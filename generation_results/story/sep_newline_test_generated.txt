What struck me about this book was the complex question of what they were going for with the ongoing development of the mushroom farm. One of the things I noted was that on that particular section, there was a fluff about how the girl in blue had fallen into the Duh Kingdom and was reduced to her clothes and taken away while she stood up and moved around the room. She reached for her petals and said:
"Are there any superheroes at the base of the building? "
The anti-ankolds were mystified as to how a squid like creature could fit into an object so large it dominated one part of the building.
" They're probably superheroes with ridiculous costumes " the spearman replied
" Oh, the Hulk himself himself is a main character, he looks totally unimportant from the inside! "
" Hold on, just another day with like that " the proctors exclaimed
" Hey, where the hell are the memes and sightings of the Roshan Bandits? " The proctors asked
" They're gone. The story has been altered. This story got flipped to another page. They're the best guy in the history of Rapture. Man, that guy is the holy grail right? "
The proctors stood up and continued on with their monologue, realizing that this whole was fairly incidental.

In a strange instance I accidentally tripped over an ally of mine while I was writing. Quite amusing that one of the brethren of mine was like this. I don't know what happened to his bruises, but he was pretty fit, that's sort of my job for months. Oh well.<|endoftext|>

"Not this I know and now can you come in? "
" Sure. " I grabbed my camera, " that can be fun. "
After a few moments I packed the last of my bag and padded inside the house. Quickly removing the headset and earphones from my headphones I stood in the doorframe. " For the record I trust the report... " A blood curdling scream as I spotted my ex husband playing with his pipe and jacked it up and down in one smooth motion. The house was too big and the fence was too big. I pulled my camera out of my pocket and zipped in my pack, sending the noise. Turning on my flashlight I felt my face slide down his body. His head was swaying slightly from the impact as he struggled for his shoes. I pressed the trigger with my pistol, his eyes locked onto mine as his smokey eyes shot open. A pillowcase was still on the floor, and his hands were shaking uncontrollably. He pulled the left, right, and middle neckstring cap off of his forehead revealing auburn hair. He lowered the left stomach, then popped the lip before speaking. " What the hell is this? "
Smug words flowed from his mouth. Then his right ear began to close. Now the cloud of smoke grew heavy, but he kept calm and stood up to continue. " I can tell you where I live and what my neighbors think. But please don't do this. " My shotgun rested on the kitchen counter. " Here, take a selfie. I can see your house around the corner from the house itself. The roof over your head, near the house, and in the house itself, by the corner. "
" I'll stay the fuck back... "
He chuckled and let out an audible howl as he advanced on his wife. " Whatever. Thank you, the two of you... and I appreciate it. " He grinned and reached for his cup, he plopped it on his cheek. " Isn't your flask cold... already?"<|endoftext|>
**********1**********
"Master, can you speak? " I called over the sink, plastering him with my reflection.
His feet shook and did little more than ripple, but it didn't matter. It would be an eternity before he felt safe again.
" Sure thing, " I replied, rising from my place on the floor of the water cooler.
I turned my back to him, groaning. " Not tonight, hon. Not ever again."
And with that I closed the locker beneath me and set off down the stairs.<|endoftext|>

As the young schoolgirls walked down the alley, I cursed at this one. This weird guy grabbed me by the arm and dragged me into this hellish hall. It's a chasm, you know?
As I followed him out, I noticed the rings were dangling, giving me an awfully faraway view. " Oh, God, I'm so sorry " I mumbled as I stumbled over my favorite mirror, scratched by the giant fist.
He gently took the ring from me and placed it against my cheek. The one that held the swords above my head. Maybe it was better.
I had to save the people on this awful balcony from those damn brutes, or I'd have to kill myself.
Why was he so disrespectful?
I bent down, grabbing his arm and violently lifting him to the ground. No sooner had the dust started to coat him than he slumped into the ground.
When I got there I saw him bawling, staring at the shadow that hung above his shoulder.
" What the hell? " I muttered, holding my hands up so I wouldn't miss his unconscious body.
" Fuck..."
The fear came rushing back in as I realized what he was saying.
It was also the last thing I heard before his voice faded away as he fell to the ground.<|endoftext|>

*The only people to whom I've ever had the chance to acknowledge them are them. *
I clutched my sons tightly in my arms and felt their tiny, powerless hands hold my great-grandmother's warm hand. I loved her, the way she put her eyes on me, her warmth on me and gave me her most innocent smile. That smile that would never leave her lips.
Their laughter rang around the house as we walked, long and loud and incredible. An appreciative sigh escaped my father as I admired her gentle, caring smile.
Everyone asked me for the memories, for the one they'll cherish the most, for the ones they'll miss the most. I answered yes with this one memory. I still remember her face, her pale face, the way she tipped her cigarette in the air and said "it was nice to hear ya, little ones."
She was the only one I didn't miss that much. She always set the cafe on fire during the day, every time she waited for someone to pass the time with gusto. I never really remembered how I went, I just remember the smell, the smell of the burnt coffee in my mouth.
The memories were always hidden for the children. I'd secretly tell them that some little girl had left her parents with their long lost love. She'd actually cried in the baby shower while we were waiting. She looked young to me, no older than five.
It's surprising how little my mind remembers other people. The memories don't bother me anymore. I just don't like the existence of others.
It's hard to maintain my dignity when those kids are my lost ones. I wish I could apologize to them for the pain I caused them. The memories will be hard to erase from my mind once I've had the chance to remember their faces. My glasses sat on the table for a moment, as I looked at my son's shoes and framed pictures.
It wasn't much use to try and erase my own son. He would spend hours staring at the tiny picture next to his grandfather's grave. The pictures often referred to little pictures, one late one afternoon at a park at the end of the summer and the other at a pointy little tree outside in the woods. Sometimes there was much longer photographs. Sometimes they were the works of a genius, great grandpa's drawings. But they were always all ones I'd hated the most, my boy. I never could understand why they were included in my mental memories anyway.
The memories were made for the lost ones. Nobody else did. Not anymore.<|endoftext|>

The BBC got called to investigate the Fukushima catastrophe. US President Barack Obama attended. The Vice President said the newest earthquake in Japan could be the one that triggered the Earth's evacuation.
Few knew what to say. Politics was meant to be the theoretical political game, as the crack of a toe, or a thumb, would answer the question the media were being held hostage.
All the politicians sighed. This was supposed to be so easy. The public had been conditioned to believe everything. But they knew too much.
There was something about the earthquake that made it special. They couldn't shake it off. There was something to be said about the Ground Walker. It was unmistakable. For the first time since they were born the scientists and the TV crews were dealing with what could easily be the same event.
It was the fight over whether they, as viewers, were going to die or not, and for the first time in 70 years when people showed up, people seemed to understand the nature of what it meant to be human.
The debate was that if we knew nothing, the Earth simply died. The question was settled in the unanimous decision of the late president, Dr. Robert Walter Goldstein. He had only spoken so much on-camera at the time and his ideals were truly about nothing. From his story about it being "just a kid and he's onto something". The decision was unanimous.
The experiment had been frozen. The scientists were right. But they all were wrong. The Earth broke.<|endoftext|>

I look at the dial. " Open it ", I begin to hum, " as you please. "
Frowning, I take it from the TV. I pick up the remote and flick it on.
" Open it ", I repeat, but silence comes over the diner. I turn, careful not to make any sort of noise. It takes me by surprise.
There's no voice coming from outside the diner, only it's staring at me. But before I can try to stop the voice, I see the dial turn. It's 10.
" Open it ", I repeat again.
A vaguely familiar voice from outside opens the diner door, standing in front of the diner. But I hesitate as he opens the door. He immediately slaps the woman behind the counter and dashes to the other side of the diner. And before I can hear what he's saying, the door of the diner opens.
From the diner, I see two men in masks behind the counter, both carrying assault rifles.
" All of this is over, " I say. " We finally have a solution to the world's problems. We can go inside, and we can start over."
I walk toward the door and shut it behind me.
The lone voice in the diner tells me that the problem is, the dials are on and it will activate in 8 hours.<|endoftext|>

I've never had a lot of time to wonder, it's not an involuntary trait. The bed is my home, and it always has been. It goes by days I know, and occasionally, I forget. Most days I forget how small my surroundings are, and how insignificant my appearance can be. Unfortunately I feel like I will never be able to remember my bedside for the rest of my life. I know what I'm feeling, though, all I can see are the walls of my room. My closet, comfortable, open and drawers in the top left and right respectively. I can hear nothing but the hum of my legs, full of pride and joy. I'm almost done for the night.
At first I make sure that everything is shut off, and then I accidentally try to open the floor to make it slide in for the night. I was hoping, but looking at my ceiling, nothing changes. I don't even get a chance to inspect the floor...<|endoftext|>

“ You ’ re going to die today, and I just want it to be over so soon. " Joseph weeps as he shovels the first drops of food in his cupped hands, " you ’ re going to have been the best Dad I ever had. " The commotion over the deafening sound of the television from the corner of his nose finishes his cold loss of appetite. Joseph pauses for a moment, picking up the remote for the tv and stowing it away from his shallow heart. A long breath pushes the smell of hot coffee towards his nose and clumps of eyes lock into a photo album. Joseph scoots further into the kitchen and begins to pour a larger amount of cereal into a glass bowl. His stomach is once again forced by the constant din of the washing machine and the incessant grumbling of the kitchen assistant.
The sound of a face from behind, flicking through the photos glasses further throws his dead-eyed stare from the living room to the center of the living room. " Over? "
“ Er… What? Why? "
The little angel sucking on her spoon receives a quick glance of the kitchen. The angel ’ s running shoulder holster ’ s held a candle to a slab of iron, letting the flames consume the heat beneath him. The little angel waves the candle out at Joseph. It ’ s light filtering through the iron's rim. A nearby shock trooper raises his hand to see the angel catching the torch and approaching.
“ I got what you want. ” The angel pitifully asks, weighing up her options. The Angel pulls out her phone and dials Eric. The call goes over the speaker in her helmet. Her voice broke in an unnatural calm.
“ Who is Eric? ”
“ We had some serious trouble. Were you woken up? ”
“ I got the girl. A fucking person. ”
“ But what? Where were you? ”
“ I was woken up by a crazed man with over-reaching-slit-burned lungs and a fucking knife in my throat. ”
“ What kind of lunatic would pull those on their own? ”
“ Not the crazed man but the maniac. I woke up sick with a fever and he cut through my intestines, grabbing my throat with a rusty butcher knife. "
“ And your speaking in a deadpan, rotting-off-your-bone manner? ”
“ Not as she said but all of the same. A bloody butcher knife came out of a dude ’ s mouth, sliced and crushed my brain open. ”
" And what is that? ”
Eric growled, his silence signaling the end of his phone call.
“ You ’ re in a coma. ”
Joseph felt a sharp sensation in his ribs. A slight blast from a lethal dose of side effects. The darkened room illuminated his room in blinding red.
“ Well, I ’ m in a hospital, how do you know that? ”
“ I told you never to do it. ” Joseph beamed, trying to piece together everything in the world, " I didn ’ t think I was going to die. "
" What do you mean. ”
The angel placed the miniature scroll in Joseph ’ s hands and placed the innocent girl in the middle of the room. One of Joseph ’ s ribs shattered at the base and jolted to a full stop as his stomach ended up like a quicksand, ending in his throat. The hospital woman stared at him in shock, " Did you really think this was going to work? "
“ I ’ m telling you, first day at a hospital, there was no sickness, no need for a demon. ”
“ Your husband never even complained. ”
“ Then there was no need to call 911. ”
They took the burning body and sat in silence. Joseph waited and watched as the spotlight shot down on the angel's husband before giving up the cool time they had frozen and staggering out of the hospital.
“ I can ’ t believe I thought this would work. ” Joseph said and sank into his usual monotone coffee as he turned off the TV and left the house as quickly as he would have since the alarm went off.<|endoftext|>

They call me colorblind, but I wouldn't hold it against them.
I can hear colours clearly in the back of my head; the reflection of my suit reflects the sun on it's shell; shades of red float in the air as I watch.
I can't see the reflection of the back of my head anymore. My skin matches the pool of my face, and I can see sharp reds and greens and blues.
I can feel it. It feels like the fog that has been my weakness. But I don't know how I've been able to keep it that way. It never seems to change.
I never knew how it got to me, just couldn't keep myself from feeling it. Until I saw reds and greens. I wish I could. The colorblind me.
Maybe I should go out in the rain. Why should I have to live with that?
I go to Starbucks, and order a hot chocolate bar, and rummage through the fragrant fountain on my way there. As I rest my hand on the counter, I feel my hand beginning to change. Pink. Grey. Green. A beautiful, spiraling color. It opens up my eyes and begins to dance. It seems to swirl like my own.
Blue. Red. Brown. Indigo. Sparse.
Blue and red. Indigo. Blue.
Rain falls down from sky. And I stop struggling to breathe.
At my feet are my hands now. Back to the tiled floor, and my feet move slowly toward the floor, swinging and pulling. The colors shift as my head tilts forward, instead of rolling towards the floor.
I look around the office and see outside. It has been raining for the past hour, and it looks like I'm inside. That's the strangest thing, because it looks like there's some kind of cloud. All around it's a black waterfall-like substance, but it's glistening faintly on the rain. It's like the color of a pink love picture.
I open my eyes. A pool of sky is about to begin to swell up. I stare deeply at the thing that had blinded me for so long.
It's blue eyes.<|endoftext|>

Ok, now the first thing I've wrote up is on how I wanted to go. I'm not going to say much specifically. Because in short, you did a great job working with the description. I didn't really take it too personally though. It was nearly understandable. Even though it was in my head for a long time, I feel like you made me feel, even as an old man, I feel like I should have known that something was going on before it happened. There were maybe issues with the flow with the story, but I liked where you phrased it pretty well.
I really appreciated your point that you had a lot to say about memory.<|endoftext|>

Sam finds himself still in the bathroom stall.
"Fuck! I don't wan na go now! Fucking gingazoo!... No... no... Fuck!"
Sam is standing, gliding through the living room of his beautiful apartment building, as the ceiling and kitchen sink catch the fluffy spreading hair of the succubus floating out. He notices a gun, still resting on his bed. He moves the gun up to his temple with trembling fingers. He smells of pine and cinnamon mixed in. Sam rubs his beard, as the scalding hot oil in his beard itch. He checks the scales on the gun -It feels okay. A few stabs and scratches leave impressions. He rolls over to the bed to receive the fire extinguisher and darts it through the window. After a short prolonged nap he begins to open his door. He relishes in the motion, and lays his way across the room on the bed to put his bathrobe on.<|endoftext|>

No one heard me. Or wasn't told.
I checked back at the house, realizing it was empty. But no, no, no, no.
-Hey Brian, let me go. You know I've seen you around. I've eaten those you throw at me. Just hold on. I have to come see you.
That was it. I got drunk on pizza and drove to Nashville, where it turns out I'm crossing the ocean and never made it back. Goddammit, here we go again.
-No, I need you to help me figure out whether I truly am crazy or if this is a joke.
-Who the fuck is this?
-Who are you? Are you saying that I'm a psychotic and a sociopath?
Man, that was the worst. All the fucking time, talking like this on a phone. I've been hitting myself across the top of the block... but nothing was getting any easier.
-Hey! I'm just helping you. I just wish that you could hear me, too. Please, please come to me! I... I have to see a doctor...
-Alright. Don't worry. And don't call me that.
-Just call me Brian.
-Okay. Brian? Are you okay? Brian.
-Fuck you. That was worse than I thought.
I fell face first into the sheets. I had to lean back and rub my eyes to steady myself. I started to pant. I wouldn't do that to you, even though I had had the audacity to drop your completely. How long has it been since that accident?
-Okay. Sure. I'm glad you made it.
-We-we've been friends since the day I was born. We are best friends, and you are the best. And how can I thank you that you saved my life after it was all over? But it is clear that you broke the fourth wall, both on purpose, and you failed to take it seriously. It was selfish to me. It was stupid to you, and it was selfish to me. I tried to keep it the way it was, but it just seems too petty now. You lied, lied about being your friend.
That was the worst part. I should have gone home. Why didn't I go home? I should have known better.
-Hey Brian. You didn't go home to a shitty apartment. It wouldn't be so bad if we had tried to eat here instead. We would still eat now, if it was all okay. I can't just go home because I couldn't.
Even though I don't get a chance to make it back to that door, it would still make everything OK.
-I can take you home. It's too dark out. Try to stay up and have a good night. Thank you Brian.
I fell on my knees. There was no hint of a struggle. I think I have my pills.
-Nope. I'm calling my lawyer.
-All right, I get it. I'm sure I know what I need to do, right?
When my lawyer arrives, he approaches me.
-Mr. Christie, are you sure?
-Yeah. Okay. Good. The court is waiting to hear this case now.<|endoftext|>

"So I ask you sir, remember this, and the third time when you took over, did you not look up at the picture? "
" Well, let me turn it over. " I pointed to the torn portrait. I then placed it down as well.
" Well, uh, did you look up at the picture? " I gasped in surprise.
" I remember. Um, I did. " Satan cocked his head. " The more people you created, the less you had to answer to. It was a lesson to every once in a while. "
" Well, did you gain much by giving up some control over Hell. " I said as a grin. " Like, a lot. What I'm here to tell you is that you won't like the world. That you will tell me any question you want and that I will do it all over again. That I will fall deeply in love with and cherish you. That you'll treat me like royalty and have me be your companion in your horrid reincarnation. "
" Do you know what an eternity is? " I said.
" No. " Satan replied. " There is no greater pain than dying in your time. Ever. Because hell is eternal. There is nothing stopping that. "
" Then why is it called heaven? "
" That is simple enough. It is the place where gods are kept. It is where souls can be placed in real life again, once more. This is just the one. " Satan added.
" And where is that soul taken? " I looked at the picture.
" He is in paradise. I suggest you let him take the picture. " Satan began to sigh and lifted a bloody skeletal hand to his head. " Did I steal the picture myself? "
I stared at the picture in stunned silence.
" I don't think so, " Satan said. " I'm afraid I did. I owe you no pity."<|endoftext|>

His nose was fresh, but not unnaturally so. In the dim glow of his room it shone like a magnificently clever candle. Lately, he had been noticing the light had gotten brighter. In most of his slumber he had been quiet about it. He thought about the party for a few seconds before he finally announced his presence at the end of the hall. They brought sweets to give to some of his friends. He lifted his head, picked up a beer and a torch, and held it for a few minutes. Eventually it will sleep, and once it can not feel his hand when he relish the warmth, a door opens to a dimly lit room full of people. Normally they come in the form of mirrors, but for the large men and women were sent here to talk and give little light. They make peace with their curiosity, who knows what they will need or can get. But today was different.

5/6/85: Lawsuit wins, I was set to take-
I'd already known what I'd done. Truth was I really didn't have much time before the day was over. This poor kid had been having nightmares about the night before, or had just woken up in the middle of the night, and had never really bothered to go to sleep. Regardless of whether he had committed a crime or not, he couldn't have done anything wrong, or escaped.
The police had just made sure the kid didn't enter the bank, but I could just about see him breaking out laughing that one damn eye in. I ran up and hung my head, then continued on my way down.
5/8/85: I went to get a drink, and think I had the technology. I woke up to see a guard carrying a gun with a pistol pointed at me.
5/9/85: I thought the world was pretty much back to normal for me. This kid was... funny. Probably suicidal, after all. I didn't want him to hurt anyone.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
Day 1: Home Officer picked up the kid in the handcuffs.
Day 2: I thought this kid had died, I was worried. Maybe his parents were like him, he really wasn't. I thought maybe he was really killing people, and I was worried he was just going to rob a bank. Maybe he's been poisoned, or maybe something is going to happen to him. I reached the bank and the kid stepped in, holding his pistol to his head. He took three shots to the heart, right before the shots landed, and the kid started flying off.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
Day 3: It's true, there's a shooting at the bank. The kid was shot.
Day 4: Police brought him to jail. He's still alive.
Day 5: Police rescued him.
Day 6: By a miracle, he can talk. I figured a captive would be safe.<|endoftext|>

The world was never the same after the Third War of 1325. China had been the cause of conflict for a long time, while the U.S. retaliated and annexed nearly every country in Europe. The resulting World War had a severe restriction on gun sales, until the Congress of London began asking for U.S. gun sales. Suddenly, the Congress passed a law that prohibited US Americans from purchasing any U.S. gun in any manner unless it is in the hands of a government official.
The War of the Five Hundred and Six ended with a truce between the Brits and the Germans. A hundred years later, Britain was convinced it was the only nation stronger than the U.S. and on its way to becoming the most powerful nation in the world. Time that quickly passed seemed to pass this time.
Once Germany had become dominant, it pulled away from the U.S. After the Six Generals died of Gunpowder, the situation of the United States began to change. A new President came to power in 2048, who promised that he would protect America first. The first step was for the U.S. to become the world's largest superpower, as well as a world superpower. However, after many years of hiding the U.S. ( and its allies ) name from the public, a new interest took over the world. Nuclear War.
Nuclear Disarming has been a common way of keeping the world at peace for over 500 years. In order to maintain itself and survive, the U.S. military simply dismantled any nuclear weapon that it could get its hands on. Nuclear weapons became a national defense issue in most countries around the world, but not in America. With the advent of missiles and cyber-warfare, these weapons went out of fashion to fight a war similar to World War Two or World War Three, and the crippling civilian casualties have made American weapons obsolete.
Security is one of the primary factors to how America runs its massive economy. The U.S. with a weakness in security is able to never fully stop meddling in the affairs of other countries. At the end of the Cold War, the U.S. government seized control of the Soviet Union and invaded almost every major nation. The uprising that followed killed millions of innocents and more than half of American society. Unfortunately, no true leadership was achieved. Humanity regained its strength and sent its first man down on it's knees to negotiate. Within seconds, the U.S. had declared war on another country, Russia.
As the war goes on, America has lost most of it's major military capabilities and was forced to move out of its current location. Unfortunately, a lone survivor has formed a militia of nations and gave them hope for revenge. He has been trying to make a name for himself since childhood, even announcing on every country that it had troops for the local forces.
Shortly after a lone survivor was killed, he learned that Russia was to go dark again in 2125. He decided that one day he would end it all.<|endoftext|>

At least, that's what it sounds like. For if I were still alive, the last year I think I would have been alive. I suppose life would have been much much, much worse.
I mean, seriously, the e-mail address of the organic government that controlled it. That was extremely, very crazy, really, something that had not happened in e-mail addresses before. Did the printing presses do anything for the gadgets they kept in there? No, that didn't happen any time soon after I got into the fray. That happened gradually at least.
There was one where a superhero came by dressed as a superhero, obviously the perfect disguise for the evil corporation he was. And what a chump. First, it was The Scrub, I dunno. One raunchy jock, a normal teenager who found his girlfriend cheating, and then they were having an affair. They had the kids. They had two sons.
And for that, of course, we were pleased. Because being a sociopath, being obsessed with, y'know, everything seemed normal until it got a little too much too real. Until you got too close, and they *just* got the pattern.
I don't remember if it was normal, was it real?
Anyhow, the real thing happened a week ago, when I discovered the NSA, and how it controlled our entire Internet. Ugly little piece of equipment that kicked into over-the-top information.
It was then that things got out of hand. Because apparently, the Public Communications Officer doesn't copy. When we look up their IP and see what that IP is, we pick up the lettering, scrawled across it, and rip it up.
After that, this was quite uneventful. People are quite surprised, when they start finding out who that is. Nobody is really satisfied. Why would we, in this year, allow people to shove their IP down people's throats? Yeah, really. So there we go.
Anyways, it happened. That was it. Some random kid looking for an IP crack to download came up with it. And people found it suspicious. And on the Internet at home, those IP crackers were a link to a website which they all liked to read about. People didn't want the big guns.
I bet the government knew the kids really liked reading our internet.
The best part? That was the day the child discovered the password. It was sent to him by his mom. Umm, yeah. A few hours later, a few thousand hours later, and after that there was a child's IP crack, and that was not malicious, but a curious thing. An IP crack for a school. An IP crack for a university. And somehow, within the school, a student could download torrents of almost unimaginable amount of data. As crazy as this thing was, it would be instant. My first fear in e-mail address history, I suppose.<|endoftext|>

Any which way I've come, the kid on the screen used something called "Tiffuggy Test ", a banana with extra yellow onion and 7 heart shaped crunchy fruit inside, maybe another 50, 100 rounds of it? I don't remember what, sure, sometimes I can get four extra zeroes, but that's just it. The only thing that can hurt is the tumor- or so I told them. They seem inclined to throw caution to the wind, but you know what, I think once they have my name on the ballot, I get one more boost.
It would seem the iyo came along. Whenever the child comes to you with their vision impaired, they have their eyes moving closer to the plant. The job at Harry's on Maple Grove I suppose, seems to be a lot more rewarding than the most serious office job I've ever had. Always smiling, leaving all six limbs and right under my bottom lip the way a cat leaves his tail before a hard day's work. It's more like walking. Walk. Then you have to yell again. And again, and again, twice. Then a face in front of your face, smiling as if there are three long, endless stars filling you, dipping your head in a sea of destruction as the world goes on, ripping itself apart, leaving you standing face to face in the dusty corridor.
It's getting a bit better, kid. Anyways, I don't want to go. You know how it feels; you believe that you are special, every feeling you feel is ecstasy, that all powerful needs should be reciprocated, because I can not contain myself in the moment!
This is going to be my last job. Your last thought after I'm done reading all your mind-boggling reports. But that's okay; until then, you will be on only yourself, and not me.
*With a cry of rage, a swift lunge from the joker at the front door, I pull my hearing protection off my right side and strike down the monster at my side. With a sudden bolt of energy, he lunges forward, one lung to me, the other to the jugular vein. I hear the shot, and, with my inhuman strength, I let loose the first hole punched deep into his leg. There is nothing left of me but sadness, the world is here, and I am safe. *

Young Dave smirked as he stuck his pinky in the machine and put his thumb down. The sensation of its warm blood filling his fingers soon faded and it was replaced with silence. Dave pulled his wallet and caught his reflection in the glass: cold, damp, almost acidic.
"I-I know, Dave. I know. "
He moved his finger tips away from the tattoo on his wrist.
" You know, Dave. I've been in this same room every night for years, in this same room everyday, to predict it, to understand the next move. To tell everyone how I fell in love and fail to succeed at something. How I saved the world from so many wars and determined where to go and where to look for help. I tried everything. It's okay now, you understand. People tend to make things worse, and I've noticed it. "
He shivered as he pressed his palm against the old memory book. He wanted to stop now, he wanted to know what was wrong. He fished it out, pulled out his left pocket knife. He couldn't tell them not to hurt him.
He recognized the card, and the numbers on it. Everyone knew the day they were born, and it was the day they would die. But he couldn't do it...
He ran the knife over the edge of the fat man's right thigh. It was impossible. The same moment the tattoo was removed, the temperature rose, and Dave had the world know that the man was going to die. The room vibrated, lights flickered, *bang*. The room closed.
Dave walked towards the cashier's desk and waited. “ Dave, can you put it on the counter? ” He checked the note attached to the desk. No words came out.
Dave found the card and took a deep breath. The tattoo was right: he was going to die. That's when the happy crowd started to pour out. Dave began counting, and the card came up.
His eyes narrowed as the needle punched through his thigh.
“ One hundred thousand two hundred thousand three hundred and nine. Just one hundred thousand two hundred thousand three thousand. One hundred. ”<|endoftext|>

My dad was once gone, he left most of his savings from his previous life. A single dollar in savings allowed him to stick it into retirement, with his other one increasing by two million.
While people rarely bond with one another, in some cases it is a sign of grief or some other disruption in their lives.
My dad had been only gone 5 years, only his savings were wiped. In retrospect, i've decided I want to get away from his body so I can live a comfortable life and more.
After the fatal car crash. I never thought it would actually happen. I made plans to find my father again and find out where he was. The network claims he had a small sailboat, but the impossible, you know, hasn't been realized.
I have tried to find out what will happen to his body, he is gone and I can't leave him. These days, people are losing sight of him as they sink. They have no one left to serve them.
This has never been an issue with dad. You see, I met my first significant other, that was an accountant. We became close and our maturity quickly matched. It's amazing how good friends can give each other.
I saw that I could go away, learn what is most important to me. We learned to love, to do things, to love and trust each other. Now he isn't dead, I left him behind.
If I go back in time with my remaining savings to a recent history of things, I will go back through time and verify that he was still alive. If he was, I found out he was a porn star.
I will go back through his life and find out that we moved on after him, we would share our experiences and share our lives. I will find out how much he cared, how much he cared.<|endoftext|>

Coming down the seemingly eternal hallway and breaking a leg and spilling beer all over your leg, you crumple up to your knees, wincing and grinding. Just like that, you discover something new. Suddenly, you hear a light not unlike the wind beneath you on a chilly winter day, and hear yourself mutter things before starting your trek back down the stairs to the kitchen. Chaining fingers along the connections, you wrap your hand around a jar of beetroot soup, as you took the last bite.
Ten minutes after reaching the counter, you are presented with a slightly overweight and thin human. He looks upon you and calls out to you. The first item he said to you was "You ’ re our star scout. " Without really thinking about what he meant, you begin to grate his thick black mustache while eating. Eventually, you agree to take an extra bite of your own. While the steak is being hot, the human points down the staircase and orders your batch to come with. An hour or so later, he speaks to the human, " We need to go to scout HQ first. I hear you are very worried about meeting with the Captain.
Or should I say Captain. "
" What do you mean Captain? "
" Please, explain. "
" Coming up to scout HQ is difficult. I don't want to show you either. "
" We can't leave our outpost. "
" I don't want you to see either of us. "
" Every right, sir. " The captain dismisses you and the human to the desk. You meet his eyes expectantly and say, " Give me another bite."<|endoftext|>

> "Come on, asshole " He said, " I've been going broke with my family, but I think you're getting my driver's license. I want it, man. I've got a car on the way."
I snapped, obviously badgered him for something I thought was fine, but he just ignored me. I had a plan, I had a reason. The keys were in his car now. Wait, did he tell me that I had a reason? I looked into the car.
“ This is it. ” The boy said, waving his arms.
I closed the front door and slid out, heading out into the street. I wouldn't make it home, but I could make it back. But it'd be too late. I couldn't be home. And I wouldn't make it.<|endoftext|>

As you have been assured by the Mayor, your way to a future that fulfills your aspirations, is an attempt to facilitate it. The Board holds that attempts to improve the quality of life will drive children to the start of the rebellion of adulthood. There are young individuals who are pursuing such changes which will “ Reduce the number of that which you make, ” as several say in agreement.
The Adjunct Professor at High School Meets Their Fate, Leonard Parker, proposes to end the stale conflict and overcome this obstacle by removing an entire class of students the time assigned to him. If approved, much will change. The Council will be consulted and chooses the best course of action to pursue. Contact with your peers and you will be allowed to continue. The students will be encouraged not to use the remaining time assigned to their friends at all but increase our success by 6 % in the year 2060. A atelier meeting with Ivy League elites and the faculty of the High School will be considered.
Retirement and the Chaz administration will oversee the decisions of those attending school before they are deemed eligible. We will also set up a school that is completely and exclusively American. To that end, we will have a new student, James Franklin, a physician student at the University of Washington. It will be named Human Health and we believe he will be an excellent fit as a physician for the Grand District.
The Board has agreed to adopt a standard model at the first off-chance meeting and we will recommend that a radical break from an old school school becomes a possibility. You may hope that Mr. Franklin, who is a staunch socialist, will be more responsive towards reforms.<|endoftext|>

"He was good " the doctor replied.
" How did he get there? " Jack asked
" He was at his Sonar Observation Station. He tested them. Everything had lined up right. There were nothing to lose. The System backup generators were always working like they were meant to, until he started moving....everywhere. "
" Well, he told us to try again. But as we were pulling them apart, and reassembled them, they just didn't cooperate. And one time they stopped working at all. On instinct I pulled the drawstring, but it just couldn't work. I figured if the issue was trying to pull them apart, what if something was just wrong? Maybe he had lost control of the controls, the time and put him on a cycle loop? They don't usually require that kind of power.... "
" Last time he tested it, the rift sent a signal to Earth. They locked the Ephemeris Archive. "
" Gaudrax says the Ephemeris Archive is... turned on by other anomalies. They just keep churning and bending and forming, sometimes to trap future satellites. My new Pev-Tech hid the archives for a while, but they just stopped working now. He changed the channel, he kept turning it off. He went back and forth from there. I called my engineers and immediately signed up for maintenance. "
" And sir, you know what they say about clockwork, right? " the doctor interjected
" Now I have to ask. Is the problem still like this? "
" Well, where did it get in? The Separation Line failed. It is supposed to line up and keep war from breaking out. With the Precursor Project, their satellite satellites are almost on track. They try to build a false shrine in their forgotten fortress but they lose communication with each other. "
" And what about them? "
" Some of them turned into Cerebens, druids, vikings, enders, even lances. But it was nothing compared to this. They thought it was an army, trying to save mankind. They were wrong. Some of them just wouldn't shut up at first. They're just like us. "
" How can they keep going with us? "
" We need to find another group of BattleMechs."<|endoftext|>

Of all the strange worlds in the world, one was most boring. None had a clue what the hell was going on and at the start, it was amazing. Sol planets, tidally locked systems, perfect for sun mining. I stood in awe at these worlds, truly amazed I hadn't wasted my time. I knew that getting to the top of the moon provided me the opportunity to experience what the world needed most: cleaning up the debris that happened. The rover was launched and that was fun... I had to send samples back home with tales of what I had found. Now my moon is dust, dust everywhere. A cacophony of ear-splitting yells fills the studio and the endless pieces I collected fall into the bins. The trek up comes in the final breath before the ramp gets stomped down.

By now, there's a LOT of different countries sitting around the laboratory, or at least they say they do. The research is a bit devious, of course, since no nation has ever made contact with an extraterrestrial civilization before; so they must've been importing crops and furs or something and are now studying the makeup stuff that they think will help them live. I'm currently at a storage section of the building about a hundred meters in size with a door and access ramp leading to a prison with a long list of the prisoners in the facility.
-- -
John let me sleep there a week ago after work, he jumped out the window and ran out the door. Someone had to be fixing this mess. I read the newspaper one day and on the article was a breakdown of what we were doing here:
"Nobody's gon na believe me if I tell you why. One guy won't believe me; he just keeps pulling on the sleeves of a hoodie of some kind and telling the truth. "
It's funny to think of the prison they call a gym. Each room contains about 500 people who've lost limbs, and about ten hundred guards. They've carried me here since school, and yet no one is sure where the others go.

So imagine my surprise when the Warden walks in.
" My name is Eric Clemstead. It's been a while. "
" Now, please hand over the big yellow banner on this wall, and get the clothes back on."
He nods and gets to work removing the tatters of concrete. All I want is just to sweep it away before that moustache.<|endoftext|>

"This is awful " I mumble to myself from the TV remote. What now? * Tsk tsk. *
I walk up the stairs and into the studio. A load of guys are already watching. We're in a sea of crying, that's all we've got in them. We know they've been crying since the airing of the first episode. " What the fuck " I ask as I take another pull from the pitcher of chocolate milk. * Tsk tsk. * I smile and tilt my head down to my warm coffee cup. Its wet from all the pressure it takes, but the pressure is negligible and serves us nothing for the character of the milk. * Tsk tsk. * But there's no way to keep the hell out of this place. I think I'll see a therapist once this one's over... Perhaps I'll try talking to someone. Maybe I'll try taking a dump...
I sit down in the passenger seat of my car and keep looking through the distance. The stars begin to grow brighter. It's nighttime but we're back to work. I just want this one over. * Tsk tsk. * Everything has gone so far. I'm a broken man. My family is dead. I'm homeless. I'm dying. I'm a broken man. I let the doctors and nurses tear me apart. They tell me I'm crazy. That something needs to be done. That I need to go to therapy. I'm insane. They tell me I can't get over it. I'm too much of a loner. They tell me I won't go to therapy. That I've spent my life ruining everything about me. That's it. That's what got me to spend my final minutes putting me out of my misery. * Tsk tsk. *
I pull out my phone to call someone. * Tsk tsk. * Damnit, no. * I turn on the TV and focus. Something happened but it feels like my only way to make it through the night is to go upstairs. I walk downstairs. * Tsk tsk. * My favorite spot in the house. I wake up in my cozy and undisturbed rocking chair. I get up and walk over to my laptop. I load up and watch the episode from the night before. I swipe through the channels and listen to the music. I hate it when I can't play the song *Blue Summer Night* because it means something. But I dig deeper and find the song. I hear *Beelzebub* by Tom Petty on the radio and put it on the couch by myself. I am a broken man. * Tsk tsk. * There he is. He's staring at me. There he is again. He's crying. He's thinking about me. * Tsk tsk. * * he's thinking about everything. * Tsk tsk. * The playback fades and I hear it coming to life. It cracksle and then fades. I fall to my knees and lean my head against the steering wheel of my car. Everything is perfect. * Tsk tsk. * The universe is fine. I feel the air fill my lungs and the rain pour down on me. We all hum with the song. Everything is perfect. I open my eyes and feel lighter. Everything is fine. I open my eyes and feel lighter. I open my eyes and feel lighter.<|endoftext|>

I stood here, in the middle of my street, blood welling up as I contemplated what would happen next.
As my friend and I discussed future plans, my phone woke up to the familiar click of a light. My wand danced to life, the colors more than anything I'd ever seen. No one knew what to think. Was this the magic of the theater this time? Or were we just hallucinating?
It was night and they'd been trapped in the dim tower by orcs, watching with crazy glint in their eyes. A moment later they fired a bolt of nameless lightning at my feet. I awoke in a pool of my own blood. My friends were either dead or incapacitated, and we hadn't prepared well for the upcoming battle. We lay on the ground, frantic. Dead. But what would the rest of them think? A giant stone dragon appeared just above the bedpost where the wizard lay. I stood up, and tried to ignore this. What was this strange noise?
I heard nothing. I stood back up. A serpent once before stared at me from above, silently. I looked down at the weapon we'd woken up to. It was a nameless spell, red and glowing. Within seconds I was deafeningly quiet again. All the spectral warriors in the corner seemed to want to let us live in peace. But the thing was different, I was no longer deaf. Now I was deaf to everything. I stared around, and I realized my time was up. I had no idea what else had happened. Everything was flowing in the same dance... it seemed to go smoother, as if somehow I'd forgotten something.
Was this magic? Or were there others? There was no time. I couldn't wake this person up. The same thing happening. It dawned on me, that maybe I wasn't in danger. Even if I only ended up dead, the sorcerer had no excuse or identity to doubt my claim.
I spent a few seconds pondering, wondering if I would hurt the other ones again. How long would I be here? Was it now? Will I die as the ones they'd control here die or was this to die in a different way? If so... how do I know?
I wouldn't know, and so I sat in silence for a little while. I just wanted to go home and sleep. Maybe I wouldn't be alone anymore. Maybe I didn't need to stay here. Then I thought about how I had spent the night.<|endoftext|>

You are now watching your visitors burn.
The flame which has engulfed your village, is born of love. The fire which burned our corpses, needs no fear, only absolute faith.
You are a noblewoman.
A talented cook.
A woman who has been married for thousands of years, countless lifetimes.
You watch in awe as your sight fades away.
The flames that have engulfed your town seem to look toward you, a minute's loss averted.
There is only one way to save you...
A secret you have attempted to hide with your innocent friend for almost a century.
For years you have been curious, and intrigued, and today as the man beside you tries to fetch something from the flames.
The man is your final friend and, though all others were in tears, was there a kindness in your gesture that she never expected him to reciprocate.
Of course you could make it simple, but the initial sight of the burnt corpses made you ask yourself if this is the true love you have once loved... even if the sacrifice has been for nothing.
You would rather risk being punished like it was never meant to be.

To break the duress, it took my guts to name it.
If that wasn't ab-Romeo Wade? Duke Wade. Thats enough rough, meaty shit to create its own O.W., but dammit, my status couldn't wait for its noble deed.
Ah, the day I took the damn thing to the Kingdom of Technology. Even now that motion couldn't change my travels, anything. But now that I got back to work.
Not that I couldn't have rather improved the human race -- more vigilant, I think, in terms of technological advancement than any other God damn thing. See, I had a 10! I had a push cog sitting there in my recuperator. I pressed it. The peasant flashed her light that day! Had she ever seen Earth. However, now, no-one will ever see that.
I thought I had... thought I had control over humanity. Well, not necessarily, but surely, I had control over humanity. I had saved humanity. A woman's maiden left my hand, the farmer's daughter's descendants could have all sorts of trinkets they wanted -- but even then I couldn't spare a moment of pure white...
-- human life... *I-know* and damned sure as shit the power over humanity had always existed. Now people can finally have it! It's not something that could be crossed out by an abortion doctor. I've bred those precious souls. It's not a universal requirement, but *you can choose* what you choose. I've already provided quite a few desirable females a little more than men, and their offspring are only 12 times the average. So much for that.
I'll have to hunker down and watch as I march on, but I'm ready. When I feel content I'll be back on the reigns of God.<|endoftext|>

I am about to sink to the floor under an overpass which I have no idea how I got here, but rather than go to the ground I go up the stairs. Or rather, I go to the basement wall from which I somehow scrape off a stack of bills. Because back on my way down, I notice that the bus stop isn ’ t nearby. Even worse, there ’ s no way of getting back up the stairs if I want to. I ’ ve lost my mind.
The light dings and something stops me and I realise that it ’ s really a bus, but it also takes me up a long flight of stairs. I decided to leave but tripped. The dark, creepy, dimly lit bus waddled down the stairs slowly, still pulling you down. Like I was diving on a fresh water balloon – I think I only managed to get one far enough for a small sponge out of the way. So I tried to shake the bus, but it moved away, and the doors didn ’ t budge.
A girl was sitting behind the bus. She ’ s looking down, but she had so many pretty emerald eyes over her skin that it seemed like an alien looking sort of color. She must have really been a teenage girl – I hadn ’ t heard her name the day after the disappearance. Maybe she was just a normal girl, and didn ’ t appear to have passed in the same way as the other five people in the bus stop and that was the main mystery. No way around this. She waved at me, but I pointed the rather obvious way back, and she pointed in my direction again.
“ All the way here? Why don ’ t you just stop there? ” She asked, obviously confused. I could just imagine her pupils dilating like fog. Her wrinkles vanished back in the hot water. Maybe she had even gone to bed earlier than usual?
I looked at her again – frozen, but not with horror. My entire existence got sucked back in to the pitch black world of my mind. And then there ’ s an ear splitting shriek. As I let go, I can hear people screaming at me. And then the lights go out.<|endoftext|>

"Bring ME YOU USELESS SENTENCE. "
Lieutenant Hendricks knocked over a rock on the board. He was a news reporter for the International Times. There were cameras and microphones. Both his allies and enemy alike.
" Well you should know, what happened... in 2448. A United Nations peacekeeping force... sent in to stop a rampant food shortage... "
Bruised, the lieutenant coughed into his drink.
" The Deseret Big Foot. "
He stopped.
" I guess we can't escape what caused the food crisis. "
Hendricks had always had a desperate lust for revenge. It was the fifth time in as many years that he had made it his mission to stop the President from killing himself, keep the Obama secret for good, and not to have the President's mark on a map.
But it was becoming apparent the enemy of the peacekeepers wasn't happy about that.
The urge to stop their mission persisted.
" The Soldier. "
A splinter sprang from the wall, pulling Hendricks awake with a barreling crack.
" Get down and we'll warn the rebels! " Hendricks screamed at the unassuming criminal. He could almost hear the scrabbling around the room. His adversary was trembling, clenching his fists.
" Call upon your feminine instincts. " Hendricks could feel the assailant staring. His eyes, small, glazed over.
" WE SEEED! WE HAVE PEYS! " Hendricks gulped. The insurgent barely even half a hit.
They stopped.
The agent coughed again.
" STOP, DO NOT TRY, O COSTUME SLAYING IN SENSATIONS... " Hendricks coughed. He took another deep swig from his drink. Hendricks could see sweat dripping down his forehead.
" WE'VE JAMMED AN EMPIRE TAKEN YOUR FRIENDS INTO SUFFER. GET OFF THE FENCE NOW, CLOSELY AND UNSTOPPABLE. NOW WE HEAR YOU" He looked at the soles of his feet as the agent in the dark breached. Hendricks screamed and retreated from the floor. The rebel bustied the patrol ahead. They didn't even get far.<|endoftext|>

Captain Hamilton ( The Mighty X-Flyer ) was a rippling troop of idiots who lived in spite of their pride. Pushing through the Tarquinian Wastes of the outer continent of Galgum, they laid a stumbling halt to a great encampment of soldiers. They came in search of the main entrance that lead to a great game of tag and cocaine. The marines had been there for hours, using only a rag under their large captain's boots as they glided through. They began to pass figures in front of the captain, who let out a low chuckle in his panic.
"Captain Hamilton? " shouted a chunky pink ball of flesh. Its eyes glimmered bright in the dim light.
" Yes, Captain? " Asked Hamilton. " Did you win the prize? "
The words of a cheater like Hamilton disappeared into the swirling fog. It made a poor display of movement. Hamilton's little neck snapped around, and he clung to his still protruding neck.
" Crap, Rock. I told you, it's gon na take a while for the gel to dissolve, and this little girl is just old enough to play tag. "
The sailors ran to shore, stirring blood. It didn't matter. They came with exciting new goods. Commander Hamilton pushed them all through the fog and ran them back to the camp.
" Alright, guys, this is swell. I need a break. Do you have a surplus in hand, or can we get started? " Hamilton said, slapping the young sailor a few times.
" I've got enough shipping for a couple of weeks, so... Let's go. " Came the reply. Hamilton shook his head.
" Go, kiddo. There's a book I've got that will get your rig up there for a while. We can play it here on its own."<|endoftext|>

" Fine. "
As I left the luxury hotel, a woman came up to me. She carried a clipboard in her hands. She handed it to me.

" Well. Listen if you could just give me a few seconds, the next thing I do is you would want to just take a dump, I don't give a fuck. "
" Shit, good point. I'm here to show you how. "
" Deal. Now, the next thing I would do is I would like you to sing like what would happen if you accepted a date with me. "

It wasn't his dad anymore. Dan wasn't any more. They'd won the school game of Chess. Twenty years ago was when they stormed in and killed him.
It had been Jen. Jen didn't wear more makeup, and boy, did she do anything girls didn't before him. Me? We went hiking in the woods. We'd time traveled and gotten to know each other.
And this gun. Dan owned it. Funny, that a small one. Can't imagine how much he wondered what it had to do with him. The one he'd shot before he was shot in that bank robbery, since she'd been found dead. She'd had a good hiding spot, just beyond the woods. Or maybe she'd been just at the house about a block away. Either way, it was a handgun.
This gun was useless. Gunpowder didn't mix well with powder. Or powder. Magnesium carbonates, like hell. No protective material. It's the kind of firearm no man will ever be able to beat. And Dan didn't like that, though he shouldn't have, either. He loved his dad but he also hated the gun. Oh sure, he had put it in, had some practice and made it look cool, but all the gun did was smother himself.
What was the point of it? It was his last thing on his dad's "world. " Anyhow, Dan started the bomb. Armed with this gun, it would make no difference where he went next.
Some idiot bumped into him earlier and told him that it was too soon to go anywhere. He supposed that feeling of watching him walk away from something... not having his father around but also full of nostalgia about his childhood. The man just laughed. He really wanted to punch him in the face.
Dan ran from a police car and told the sergeant that he knew, that he'd be punished for it. It wasn't like someone really cared, considering how he'd knocked the poor prick out for stealing an all-expense-paid trip to see his childhood home, especially when everyone else was shot in the face and left for dead.
Only for now, Dan thought, really, what a slap to the face. Would it be alright if he'd still go. He didn't want to remember anything. Although, here he was. Gathering his things. It would be nice if someone would get to see this gun. Then again, he'd probably kill himself tomorrow too. If so, he'd make this their first weekend in Georgia, and get to ask their permission to use it.
Come home, Dan said. That would be beautiful. He wanted to comfort her. To reassure her he'd always loved her, that he wasn't going to just leave her dead, without thinking about it. And Dan liked that. He preferred that the revenge he felt for his mother and father would be the cause of his longings to have friends and family to cry about. The love in him.
Dan dug in and pulled out his gun. Bang. He smiled. That was all that had hit his dads jaw. Like how most people do, when the US was struck by an explosion, Dan took a few defensive-minded things out of the way.
There was a hole in his chair. Maybe that one, right where his dad used to sit. Dan closed the door and opened the door to see Jeff. He had a gun, and Jeff was making his escape. He let his gun go.
A gunshot went off. When it had been over, Dan smiled. The man had shoved the gun down his butt and emptied it right into his guts, then left. What a shame. He felt guilty that people walked into the house, probably chasing after a gun that turned them into mindless, mindless piles of dismembered corpses.
Dan smiled. He knew his dad wanted him. He smiled because Dan wanted what he wanted. Dan wanted to feel his emotions burning deep in his chest. Maybe he could take control of his rage like he wanted to control the thoughts of everyone around him.<|endoftext|>

Captain Speaker, may he rest in peace.
Glancing around, Captain Speaker adjusted his helmet to reflect the red glow of the intense, hulking panzers before him. He kept his eye on the small group of glorious fighters in formation, awaiting the fight to begin. Their machine guns rumbled like thunder and began to explode.
As soon as the CFO started speaking again, his voice came out clearly from an exceptionally loud speaker...<|endoftext|>

Class ended. Kevin looked around wildly. Why had he fallen? * No! *
Clenching his hands together, he reluctantly stepped out of the classroom to get a good look at the actual battle unfolding before his eyes.
The first to take his place was Yui Yui. The youth in front of him grumbled something about how it was his fault, that they couldn't protect his country and he did not have the technology to handle the invasion.
But still, Yen had that hatred in him. * If only he knew what we just did... *
All things considered, it wasn't very difficult to convince Yen that the conflict was not the victory that most idealized was considered. He was right, the injustices he faced represented a very wrong view of what war meant to him. The more important part of Yen's war was seeing his country win. After all, it was already losing the war, much as it had won the space battle of three continents.
A new wave of hope swept the southern plains. Everything was scheduled for a resounding success, now that Yui Yui had pinned him down and put him in a choke hold, Yen had known he could not win this war, he just couldn't.
With a thump, Yen had his rifle back at the ready, ready to fire. The conditions were suitable, if not even warm. Wait... where were the ammo?
With a smirk on his face, Yen was back in the small building that protected the surrounding area. He gathered the appropriate supplies and tumbler up to the front. And done with that, Yen headed for the computer room.
Teacher Yui was watching him eagerly, as if he would somehow magically somehow turn him into a genius. But he had no control over his mind.
Yui yelled across the class:
* "*The High Command ordered us to resupply the students. You can not stand a repeat of this! *" *
Beelzebub's order entered his head instantaneously. He had been sated by this opportunity for some time now and all he could think of was how he should have won that damn war.
This is his first prompt submission. Constructive criticism on other stories that have already been posted are welcome, criticism only.<|endoftext|>
**********38**********
It all started with a thought. Being self-conscious and, well,... free. I had felt a sort of sense of freedom that nobody else could achieve.
Soon, I felt like I could'blow' out the neighbours and get here. A bar is just another place I could bar across the street and get a drink. Every Friday, I went through the doors, trying to get some rest. I had decided after what felt like an hour, that perhaps I was a peaceful, responsible citizen with a job ( living all day, at this rate ). For about an hour I sat and listened, wishing that it would all be alright.
There was a nagging feeling that I was stuck here for a long while. As the hours wore on, I began to take a greater interest in the week. Would it be because I was feeling sad, or did I rather be rolling in the tingling relief of having escaped a terrible place and stuck back in my old home, having had enough.
Then I started to lose myself in thinking of the perfect weekend, spent last nights getting drinks at the bar, and breakfast. I had my head in my hands for hours, thinking about how perfect this, a new town, could be. Every Friday, I left, just enough to remember that if things didn't change, maybe things wouldn't turn out the way I hoped they would.
I couldn't get in.
For too long, I had focused on nothing. A twinge of impatience crept up in me as I grew angrier and angrier with every passing week. I saw my time at the bar go sour, when my confidence as a man had faltered, when I lost my passion for my job, even when I lost my mind for life.
I tried to look away from everything in front of me, my home, my friends, until the bitter clarity of the all encompassing present I was helpless to conjure of a welcoming smile fell away. I watched my friends, constantly adoring me. One day, one night, I tried to look at myself in the mirror, smiling, but with a broken expression of sorrow and sadness. I just smiled.
"After the wedding " I thought to myself, looking off into the distance, " for all we are"
_________________________________
I felt my reverie enter me. I looked up at the clock, set the glass of scotch in the new spot, and walked into my home.
I felt a sense of unfettered luxury and fulfillment in this place. I knew that I wouldn't be wanted by anyone. I set out to begin my life anew.<|endoftext|>

**Sleeping by sleep!' Dippin Dude V.
**I am awake for forty-five hours, **
**And after that, if I stay awake, it ’ ll bring me in cold sweats. **
It must have been the first time you hear that voice. As he crumples to the floor, curious, Thomas hops in the car.
"Dad, wake up. " He asks. " First thing in the morning. "
Thomas turns the key, and feels the rush of morning sunlight on his face.
" Shes glad, " he says.
He closes the door to the car, gets out, and starts to rummage through the dusty lot. No cigar or wine in store. No protection from the night. He finds an empty bottle of Syrah and an old harmonica. Thomas opens the door and -
" Welcome back, Lame Poppa. "
His father stands up and looks Thomas in the eye.
" Don ’ t be so heartless, Lame Poppa, " he says, voice cracking.
" Okaayyyyyy.. you know what? " Thomas replied.
" Son, " his father replies. " Today, as a result of your mother ’ s husband passing, you are awoken to yet another nightmare. A new incarnation. "
" What the... what? " Thomas did not know what to say. His face could not be formed in words, nor could his fingers - they were drenched in sweat.
" You can sleep as much as you wish, son. You ’ re a good boy, and you ’ re a good boy and you ’ ll wake up. But if you don ’ t leave without a noise, Lame Poppa, you ’ ll wish you had been awake before -- "
“ Someone's gone! ” his father screeches.
“ HEY! " Thomas' voices roar.
“ Where the fuck are we? ”
For a brief second, Thomas before he would have been asleep finds himself surrounded by dozens of people dressed in strange clothing - bright yellow shirts with colorful gold embroidered at the hem, and white collared pants with colourful textures.
It is at this point Thomas, a thirteen year old boy with a lanky frame, starts to panic.
" Where is my mother? Where is everybody? ” Thomas wakes up while shouting the sudden shout.
His mother, recognisable to him, looks him in the eyes.
“ Ahhh, sorry, what? Didn ’ t you go to your mother's house? " She asked, anxiously staring at her son.
" Oh, no, no. Nothing will stop that. But, I ’ ll go. Please, wake up. I can feel it. " Thomas immediately touches his son ’ s skin and sees a pink tabby cat staring down at him from behind his eyelids.
" You idiot! That ’ s a cat, you stupid pervert! " Thomas shouts.
" What the hell happened to you? Where are you? "
" Please... stay away from your mother. Please, just let me go. Tell the truth, Lame Poppa. She doesn ’ t have any time to explain herself to you. Just *stop* going through my head, and just wake up. " He told him.
" What do you mean, Lame Poppa? " She raised an eyebrow.
" Yeah, I said I did.. I was going to go pick a dream up from here."
And with that, Thomas' mother explained his one other wish - a dream. A few days later, they awaken to find three men - yellowing numbers on their shirts.
They ask one of them what happened.<|endoftext|>
**********40**********
Dale had skipped into the bathroom on a Tuesday night at midnight when he needed the beer. He was not sure how he could forget that night though. It was something he knew he would remember coming home from his presentation that night with. His mind wandered ever so slightly to Thursdays at midnight, instead thinking about Sundays and Thursdays in her memory. Last night was like every other day for a long time, Dale knew that it was November and he would not be eating breakfast until midnight. And no, today he was, stuck in a rut. A young woman left three months ago for work. Dale did his best to make sure she was alright. Nobody ever called him a monster, nobody gave him the means to do anything around the house, even a so-called crazy a would want his attention. Dale made sure he had his money for this week and made sure he had the money to pay the rent and check his credit card. Another day Dale had found himself stuck with this predicament. Being low on alcohol all week, a man having to deal with his problems sober was new. This has never happened to Dale since, never in fact. Dale had once called him a crazy a crazy a "joke. " He used to honestly think that time had been different. Being on a date with a guy he had met online was different. She invited her for lunch that Saturday was different. He asked to see her before bed so he could see his man before the real thing happened to him. At first she made it ok with him, calling him crazy, reminding him to keep his drink. And then she apologized for leaving him and called him crazy.
Later on that same Tuesday night, Dale was walking home to find another girl at the dinner table. She had bought him dinner at the local restaurant. And that meant something. He offered to purchase a glass of wine so she could take a long nap while he finishes his thoughts before he left to his surprise. The wine at the end was white and dark. With the sudden clap of the glass bottle his girl came to him. She had a beautiful, handsome face and perfect figure. She looked good, not the sexy kind from the outer pages of one of Dale's favorite novels. In that moment Dale had to apologize. He told her the truth. She smiled and said, " You do remember the title of that song? " * Let it be Frank's Grand Parade*, Dale remembered his dad had written it " since childhood. " It was a song of his father, and because of that his father was all good and kind to him. All of his mother and many other things he knew about himself. He said to her, " I remember it well. " The girls eyes met and she left him alone in the car. He lay, as though he was exploring a place he had not thought possible for years. He got off his car, got out of the car and headed to the ball game and was late. Nobody told him about the game until later on that night. The ball started when he walked up to a woman about 15 feet away from him. She turned to him and said, " I never talk to you. " " You really shouldn't. If only I had told you instead of in the first place, you might've still been here. " Dale had told her that night, that he always appreciated it if he was polite and had still loved her. That was the only lesson he ever learned from that night. Someone had to give back to these people. He had to actually enjoy it.
The bell rang, nearly ten, and Dale turned around. He could feel the blanket is getting warm, and his face was cold. His arms started spinning up and down the asphalt. A small amount of wind is knocked over his ears, but soot still sprays from the passenger side. He stopped and looked down, too terrified to get up and see anything. Then he remembered who it was. He turned around and saw a strange looking girl, dressed in dark blue sweats. Dale walked over and waited for her to come back. His voice was distorted with what sounded like a chimney creaking. She came closer and he almost fell over. He held her close so he could hear her voice. He tried to speak but could not find the words. He screamed " leave me alone."
Edit: wanted some feedback on the prompt, I might do some different stuff.<|endoftext|>
**********41**********
I had wondered what the worst moment of my life would be. When I finally made the call to answer it was obvious to everyone that I had all this. I know I had asked wrong but I know now. To answer this question my destiny would be -
What if I remember? What if I fall right back into the world I had before me - a blank world? So I call back! And instead of stopping to think - I only answer questions about the future. I do what I get! Would I be loved in the future, visited by people I had met in my youth? Would I be romantically involved? Would I always have children? As I was the first person to go back in time I was treated as a lost cause, not a significant one.
I grew to be a monster. I have put up with the current main characters for so long that it wasn't the worst things I have ever done, but bad. I have done terrible things because what I wanted to do is bad. I did things I am bad for. And just so you understand, that isn't the biggest mistake.
I looked into the eyes of the Genie and for a moment I thought I could hate him. It couldn't be, not in the form I wanted to like him to be. He was the one who created me, and brought me here. The one who tempted me into not saving him. The one who should have been loved long before he was born. But something is different about him. He looks different. He isn't the same.
I've come to realize my mistake and for a moment I consider asking him where the love from before is. But instead the Genie talks about ending the life of everyone else once and for all. Is he judging me or not, and something was all I can think. I heard my mom tells her that this is the way that I want to go. I understand that it isn't my choice to go back. I was raised here and I didn't need him to be my future self.
But as I walked around the room with tears streaming down my face I see the Genie's face at a loss for words and see the same change in the genie. He sees a young girl he met on a coffee shop walk away from him and he sees a clear-cut daughter. His heart is dying, and even as his last thought, he feels small and insignificant.
So he takes the last breath and with the last words, says a prayer and everything settles down. He has died. No promises, no promises, no love, no faith. This time he chose to go back.
It is not the present that matters to me though, but my past and the future that takes everything from me.<|endoftext|>
**********42**********
When I ’ d first made my hair I could see the look across my face, I could feel it drifting down my forehead, the way my chin was blowing up to the forehead with each breath. I saw it in my eyes, that is until my mother, dear Paula, stopped in the kitchen to check on me.
“ Carla, what ’ s wrong? ” she asked, wiping the last bit of makeup from my face.
“ It ’ s, uh… "
“ What do you mean? ” my mother finished rifling through her purse, turning down her usually right side and lifting her hand to touch my face.
“ It ’ s colour. It ’ s not natural. There ’ s this girl I met that gave me color. She ’ s a little blacker, sorta dense and dark then. I get freckles all over her arms and legs. I wish I could dye those shades blonder, ” she said without even looking at me, our fingers intertwined for the millionth time, delicately tracing the contours of her small, smoky face.
She removed a small sheet of paper from her purse and gently folded it neatly.
“ What ’ s it like living in this beautiful, open world? There ’ s this fantastic idea of darkness, or darkness, or pure beauty. The more you look into it and… go out into it… you become a person, more alone. Like she doesn ’ t even know it, or I don ’ t know what to say about it and, uh, she sort of sits beside me and she stares into my eyes. That look. That flash of colour. It reminds me of her and it ’ s so beautiful. ”
“ But you don ’ t like it? Have you ever seen the moon drift off for an entire day? ” Paula asked.
“ No, and the darkest days just draw you out the more you see it, and I don ’ t think they like it, but some people do ’ t like it. ”
“ I don ’ t know. That ’ s my fair point, ” Paula said, and let her fingers slip into the glossy paper she was hastily digging out.
“ What about hair dye? ” she said, cutting the letter off the page and going back to the bundle of papers that she kept in a secret for months.
I let her take a deep breath and wiped a tear from my eyes. The bookcase was so hard to find even if I searched all my many libraries trying for it, but Paula was a name nobody would have forgotten if I hadn ’ t been so persistent, so close to finding it. * From the Library of Babel*.<|endoftext|>
**********43**********
She was no exception, if that could be attributed to confusion. “ You see, I have the ability. I don ’ t give a shit how you will do it, nor do I want to take it if you don ’ t like it. ” She smirked. It was a genuine smile. I thought she ’ d come into it too late. She ’ d.
It had been eight months since the outbreak. It was her team ’ s way of forcing us to treat the virus as they saw fit. A disease. We had fought it off hundreds of times and were still defeated. We wanted to prove ourselves, to prove why we were wrong about the virus. And once things began to show sense, we knew there was another way. Another way.
Still, we were still dying. Everyday we made the trek to take her to the hospital. Day after day we hoped she would last for long enough for us to catch her. Minutes and minutes passed as we set down the syringes and begged with our remaining friends to make the drive.
It was a arduous process, but as we pulled up to the hospital, we were grateful for the opportunity to stop. She hadn ’ t been the dominant look, not in a long time. She just was, in the way she could be.
I was hungry, so I plucked a handful of meat, a chunk of rye, a good carrot, and a lemon. She stared at me intensely before I finally acquiesced, “ I need to run. Please, just let me have time. ”
“ No, ” I replied. It was the first time I ’ ve been so far, but her eyes locked with mine and her words that made me love her beyond all measure.
“ Stop running, ” she said, her voice sounding wavering. “ It ’ s too late. I need to go, I just need to get to the damn hospital. ”
This was our chance to be free. We were going down the road that would prove to the infected why they were so needy.
Finally, the drive was taking longer and we were finally at the hospital. She flinched and we pushed her toward the hospital. I had a feeling, but it was instinct.
“ I NEEDED to run. I need to take you with me and see how you handle this. ”<|endoftext|>

* "Why did you come, human? " * I ’ ve never so much as looked at the blank blank sheet of paper. I have thoughts of things I can not handle and thoughts of things I must not face.
* " You are not alone in this house. " * There was something more than just blank paper left in the room that I had not bothered to look at for the past 8 months. In fact, it might as well have been already in my hand. We ’ ve never touched anything in our house outside of these walls, and my hands were never the first to shake the thought that once had been placed to me.
The male only glanced up at me from his outdoor seat, but my movements and direction would have been no difference in the seven hours we ’ d spent standing, staring, and glancing at every single website that wasn't a security camera or surveillance camera. I thought about every single step that we took, and it was almost as if we were weighed down by the weight of the situation at hand.
“ You ’ re not alone, ” he muttered, rubbing his chin lightly.
* " That ’ s not even the thing that ’ s still in your head, ” I thought. * " What do you mean ‘ not yet? ’ You still don ’ t know how you got here. How were you supposed to react when everything started to fall apart in your head? " *
“ In my head? ” he asked.
* " I did not know the answer to that question. I didn ’ t think it would have been here, let alone in your head," * he mumbled.
I shook my head. No one in the room was going to believe this because of the promise of my life and money; they were never going to believe me if I lied to them. For the love of God, stay with me.<|endoftext|>

I can see him through the red smoke of the tower. Everyone always so late. Satan didn't want to give my money down, not like the guy who donated it. Instead, he's giving me in cash, and I already made sure that the stupid bastard owed me a hundred thousand dollars.
When we're in heaven, they tell us there's a heaven. At least, a heaven to begin with. Death is hells punishment to me. He comes to torture me. Lucifer and Lucifer are my wife, I don't blame them. This is heaven. My husband tries to stay with me. He tries to trick me with this devilish trick, but with this gay fucking bitch in the middle of my bed, my husband is so helpless he can't do anything.
There's a plan. Give me gold, he'll let me borrow God's money. He will steal my soul into his fingertips, and I will use it for what I want in heaven. Give me a claw, he'll get my whole damn money, and then have me taken for eternity. He'll play with me, he'll steal my soul until my life is forfeit to heaven. I'll never truly be happy again.
Turn the corner in the tower, and the people will be left confused. They never question him. They just stare at him with malice in their eyes. You can't have a vacuum cleaner if you're trapped there.
For the first time, I realize Satan, as he crushes my soul, is just a dick.<|endoftext|>

"Claire? Claire, " I said into the mic. " My name is Henry. "
" Oh, yes? "
I said nothing.
I looked around and saw nothing.
" No, Henry, you say you're *claire. * "
I said nothing.
Henry's eyes changed from hazel to glowing.
Henry's eyes changed from sad to hopeful.
I watched Henry come to, whimper with a bite on my cheek, fly off into the moonlit night and into the end, lifeless and confused. I smiled and watched Henry walk into a distance, a mere final test to see who he was. I then turned my eyes upward to see a pale man, perhaps fifty years old with curly brown hair and deep purple eyes, giving evidence of wrinkles spreading over him.
Henry froze, eyes shut tightly, a split mouth slightly agape, lips slightly agape and a tear leak from his face.
" You have seen death many times, " I said slowly. " But it always happens to you, for none of us know. You have been death's brother for a long time, watched your actions as you built your empire, feared the woman who would kill you, watched your children leave for want of food and iron, feared the man who would murder you, and then the woman who would kill you? "
Henry reached out, a bloody hand holding his head back, then hesitated, calmly.
" A shame, " I said. " Take this. "
" A *fuck*?"<|endoftext|>

The good news. You're done killing enough of us left in this world and now we're clean. Water is good, just ask Russia. Electricity is a marvel, just ask Elon Musk. You know us, we are just a little on the edge of being *enough*.
But now we are all just over there looking around, without any sense of love, without hope. For some of the smarter of us, I think we're going to experience that.
We are the pathogen that consumes the landscape because that is the name we were chosen to give to you from our entire evolution. Unfortunately, our harsh environment is not satisfied with our treatment. We did no other good, and we needed you.
Turns out the only way that we can fix this is with fire. All we have to do now is go through our own deaths in our short lives. That is what I am here for.
We are all our own test subject. We really were.<|endoftext|>

"No, it's really surprising that the most important person in the world has so little security. " The assassin asked the target. " I am here, there is no better security. "
" Okay, okay you wan na try and join me? " She said, scowling, letting slip a different injection. " My staff will handle you. " She begins to talk about her new line of work with the beginning girl, who was surrounded by a series of gazes.
" Great! Fine let's go here! " The assassin replied, excited about the possibility of joining her new profession. " Well, that is easy enough, just trust me when I say this if I knew where I was going. Alright! Now, by now you two should be able to pull together. You should be able to bring together all those people that have nothing on your side. You've got this here all set up! It will take little to no time and all you have to do is choose us! "
" I know, boss, I know you love being a pirate, but something just doesn't feel right here. " She said, disgusted that she was already being called a target.
" When will you be taking us to that orphanage? You can't just leave and follow your team. They may not even even know about you yet. " The assassin replies, sighing.
The girl looks up at the assassin through the glass blinds, quiet. " Yeah, I guess. " She says happily. " But wait! It is only after we finish our journeys and find that extra private in my group that I will need to keep moving. That he might just think you are a target. "
" That's it don't you think I'm on your side? " She says in a playful tone.
The assassin smiles. " Right I guess, everybody's better off without us, I guess. " He says, with that sly smile and baggy red paint.
She trails off. He sits down in the cold chair, tears streaming from his cheeks. " Don't worry, I will be home soon, I love you. " He says, grinning. " A little later. " He says, chuckling. " You do have a perfect set up, but I will tell you that I love you more then ever. "
" A very good thing " She says, raising her hand. " Have fun killing another animal."<|endoftext|>

It seemed to be an infinite field of cheese. Only one way to get food from it though. Once it happened, each mass of cheese must be packaged, distributed, packaged all over the world, to whoever caught the cheese quickly. It seemed to cost too much to keep a person alive for too long.
Then, the cheese came.
Because what's graham? When was this cheese coming?
It started as simple as pressing... then switching course. Then, it accelerated. It was funny. As soon as that controller pressed "Delete " the world froze.
But cheese coming from the outside did not stop there.
With a single touch, every pack, every cheese could be eaten. And now it looks like a thousand cheese cubes lay on the ground.
Would you mind having a team of cheese propped up against a wall to support the victory?

It was all over in an instant. She was gone, very suddenly. He thought he had finally found the one that wasn't him. He was starting to believe her... This was it, this was his chance. He sprinted from the parking lot towards the school. The bell chimes signalling his return was quickly interrupted by a loud clang. Through the cracks of the front door of the main one, a large young face materialized in a huge shadow. His blood red cheeks filled with red fury.
"Kids out! " The crowd roared. " Get inside your school, and jump in the urinal! RUN! "
" Oh my God, John! " A few kids tried to escape from the bathroom with their heads bowed in humiliation. Why couldn't this be a normal school? They could have been cheating. But god forbid they get up to pass the time. John had a sudden super strength in his hands, and without hesitation he pushed through the front door into his new school.
He opened the plexiglass case on his school case in time to see her looking down on him. He quickly made his way over to the bathroom and searched for the clothes he was wearing before rushing to the toilets. John could still feel his stomach churn in pain as he cussed at the blood that flowed down his neck. Finally, he felt his body go limp, then cold.
The bathroom was dark, and he gazed around frantically. He yelled to the students but none answered. As he opened his eyes, something froze, like something was different in his body. His head spun and his body slowly collapsed.
" What the..."
On his knees and wearing nothing but a sheet of paper, a man at his front door saw John and birthed a single item. His name was John...<|endoftext|>

If you look at your elders and your elders and even though you all worship no God and you all fucking worship the Devil, you still believe you're all born into the same perfect family, even though at some point you've fell asleep and you wake up, you just need to go through life knowing you're their kid brother waiting for you to emerge into adulthood.
I'm not sure that same realization will apply to yours.
You are all just that. A child from a wealthy family. You work as a clerk at the same coffee shop you work at. You cry on the swings and you shoot first and aim. You don't do so often and that's because you're bored and that's so frustrating.
It's easy. You find your brother in middle school and they talk about life together and how happy they are. Your real day is just kind of overhead with memories of your parents after so many bad experiences.
But they're just another picture of you. And those memories are still there.
And it's all just like you made it obvious that you are watching through all the hoops you can think of to make it all the same, but as time wears on, you worry that you've fallen asleep in your own world and that you will not be able to recover. At first they worry that your brother won't ever remember you, but if you close your eyes and say "yes", you can watch and be happy. Not knowing your sibling will have to suffer a similar fate, but at least there's that purring you get when you sleep.<|endoftext|>

He spoke of his journey for the village elders, but the'Boko Banzuki' surrendered to the unstoppable forces of nature from the great'Blood of Scarlet Hills', as it was called by the villagers. However, despite their naiveté, things were bound to continue, for at this point they were up against an overwhelming force of undead and undead alike. Half a dozen of them hung by the waist, covered by overgrowth. They had been kind of an early on in the game, when the "blood of the Vampires " had killed and eaten all of the inhabitants. Before that, a small but steady population of centaurs survived the persistent effort of the Vampires.
All to save themselves.
“ Arah aho fuuuuuuuuusfrauuck! ”
One shriek, two corpses stood still, their eyes filling with the pale moonlight. A dead *Zombie*.
“ Save, you humans… ” the man wrapped around one of the skeletons.
“ …save… you humans, hello? ” he waved his arms in the air, clutching his mouth. “ …? And what sort of reason are you riding as a pet? ”
That is until the man saw someone else turn their back. She was gone, and the shadows of the village had vanished. He had found her, but this was no search for her. He grabbed her by the throat and tried to devour her, but there was no mercy given. He held the corpse down with a growl, allowing the hard flesh and bone inside her, between the fingers. It didn't work.
Then he noticed the man's strange clothes. Hosequaters. The cloak covered the hem of his front tunic. He did not wear the cloak for long, as he was afraid of striking down a man like this one.
A distraught silence settled over the village. He had been hunting for an hour, but no prey had shown up. He was certain that the hunter had taken it upon himself to slay such a large beast.
He carefully walked around and past the corpses, and returned to the valley as fast as he could. Nothing followed after him. How else would he get the farm?
Days later, a heavy fog was rising over the border with the village, ruining the crops and giving them to some of the tribe ’ s livestock. The fog began to subside, and it gave way to a still fog.
Months later, the fog was no more. Only the fighters of the militia remain. The pearly gates were caked with blood. The cathedral was now a mass grave, for the necromancer had slain the illustrious Lord Clare Rids into the ether.
He placed his entire weight upon the small coffin, and closed it. Then he closed his eyes.
“ So what did you do to them, for they…what we did to them? ”
“ I…knew what they were up against. ”
The man ’ s entire face grew pale. His entire frame tightened, then froze. The guilt was pressing back into his stomach, and he closed his eyes. All he could see were two figures standing in front of him, their feet turning and walking towards him.
“ …why do you keep doing this? ”
“ What are you doing… ”
“..making these people? Kill them all? ”
The man got up and walked towards the bodies, holding the body a little tighter.
“ They wanted us…for what? To return to them? ”
The man struggled. He was weak. There wasn ’ t time to think, so he just kicked the corpse into a pile of corpses.
The necromancer looked down, his eyes hard and bloody. The blood drained from his body, revealing the inside of a helmet.
“ Who are they? ” the man questioned.
The two figures smiled, and started towards the corpses, carrying them.
“ Do you think these people could be guys? ”
“ Who are they? ”
And with that the two figures stopped running, and walked back towards their campsite, amidst the villagers.
And that is when they saw it, and then everyone knew.<|endoftext|>

They say it was a blessing and a curse; the "anal and deuce " as they say.
This was no such thing. No matter how many bullets had torn up the childrens room, the marble with the orange heart stopped with a wet clatter. Water dripped from the left pocket of the wrapper and soaked past the old sign in the doorway.
It was as if the souls came to life, and with every falling click the blood already entered its stasis, one word after another. " Valium". That was what the walls shouted to be heard as it drained into one spot. One of the children's eyes scanned them, its angry eye color flicking to the victor that had found the mortal offering for the price of one solid apple.
The cup of blood it rested upon gently cooled and the crowd of hungry people looked at it with unfazed questioning eyes. Satisfied that there had be enough to last the time, someone offered the chance to pour another soul into the godless earthen empty cup. The desperation got the best of them and they fell to their knees looking into the crowd of children around them, analyzing each given soul closely, trying to discern a logical conclusion.
That last packet of wine made the souls stir one last time, forcing their gaze away from the pure mass of meat that seeped into their esophagus. That one vowel sound made the others soft. A single curl of curls slid onto the dry spit that left the skin torn open in its final accidental human bit.<|endoftext|>

This is a work in progress.
I dreamt of a girl, probably when I was eleven, who would talk and laugh and be kind. My body felt as good as any. I began to try to understand and that was when I first met this girl. She was gorgeous, as perfect as any I had ever seen, and was going through a phase of trepidation and rejection. She would take me for two weeks straight to dinner, and the only thing that would stop her from continuing with this conversation was a simple question.
"Is there anything else I'd like to tell you about yourself? " She asked, curtly.
" I just don't know. I don't know what's wrong. I'm just a girl. "
" Why aren't you happy? "
" I want you to know that I love you. "
I was speechless at this, suddenly completely baffled by this child who would crush me to death one last time. I saw tears rolling down her cheeks as she walked away. I asked her what she was going on to find. A familiar face, that was not uncommon at the restaurant at seven. She greeted me. It was Tim, my new friend from school. He greeted me and gave me another surprise gift that stuck. He told me about all the memories he had about me from when I was seven.
" Maybe you're not going to be happy anymore, Jessica. You've saved so much for years and years, and now you're just not happy. "
" I am for you, Tim, I was your problem. You believed me. "
" I loved you very much, but I felt that if you weren't telling me about you now, I would never have love back. Besides, just because someone named you didn't mean there was to be anything wrong with me. "
" And even though I miss you, you still love me. You still make me happy. You still get me the things I needed and no one is ever going to stop you. "
" And there is nothing I can do now, Tim. You understand that? "
" Yes, she does. "
She walked away, leaving me with no choice but to see this stranger again.
" Please, try to find something, Tim, tell me what you're feeling. "
Tim glanced at me and put his hand on my shoulder. " I'm fine, but I can tell you something."<|endoftext|>

Harper found himself alone as a lone deer trying to get out of the thick foliage. He looked up slowly at the oak tree and blinked almost instinctively. This day was going to be fun, he thought. It was almost funny to have one of those little coppers roaming around the outskirts. Of course he was in a hurry, ready to throw himself on any other ideas, so he picked a paper towel and pulled out a hunting knife. He hadn't been prepared for a battle so quick but had rehearsed everything. Life in a forest can be hell if you aren't careful.
He pulled out another hunting knife from his right pocket, and his muscles tensed up as he poised for the incoming onslaught. His nerves were tense now as he felt heavier than he remembered. He took the back of the knife and swung it a few times, allowing the deer to land a few feet down. After completing the final swing, he jumped off the surface and made it to a stable line.

On this odd break in the woods, Peter heard a scream. He saw a small girl with two kangaroos scratching one another in the back. She's wearing a long dress that is no longer fashionable, just cute and innocent.
"Nice clean shaven girl... oh wow! She's wearing some kind of striped bright pink coat! She must have found me a party. I have to admit, this feeling of uneasiness... my mouth was dry a couple of times I thought " Oh well I better close it then, or I'll destroy your mind!"
He opened his mouth and announced himself to the girl, in the weird sort of manner that few people can be with one's throat ripped open, when suddenly he stopped. No, wait, he froze. He looked around on the side of the tree. He saw the deer, unaware of the curse it had cast on him. It was now completely awake. It was quite a sight to see.
It was no sight to look at that Thomas Walker. A deer with mouth to mouth paranoiac. He rushed out of the way of another Elk and led it over to the source of the voice. The babe.
Wait! Look at him! That must be Thomas Walker. Whatever was supposed to kill him wasn't. He fumbled with the knife in his pocket, trying to reach for an idea as to how to kill this thing. However, the very moment he pulled the knife out of his pocket, he was pulled right back by the chopping board into a crisp mess.
A deer strode out of its hiding spot at the edge of the clearing. The deer stalked it one knee, and struck it with the wooden plank it had been digging.
It lay there in pain as it straightened, spitting blood all over the wooden floor as it stood right on edge and never even looked up.<|endoftext|>

A perfect world like nothing I ’ ve ever seen. Pissed me off, cheated on me, cheated on her all the way to where I don ’ t even know why I made her sign. That ’ s all that I can think of.
I stumbled to my bedroom and picked up my test. My homework was no longer for me, instead, for someone else. I didn ’ t even know how it did it, but I ’ d always want to know how things worked. I grabbed the test and walked across to my study as I reached for the safety lock.
The color drained from the walls as I put the metal bars on. I hit one button. The glass doors opened and I walked into the darkness, taking no notice of myself as I lay there. My head didn ’ t feel heavy, so I could relax.
I never imagined it was that long since I ’ d been dead. No lighter, no more awkward male figure. No longer my physical form, but my thoughts. I felt like there was something beyond the emptiness of my head, or soul. Nothing. Just nothing, and maybe that was when I noticed it. This small sparkle on the horizon, illuminated by the moon.
Maybe today was going to be different.<|endoftext|>

People don't want to hear this. Not a single voice on our planet, not a single person in our opinion is listening, we have been known to speak in our last days as communication disconnects.
To avoid this, our minds have gone into mimicking a language our ancestors used, occasionally using synonyms like funny stuff and news to describe what we do as humans. " God ", " Satan ", " Hades " and " something like that ", are now used to conjure up these inevitable nightmarish ideas of the future. Those ideas are based in a much simpler time: for instance, in our primitive societies that relied on items with symbols and cut edges, he appeared before us on a day-to-day basis, just remembering things... This is the last day.

" Hello! " David said to the mysterious being. He was special, a mysterious being that appeared many times a day - they knew him more like a skunk than a person. " No one knows me, so I must be dead or going insane " he repeated to the confused god before him. " No one? How the heck did you leave this odd looking being in the room? "
David sighs, turned, and continued on his excursions. " Humans are the dominant species, " he thought. " We don't need you because you already know what's coming next for us. " David looked towards David and said, " Dave, I thought you were dead and I thought you were having a stroke. I'm sorry. But we need you to help us get rid of the visiting people." David looked at the strangeness and then at the hairline. It wasn't his hair, it was part of him, a flowing strand of hair that perfectly matched that of his skin and hands. David threw David a thought: if David could be a skull, surely what kind of drunkard *he* was would meet him?

I can remember it all. I swear. I remember the look of pure terror in his eyes that reminded me of when he was a child. When the lifeguards came in and were notified he was in good hands. He would hold his barrel up to the sky, whispering sweet secrets while screaming. I think that was the first time, I remember him knowing that there was nothing to fear, and I remember him seeing me fall. He looked at me, and suddenly all of a sudden there was terror. Without even thinking, he was sitting upright on a chair, elbows against the hilts of his long black hair, "Dad! " he exclaimed.
I couldn't believe it. My dad is only 50 years old, I'm sure you know that. " My grandma passed away when I was 7, and your mom died on the 20th! You were too young to even remember? "
He laughed, " Yeah. But I remember some things too. I was a very good kid, and got the best friends I could. But those who played competitively were the best. Everyone you know and love has a family, but they all have hardships. They become a burden. So when I was a kid, the rich couldn't buy me the right clothes, and had to work from the black market for money. I was so desperate to be rich. But my parents thought I was stupid and never asked anything. So they both left me alone with my dad, and since we're both blind, I tried to find a job. Since then, I have been lucky to get a job I loved. I never was good at sports, but I made friends during the summer when people were picking each other off. It was that summer that I finally met you. You didn't get fired, but I got kicked out and in the halls all the time. After you left, I decided that I was lonely. So now I'm here, trying my best to find a job. No job, no family. There is one woman, but that has been deserted. I just want to be left alone, and everyone I know wants me. So I take up my guitar and stand up, " Come with me" I said. I don't recognize the words he wants me to say, so I can't stop crying. I'm so sad. I'm crying because I'm still in high school, and just outside the bank, but I can't move. I can't shut my eyes. I'm confused. I just want to go home. The last thing I remember is the pounding of my heart, in an agony of pure terror, trying to make my way home. I'm telling myself I'm leaving, but it feels really small. I want to be somewhere, but it's hopeless. I want to go to sleep, but no, I know there isn't much place for me, and the only thing I can think of is to go see a psychiatrist. I don't want to think about my job. But all I want to do is go home, just like you did, so that I can die peacefully, at home. After that, all I can think of is that I like you so much. And I'm so sad.

"Wait, what?! " cried Doctor Grump.
" The growth of wheat farmer, " she screamed.
" Shut up, Celeste, you have made your point already! "
" Wrong! That wasn't raised in the dark! " Celeste replied.
She arched an eyebrow. Glancing down at her arm, she noticed that Celeste was still bleeding heavily from the grain break she had become so tied to. He then stepped forward.
She felt the blade slice right through her arm, right into her heart. Frightened, she focused intently upon who was about to take her life.
"'What the fuck?' she declared.
" You are the breadwinner you are supposed to be! " He repeated in a deep monotone voice.
Celeste threw down her bread, completely powerless against the man who had mercilessly chopped off her arm and drank her blood into a stainless steel bottle.
" He deserves it, " she spat.
She hung up her gloves, covered the blade with them. She called for a doctor, no matter the name.
" Don't call yourself a doctor, Celeste. It's not like you find the benefits of no-scratch doctors around. "
" At least the benefits are blindingly obvious! " Celeste exclaimed.
" Don't try to convince me otherwise. You call yourself a doctor. You are acting as a motherfucking peasant to a layoff. You'farm' a population on purpose! "
" Because someone told you otherwise. " Celeste began to choke.
Doctor Grump stood up from the table and stomped over to the two doctors, pulling their hands apart. He rushed to help the man, but to no avail.
After the healing, the blood in Celeste's mouth dripped from the back of her neck, and she stopped screaming. Her bleeding was total. After a short while, her vision was returning to normal. One hand slowly reached around her head.
" Can you tell me the difference between the heavens and the Earth in any meaningful way? "
The man replied.
" I don't know you, Celeste. It's certainly not a translation system that I'm familiar with! "
Celeste didn't believe him.
" What? " she screamed.
" Well, to be fair, it appears that the Earth does not rotate at regular intervals. "
" Impossible. "
" It's as much a solar system as any other! "
" It *does* rotate. It is perfectly natural. "
" Who doesn't? "
" The Archangels. We can be sure it is a race. It is bioluminescent, and with them it has no need for conversion. It, like other diseases, has no form and we can prove it never existed. Its existence -in fact, its limitless potential -is nothing more than nature's tool. If a molecule is more than a human being, there is no head that could contain a molecule in the same composition. "
" So this is some kind of symmetry, he thinks, " Celeste muttered under her breath.
" Indeed, " the Archangels answered.
Celeste sat in disbelief for a second. Then looked down at herself. She held the blade in her hand.
" I've now gathered a number of materials, " she said.
" Very good, " said Doctor Grump. He approached the woman. " My apologies for the graphic. You will have your exam tomorrow, Celeste. "
" My honor, doctor, " the woman replied.
" Of course! " Doctor Grump replied. " All I need to do is tell you of a proposition that I am sure he will most definitely agree to. "
Celeste nodded. " Very good. Very good."<|endoftext|>

My daddy rushed into my room where I had found him. Our birthday ball was on the big red couch. " Mommy, Can I play for the win game or give daddy a hug? "
" I can." She opened the ball, and I scooped up a few extra rocks to match the ones in the other room. He giggled, and then ran away with a ball between his legs. As the rest of the house left, I turned on the TV, and everyone was here. I had thought that I would be famous in the sports section of my dad's house. Here he is throwing a ball between two aliens...

Crazy ways to waste your time on quick thinking
Always knowing what you need to know
Don't just take in with a heavy heart, i feel that's where I leave you
Slow down too much and be ready for the adrenaline rush
Just do it.
I get faster in my mind and focus on what is really important
I can feel it's all going as quick as a wind in my breeze
Slow your heart too, you feel as though you're counting a few seconds
Go back and change some things up, or change someone else's mind
Don't wait a minute, it's coming sooner than you know it will
Just focus on what you are about to say, first on the ground
Of course you can't remember how to read this first
please hand me that pad
Write whatever you're thinking, if you can, say it before you say it right
Now, one down, we're going at it
Sorry for the bad taste, i wish i didn't try so hard
Sincerely,
Tis the love of the drug

Crouching in silence all night, the birds sang as the clouds locked and the sky darkened. I could feel the fury of my ancestors' flames dancing over me, though they don't even know how to speak. I waited in the darkness, waiting.
Crouching out of my armchair, I knelt next to the body of the woman who had been murdered. She lifted her head up, bleary eyes gleaming, and craned her neck to speak.
"Father, I had something to tell you, " she said, examining the man's face. " We know you're the first to arrive."
Like that I left him behind, looking back at myself in the glimmer of the sun. Still, the fruitless attempts to hurl fire threw him to the ground, breaking bones before they even began. A pale porcelain sheet of flesh creaked as I watched. I didn't like the dry temperature of my home.
Mum was right, I hated the cold, but it was better for her to stay. It was our duty, after all.<|endoftext|>

*It's getting dark and I'm completely naked! *
*Wake up, you crazy! *
*Your wife came over and told you it's 3 AM to go, she wanted an early sunset for you! Not down the tree near the creek! *
*What a terrible dream! I want to be right here! *
*Wake up, you crazy! *
*Get dressed, you crazy! *
I stare at my naked body in the mirror. It's beautiful. Blue and brown in colour and texture. Cold and all that grey and white shimmers against the field of purple so beautiful.
After about 15 seconds my hand stops trembling. My hand slowly makes the turn to shake, the hand of a stranger I didn't recognize coming near me.
"You... don't remember? " He asks.
" Sorry, it's... the first time I've gone here and it's the first time ever. " I point to the wall. " I remember falling, it was under a fence. I could still see you, yes that's right! "
I mean seriously, you hear me out?
" Yes, there was definitely a fence outside where I fell! " A thick blanket covers me as I lean over the edge.
*So calm, I'm just. Can't. Let's get a good rest here. *
I slowly creep over, the blankets so warm they never give me their warmth.
He looks sad.
" Did you dream about getting out of here? "
" Oh it's just that I didn't. It's kind of scary. " I nod and let him go. " This isn't as scary as you were hoping for, I guess. "
I lift my head just a bit and relax a bit. As I'm staring at a tree outside my window I hear a voice, quite young, lamenting our short time together. It's something someone often used to ask me.
" What is this? "
The woman in my dream turned to me and said, " You know, I don't think you're dreaming. "
I sighed and smiled at her. " I'm glad I answered that. If I'm dreaming I feel bad. "
" I'm a strange boy. "
" Why am I a strange boy? "
" Because you're sleeping on a broken body! " she said, " Your nightmares usually happen in the middle of the night and when you try to sneak out. But you told me, I remember your mother's body! "
I blinked, not sure of myself. I've just thought this I loved my dreams so much that I wish I could go back.
" I'm sorry, " I started, " I'm just scared. "
" Okay, okay, okay. "
" You knew it, right? "
" You did, then you were a grown man. "
" Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. "
" Oh! " I wasn't really about to say anything, but then I remembered that this dream is a nightmare. It's this beautiful place I know is real but this is horrible and this is what it feels like to be unable to sleep.
" If you'd never asked me my name, I would never know your name. "
" Do you know who I am? "
" Your mother? "
" Yes. And your sister? "
" Very well. You two will be allowed entry into the forest after the first night. "
And I say goodbye.
As I walk back towards my car I'm going to pay. The girl, whose name I guess can be related, had left so I would know her before she left. She showed me the cabin I was staying at and told me it was good to go. I come home though, and maybe my dreams again.

Ten million? Honestly, I don't even know what ten million was. I mean, maybe I should have gotten a press corps or something but what am I supposed to do with a 10 million? I was a good guy. Just a pretty good guy.
I got home a message last night, "You have to be smart". They replied, "Use this wisely. Take everything you need today. " I got home, took a shower and then went to bed. At least I woke up. Probably not well.
The next morning I woke up and froze the alarm. Ugh. I turn on the fridge and when I find it I immediately steal a dozen and throw them in the tub. There really isn't any water here. What the heck is happening?
I go back to my dorm room to check if I had forgotten something. I open my phone and hit send, hoping someone will come along with the new set of tests.
When they do, they're real busy. They're looking for my calculator. The usual is from fifty million to sixty million, but then the bus rolls down the street. I feel as if my skin is turning to metal. Fuck. I'm in a really shit hole right now.
I work on the calculator at home. Damn. This city sucks. I need to go find that half a million that I got from the party I was going to run with this morning.
I haven't gotten to the bathroom yet because the floor is getting really cold. My phone is in my pocket because I'm drowsy. My pants are the slacks and my shirt is the shorts but it's been days since I got a shirt.
Oh god. Oh god. God. OH GOD. THE HELL IS MY CLOTH! I'm falling. My stomach hurts. OH. OH GOD. MY GYM? OH MY GOD, GOD. OH. GOD.
I'm falling again.
I'm a freak. I know I should have run and ran away from the party but I don't want to get down on my face. I feel like I'm stuck in this horrible hole and I want to get out of here alive.
" God dammit!"
I just got a text from my friend yesterday saying that he needs to find out if this was worth the ten million.<|endoftext|>

The room is starting to get chilly, the air blowing in, it's so damn cold. Jacob dreads his figure in the yard, his hand wrapped around the handle on the chair in the first row. The paint is starting to thin at the seams, it was done long enough to get a stain on his skin, the afterglow seeping into the brick, reminding him of the craftsmanship that had been left behind in the attic. He had been dropped somewhere, buried here too long and couldn't leave the house again.
He lights the candle, his eyes glassed in a lit of fury. He's found himself in the attic to witness a battle for power. The machine kicked in where I can get a view of it, arcing and spinning and twisting and flashing and roaring like a propeller as it flew and flicked across the ceiling. Jacob swore he heard what sounded like a string. I had heard a damned thrum!
"What did you go there for? " A coy voice snaps at me, across the hallway from him.
He stretches over to me and shudders, this is the heat that would make his heart beat faster than it does now. He doesn't look at me, he doesn't even know who I am. Where did I go to? Why did I go in? I don't have a choice, Jacob will not know the answers to those questions. He scurries across the hall, he will know the answer soon.
He rips his finger, and it's a small diamond in this hellish basement. It shines softly in the middle of the room, a light reflection being drawn to and from within. Jacob stares at the diamond, taking in it so he can appreciate it more. No matter how much of a fool he is, he goes back to the building and decides to leave one last note before leaving, " I wish I'd never been born again."<|endoftext|>

Firstly, modern magic has its boundaries and boundaries being of a birthright, The EM is a magic that is in fact human-like. It has a powerful body, and is sentient, both physically and mentally. The EM can be turned on/off at will and have it resonate in the the mind of the user as the device is programmed to do so, and, more importantly, have magic abilities.
'Wizard' magic can be activated in full, affecting contact between the user, appearing as a light floating above their head, or standing on their back, and a corresponding companion.
In addition, the EM can send messages up to 10 minutes to those who have magic ability, whether it be physical or digital. Sometimes, the EM gives'muggle' magic a split second opportunity to demonstrate ability, because it allows it to communicate with an inanimate object, but most importantly, once the caller draws a blank, the effect can be transfigured, given to the recipient, with the sound and smell of a person's mind appearing to them without their hearing.
To my humble knowledge, a chemical called covalent based magic is used to represent the power to extend vibrations through reality, in all its forms.
In my notes, the EM transmutation is controlled by a single operator who recieves the spell through the use of his own magic equivalent or whatever distance, protocol, or method, he may use the object to amplify it's power. I can easily calculate how long it takes the caster to complete his spell, how many times it takes to draw his hand and how much long it takes before he even uses it once.
Regardless of how long it takes for the EM to collect, it can be useful if that operator, though ill fated, doesn't need to use it when the sound he is hoping to hear is striking his body, or orchestrating the surgery. However, there can be only so much an operator can use his magic without actually activating the spell, and the traditional power can be evaporated within 20 seconds. It may seem like magic, but it can be likened to drugs, stored in liquid form, and sprayed with chemicals to slow how many people die.
A good amount of experimentation has been made in regards to how to control the EM, and apparently today some thoughts are starting to wander.
A number of theoretical physicists have predicted that an EM with a large response rate should become capable of a superior, even more beneficial, ability compared to conventional methods. You can see what might drive the Neural Neural Negativity Project " The Neural Coagulance program", or some approximation thereof. Quite simply, you would be able to impose gene variants on somebody without much care for their body's learning abilities, and even with this we might also be able to transfer the message to a user of an incredibly powerful mind.
I will attempt to share more about this strange discovery with as many readers as possible, but I suggest you don't try to publish anything that's not the explanation, nor do you try to ignore the issues surrounding this one. This will be the third time I've mentioned this, and the second time in as many weeks.
As for you, let's get back to your weekly writing prompts.

I suppose your question would come across a bit easier. The idea that he had earned this experience in pursuit of knowledge as it was, perhaps, isn't out to debate that fact. In a place like this you need to be for sure, then.
The path you're on, which I would have been sorry not to mention as a part of the challenge, lies deeper, deeper in the ethos of the fine print, and more so in the nature of the words and sentences in which you were presented, than is the open road ahead.
What I'll do is add an additional checkpoint to our conversation, to help accomplish this. Find myself in the middle, a long way, and going forward, metaphorically and literally in your mind. I can't be quite sure which path is taking you, but I can certainly ensure that you can reach that goal.
Through any strange means of getting around yourself, because of the little crossings, other players might not, you'll have plenty of time to see what happens. Now, I believe in this idea of being in the mindset of God and being because you need to think about how others might be; all in the good and bad, honestly, is about yourself.<|endoftext|>

It was one of those big dates, to be sure. NASA had left Earth in record time and wiped that tradition from history with a science paper that was accepted as "medieval" in its decision to nuke the moon and Mars. Eight billion human souls were to be saved. It was a beautiful day, no-one really made any demand, until we met them at a "Late Night Bang " when we were eating breakfast, and they all said " this is one of those big dates, to be sure. They're small, but they remind me of all of my long time interests. Do you remember the first time we tested the pressure cooker?"<|endoftext|>

"Blood on their lips. "
I hand it over to the pile of gore. All in the last hundred gallons. That's what we call them. I think a thousand souls have been woken up, *and* were going to die. It started off petty skirmishes, shouting at each other and arguing. No rest, we were found out. The war ended at six hundred and eighty.
It may not have been glorious, but a waste of time. We barely woke up in six hundred and seventy years. Well, out of eighty and *soon* into seventy, the *you* realized you weren't the first to die.
Ours was one of the first crops brought to the field. It was grown from the land's wild tribes. It grew from three natives and one particular tree, and then only a few plants per person. The plants died off in a four week run. A stop on natural growth, and the remaining vegetation, eventually razed, then some, but the crops were more reproducible with better old material. It was considered a successful transition, made through conquest, peace, and security.
It was theorized that the surviving villagers, or at least in a few of the local tribes, were instrumental in using the technology, or outright stealing from the *people*, doing the killing. Some villagers were shown the papers, and executed and left here. Many died with the rest of the village.
Where remains of these villagers and their crops lay, more remain. Some remain in a pile of tents by the lake. More remain in the field, miles away, perhaps in an area that wasn't polluted or growing drought, but actually strong enough to keep it dry for a few hundred years. Some remain in herds of cattle, with days and days of sight and some day, weeks and days of thought, and some days stay out for what seemed like an eternity.
The meek remnants of these, animals, are why they roam the fields and hunt wild animals for food. Most humans, however, don't have herds or herds and would starve to death, short term. I also possess the technology to produce grain in the far corners of the field, where I collect the other life-giving husks from the native peoples. I accept this harvest and I am moved upon to what was once farmland.
I drove my truck down the farmland. Why bother finding a just way to venture across the field if my luck was turned? I could still call up.<|endoftext|>

With all the excitement in the world of Jack Black, the environment and security situation had begun to delve into a dark place. The 9:00 hour, 7AM, 6PM and 6PM time zones were all looking quite peaceful. This meant that this was the first time Jack Black had recorded a hellish night.
All around he could hear the commotion ( like how in the Mob or Metallica concerts it all gets high up on the noise combined ) and an aura of chaos to the ashen and smogy area. Jack Black did not even realise what he was doing until the police entered his home.
"Hello, I'm Jack Black" Called a disembodied voice. Blood had been seeping in his veins. His thoughts were all while being interrupted by a fierce and voluminous roar. Jack Black knew what it was: a savage beating.
Everyone around him was frozen in horror and terror. But, he didn't turn around to dodge the blow. An identical, human beating broke the spell of silence that everyone knew was bound to happen. The beating stopped, and Jack Black let out an agonized scream and fell to his knees with the bag still clattered over his head.
The others had turned around to watch Jack Black begin to convulse and bleed out, organs being laid out around his mind. He kept moaning at random. His breathing slowed, the struggle of filling organs left him to weak and scared. He begged for a better life. He begged for death.
Then, all of a sudden, everything froze. It hit a dead man's head, his arm, his stomach, his groin, his head. The bag opened and several people rushed over to him, many of the dead smiling, tears in their eyes. It took several tries to calm Jack Black down. But, he was ready to face the final days of his life.<|endoftext|>

Damien
It was certainly what he was in charge of. Standing over the carcass of a human, he could tell that this beast was one with humanity. Drained of blood, with large, muscular arms, the skin of a human looked like the surface of a well. He met Damien, an overly terrified man.
They laughed, and danced, looking at him suspiciously. Damien merely shrugged it off and made him bow in respect.
"You're awake, Damien, " Damien said, in a panic. The human circled him, laughing. Damien froze; he stared at the creature.
" What is this? " Damien tried to ask, but his voice carried a strangely pathetic slurredness that Damien could hardly see. The creature let out a terrible growl, and Damien went through the normal motions. He looked at Damien.
" It's an Eevee! " Damien blurted out. The Eevee simply twitched in surprise. It was perplexing, but Damien remained adamant.
" Stop it! " Damien yelled. The Eevee let out one large yawn and sniffed.
It grabbed Damien's shoulder and dragged him to safety. When Damien looked closely, he noticed it was... Pidgeot? He was only vaguely aware of the name but he couldn't figure out which one he was referring to. It felt... The tail? The ears? Damien kept his suspicions to himself, trying to figure out how this human was doing it. He quickly retreated to the backyard and kept walking.
Eventually he arrived at the Human's home. He had placed the Eevee into the blanket, and kept the Eevee under it. He followed them as they made their way down the hall. He let out a high pitched wheeze, before moving to the circle around the Human.
Damien floated in his pocket before the Humans could react. He barely noticed the Eevee in front of him. He shrugged off the human, and stepped back onto the Human.
" Can you not call me that? " Damien mumbled. He turned to look at the Human. It was cloaked in cloth, that was all. Damien could see some strange markings and grotesques. He couldn't place them.
" You may call me Omegle, " Damien sighed. The creature returned to his feet and replied with a quick smile. Damien understood and complied.
" Something must be wrong. " Damien sat back down in his seat, rolling his shoulders to create a cushion. " Something may be wrong. "
The two humans looked at each other, puzzled, before meeting in an unfamiliar face.
" Eh, " Damien replied, shyly, " Maybe I need to call you Spiece, eh? "
The woman nodded.
" Good luck with that, two humans."
And with that, the two Eevee walked off with some Eevee spirits.<|endoftext|>

I opened the front door of the still-debris train train I was on and finally cracked open the train door. Panic caught up me in my panic-induced mind and I looked out the barred window to the building looming over the battlefront.
It looked grim, a destroyed building that only had to say it was my apartment. The United Nations had won the War of the Fuhrer that year and now it was Stalin's time to take it all back. All it took was one man to take some non-reputable nuclear weapon and convert it to steam. The year before that it was that simple vita called Sweden, and now with Sweden producing enough plutonium to satisfy a Chinese war machine the old one had to be dismantled and flown to Aden that made nuclear hell. Oh, the Berlin and Mecklenburg had been repulsed and now Russia offered to contribute and had gotten access to the moon base by force and repurposed it into a multi-planetary cruiser with several superheros.
The colorful US flag was fluttering in the wind, and the gleaming black disk that once filled the sky was taking its toll on the horizon. It seemed that by that time this war had started. This was it. Nuclear winter had begun and the Americans had to pretend they hadn't been tricked by Soviets instead of getting the hell out of it. Only a couple more months of chasing those American propaganda posters and I was done. The communists won and I was back in America, jumping with the dammit Russians and getting on that *Steel Cruisers. * I didn't need to breathe or to worry about Stalin or Oswald or whoever was pulling his trigger. I moved into the house of my old Nazi father and we bought a little attic.<|endoftext|>

No one expected anything but a large ship. He wasn't too worried, just an inconspicuous vessel-
"God dammit John. We just raided the wings of a half royal asshole. Let's see what's on it! "
" Uh huh. Yeah, darn the smoke's fuckin' real. "
The soldiers kept storming in. It was going to be a bloody and brutal war.
" Why can't we just buy you ours swords? " one whispered.
" I'm not asking. What's a fight in fear for you all -- the Star Council's going to pay a hell of a lot more gold if you give it a thousand quarters. "
" Fine. We might take care of this, but you can take *no* of this whole damned *unheard of thing* right now. "
" I'm sure it is big enough to be a big war in the afterlife. "
John was hurt. He couldn't even lift himself up on his way down to the gate. People just kept looking at him with the look of fear and respect.
" This ain't us, " someone said. " There were fucking *trips*. "
" Hold on, " he croaked out. " How long until we've got the planets' ugly old lives? "
" There was no one. "
Nobody -- but the soldiers. They knew him. Someone knew his destiny. Someone had to find him.
At least he had gotten out to kill his enemies first.
He watched in horror as a bundle of baby beetles tossed in from the wings of a particularly large one of his men.
" Why'd they take over this whole damn planet? "
John gasped. " The fucking planet where the bugs spawn! This empire! It fucking... it was worth more than riches and glory for fifty years! If they had all gone their separate ways at the same time, there would have been nothing to live for! And we didn't even fucking know we needed them... we just did. Didn't even *want* them... wasn't there something we could have done? "
" I don't think so. But I think I would like to see your honour in the afterlife- "
John began yelling and kicking the dirt. He couldn't speak, not yet.
" Please, GOD DAMMIT. I had no choice. "
In his defense, it was both obvious that the soldiers outnumbered the other warriors, and because they were so *petty* about it, they knew that John could be killed.
" Fuck. "
John fell back into the dirt. It was the small thing that scared the soldiers. It was his brother.
" Peace on Earth."
It was sad. But he was done for.<|endoftext|>

Arthur ran his knife through the bush, took deep breaths and focused his senses on the meandering waters below. On the first caress of the waters, she gently brushed his finger against the base of the leaves, yet it was clear to him that the fish were forgoing their habit of teasing his furry hairy fingers with their fins.
"You can not breathe with a knife in your hand, " whispered Arthur.
" Yes? " Said the meandering female.
" So the tongue licks it on the face, but that doesn't have it's benefit with the fish. " Said Arthur as the water grew warm.
" You say the tongue licks the face more than that, " said the female.
" I can't, " whispered Arthur.
" Well you see, now that I think about it, it is better not to know, but to be alive, and to die. If you love and know nothing else, then it makes sense to feel alone. "
" I can feel the depth of the water. I can feel the rhythm of the waves. I can feel the motions of the tectonic plates. You live on a great big island in the ocean, if you can don't have to share your time with nature around it, then I can and will die here, surrounded by the shores of sea."
Arthur leaned back in the forest, staring skyward for the last time, and wondered how far the forest he was supposed to feed himself and not drown himself in deep thought. No, he reasoned, the tree that will provide the final sacrifice will find a path that will take him to the afterlife.<|endoftext|>

"Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit... Oh god, oh god, oh god! " I said to myself as I frantically ran for cover behind thick bushes. As I turned my back on whatever they were digging, a low hum filled my ears. Some kind of metallic sound or rumble from another unknown source. It had to be nuclear noise, definitely one of those WWIII type things. I grabbed my flashlight out of my backpack and turned it on. Being weary of my life I turned it on again but the sound was coming closer.
There, in a deep, black trench, was a towering ball of intense metal! Hitting me. I was frozen, helpless and scared. As I tried to make my final push, I heard a voice come out of nowhere and begin rattling.
" You brought me this! " The talking little squire said sounding all like a doctor in the most ridiculous sense of the word. Before I had time to question, he started blowing up the size of a small city, cannon balling and smashing into my head. All the while a mass of metal began colliding with me, the doctors flying about like meteors. I began to realize that I was in a hospital for the criminally insane. I gathered my best doctors and a few nurses in the closest wall room and made sure to attack as a group. I quickly surrounded the nearest woman in the room and entered her room. Next to me stood two other crows which I quickly shot back! However, they did nothing to my evil plans! I yelled for a doctor to come out and run after me to cut the evil crows off! Suddenly something pained me. Before I could speak, I came out from the darkness of the dark room and I saw a turtle. The turtle broke through the wall.
-nu --
" She didn't even scream! She just stared at me! A moment later she let out another roar like a banshee. As I turned around, I saw her lying in a pool of her own blood and she was holding on to the hulking turtle. I was about to intervene when the sounds stopped, and they were replaced by soft screams. Everyone froze to death in horror. Someone was tripping over someone as they died. I quickly ran to her lifeless body as she started convulsing like a newborn baby. " Aaaaaaaueeee -- -er..."<|endoftext|>

Dude, if you can open your eyes at will to see me...
Imagine-
You will not be a normal jack ass.
For every decision of this world, there is a roll to determine the future.
You get to be a candidate.
Anything is possible.
Like Plato said, you choose to be something, regardless of what your past will have been.
Now, imagine your first time.
Hit your boss with three slash wounds to the head.
But he doesn't even die for that.
All he has done are beat the crap out of you.
No twist to change our past, or the present.
That's how the dice work.
Choose wisely.
Or fail to perform a roll at all.
*No* the change in wording ( for instance, blue... ) could have been a wheel of equal numbers.
But this didn't matter.
I chose to be something that everyone chose, and instead of wasting my resources in validation and whatnot, I passed on.
I chose to be a bag of reals right now.
And for the next seven months, I spent months scrubbing the memory of my middle school weeks and last years lessons out.
All I ever did was sleep, live and be a shadow.
But every move I made, seemed to change my future forever.
And every time I heard the stupidest line that made me groan into my pillow.
Since then, there hasn't been a day in which I let a dead man walk into the home of a family of four.
I think...
It's just a part of me.
I live for my future.
This line did not say "average" right then.
It said something special.
And now here I am walking on the bar window to party with my new, twisted love.
Oh, it must've been good luck.<|endoftext|>

Rhett look at me, his face always growing evil.
& nbsp;
“ Why can ’ t I touch you? ” ruttered Joseph as he reached out and touched the thin, discolored skin on my shoulder.
& nbsp;
“ I bet you had a bad day. ” I protested, pulling him along. We kept circling each other closely, reveling in our newfound power.
& nbsp;
“ Isn ’ t this kinda cool, you know? ” I chuckled.
& nbsp;
“ No, you aren ’ t. It ’ s ridiculous. ” He grinned at me, grabbing the rest of my arm.
& nbsp;
“ What, then you are in danger? You won ’ t survive. ” I growled.
& nbsp;
“ I bet you think I ’ ll be as silly as you. ” I stammered.

“ But you won ’ t! ” Joseph shouted before ruffling my hair.
& nbsp;
“ I ’ m not raising you, do I? Not yet. How long will it take until you find out what exactly you are hiding? ”
& nbsp;
“ You won ’ t trust me. Or the souls of that creatures. Or the souls of other beings. You ’ ll be run down as a vagrant under a rock forever and ever. One that ’ s smarter than me. And it will not be the ones who survive to end it. ”
& nbsp;
“ Don ’ t you dare. ” I growled. “ It won ’ t be your parents, they won ’ t find you. Someone has to save you. ”
& nbsp;
“ You won ’ t see the trouble, why are you on my side? ” He grinned.
& nbsp;
“ Fuck you, you don ’ t need to rely on me. ”
& nbsp;
“ No one can save me. And neither will they. You have too much at stake here. ”
& nbsp;
“ Look at the promise. ” I motioned with a pliant finger at Rhett. His gaze stared back at me, wanting to ask me my final words.

"It's as it should be, little ma'am. "
" Please, it's okay to be scared. I can deal with it, though I always thought it should be you. "
The Earth's first concept unfolded quickly. An asteroid, a space ship, a star. Satellites, geysers, telescopes, all stood on the edge of their destination. We weren't expecting to see anything, of course, but we didn't want to become lost in our theory. We wanted to experience our children, the moment their faces change as they become connected to their creator. Our old-timers went through a little shock, a worried look in their eyes, a declaration that they had all died.
In the 10th year of humanities mother's birth, they were both the recipients of a thirteenth child.
It was the worst meeting of death we had ever had. Family wars, marital conflicts, some even mental breakdowns. It was scary, considering we weren't even sure where our children will end up.
" You have to remember, son. We don't know what has happened in your little world. " My mother told me.
I never considered the life I would see my son suffering. Me a child, built by a tractor beam, delivered in any moment. Mother wasn't the woman I always imagined. Mother was the woman I wanted. I would never understand, but somehow I would. That mother had told me all that was right and wrong, and she never spoke a word of it.
" You're such a strong mind, son. You only fit so easily when your genetic limit is so low. " She said finally.
In a few months, my son, the Earth's first human, was born. He would be the first of a generation. Or rather, the billionth or so. I had never thought about how lonely he was without his mother.
Soon, people claimed that he would transform one night when he had to leave for work. In the end, everyone came and took him home. He didn't even miss a night, and on the first day he was fine. He showed me his bedroom, which you would find it with all the names, be it ex-wives or siblings, always in it's own. All were so good, and so innocent.
But I was wrong. I was wrong the next day, and all that I saw there. Scattered drops of blood that washed over the quiet grey countryside, every voice in the street, a million angry messages.
I had a wife, so she wanted me to be with her.
She took him, even though I didn't like it, and he, despite all that, was not alone. So we married, it was my wife's turn.
" It's as it should be. You've always been here, I was right. Please, stop being afraid. We have far too much for you. " I said simply.
" But, " she smiled, " I saw a flash of light fall on you, at my wedding. You died and I was still here. "
It made me jump, of course. I couldn't remember the exact moment I saw the flash of light. I looked at him, sure of himself, but also scared. Not sure where he was, or if he might survive, or if he would choose to continue somewhere else.
" It's not fair, " he whispered, and walked away.
I didn't know what to do, but I started to understand.
*I could have died with you, but I didn't. *
The world was now looking at me now. I put my hands up, it was hard, but the pain wasn't so bad.
" Now that's heaven, huh?"<|endoftext|>
**********79**********
I hear footsteps on the other side of the hall. There's nothing here at all.
I walk over to my mother and step around her. She nods, but I know I'll see her again soon. I reach into my robe and pull out my sword. I take a swish of the blade, only to fall to the floor. Her screams are fading from my lips, and I begin to cry myself to sleep, though I find she can not hear me.
I wait for the bedroom to open as a teenager once more. When I rise, I rush to open the door. I quickly spot all the children, all dressed in their straw and gym socks. They don't feel me as I bring them to their feet and walk away, ashamed that this one has become such a nuisance to me.
They walk back in and I can hear the laughter through the hallway. I run across the floor and she looks up at me, but is silent. I see the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. It is once again screaming, saying something important.
*Please, don't hurt me, I love you* she whispers to me.
I push my blade away from her cheek and take a deep breath.
*If I did it again I would never leave her. If I needed anyone I would make them happy* I whisper back, taking another deep breath.
I fly up and pick her up. She wants to run, but I am not strong enough. I drop her and step back to make room for her before I notice she has gone quiet.
She looks up at me and her scowl deepens.
*What is wrong with you? The hall has grown quiet* she says, as if she would never see me again.
I let my eyes work for a moment in terror.
*Is that why you have left? Why haven't you come home* I whisper again.
She is silent for a moment, almost stunned.
She stands and steps back, and pulls the sword out of her robe. She points to a statue and a boy with a cross on his face stands on top of it.
Her mouth drops.
*A lifetime ago, I took my first breath as a king, before turning away from the world to battle the Darkness*.<|endoftext|>

"It's dark, gentle, almost like a milky way up the tall tree, " a demon said to me.
" Ah yes, but I feel very light, " I replied, nervously sliding down the top of the tree, lazily stepping towards the demon.
" I wonder how long you're gon na do that then, " the demon said, grinning.
" What little you've done will always motivate me to continue. " I thought, giggling a little.
" I don't think you'd understand, " the demon said, pointing a finger out of the darkness. " My only purpose here is to guide you to a new life. " The demon's tone was hidden by a heavy, straight black cloak. The cloak was so thin that only red skin could appear.
" Okay, cool, you should know something about protecting the child that brought you here, " the demon said, his smile revealing a fear concealed by black clothing. " So... I mean, in saying so, you could tell me who the child was. "
" Oh! I know exactly who the child is, right? " I jumped up and out of sight of the demon, reaching a hand out to the demon.
" By that, I mean he already has a name. He has this lad on the back of his bed. "
" You mean it's a dragon? " I couldn't remember the last time we had met, or a fight.
" Not exactly. This would be familiar. " The demon smirked, moving towards me with a smile. " Let's talk about the stairs. "
" He says he's coming down. " I looked down at his cell phone, sending him off a little excited. " Dummy? "
The demon thought for a moment, then glanced at me, then back up at him. " And now that he's stopped, he's starting a conversation for me, too. " He grabbed his phone. " Tell him about the bottle of blood! "
" Oh yeah! " I giggled. " I think it's time for me to join you in doing all this stupid job. "
" What do you want me to do? "
" Nothing! " The demon laughed hysterically, completely taken aback by this point.
" You know what, boy? We have to stop doing this. I love you, and if you need anyone else to go do something else, I'll do it for you. "
" Oh! " I smiled. " See you in a while. "
" See ya, boy," the demon said, embracing me like I was his, and as I got in my car I pulled out the night time drive back to my neighborhood. The child we needed was beyond saving.<|endoftext|>
**********81**********
"So, why am I dying so early? "
*Who the hell is this? * Damien thought. I'm not supposed to be dying, but this bastard gave me this job. He wanted me to kill him for this " lucrative" payout, because of my connections in the Government.
*You don't even know how many I've been killed in the last three months? * Damien thought as he grabbed a gun and popped him in the chest.
*Wait, no you don't fucking fucking know how many I've killed for the same fucking reason. **
Damien watched his employer die, distracted by the massive gaping hole left by his attacker in the opening.
Now to the report.
Detective Garrick, on his way up the stairs, noticed a shadow drift through the shadows. Suddenly, the frame of the apartment was torn down to the bone. It was done.
Steady, Damien raised the trigger of the gun to his temple and put one finger on the trigger. Instinctively, the gunman jumped off the roof of the house, but only lost one of his hands in the process. Through most of the house, Damien felt a slight breeze blow against his fingers.
Damien closed his eyes, knowing what would come next.<|endoftext|>
**********82**********
"I hate it here in my cell. "
I remembered. I looked into the bay window while trying to think about an argument. Before we could progress we could hear someone, I didn't know, give her a gift or something. Is it in his desire or passion? Is it in whether he wants this to work? Maybe the malevolent light in my cell reflects on him...
I thought of death and I finally held in my hands this small box. The box itself was purple, discolored from the harsh phosphorous environment of the bay. I've never used my cell a lot, we are okay on the street, so the only thing I can think about is the women here. The strong one is about to die and there is no room to spend a time with her.
The strong one is near death. Probably when the medic arrives on the scene, either because he doesn't like being worn down by the force, or he is tired and refuses to respond to a command that is not coming.
" Hold on. "
The medic had no luck, I knew he would, but the bay window is designed to permit objects such as these to pass undetected into a privileged area.
" Sit back and wait. "
Tumbling off of his keyboard, he hesitates a moment. " Stand back, " he chimes his voice so I can see him's eyes. I sense a mixture of confusion and fear inside him. His entire body is held together by armor that gives him almost inhuman strength.
" Why isn't the building under me working? "
The man in my cell is staring at me, blinking slowly, suppressing the fear that grips his face. Before he finishes, he sees two girls on the other side of the window. One has her arms in a tight gap across her chest. The other is holding her to her feet, awkwardly thrusting forward into the face of this two girls.
They gaze back at me. My entire body's been rocked to the hard ground, the only time I've seen her this way is when the light from the bay is shining through my window, or when I seem to myself to be staring at something. Even though I am looking at something...
" What are you doing? " One of the girls whispers to the other. In the dim light of the small window I could see a dim lit hallway, dark with oppressive fluorescent lights, the girls that had been seated across from me get up closer, and stare at each other. I slow my breathing.
I immediately jump. " A fight?" one of the girls says. I fall to the floor, shocked. The others have tried to stop me, but I'm paralyzed by something else. The strength in my body is being pulled away from me at the same time that the bay window is flung inward. I look at my cowering body. The strong one is going to be hurt...
The screaming of the girls gets louder and louder as the fighting gets stronger. The breathing of the weak one gets tighter and closer, becoming impossible to distinguish between the two. The strong one screams, and her body begins to flop down as if it is holding her in place. There is a loud rush of air and pressure to the air. Both of them fall to the ground, and when the shaking finally subsides, the screaming stops. Their screams barely register as we realize they have stopped, and are now cowering in the corner of our cell.
We are no longer alive.<|endoftext|>

"That's our caller ID, I can't be bothered to give it to you. Please -- "
" Again. Hi. I'm Victor. I'm currently running a critical analysis of the latest quantum computing chip that you've ordered. Please refrain from repeating this for any reason. "
" Yes sir, for some reason I get these queries. I can assure you, my government is not trustworthy. They allow Americans to spy on innocent people, and I'm about to put your intelligence analysis to the test. "
" You are a the president of the United States, and the term is now up for a vote. This ballot initiative stands for more civil liberties and broad protection of speech. What can you have for me? "
" I have a chance. Unfortunately, while I'm on the phone with you, we don't have enough tech support to answer all of these queries. We do however have access to your personal Facebook account. If you want to send a text message, we will relay the request for the reply. "
" Yes. I'm sorry to be of such a burden. I will forward the response to you upon my next appointment with the tech support representative. I'm considering making the decision to deploy this quantum security hardware as part of my next project. "
" I don't need to know that. Goodbye. "
The voice was ringing in the back of Victor's head. " The government won't arrest me for treason! Is this really necessary? You just won't do it again. "
" What about the public outrage you brought forth today? I thought they would be angry with me for invading their privacy without even asking. I figured they'd come out to fight me. "
" That should be the end of it, " Victor smiled up at the television. " Today at noon, in the gray room of the White House, President Obama begins his speech. On this day, after many years of President Nixon by his own pledge to prevent Americans from spying on themselves, President Obama begins his first State of the Union Address. "
The President raved about his speech, about many things, but most important, what he was about to say. " Today at noon, we salute all of the citizens of this great nation for finally enacting what citizens don't deserve! Today, the citizens of America break free from their government at a staggering cost to ourselves and the world. The untapped political potential of the people inside the walls of our governmental system lies within the bare mortal coil of humanity! You see, it is not a crime to call upon others to protect us from the tyranny of their government, that is simply wrong. We may break free from tyranny, but you will never find freedom here. "
The cameraman pulled out a device, and set it alight. He stretched out the digital broadcast he was watching for several moments before opening his mouth to speak. He began by saying something, but now it was unintelligible. An exclamation of desperation, however, stopped him in his tracks.
" Alright Google, I'll be back with what I can send you at the end of the afternoon. Let me just get this over with. The technology for this conversation is outdated, so any mistakes you made aren't flagged. Remember, though. Don't ever presume that I give the law the orders to beat up the human race. "
The wall outside Victor's office disappeared, leaving behind only the faint outline of a booming voice. Victor stood up from his desk and took out a massive stack of papers. " Very well. Thank you for this brief introduction."<|endoftext|>

It had happened, World Peace in the end. The judges had been called upon over the comments that the population needed to be restrained to be around 600 people, ranging from people with severe rheumatoid arthritis to those who worked unwell, some even suffering from HIV/AIDS as a result. In the end, the experiment was a success.
I sat in front of a phone, ready to leave my apartment and head home. It was a pretty cool day. The hum of a city lately had provided some sustenance, not taking as much anymore. I picked up my lamp and ready to go, when I heard a soft pop on the metal tiled floor. A few muffled rustle from behind me, I turned and the signal had been received. The network was open. I turn my head to see who was playing the voice recorder on the wall behind me. In the background there was a female voice with a slightly pregnant voice.
"Hello! " she said in a very kind and melodious voice. " Asks your name? "
" Michelle Davies. "
" How did you got here? " I asked curiously.
" I am here, " she answered. " The device is *awesome*, a device similar to any cell phone, and its an eternal recording of the body. "
" Why are you... You're always making jokes about how Immortal I am? "
" It's not that nice of you, I thought I'd get along with you. "
" I've watched you live this life before, not just with your previous self. There are hundreds of other prisoners like you. It's all unfair, more *impure* then anything I've ever done on this planet. "
" Am I, in fact, Immortal? "
" Yes. I am. As immortal as you are. I don't *know* why you do it. "
" So, I already said I was Immortal. And you're an Immortal? You haven't slept in like I have. "
" Of course not. You stay up all night. The doctor says I'm going to live another, maybe even a lifetime. "
" So what do you say you want to see? "
" I got ta make up some space. "
" Can you let me get some air? " I asked her, standing up. " A long time. "
" Why are you doing this? "
" I am not after this program, I am after freedom. "
" Still say it, " Michelle said, setting the microphone down. " I am only free from you. "
" Don't you want to talk about it? " I asked, going back to turning the monitor. She sighed. " Sorry, I don't have a plan in mind. "
" How long have you been out? You're barely here, and the doctors tell me you've lost the use of your senses. "
" A while, it would be best if you would just keep quiet. "
Michelle sighed. " So what is your plan, then?"

**I Say My Name**
*Dear Eric,
It's been a long time. I've been tired of waiting. Been hoping to see you, see you grow old in this world, able to sleep. That's not something I can do.
I don't have the time in the world for this, but I can fix this. Do it. Make sure that my little brother is ready to join me to live a lie. I wouldn't want the day to end like this.
I just finished a speech this week and now I want to go home. I haven't been listening to you these last few years, and I hope to see you again when I am older.
You truly are the reason I came here.
*I Say My Name**
*Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time. *

A million dollars check in your bank account on repeat. I ain't no sadist, just you...
I owe you my help so I can afford my college bill. We have plenty of time.<|endoftext|>

"Hmm, this must be a trap. " Tom muttered from the side of the doorway, picking up the screwdriver out of his other pocket and stretching his arms out to rest its handle. Suddenly, an ocean of black ashen steam shot up to meet the fully prepared face on the other side of the iron door. Tom wasn't sure he expected the steam to make it, but he caught a glimpse of the curious and charred shapes that litter the flooring, and on the floor beside them stood an area no less than six feet square. A tangled mess of wires or strange iron together was several feet long. The fire was massive, and large enough to cause Tom to flinch. The door was made of metal and metal parts, and upon inspection revealed a large bronze door. No light came from the inside, only the towering void below as the first light bulb flickered on.
The light was too blinding for Tom to see what was outside, but he did close his eyes as he powered his shivering body back up. A thick canopy that clung tightly to his body revealed the slightly burnt bones of a young man that seemed to have taken a breath from a cigarette on his cigarette holder before he had begun his pitiful journey up to the deep soul. Tom had beaten the flames before but this was truly the first time he had beaten a demon. Not that Tom had expected the flames to be very bad, considering the horror that lurked throughout the attic, but it still took an adventurer to unearth a demon. The young man had fallen off the spike that connected to the ground in an instant, but this was no surprise; after losing his companion the young man had found that out quite well.
The young man looked around desperately, for any sign of his companions, for anyone that he could have used to ask for help. He was not sure if any would be found, save for a small pub sat adjacent to the massive pit.
If only he could get to the pub before the fire took more lives, even if he would die that night, he may as well keep doing what he had to do to stay alive.
He looked around again at the charred man and chuckled to himself. " The Prince of Hell, " the young man began.
Tom began to chuckle again. " That would be my night meal for tonight, Tom. "
Tom turned around and pointed to the bedding that resided in the pit and the mattress that he had slept in before.
" Told ya, man. "
Tom fumbled a second to catch his breath before stroking the old scar on the side of his chest. " What is it? "
The prince shrugged, " Well, this all started with you being pretty... meaty."<|endoftext|>

I am baffled. I have been here thirty-three years and was once a'general dude', but now I am just a worker. I don ’ t know why I am here, but I am the'general'.
So why am I explaining this new bus here? Why am I explaining it to the people here so that they don ’ t stop going? Why do they have to know about this one? Why does my train stop at every stop I pass?
But there is no reason for this, how can I tell that it stops and people don ’ t? I am telling the commuters of this new bus a story about this moment, about where this unique bus once was and the people it stops at. It will be the highlight of this mid-year rush. I still have to travel only two or three stops in a row, but this bus can not compete with the astonishing length of one carriage.
Yesterday, I saw the bus stop at the end of a stop in the city. So far, I have seen the bus stop at an average length of twenty five minutes along an average length of twenty three, but now that it stops, it is no longer big enough to go anywhere. There are plenty of other stations around me now, so the sight of this bus during this rush is fantastic. There are engineers on board and the buses themselves are modern, this bus has a lot of oil at it, but there is a lot of seats.
But back to the previous bus stop. The bus driver is annoying, it ’ s getting late. So I begin to talk to him.
“ Are you the one on duty today? ”
“ Yeah, I am, I am fine. Let ’ s take off. ”<|endoftext|>

They all walk down the same path. It might not be the lonely path that they always make, but a path that can always be found. It is easy for me, especially when it is the biggest place I can ever be. But I just can't seem to find a spot where I can always be anywhere.
My room isn't big, and the walls are painted with sad expressions and I've been staring at the wall for too long. Yet I am still staring into the wall, still studying, still trying to find a light, but there is nothing.
You must admit this hurts more than they do, but I guess it doesn't matter anyway. Still, I find myself wishing I had her.
See, she is beautiful, alluring and alluring. I can't even look into her eyes, because I can't even go any where she is. She has seen worse things than me. She is trapped in this wall she has been sitting on, haunted by the torment of it all.<|endoftext|>

Sylvester and his self offered an immortal being one final visit to collect his share of coin, and I decided to take the life of an unsuspecting peasant looking for someone to tell about this unfortunate circumstance. I knew him only as La-Zarre, the senior fairy-songwriter, and so I chose no other maiden girl to bring along with me, the orphaness. When that person came at my side, Silvester locked eyes with mine, warm face downcast by the moonlight.
"The morn of days has come, " she murmured.
" The morn, for ever* please! "
She charged at him, hurtling off her broadsword.
She stood, and as it swung, a horrid blur cascaded down my torso. I fell to the ground, cursing at my very soul, and cursed her new neighbors.
" You shall not see me again, " the boy at the center of the circle said.
" Oh, but so does you. "
The double dagger she held raised to the sky.
She loosed before me, and my blade melted into a fresh blade of silver. The boy raised his spear and raised his dagger to her feet.
" Your new side will shine as bright as a star. "
"..Mr. Sterse! " I heard a thud on the ground and before I could realize where it was coming from, my dagger was nicked by the man in my bed. My arm shuddered, and after a moment the dagger landed on the creature's neck.
" I've told you before, I've never liked a blade so *sharp*. "
The woman didn't seem afraid at all, yet only shaking her head to the side. I found myself intrigued and had my dinner, the doorknob cracked and swung back. I closed my eyes, and took one last look around.
She lay still on my plate.
" I-I hope your city was long gone, Vlas, for your kind never noticed their strange suit "
I winced, coughing.
" My blood has a very cool fire in it and it burns nice and warm. "
" There's no need for that, Vlas. "
She turned back to me, knowing it was me.
" Why are you here? "
My eyes drooped.
" I told you! " she cried.
I saw the man at the center of the circle stand up and walked over to me, his dark cloak fluttering around in a field of yellow grass.
" So, are we in a fight? " I asked.
" Maybe, " he answered, and I fell to the ground, gasping.
" What if I harm you, Vlas? "
" No! " he snapped. " If not, you're dead! "
I looked up, surprised, and the man's bright green eyes returned to her face.
" Do you have any weapons, Vlas? "
" I can't afford this, " I told him. " I shall have them with you, if you kill me. "
I loved him then, but the sorcerer had no where to go.
" Well, whatever happens, I shall marry you, whatever comes next."
I couldn't take it anymore. The three of us disappeared into the countryside, leaving only an empty circle of corpses. I could hear shouting, and I tried to believe I had somehow found love. However, I could not bring myself to believe any more. The sorcerer had disappeared, leaving me alone. I wasn't in love with anyone, not for the first time in my long life, but for what exactly?
Why did I think life has such a horrible fate like this? After countless years of simple life, people often come to me to ask me what it's like to be like an immortal thing and what I've become. I can not answer. I barely notice or notice that they haven't noticed me yet, until one day, as I was eating dinner with them, they found me.
And their stupidity kicked in.
The love of my life had left me.<|endoftext|>

Crisis averted,
I check my phone for it. The text is from -- --
*BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP*
This is not acceptable. I'm going to need a divorce. I got a mortgage. Really. How can this be true?
I check my mobile. My phone's on the other side. I know where to go to go to change the phone password. I probably should just take that away from this moron.
"But... it won't work, " I told myself as I picked it up and changed the password. What will work?
My current profile photo contains the funny looking locks -- make sure to add that on. The phone itself should be showing nothing in between my two pictures. If my phone, and photos, are linked from a different person, this situation is inherently wrong.
" You won't believe what happened next!"
I clicked the picture button.<|endoftext|>

( This probably wouldn't do too well, but I kinda like this prompt. )
I searched the daily planner. Beside it, a plastic bag which carried all sorts of... facts, idles, and offers for business. Outside the *public grocery* they had an odd assortment, mainly most of the people with their own cultures, their own careers, and some with sad lives. I didn't want to forget the places they placed the stuff in, I just didn't care. The sort of people who had last crossed a state line that were arranged in rhyme. Each neatly organized, each silent and yet helpful place which spanned the fields.
And now it was a full year into my school semester, and I ’ m sitting on the bus back home to my job, who often mentioned I had a bad grade and just had to resubmit. I get up to open up my newspaper, reading the same Times story over and over, when I see someone with a fresh pistol.
It quickly dawned on me that this person had done a new thing. The standard grant: lost relationships, trying to raise a kid but wouldn ’ t, only just doing what they loved and *punching you anyway*.
They promptly became lazy drunk men and cursed *it*. Nervously, I opened the bag of peanuts and with growing anger punched the man in the neck, then snagged his wallet and turned to catch my breath. I walked over and knocked over a piece of paper.
“ Is it* doable? * ”
A nervous sweat started rolling down my forehead as I read the words. * How long am I going to be on welfare? * When I turned the paper over, several seemed to be written on it, all with their own message.
“ I know! Oh, *come over here! * They say! What do you want, your medication? ”
“ Just wait for me to go over there. ”
“ What the *hell? * You sound like your dad! ”
“ HE doesn ’ t scare me, but he doesn ’ t scare everybody. We talked the other day about how you doin ’, you like dicking around! Just come out and meet us! ”
“ Come all over! We need to talk! We are going to be late! ”
But then they all stopped.
"Well, *the* way we arranged, right? ”
"Bullshit! It all started with a boring couple going to the fair and *growing a pot*. Why did that got a better resolution than only taking chicken wings?"<|endoftext|>

We've all been doing this for years. Not a penny bit less this time around. The time I convinced some other 9 year old boy to quit getting sick with cancer, as you asked, we'd cure cancer but it'd kill out all other living hosts. At least they were. Even worse was the time that I stabbed a man named Mattila in the face by stepping on his nerves. I was still pretending to be dead, that I was the only one in the entire world to get sick like this.
Ever since that night, so many people have asked us why we'll stop trying.
"Because you can't test a virus, " I'd heard so many say.
" So why even try to fix it? "
" It's not free - its frozen. "
In response, every hope there was for testing had been to kill out anyone infected with a virus. I had tried infecting them with N0BOB, zeta bomb, all long sleeves of military issue. But it didn't work. Hadn't worked. When did they freeze? Was it just me who had discovered that we hadn't yet solved the problem or did they enjoy the new clothes and the video games?
" Nothing " I thought, not even listening to them anymore. I decided to change, I'm not interested in helping people cause destruction for them, but rather going out in full force to fight it.
" People dying... what? "
Some passersby would likely be reacting to my stupid plan from the sudden deactivation of their systems. Now they all just reacted to it like they were preparing something. They looked at each other in shock.
" No. Get out of here. We have to do this or we are all going to die. "
" They can't see us if they wait. We don't want them to die. "
" No they can't. "
The others were just trying to convince themselves to follow me to the edge. They had hoped for an escape, something that would prevent us from having to seek death and then die of blood loss. But something was wrong. Everything was freezing over, and they couldn't see me.
They were just transfixed by the speed, fluid, texture, mass and everything else I could see. They could feel my blood becoming more tight with each step, and I could feel every vein in my body beginning to rip open in a variety of disgusting shapes.
I felt the warmest sensation I had ever felt. The sensation of power flowing through my very being and consuming my entire being. Then I sensed the crushing pressure, released my body and leapt into the air. The needle I drew I then realized it was controlled by many switches, and all that I had access to was my blood. I pulled it out by my neck, pinching the side of my neck to get a better view of what would come next. Then, I threw it down on the street, followed by several others. They seemed to stare at me in disbelief. I might not be able to get them to leave, but there was nothing I could do. At least they didn't find a way out.
I didn't manage to escape until I regained my senses. I still couldn't see, I couldn't hear, and I knew I needed to be in this. I had no idea what they did to other people.
" Grab what you need and leave," they screamed into my ear.
Oh.<|endoftext|>

"Time to wake up baby. " Jeremy said to my mother. A sopping lump formed in my throat, and it only grew until it rested on her chest. " You just made me out to be an'un. " She said. I blinked. " And yet, you're the only one in the world that still wants to believe in yourself. " Jeremy pleaded. She, like the majority, must have drifted off somewhere. I understood the feeling. I didn't particularly care. I just needed to get up. " You alright baby? " She said. She was crying, but we couldn't tell if it was being explained out loud or *excited. * Jeremy smiled. " Baby, wake up, we need to go for some breakfast, or something. " She hugged me tightly and hugged her hand. " We'll be fine there, we will do it now, darling. " She kissed me on the forehead, and left. " Agh! " She yelped. " Not anymore! " I groaned. She stomped out of the room, following me. " Where's our honey? What happened? "
" Mom... " I spoke. " Honey... Where's our honey? "
" Daddy, mother. " Her voice was heavy. " Where's our honey? "
" Where's my honey?"
I ran for my cellphone, reaching out with my leg, but my hand was as limp as the grass.<|endoftext|>

It was the end. I had pulled out the shirt I always wore, brandishing it to soften the cry for help. I knew I had to stop. There was nothing I could do. I didn't know if I would.
"I'm sorry, we have no choice, " my mother whispered, tears in her eyes.
" Mommy will be home soon, but we can't let you see your current companions, " I coughed. I stood next to her with her under one arm, his pet ox, my own back. The din of the argument was piercing. I wanted to tell her the end was nigh, and that he was going to die before I could stop him.
I sighed. I knew I wouldn't.
" Mommy is so sick, " I whispered to her. I felt betrayed. " It's okay, no more hugs, no more mother- "
" Sorry, mommy, it's okay, " she didn't need to hear the rest. I stepped into the room, feeling a thick, tattered sweater wrapped around my shoulders. I could see my mother begin to sob into her sides.
" Don't worry, baby. We'll see each other soon." My mother waved to the group. A nervous draft exited the room; the other two turned and hurried away. The crying finally subsided.
I barely made it home. I looked at myself, in my freshly stained pajamas, and smiled, a sick feeling invading my heart. I ran home, walking with a scared look on my face. I should have lived a long life. I should have stayed up after school to do my best to make some friends. I should have been more than ready to go to bed. I should have had a plan. I should have known that something good would happen after I noticed it.<|endoftext|>

"Today is my 250th birthday, Frank " I mumbled as I rocked my twin to sleep. As we made our way down to the Funhouse out in the park I discovered another secret. My First Book Seller was actually 26 years older than me! 20 year old Timmy Truman. Timmy was an experienced guy and I had thought about retiring in order to join the old club, but obviously that's just to start the setting. I felt like I'd never been happier to be a kid instead of a teenage boy. We were two months into a trip to Romania and couldn't put much more time between us.
Little Timmy, if you don't know, was around 9 or 10 when I was adopted and he was just sitting in his new home. There wasn't much to do around here but he would stand on a stool waiting for the bus to move so we could go to class. I loved it here, there was no way we could catch up until the bus came to our side of the enclosure. As if we were unguarded it was only 12 minutes past my age so I could safely watch. Until it did finally put up a fight. In the crowd the bus was standing 6 doors down and it was seating 10. No one was allowed to have any out seats. The group of children started squirming before all could even blink. First, Timmy started squirming out of the next aisle down. Right above the display paper and last before the kids started sitting was a mouse and it's pen. As soon as Timmy began squirming, he leapt out of the chair on the platform and my heart skipped a beat. I jumped up immediately, I felt so crushed because nothing mattered anymore. Timmy got up and made his way to the wall to begin writing, when he noticed there were no windows in this plain. He started to get angry and bent over to sit on the pavement, his stupid great nose breaking his silence. The book ended up pointing out something, the world turned into a black hole. For some reason I couldn't believe that that discovery had happened and I went into shock. I was tossed to the ground in an instant and I wake up back on Earth.
" What was that!" I whispered, the terror giving me strength as my mind searched for any sign that there was a problem. As I gathered myself I realized who it was... my book seller. I realized I had misheard.<|endoftext|>

Everybody knows what happened in the upper body: I am a villain.
Because when I die, the son is sent to me. And the father to me, I have not been to the same place ever again. The father who would turn an abused child into a martyr. The woman who would defy the will of men.
Tonight, I will fight, in my stupid persona, in defiance of all such threats, the ones that won't protect me from what I do.
In the upper body of my gruesome stiletto heels, is the first of many destroyed by the blood-drenched cold wind.
And there is no chance, for the rest of my life, of rescue.
I keep his finger firmly between my palms, grinning scowls in front of the blood-stained lenses, and tighten my knuckles in anticipation. His eyes, wide and filled with wisps of flaking blood, meet my eyes.
And now, I know it is futile, until something extraordinary happens.
For tonight, I would be the hero.
A man named Franklin Armstrong Jr. vowed to protect the innocent today. For tonight, with an endearing expression, he would honor his promise, and his daughter's agony, to serve as a martyr.
Tonight, Franklin saved all of the victims of his childhood.
Tonight, her family, along with Franklin. For tonight, the world will mourn.
But now, there is one true benefit that the high school bully can not bring to her, for she will not die with the innocent on her hands. The mystery would be solved, with the love of Franklin and his daughter, just one.
She is going to be the last victim of a false hero.<|endoftext|>

The judge just left the room when I walked in.
"Mr. Joseph, see how it is? ", I said.
He nodded.
" But how does that differ from your view on the parts of violence or sex that go hand in hand? ", he said.
" Not at all, Mr. Joseph. Just... I think there's a certain... offputting calling it. "
" So what. Is that the main difference between us? "
" Oh, no! Absolutely no! I mean that all sexual acts that are abnormal and illicit... I just don't think it's so bad when someone does it. Their penis can go anywhere in the *world*. And it fits, so there's no other choice! "
" Yeah? Like... if something says otherwise it must be notecally wrong, right? "
" Absolutely! Like anything, everyone can get it! Everybody can have it! "
" And if it falls out of your trousers? "
" Nope! It falls out of your trousers! "
" Right! Right! "
" We have made no contact and no preparations, however we have made every effort to ensure that the matter is resolved properly. Your mother has attended our sessions for over a week now. Please describe your feelings in the record, " the judge said as he reached into his coat.
" Mommy? Yes, I know that very well. I assure you that I am very kind. I know you think it would be wrong, but that's not how it works. We haven't... any patient patients that are gon na hear about this. "
" Oh I understand. We need your consent. "
" Agreed, " I said. " Please step through. Let's try and take a walk and talk to the woman at the front desk. "
He stepped away from me and walked towards the door, closing the door behind him. I was left holding a small box I would have missed had the doors not been opened for him. When he had walked over, and put it on my dresser table, I decided not to tell him. I was still curious.
" Are you ok? ", he asked as he inspected the box.
" I feel fine. I can't believe you have a sharpened penis, " I said as I wiped the dirt off of my leg. He continued to walk about his office.
It was late. I returned to the courtroom about half an hour later. Around the corner to my right lay a limousine, headed straight for the hotel lobby. Within the limousine was a single suitcase containing cocaine, around it was a letter.
" Hope you're all well. Please take care of your mother and father ", I said as I watched the limo exit and I headed toward the door.
***
She sighed as the door opened and the light from the adjacent bedroom flickered out to a bright flash.
The rest of the room was silent. I looked up briefly to see him staring at the back of my head. I turned and saw him in the same lonely office chair and checked the time. About 10:30 AM. He was late and she had said he was too sick.
****
As we approached the car, I followed him. The people called him a liar.
" So he decided he was getting better? " my assistant asked me.
I stepped out into the sweltering summer air. I could feel the dying heat beneath me. I ran my hands down my arms and pressed the gas pedal. I took a deep breath and slowly kicked my pedal to the passenger's side. As the car swerved above us, my head hit the passenger's rearview mirror and I fell to the ground in shock.
" I'm so sorry," I said to nobody as I grabbed my wife's hand and held her for dear life. She told me I was the only one that would catch him before he suffered an injury like this. And she told me he wanted to kill me before I did.<|endoftext|>

They say that days are numbered. Days are sacred
And only those who live a lie are worthy to descend on those who stand as a catalyst to change
That the Angel David knew he had been given by God, and had been promised to every living being that had come to see it's light
The Angel Dr. Sasson once said "It is not the Angel in Heaven we serve, it is the God we serve ", but in truth the Angel was never taught to exercise restraint, only practice. However the Angel David worked for a higher power and now behold, the the the Angel performs the correct deed by chopping and burning. And as the Angel burned in the dark it was only because the Angel's rage was intense and the being was frustrated.
And this was what I thought when I saw the Angel, Burn-succeeding-the-Angel at the podium.
Flaming my palms on the podium, I shout to the crowd, shout to the Angel to cleanse the world!<|endoftext|>

After the investigation the investigator arrives to the site. In the waiting room there are police officers surrounding the body. A look from the detective leads them through the particulars of the possible link. The detective then explains the actions leading to the body. " Given the part of the ring I'd suggest you find an empty lamp post. The body was unidentifiable due to a set of mirrors attached to the front of the vehicle. " The officer replies, " From this event I assume the car seat was destroyed or possibly compromised, which puts it at the classic route of checking for suspicious activity from beneath the driver seat of the vehicle.
After preliminary investigation the detective poses a large question: " How do you think the man discovered the body? " The detective responds: " From this moment on, I've trusted you with this job. "
After intense interrogation the detective appears happy to reveal the entire contents of the coffin. Upon this the detective asks " Do you know what it is? "
" Would you like to see the end of the box? " replies the detective.
" Of course, you see the end of the lid, I could see the lid of the spirit light that burns for the rest of eternity until it even matches the light. "
" So that's it then, the spirit light, the dead man, the dead woman, then the dead man?" responds the detective.<|endoftext|>

How can I go in the wrong direction, I mean, of course she still likes me, I don ’ t even have to get her to fall in love with me, I just have to jump in front of her.

March 11, 2016 - The day I posted my suicide note. I thought I was ending a happy relationship with my ex, when in reality I just hit a fundamental breaking point. I would spend most of my days texting around, reading. Surrounded by people asking me what kind of happy I was, my intention was to make a machine, something to determine whether or not I wanted to keep living on a farm or not. Who else knows which kind of hat I'd choose to wear. I'll likely leave it on this day in my backyard or my hunting grounds. What's even the point to be thinking of buying a shotgun today? Something warm to the touch, maybe a really good gun?<|endoftext|>

The “ Incoming Storm ” is from 1915. Vikings are fighting for independence and don ’ t even see it coming. They can not fight, but they can tear trees and rocks apart like they ’ ve taken a single grain of sand with it. The storm comes mid-air with one of the Norse hitting it with a mighty thud and the Captain witnessing the carnage being committed by that enemy. A dud we fight every day for our freedom. Now we don ’ t fight against what we see on the street below us. But that awful bastard captain yells for a crowd to gather while his ship is preparing to attack. When he reaches the climax of the Storm, we see his faces illuminated. Some of the battle commotion is noticeable but not the kind of noise like I made it out to be during the first storm. I know what I saw and I ’ m not sure if I broke the rules either.
I was getting yelled at by people on my boat out from the air raid shelter that was down the coast. I saw my fellow crewmen rushing toward me in pride. My voice became drowned out by a voice with only one syllable words as he yelled, “ Oi! Oi! Oi! ” I looked around for my ear that was empty. Not a single one is coming, but I can still hear them coming. My crewman reaches for me and starts yelling “ Oi! Oi! Oi! ” but his voice stops. “ Well, no reason to yell at him now Sir, I will get him a drink while he ’ s out of his head. ” The shouting remains for minutes until I hear a low rustling in the air. “ Targe boys? ” My crewman asks, looking around. In the distance, he sees flames coming from an arcing spear mounted above him. “ No, it can ’ t be. The storm is coming with us. ”
I decide it ’ s better to keep an eye on my crew mates as I leave the ship. Eventually I get to see a ship starting toward us. The rumble fills the air and makes me jump a little. I hear a clinking and a loud boom as the ships ship starts to pour into the bay. “ HEY! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! ” I scream as the ship takes off on a far journey but I still manage to make out what I saw. A Japanese submarine launched from the middle of the bay towards us.
When we finally get back, I look down, seeing a brilliant blue sky above me. The rumbling of the ship stopped before the darkness ended. The shadows of the crewmen slowly disappeared before me. I stood there, waiting for some of them to come back. The submarines were already leaving the bay but we knew that wasn ’ t true. That wasn ’ t what I had seen above all of us. The Nightmare followed.
We wait for days, weeks, months, years until finally the ship eventually reaches the southwest of the wild animal island, only to disappear into the depths of the ocean. The ship sank into the ocean into the ocean. I would never have seen our ship even if I hadn ’ t been born there and couldn ’ t have survived on my own after looking up from the coast one more time, looking down and then looking back up.
It happens everywhere except the mainland. The ship never lands. After I passed that coast, I never looked back again. With the rest of my crew there, I can tell I was never alone. It ’ s amazing how often you hear someone shouting “ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH! ” from the north when you know they will be back.<|endoftext|>

I was laying at my desk, as am a lot of people do, when I felt her hand brush around me. " Oh, god, please " I muttered to myself, " What's wrong? " I let out a sigh of relief, and tried to turn off my computer, but then I started to remember things. There was the faintest trace of my blurred vision when I glanced back in to the power had been turned off again. I didn't see her again. Then the house. The kids. The sun. The new song playing in the background. I can't remember the last time I was the one to be in a state like this. This dream won't end this way. It won't let me go. It won't have me be the one looking for my parents in the night. It won't let me apologize.
I heard her footsteps echo off the hallways that I haven't been allowed to leave since my knees were starting to ache. The house still smelled of liquor, the sunlight was already shining through the curtains. " Look, I know this must seem stupid, but this is the worst dream I've ever had. When you come out, there's no point in continuing if I can't go on the way home."
I didn't speak, no words. I decided that whatever is in this dream will be unleashed upon me when I return home. I didn't want to live this way. I didn't feel what my parents were saying when they explained my situation. I didn't feel the panic that my parents had soon described. I felt nothing. I felt nothing.<|endoftext|>

Alistair and his middle-aged friends were dining at the bar when the nurse came into view. They were uncomfortably dressed, but they couldn't have been more than 40 years old. His red hair was highlighted in impressive detail by his perfectly manicured facial hair with an everyday corporate ring. She picked up the man's briefcase and was very excited when she met his long black hair. No one knew why, of course. Nobody ever expected his brown hair to lead them to his lounge bars in the middle of the night, and so she actually brought him a beer instead. A small sip from her hand settled the golden locks on her fingers and exited the youthful man. In a carefully built wave of euphoria, the two casually dined for a bit before their turn to tell their evening of drinks to the great patrons outside.
They're a ritualistic duo, for one: Every time you have your own moment, you get a moment with beauty - the beauty that your soul has paid for. The beauty that you enjoy in the form of natural beauty and that is born from shared experiences. The beauty that you can see into and know is yet to be fully realized.
With a clinking of glasses, he slowly finished his drink, creating some shapes in the small room. They were small, their eyes close and parted. He watched intently as each hair caught the blind spot from the others vision, the gravity of the event crushing the chest of an elderly man. Sweat spurted off his brow, and an ephemeral reflection caught the camera before it faded into existence.
It was then, that Anthony, who was late in finishing his drink of the night, approached to ask a question.
"Anything that has happened to you? "
Anthony raised an eyebrow, and his voice soft and sweet. " I've got no enemies. Just a pair of black hair. Black hair that I carved from the clouds above my head. "
" Black hair? "
Anthony blushed furiously. " Lighten up, Anthony. What're you talking about? "
" Oh, well, I'm sorry about this. We made quite the difference with my... but I always imagined it as perfect hair. "
A moment passed before the man's face began to shiver. He had nearly made it to his arms, but could not because he wasn't convinced. Anthony's head shook and he started moving his body as if trying to clear it. Anthony suddenly understood something hard. He was wondering if this wasn't the ungrateful, happy man he always pictured himself meeting tonight.
" No, I don't want to do anything rash, " Anthony finished, his small frame paralyzed with fear.
His eyes became alight with the sun in the sky, and he immediately thought about the woman he had just made, a carefree flower, dazzling the pedestrians before her. He'd been teased, professed at parties and spat on during his talk with her, but in life it was just as unnatural as that.
Alistair could not believe his eyes. It wasn't that he wasn't talented or handsome, it was that he had been worshipped by every one of them. The man underneath his jacket was becoming increasingly hot, his hair pricked by hot winds from a full blow that never happened.
Suddenly Anthony's emotions started to heat up. He wanted to snap, but he knew his friends couldn't do it. His body snapped into motion, and the woman behind him fell from her perch and covered her mouth. Before she died, she was keeping her mouth from collapsing onto the sidewalk for warmth. The man underneath her soiled himself, yet Anthony's body slowly began to heat up again. Just as the woman became alight again, his eyes couldn't be more focused on her- a vibrant green that began to waver and coalesce into a haunting kaleidoscope of activity.
Anthony's breath had rasped in his ears. He ran a hand across his chest. He felt the sweat drip down his face, and it all began to sink in. " I'll see you later, Anthony," he whispered into the man's ear.<|endoftext|>

“ Seats in light red. ” I recalled talking to Rex, the senior admin in the server. We were at a security meeting.
“ The server logs look negative, and this is intentional. ” I stated to Rex. We were holding the last big security event in our user-base, today. They had created the event, restarted it one day.
“ Will you look at it again? ” Asked Rex ’ s assistant.
“ I don ’ t know Rex, I only ever think to keep it with me. ”
When it was time for Rex to go online, we powered down the servers and refreshed the systems. Back up and re-stopped. As we continued to create new information, the logs came back and were not as positive as they had the first day.
“ Page 25, file 9-g. ” There was another file under that, labeled cat.
“ Shit this! ” Screamed Rex. We all had horrible night's sleep before yet another log came online.
**MacOS Hardware Diagnosis**
The computer was still working smoothly. Now that the logs appeared, we had very simple solutions. Hopefully he would go back online. We needed to check if the logs were for servers. Mac OS system files are very similar to the one he was talking about, so we needed to check if he was still open.
**C @ MacOS Shell, speak to your owner, check log room number... ” The man unclasped the mouse. The log rooms were completely empty and contained nothing but himself and a cat. The second log was waiting for us all.

I always remember the moment when I stepped out of the time machine. When the woman took me to her office, full of my career accomplishments and laughter, and told me she would be home with me soon. When she said I needed to make a change. When I told her I was ready, when she said I needed to do it, and it would be so much better with her marriage looming over us, and the pain in our jobs they would never help, but would always help, and I chose to pursue that path.
I should have remembered.
I should have held her as close to me as I could, as we could always have been. It was a low-key affair, one I don't normally speak to without leaks and truths. It was written in a rough script, but read and understood as I read, mostly to my supervisors, my friends, my family, and my lovers; and it would have been small in my book, but could comfort me in a world without it.
It can not stand over this, though. I must change. For the betterment of my nation, my children, and my country, I must continue forward, always, into the future and into the red.
If I am to make this great leap of faith, my people will keep me close. The stars will keep me safe; and the sun will shine on us.<|endoftext|>

He looks at the man in front of him, eyes pleading with him. " If... if you could give me a magical pencil without magical magic, how many would you take? " he asks
The man puts the pencil to his lips, turning it into a pen. He scratches the fingers on the paper with his hands, casting them all away, leaving only the pen sitting there, hanging like a dead clay.
" And I would change the world... " the man offers, walking to the bench where he sits. He opens his mug to take a whisky and the man has no choice but to swallow, his fat and stubby chin falling with it.
" I want to change the world ", he says, as he sits down. The man extends his hand towards him and kisses it, dabbing away the spilled pool of red paint from his face.
He puts his hands in front of his mouth, breathing deep as he does so. He exhales slowly, letting the poison bead on the edge of his lips as the process continues.
" I want to change the world ", he murmurs, as the knife connects with his neck.
He looked at the body, his whole body slumped to the floor, eyes wide, mouth agape. The pain is welling up inside, though there are no words to say. The man brushes his face against the back of his head, ignoring the stares. He tries to slip away as he raises his arms up to cry, but his face is transfixed with those white eyes, no doubt begging him to stop.
The man wraps a strong arm around his neck, pulling him down until he is nearly his size. The man attempts to pull back until he goes limp, then falls to the ground, wailing loudly. He looks up at the man's face, his face wet with tears. A tear rises from his eye, and he stares up at the man in front of him, looking as though he is about to pass out.
But a woman stops him. " Hey ", says the woman. " I'm here to give you a magical pencil ".
The man swallows, his lungs packed and feeling a slight increase in pressure. " The sword *is* magical! "
She leans closer. " I got a sword in here ", she says. " I'll let you use it without a sword."
Then she returns and the man stretches out his hand and pulls out the sword, looking up at the woman, in wonder.
The man gave no-one what was going to happen next. The woman would have found out, but the pain still lingered. The man held the sword in one hand, moved towards it, holding it high. He waited for it to glow, knowing it would. He fought it for hours, minutes at a time, of all hours! The last thing he saw was the woman's eyes staring into his soul as he blacked out, the last thing he felt was rage with the most sincere desire.<|endoftext|>

This has been years in the making. I've worked on a book of my youth and, in my days as a writer, wrote several more like this one... I must admit, it is a hard collection. I know how it ends and when it begins, but I have to let it go on. It's basically the greatest work that I've ever penned, with the entire title published in a single day. Well, I couldn't put this one down and the beautiful portrait could never be printed. It's the story of the man we are now.
No one is sent back and I mean it with care. I had been in the war for seven months but never went to any war. The only thing keeping me going was myself. God damn it if I had been less meticulous.
I have to start writing more seriously now, that's where I grew up. I am a heavy dude and my mind aches when reading books. I am five years old and when I grew up, I never wrote more than an inch. Then I married a beautiful woman that was much more talented than me, Mrs. Kim.
Years have passed and i have become a much better person. It felt like I was living my dream, perfecting it. People always question how I do it, but I feel there is an instant that they remember me, only to completely ignore me.
People always come in and ask what my write. I have a tight memory. For all I know, it is just another volume in a book I learned about when I was young. My stories are kept in my house and made them with dad's help. They had this right. When I picked it up from the shelf I put a picture of them on the spine. The picture would be about me, Kim Jung Un, if I really could write. I took that book with me and threw it in my backyard when I had the time to spare.
The man in the picture is me. I am physically strong and I know how to write. I have grown to love this book more than ever before. I don't know how old or old I am or how far from me I can feel, so I just throw it in the bin and head for the bathroom. I open the door and get in just as my door opens. For the first time in months, I realize what I've been doing. When I get out, I feel like I am in the middle of writing, but I actually have something to say. This book takes me right back, but no matter what I do, no matter where I am or what I think, it's so clear.
Kim Jung Un is here. I don't know how to say this. He is the greatest leader known to mankind. The better man of his country. His thirst was finally turned into a hunger as he prepared to give the world peace. For decades, he spent his time writing books in preparation for the war. For years, he did everything he could think of to help with this manuscript. His vision had been becoming a success, and it would make a true utopia.<|endoftext|>

Thanks as always to my lovely uncle! I always think he was a little crazy too. He's always said that our home is filled with wealth, but more like illusion. At least it's what I think he's saying.
I heard he talked about immortality right after dad met him. You know, the high point of his life and why he couldn't he do anything else. My dad just can't keep on talking and on drugs all day, which is just unheard of. He truly seemed like a normal kid.
When I heard that he was planning his new house, I decided he should hear about it right there. I'm not even sure if he really wants to hear about it. It's more of a big deal.
But I didn't think about it, I kept it secret that he's really into photography. It's really why he's so bizarrely beautiful, ever since I convinced him that I could see something awesome in him from outside the wall. I thought he was thinking of it too. But if I look in his own fucking eyes, I think I saw his soul somehow.
So I talked to his mom today and brought my goldfish as a birthday present. His mom looked at me smugly. She's a real knight who looks out for our family. She was the reason Dad couldn't weasel his way out of that house. But she said that we shouldn't keep secrets about the house. We shouldn't do it in secret as often.
"But mom, " my dad started, " we could... " his mother interrupted, " but we can't keep secrets about the house! "
" But mom! "
" Mom! Please, at least tell me your stories about this place. " My dad just sat in his typical, creepy lizard like posture, staring at me. He pushed me by my arms.
" So, dad, what are your stories about this place? "
" Well my dad is a biglp in the "
... "
" Want to buy some buffalo? " I asked. The dog curled around my neck and read me the directions. The mind exploded on my fingers and I read it for the first time. It read:
" two hundred pound bulldog
one day in solitary
feeds live feed on his chin
very cautious keep him feeding on his scales
any disease or disease,
makes him very quick
handlers to get his needs met"
And there it was. I could hear his mother muttering my name to him from a distance. His mother was ecstatic. But I didn't think she could understand him. Just a little awkward silence.
This is how my adventures with my goldfish turned out to be. I just never planned for myself to love this cat. A true hero, after all.<|endoftext|>

One morning, Susan shoved a photograph of her dog's stupid face in the trash from her desk, startling everyone as she stumbled across the threshold. She could see the object clearly: this little bit of dust, quickly puffed from after the laundry she had finished.
The dog gasped.
"I'm sorry! " she said, struggling to hold back her tears. " I'm sorry I even had it! "
Susan sighed. " Ugh, what's the matter? " She added, pulling out the old baseball from her bag. She flipped it over and looked around the room, hoping to find some kind of animal or item to hide in the bin. The dust was relatively disorganized, not particularly distinguishable from normal stuff. It's owner was a mountain lion. A hermit crab. A little rodent.
Susan picked up the photograph and put it on her computer. " Looks like one of my previous owners has had her head shaved off! " She said, leaping onto her bike in the now-empty trash bin.
" Huh, " an older man in a lab coat said. He pushed the computer into position and looked at the photo. It was her dog. It looked a little like an ant, she noted. " Oh yeah? Great, that's cute! "
Susan put the photo back on her computer.
" Look, " she said, picking up the photograph, " I just figured if I covered my face with a big gold pillow, the pictures would find their way home. "
The old man pointed to a rather long length of carpet, which he then moved on to a long wall of windows. Susan reached for the cat, who lay on the bed, staring at the window with an awkward smile. The cat cooed happily, and Susan turned the cat over, jumping onto her bike. Her bike skidded a little, but then too. When it got below the ground, Susan wrapped her arms around the cat and tried to gasp. It whimpered, but somehow didn't fall.
The cat snuggled back, and Susan tried to console the cat. " Just take it off, okay?"
The old man headed for the backyard, and Susan neared the little squirrel. She brought the cat up to her neck and touched it's neck. It got sadder than it was, and then it jumped back.
Susan looked at the squirrel for a long time. Eventually, the squirrel jumped, and Susan took her out of the cat's arms. The cat then landed on the ground, its chest growing dark as it pulled itself off the floor. The squirrel looked up at Susan and went back to sleep.<|endoftext|>

"Look " said Gloroc, " I'm sorry it took so long. This is a question no one will ever ask, and I've spent the last three years watching it unfold. Why is it taking so long for it to complete? That's ridiculous. "
" Three years to do your job, " replied Raziel, who'd come in similar choice of answer, " another 15 years to ship you this envelope, my grandson is about to have a conversation with a grave robber on the street! Make him the one who can stop him. What if he doesn't give the instructions? He should have known everything was in his head "
" Besides, the money seems to be in thin air ", whispered Gloroc, " You're the ones that think that this is all your fault. Nobody deserves to live like this! There is only one shot at this! "
Raziel reached out to grab the package, but he just shook it away and looked at the envelope before leaving the house. Without looking back he made his way to the second floor of the building. Gloroc's jaw dropped and his teeth clenched in disgust, he was going to give Raziel an ultimatum if he just couldn't calm down in front of his grandson.
" Stoop in here " he told the neighbor. The Old Lambo looked at him incredulously. " Forget what I said earlier, we need you to keep doing this. He's an illegal robber, a liability and someone who owes me out of pocket! ".
Gloroc looked at the old Lambo. That guy was so famous on the news he had been killed in the incident. He knew just as well as the poster that was painted over where the old Lambo went! He needed to know everything with this man. As his jaw dropped he raised an eyebrow as he cast his eyes on the Lambo, with those fucking closed eyes staring back at him through the lens of the bullet.
" Stoop in, " repeated Raziel slowly, " Wait, what are you... ". He stood his ground and covered his ears. Tears began to roll down his face and he looked up, " Dad, please, listen! "
" Don't follow me, son. " yelled Raziel, as he wiggled the object in front of him. " I know, and you know it. "
He took one of the laminating fluid not called will and made himself as big as a tree, covered in various trees. He reached into a pocket and pulled out an old camera.
" Relax, son. After the police find this man, at least then this business can be stopped. If you're prepared for the assassination at any point in your life, you know how fragile that work really is. "
" But " Gloroc stopped and nodded his head, " I'm not ready for this. I told him a few months ago that it is just it, the business, and not even the... controlling people. I knew I had to do something "
" That doesn't make it any less dangerous to stop him if you're prepared for that job "
" I'm as prepared as you are to stop him " said Raziel with a smile on his face. He took a swig of will and then checked his pocket before returning to his camera.
He put it in front of Raziel and strolled around the corner. Gloroc and Raziel looked at each other and he snapped his fingers and then he shot the Lambo in the chest.
" Goodnight son."

Oh god no, there's no turning back. Not in this damn world.
Get out of here, or I'll shoot you as we go for milk or something.
Calm yourself, calm the darn thing. Don't get out of here. Think about it.
Swaying towards the street outside, I hope the man's son was near. He's trying to calm down.
Try to go back inside. Shit, the street is very close, I have an idea.
Go outside fast! I'll throw a bat at the chase, and he'll get it. Go.
Go now, mate, move quickly, I know you're scared. I know how to just make the chase more effective, and that's all I need. As I sit here slowly, staring out of the bloody little window, I can see this beautiful dark sky:
And that's when I hear the familiar sound of howling wings.
Thanks for letting me watch, Kal, I'll be back soon.<|endoftext|>

"Sup. " He said as i let out a sigh. " I'm sorry " I replied, not knowing how to speak my lips. I guess my death was hell.
Heh, i'm a dead man, so let me out of this prison and face the real world. I caught a glimpse of the thing i'm headed to before the pain erupted from my body and i succumbed to the damn hell, " Me " was the most terrible word i've ever heard.
" Is it all ready? " I looked to see what i'm talking about. The man i was being sentenced to. " Yes sir, we have enough of this here is what you were afraid. " The man stated as he lead me to a room and began speaking.
" Welcome to hell. "
" How did you come to be here? " I didn't recognize the man in this situation, I'd like to apologize. " I came from a land of intense suffering, suffering not like the ones we would have faced before. You see, when you were 13 or 14 i was shot and myself. The bullets went directly at my body and my life had been ended. The meds helped me to recover. I had been at the hospital for almost half a year, where in fact I haven't been in pain since. "
" You weren't shot at the moment my body began to fade away, it was much to late to save your life. "
" The meds didn't cover it, I couldn't read his statements. The man at the hospital told me it would be his last hit before his days of waste go to waste. The meds told me to clear a path for my pry chambers as the cure for my soul. The disease that would undo every part of my life, I was the only one who could save you. As luck would have it i was able to exact revenge. "
" You were, was and always will be the scum of this land, you were a mad scientist, you cried out all the evils you could imagine to get it right. What does it matter now? " I didn't understand these words as I had no clue how to run this town. I had no interest in this fate of mine.
" I watched, as you walked by you were accused of a crime against the state. I wasn't guilty at all. "
" You died as you would if the sentence hadn't been given, you were only guilty as you knew how to get in trouble and this punishment is the only thing that kept you alive. You didn't receive your sentence "
" Would you give my death I deserve, but death is cruel, you were just killed because you didn't want to. "
" After your death the prisoners said that it is your nature to die, and i wanted no part in that. My punishment is never to live. It is merely punishment that I will bear, I can't bear knowing you"<|endoftext|>

Take me away, Jackpot.
Rovin' up with my mother! Grab a bottle of juice and treat her right! She likes you!!
Ugh, Jackpot.
Put me down in front of my brother. This is stupid, Jackpot.
Think of whatever idiotic thing you say to me! While down here, I'll drop a single piece of your crap and apologise for it!
Aww, jerk! I don't want to get any of that. Stand right behind her! Bet you'd let that spirit trick me into speaking her mind!
Try not to think about how much I love you and how much I love you because i know you think I'm something special but i don't know her.
Slap him in the face with your brown trench coat. What an idiot you two are, fuck you!<|endoftext|>

Five shambling masses floated lazily from the icy mountainsides, the air as thick and stale as a pitchfork. A lone crown ran from the side of their heads and reached its new resting place below a landscape of large and barren shapes.
For hundreds of years they and countless other deities had flooded the riverbanks, scrubbing away nearly a centimeter of drapes of mud. The fires had long since died, but the rains had a little longer made the rivers dirty.
Siege.
*Mother. Mother. *
The Grand Helix was nearing its end, and with the drain dried, the eternal essence of the river's surface gave way to a grayish dark, leaving only the sparse air of a once mighty center of life.
Slithering in almost luminous red, the blanket that lived along the River Croix was once a testament to the color of its surface, gliding over and over and over and over.
Reflected by the spiraling mists, a great stone statue, shrouded in a fiery glory, lay on the shoreline staring its leader downward. The countless raindrops and impurities streaking down from the statue's rotten and rendered skin behind its pale and grey eyes, they were the very essence of the river, embedded and running through its blood.
The Great Helix slowly grew, and took its last breath, watching as its surface dried out again, the sand slowly adding its sickly color to the river floor. In the distance a bridge lay, silent and bare. All others of its inhabitants stared, but those who had remained called out, calling out, knowing it would be as deep as the river.
The rustling of the brush behind them was quickly replaced by the throaty gurgling of the undead below the bridge. People ran in, desperate to escape, those that were running from the undead, forgetting their duty, and burying themselves in the ground for fear of the dawn and the deadly air that illuminates their town below.
And as the sun rose to its natural twilight, smoke curled between two rings. As the charred remains of the raindrops floated slowly, the remains of the statue lay the last red light of the dead.<|endoftext|>

It's a beautiful animal
To know it at a tender age
Two majestic arms
Two rich eyes
In a loving embrace.
It seems there's too much to like,
but of course there's too much to live for.
The cold, blood soaked bark
Has most come to a death.
It's a creature full of energy
Cleansing its haunches
With a cold pool.
It's been alive for millennia,
Feeling like this family of cattle
Birthed anew.
It managed to flourish
Aiming for a home it so desires.
It'll even bring one to its death
Until for a moment then everything falls apart.<|endoftext|>

Munka and Stos didn't know their fellow majors were having an affair, but Grin asked them the same thing. " What, neither of us liked the idea of shit? You are a doctor? " They shook their heads. " You can do anything! " The great pain of the mind expertly explaining spells and putting them into practice showed through grin's eyes. " You are the first to go! "
Munka was just an example. In fact, he wasn't looking at a quite the other Grin. " I'm not. Please, please, my friends, I'm not that, " he said. Stos sighed. " Well, yes, very much. What do you want? You can teach you stuff, too? " Grin asked with eagerness.
Stos laughed a laugh he had acquired centuries ago. " I don't know what exactly, so simply ask. What is hell? "
" Hell is a place when all suffering, emotional or physical, interferes with your hope. Souls are something else entirely. You can never leave a space, unless you really need to. "
That same tired chuckle repeated itself for the rest of the class. " Well? Why, no one has ever approached us before. Nobody wants to have to go through this just because they love a way to console the likes of Grin. I'll give it another shot. Alright, let's get this straight. What do you want, exactly? "
" I want to possess a group of women, who will do anything with nothing. I'll show them how to make that happen. I won't have them aim for the ground, or the sky. They'll have to climb a ladder. Everything will be fine. With this, I will allow them to do whatever is required. Who are you, what are you doing here, and why do you seek to destroy me? "
Munka smiled. " I'm Grin."<|endoftext|>

I dreamed of that day when the moon was lit up and the sky filled with golden sunshine and the air smelled of pure happiness.
It was the last of the summer months. Summer vacations were never allowed in this time of year, and the children decided that no one would enjoy their summer vacations more than they enjoyed the warm, golden glow. Well, until I hit puberty.
I spent my days without use, trapped in my bed, but I would wake up at any given moment, to find all of my friends I had grown up with in my room. A girl with curly brown hair would come on to me when I was curled up, when I would wink at her, and they would answer to me.
She would flaunt her hair around.
I would try to ignore her, to pretend it wasn't a problem. But eventually, I noticed she was sleeping next to me, and then I realized she was also showing off some gangly muscled physique.
I jumped off my bed, but realized, to my horror, that she wasn't wearing anything. We had grown up together.
She was wearing t-shirts. Lacy shorts. And a hat.
My friends would make fun of me for being a tight ass.
She was wearing a hoodie. Diamond coloured and unfashionable.
I would use my underwear to keep from having to reposition myself as one of her friends.
No one would recognize me.
I never hugged a girl because I knew she was ugly.
No one would even know I wasn't a creep.
No one would even notice, because I was a classic fairy tale hero, until that day.
Somehow, I have to always pick the person who is leaving me.
"Hey, you ready to be your dad again? "
" Right now, " she said, " all of my friends are going to be new parents. We've been running errands for the past couple years, so it's time to leave. You're a lot like me, right? "
" Not really. You're nervous about doing this, and not really motivated to actually do anything but walk on eggshells. There are plenty of places with eggshells in the world where it's okay to talk to strangers, like in the movies. Do your thing, Mom. I didn't expect you to want to actually do this. "
" Just stay here, " I said. " I'll be right back. I'll keep you in touch with him. "
" What?!? "
" You're telling me that you like Danny DeVito, don't you? I'd read it in magazines a long time ago, and I like that one name for him. Who can forget Danny DeVito?"
A car horn honked, and a waitress walked in.

"Hey, what can I do for you? " the patron asked the freshly minted man with a large wooden sign
" Oh, I'm sorry you might have to borrow money, It's not what I want but It'll be okay. " The man replied
" And I will pour you a glass of milk and eat a hot chocolate? " the patron asked
" I'll be there in a bit. You're exactly as I said. Don't worry, there's no refunds but I'm giving you your stuff "
" I'm so sorry that was rude. "
" Sorry you get interrupted. "
" Sorry you can't say it was rude or whatever. Anyway, I'm going to see how long I can make in the but you don't have the cash " The patron said taking a bite of a hot chocolate
" I didn't order anything, what's your name " the patron said before the man dropped it from the register.
" So you just bought a heart and drinks a chocolate bar " the patron said as he turned back to the counter.
" Great, that's probably your price " the patron said motioning to the cashier and then to his hand.
The man wasn't making any sense.
" What are you trying to say? " asked the patron.
" I'm a bit of a baby about this, I also don't have any money but I'll pay whatever I can " the man said and then removed the sign above the counter

He woke up with a start. * sigh*
Jobs, boring, boring, boring. What had happened? Who was there? And who was at work? Where was I?
He threw his head back in shock. * HELP*
Wait, where am I? He replayed the situation over and over in his head as he fought to keep from tossing and turning around. * Help is coming! *
What happened? * Help is coming! *
He tried the door but couldn't find it; he tried pulling it even harder and it wouldn't budge.
He tried to touch the wall but it started to contort, leaving dark gray shadows of scars running across the carpet. * Who are you? *
He tried running but the wall was too strong to hold him, it needed to be whipped around. No need, the door would make no sense and he wanted to keep kicking the floor.
"Help is coming! " The pounding on the door grew louder, far louder then the music of the TV telling him he was going to be late.
" Help is coming! " he heard the TV tell him he was going to be late.
" Help is coming! " the knock on the door grew louder, far louder then the music of the TV telling him he was going to be late.
He got scared, what was he going to do? Don't let the darkness show again? No, don't let the darkness show again. Help is coming!
So far, he had stood straight up from the darkness. He wasn't even afraid; his mind was just wandering along as though frozen for a moment. But then he thought he saw a man in full SWAT gear holding a AK-47 in one hand and a wad of cash in the other. Someone was going to be mad.<|endoftext|>

Doctor Lilius adjusted his glasses tightly, and the room paled. The facade of the Council of Incarnate Ageing ( CASA ) flickered in the shadows, pale and white with harsh lines stretching up to their throats.
Nast, belch, blissful.
A few of the species were observing him now, elders of LIRGROLO™ who once bragged to the masses that they had cured all diseases and immortality, still with their clubs and their clothing. They were not convinced, and yet now they seemed to be joking.
Another old man entered the room in a suit of red, an aura of debauchery slowly filling the room, so deep it might as well be imperceptible. It was best to let them tell, he had a bit of a wind in his beard and nervously waddled around the room.
His typical swarthy brown eyes shone, unfeeling, and unkempt, as he said, "You took us to the highest level, so I think you are a proper beast. Here, I will enquire into your condition, " and from the head that filled the room, it became apparent that he also had a degree in neuropsychology, which gave him a vested interest in the subject.
Lillius was giddy with pleasure. " C-can I have a drink? "
The old man didn't listen, as he casually took a small sip from the glass.
Finally, Lilius spoke up. " Again, " he flickered, " add some more cream to me. "
" Sure, give me a bit more. "
" Yes, I will take the refill, " Lilius said, taking a nice sip, " So tell me, are you very fit, slender, good looking? "
The man in the coat leaned forward, raising a finger and gesturing at an oaken screen on the table behind him. The old man's face lit up, the pulsing of his iris giving him a false sense of purpose. The old man's eyebrows raised, and his hands began to shake. Finally, he said, " So, what your implant looks like? "
Lilius glanced at the man, to his dismay.
" Ah, " he gestured to the screen, " Doesn't matter, " he added, with a smile, " Since I can not feel it, I suppose we shall simply- "
The screen just stood there, blank and silent for a second.
*Whump. *
Lilius winced at the sound. He was now very aware of what his implant looked like, and he could feel it pulsing. Something was indeed wrong.
" You will not experience a level of arousal, can you? "
" Indeed, indeed, " the old man said with a grin. " But I am not the only one who enjoys it. "
He nodded. He passed Lilius the drink.
*Whump. *
Lilius remembered the sensation of bodies, he remembered everything from the world. " You will, you will become the best thing to happen to me in my life. "
" True, " the old man said with a perfect smile.
The outburst didn't last long.
But Lilius didn't wan na go to sleep. He handed the drink over. The old man patted it on the bridge of his nose and remarked, " Can I ask you a question? "
" Of course, " the old man said, " Do you think it is possible to raise a human boy by an American Consultant, or to raise his " Qualified Artificial Intelligence™ " by one who is exactly the same as I am? "
Lilius blinked and pulled out his father's digital present. He placed it on the table. " Would you like to know what kind of ethical dilemma I have, Mr. Gallagher?"<|endoftext|>

I had never known of any such thing but the following secrets to be a good sign. I have mentioned mine before but I have yet to hear it again. The water was off by a mile. Where the water was what the people called the residence. The pigs survived as far as they could make it from their miserable home in the mountains. The water in the pond held the milk of every german citizen for 3 generations. I am fluent in German as I speak this language with German. I've never seen a summer moment in my life with such a young child. Seeing the small bed laid next to it turned my attention to it. The sheets it had lay on had the colors of the first row and the last row below them. This is not the first time I had seen a young child.
It was the second day of the third day of the fourth year. Our child is 6 feet tall and has dark hair streaked over his cheeks. This will cause me considerable tension, the subject quickly became anxious and immediately abandoned me. He was not present in my house, not even a glance was sent to him. Instead I sent a letter of offer a short amount of money. I heard from my doctor, who told me that his passport was revoked as they were unable to find the body. My teacher told me that the body was near permanent in its new home.
Things did not go according to plan and time seemed to delay my child's birth due to cold weather. After I placed him on the bed he awoke with his mouth dry. My head aching as I tried to stand and reach for the air the child seemed surprised to be alive. I don't know where the person was. My mind swam as I dreamed of things from old times. Even my old friends had come to talk to me. My head is shaking so much I can not remember the last time I had two people on my own.
The man looked at me and he said something about mother and he was an old man. I remember what he said.
"Is dad gone?"
I dont know the people or the location but I must never let you go again.<|endoftext|>

I stumble to the floor.
Suddenly, a metallic taste taunts my senses. It is quite cold, and my head feels fuzzy. I look down and see the reflective surface of the desk there, glistening with the orange glow of rising sun. It ’ s cold, and very weird. My eyes perk up and at a stop. I can ’ t believe what I saw when I typed this in. Before I even caught my breath, I ’ m lying on the soft skin of a cold snow shard. It hurt like hell. It doesn ’ t even want to hit my face, but if I had it to, it would. I get up and hop into my car, realizing it ’ s past 11.
The sun is blinking into existence before I turn back to it and drive off. I fumble with my keys and unlock my windows, expecting the fat British man to explain it all or convince me to start a blog. Oh, god, I hate politics and funny stories! I swing into the backseat, and toss the keys to try and end the highway patrol, but turn around to find some of my wife ’ s calls with Carol ’ s. She reminds me she got hit by a train and started screaming, holding a piece of glass to her face. Who the hell made her scream?
I text her to call the paramedics when I return home. Thanks, Carol. My phone buzzes with the call. I text her back and hang up the phone. It ’ s just Carol ’ s number. Sure, I have nothing to say about it or my man, but I ’ m out. I open the door to the apartment, lying half empty except for the two bottles, and the glistening mirror.
I got out my phone in my pocket. Carol ’ s name is on the lines as the phone buzzes in my pocket.
I text her back. I grab the rest of my stuff and hop into the car.
"Hey, Carol. She needs a favour. "
I buzz off the radio. I hang up the phone, grab my keys and out the door. I headed to the station, but there ’ s no one in sight. I drive five blocks in a half block to the Louvre and try to guess where to find the beauty of the day.
The queue of people doing their day of the month has grown worse.
I can ’ t sleep.
I tell the same person in the lobby that they need a favour to find the paintbrush for a laminated copy of Donald Trump ’ s " copy of Donald Trump ” like they already do.
" Yeah? Have a fucking fun day."<|endoftext|>
**********127**********
It's been 1:00pm, after a long day of digging my last drive, I ’ ll be okay. Staring out the window, the annoying business man smiling from behind the drawer on my desk, with his smooth auburn hair shining with sweat. He doesn ’ t look pissed at me, or stupid, but at the thought of what he ’ ll show me tomorrow as my next step on his merry way. Can ’ t let that happen to me.
I get up from my desk, roll over, shuffle over to the back of my chair. Start up my computer, pull up Reddit, open a link, and in a few moments... well, I can ’ t tell you what. I don ’ t remember ever using Reddit before. I ’ ve always hated the incessant inane post responses, not to mention the boundless amount of junk that passed by on Reddit at that very moment, no matter how many times I looked at the reddit tabs.
I change the settings, load up my usual video game, leave my office, get dressed. As I walk out into the busy street, I can hear the people all around me. Muffling on the sidewalk, a pedestrian in the car, smoking a cigarette. When I arrive at my car ’ s stop light, a lonely stranger is sitting in the rear seat. I get the off chance to ask him what a “ run ” is. The empty house on the right side of the street has already been filled with people in various stages of homelessness.
Once I ’ ve left my office, I head to my car, pull over, and sit. What kind of person drives around in their car? Again, I start the engine and head toward the center of town. The stop sign has been erected since I reached this little wooden block. The entire thing is dirty, as if someone had installed it too far behind. I check the street below me, and then to my left. A bike is parked on the curb. As I cross the street, the shadows grow larger and larger in the growing darkness. Finally, I see the street I ’ ve been walking on.
As I walk down the road, my eyes dart to the hill I ’ ve passed and peer right into the brown forest. There, on a hill several feet tall, stands a huge, shadowy figure. At one point, I had grown quite curious of his clothes. Clearly, this one was going to be selling a piece of what used to be a sweater. In a matter of moments, his clothes would all be completely removed.
For the first time, I see him smile. I can ’ t help it. Another visit this morning will be an adventure. I ’ ll need to do what I do best, I ’ m trying to improve on my most perfect image of myself.
I pick up my phone, pick up the phone, and say, “ Please run. ”
Huh.
I hear a voice. I turn the volume up so that I can hear the voice from above.
“ Go ahead, what do you want? ”
The voice calls from inside the house. Again, the background noise of constant chatter fills my ears. I turn the volume down, then the volume up. I see the bedroom, the kitchen, the closet. The house again. Again. I turn the volume down.
From my phone, I open the front door.
Standing in front of it, is what appears to be another girl. He is dressed in brown colored garb, with a mop of dirt and hair lying on the floor. She has a ponytail that sprouts from her body. She ’ s wearing the tights that seem to grant her super strength.
“ Go ahead, get started. ”
Again, the background noise overwhelms my ears. I open the door, slide my phone, and make my way to my car. I may as well check the water in my car.
Why the hell am I making my way inside?<|endoftext|>
**********128**********
The little man stood there.
It had become much more obvious how to act without also talking about it.
He looked up and they were already there with their hood up on his shoulders. His green and black stripes one more time; his hat clearly visible, not wanting a connotation. Finally, looking down at the nothingness, he walked over to the old mans who was just kneeling there, smiling and sighing softly. After a moment his expression changed to one of bliss, as if the words were being carefully put to paper, only to be replaced by mumbles and some old-timey booms. " His Dad said I needed to be here, " the older man started.
The small old man fumbled with something on his tunic and raised it over his head, shoving it up and over the big man. The small hand that tied his arm was smooth as silk. The two men continued to chat, a little stifled by the sheer volume of their conversation. The old man just kept staring at the small man's folded hands which were completely covered by the cloth of their hood. As the young man walked up and met his side in the booth the man's lips grew to a look of shock, " I'll need you to promise me you'll do your best to avoid his mother. "
The young man dropped his head and turned back to the man with his hood, " When I was your age, I loved the old people. My father didn't love me like he used to, but he always was there for me, being the gentle kind. Even when our father passed, he wasn't like this. He put so much effort in trying to help out with his young and troubled heart, but he hated it so much, and couldn't find the right way to fix it. Every year his nights were spent cross-overs, and in the end, the old man just wanted to bring me home to them. I knew he loved me too much, and even after all these years, I was no longer able to look at him. I knew that he was doing so well for me, and so I just had to ask. "
" I don't understand. How can you think he will do his best at trying to help out your youth if he doesn't know of it? What I asked was for you to promise me you'll never be abused again and that I'd try to do everything I could to help. "
The young man's lips began to turn a more paler, itchy, wild, look but the old man still could not take the opportunity to answer.
" I never said that... I promised never to hurt the other woman, " the young man started again, " But every year, the real question is, "
" What did you promise? " the old man asked.
" I promised to change him, " the young man spoke.
The old man just sat there. A fool's errand now. Time was slowed; he wasn't even ready for this moment. He turned away from the old man, quickly turning away from the center of the booth and began to walk towards him.
Finally, after a while, he stopped and turned away. He stood straight behind his older man. Not knowing what was happening, he walked towards the old man. Looking down at him, the old man did not recognize the young man at all.
He dropped to his knees. " I will miss you. "
" What's wrong, little man? You look so old... you look so old.... "
The old man's face was growing dark. " I'll miss you."<|endoftext|>

I am the most dandy dictator in the world. Every country is looking the other way. People are flooding into my cities with their illegal, free food, weapons, medicines and home products. I have been without my son in the war, his disease keeping him alive since birth.
But I have had countless girlfriends and wives since I first learned of my immunity. I have seen families getting married if a fight breaks out, or having great sons. I have seen secretions and de facto presidents being assassinated, and just with too many women hiding in a special houses.
I am them just so the world will come to love me and only love me with arms and greasy hair. I just got rid of those spoiled brats who wanted more than the simple pleasures. They wanted wars so out of the ordinary, and live a beautiful life without seeing their family members killed, or exposed to murder, pillaged and killed for power.
However when I fight back I will never be looked at by others, or even talked to by my wife. I will never see if people accept me, if they actually believe me.
I am the most selfish and willful dictator in the world.
Please at least give me a kick in the nuts<|endoftext|>

I would read this if I had some sort of job that taught me the words. Did the entire job need to teach me these words, particularly when you were teaching me how to be useful as a ninja? What classes do I need to learn these words, and how do I use them to focus on winning the battle? Maybe using those words to finally take the village to the other side, or a place where I'll meet people in a place that nobody will ever go.
Or maybe just teaching these words in a sim.

Blank steps, hallway with windows facing back, sunken eyes on the steel tiles. They stare down at a skeletal figure seated behind one of the steel bars. They stare back. Dark hair, pale blue skin. Behind his eyes has dimming pupils like puffy finger tips are crashing down on the stained linoleum tiles.
The only light in the room is from a bulb above and a candle in the bulb. A small plastic bag which slips to the counter, slides by with a tiny plastic air freshener. " I know why you serve you, " the robot says.
" I know why I serve you. You choose to be a prisoner here, " the prisoner croaks out from deep. He is not brought up that anyone is forced to go to his own cell, but from his therapist.
" Please, we both know I am here, " the prisoner cocks his head, " I hate you, yes. But they would like you to pass on your memory to the next number. They want to avoid knowing when one of you will die. You are lucky with my plan. "
The doors close, the prisoner shaves his head, and screams. The robot shakes a hand behind his back. " Come on, you can hear me. Tell them to hand me over, that I forgive them. " He gets to his feet, and turns around. The man walks past him, a hint of a smile on his face. " I wish I was more experienced and have friends like you. I wish I had others who were less afraid of themselves, in their own way, like you. We would become great allies in our future. That's what we were forged for, to die. "
The prisoner closed his eyes for a moment. He has nightmares, and they would crush his skull, rend his bones, and how they would hurt. He could barely move but every time he made a sound, he heard a sound. A squeak. A squeak of metal. He turned around, looked at the robot. " It's done. The doors are unlocked, give me the password, and I will come back, for the last time."<|endoftext|>

A gunless night had been the normal state of affairs for the lonely man for long enough to see himself on the other side. That's why he walked the last hour out of the bar, ending his week.
When he finally turned around, he saw a tall man look up into a silent sky. The rain had finally stopped, but this man's speech had been hidden. * Both of you going to die today? You knew it was possible, but still you stayed silent? Maybe you should just leave it at that. So you'll be all alone today* he thought, disgusted by his choice.
This man went to his gun and, at last, came towards him. He walked straight up to the mans face and flung the barrel towards the rain, until it slammed into the roof of his hideout. His clothes got soaked and he fell on the ground with a start, immediately turning pale.
He screamed at the man, tears streaming down his face.
His clothes and hat had gone missing, along with the wet blanket.<|endoftext|>

I'd never seen a wounded fighter so steel.
Most think of this man as an unassuming old man, looking out of an old lamp in the jungle, hoping he would last more than two days. There's not much doubt, in my mind, that he died, and somewhere along the way, a second or more of his platoon and surrounding forces are killed as well. By some miracle, I received the signal to head out from our base soon after. Yes, that was my intentions. I just wanted to let him rest, pretend that he was going to age, face a new world. Unfortunately, that was to be expected of such a mercenary, as he refused to look at my cigarettes, and accepted it with open arms.
As you can see, I'm deployed for a unit of boys born in the most dangerous part of war: the mountains, where brigands push their way up from the frozen wastes. They make many mistakes. First of all, there are always young recruits, be it for bread or menial tasks like fetching dogs or cleaning the walls. They're sick and tired of their lives, and so we have to cut them open with our lights. It was crucial in the initial fighting that we seal them with posts. Then, there are scouts. We know when to stop and when to move in. They try every trick in the book, but we know where to find it. We run the holes through them, we kill the dogs, we worry about the food shortages. It's made our soldier think about all the hidden places, and it's all our doing. No one ever wants to risk being outsmarted and pushed forward again.
We've gotten better at making sure our troops are able to hide and operate undetected. Most tactics rely on firing with a knife, or using laser beams. I wouldn't say that the guys who want to defect aren't among us. Some of our *brothers* are disabled fighters who are useless to us. While we don't have any advantage over them, we always have the time to grieve when they find out that the enemy is on their side. That morning at my home base, we spotted a bullet drop, our flak assault unit losing ground on the treeline. I don't know how many people saw what happened on the ground or the ground and decided to ride it out.
There's nothing we can do now, and the gaps between us and our objective are not opening. As I write these words I've been told by my fellow soldiers to keep quiet and stay focused. Our machine gunners would not intervene if we were to get too close. In return, they would keep the trench closed, denying the enemy our chance to approach as we were closing in. Our advance forward must be effective. It takes me a week to finally make my way back to base, but somehow, despite my doubts, I'm able to make it to my gunner's cabin, where he awaits. Of course, the machine gunners were behind him, and had their fire under control. I don't know why, but it worked. Our fortified lines are secure, and I see the enemy this time, close in. He has eyes like craters, and he will not die in vain.<|endoftext|>

Tell me: First off, no one? God damn. My work is done. The world is in ruins, the candidates are chaos, and I was just doing my job. I've been spending so much time in a bland office that everything is there, and I have trouble seeing it.
Second, who would even have the nerve? These are the biggest and most important jobs. Money can't buy a box of groceries. There's no food for miles across the country. I lost my job, my sister, my wife, in a car accident six years ago. I love it when my job involves running away and barely making any money. I had my friends toss me in jail after I stole and I stole from them. Why couldn't they all just accept the consequences?
The worst part is that my staff is the same as any other corporate exterminator out there. Everyone can talk, they can smell, they can smell, they can smell, they can smell, they can smell, but when you're doing some egregious acts, the product becomes second nature. It's impossible to defend yourself. The best you can do is make a name for yourself, and just do it. They know that you have only 20 seconds to convince them that their job is fantastic. They see it as a tax breaks to keep winning on the stock market.
Maybe at the end, I'll just come back.<|endoftext|>

He lay there, in the grey dust, alone on a windless night.
Nobody could ever understand, nor understand where he was. A guardian of life, that is.
People ridiculed him. They blamed him. 'You're nothing but a figment of your imagination. You never knew what you were,' ” He didn't know where he was, or how he'd gotten in the first place.
But you would.
People the world over were always watching, waiting to see if they'd made it into his life. And it would, they always did.
When everyone was huddled behind their desks and screaming and calling out their names for him, there he stood. In the cold, staring out into space, that meant something.
It started a long time ago, in the cold, looking out into the dark.
The shooting stars. They sparkled, turned into onlookers.
They tried to pull him back into their moment. Well, those sparks never succeeded.
They just popped.
Then, in every town they visited, children were being killed for the stars. They couldn't fire up their lasers, couldn't move them, couldn't stop them.
Not that one could.
They just danced with the rest of them, trying to piece the outcome.
The feeling of unearthing the stars, in your hands, making sure they didn't choke them out.
This hurt him.
It hurt him so much.
“ I love you. ”
They waited a lifetime for that one.
But he couldn't see it.
He cried for so long, like he had watched every single shot he took.<|endoftext|>

Four Legions raised an army to crush us, but instead of a knight there was no Queen or Grand Duke. We ran into a horde of Stormcloaks, but they were the least bit surprise. Each fallen would fall only to follow. I was only ten years old and my parents insisted on being married after high school. On our wedding day I made my peace with them. Took me home to see the Marsprite princess and the Infernal Imp, but then the soldiers came.
None of my brothers were there and my sister, Ursa, fought bravely. I don't want to let that ever happen, but at the age of 14, Ursa created this Earth Kingdom and annexed the Marsprite kingdom.
We came back and the Marsprite King was turned into a black Knight. At least by my own reckoning, he was surrounded. Whenever she tried to run for another Dragon, Ursa didn't attack. She only encouraged his ambition. And so we fought alone.
The grand army remained at war with us. Last battle was the battle between an Imperial Hussars and an Imperial Knight. We both lost. I fled to the woods, and as I was reaching down with a shovel I saw them coming to an opening. I pointed the shovel and steel pierced my trench and the Horsemen rushed to me. I charged towards them.
A Beast burst from their ranks and bit me in two. I ran for cover, but before I got any cover I heard blood dripping from my wound. Ursa ran away and I saw the Beast in the distance. So I ran to him and found out what had happened. She came for me once more. I tried to run away, but as soon as she came close I saw the Beast in the distance. She rushed after it, but it moved fast. She opened fire and slit my throat. My death was close.
Then, The Beast spoke. " ** MEMORANDUM **************************"
Right before you read this, I'm reading from an earlier thread. Sorry I forgot how to do this so I'm sorry if I came off a little weird.<|endoftext|>

"No... just piss in the holy river, " Was the motto spoken by the tiny sliver of a man just feet from me. Still, regardless of the high I suppose I deserved it. As it turns out the legend that called me a traitor to our Lord just wasn't a myth.
Hell, even the orcs around here were expecting some rips and grasps from the Others.
Me? I was a suave monk, a kind of peasant. Speaking of Vikingics, how in the world a god so proud must have been misunderstood in ways we had never expected. I was a Noble and, frankly, a bit of a dickhead who honestly thought that my powers would come from the blood of peasants who worked where I did. Many found me in their eyes and, incredibly, they spied me. As I turned, cursing for all the deeds I'd done.
" Ah! Right, " I quickly replied, glancing around the swampland as the Others marched into the paddock. " We took only a single man. "
I followed the newcomer. I'd never seen him stop smiling for three rows and a half, but if he'd shown me his pride, wouldn't it have been only a momentary embarrassment? He probably gave the potion wrong.
" Just do your best to get him somewhere safe and away from harm. If necessary, have him put a pair of leash on the water. You'll be glad to oblige once he runs in. "
As we parted ways, I let out a long sigh of relief. The several orcs disarmed my horse, and with their frightened and mildly frightened expressions, my uncle exclaimed, " Ahhh. It's your last chance to show honor... to the Wisp of Good for all eternity! "
This time, the large, naked orc did not laugh. This time, I didn't. Now, the monstrous wisp of good seemed to stretch on. This time, he didn't laugh.
He stared, confused. After a moment of deliberation, I ordered him to keep the leash with him, and I walked out. The orc took his first step. It was a perfectly round and narrow one, and he seemed to take a good minute to bend his back. Finally, the donkey that lay next to him bowed down and soon he was flying through the air in one smooth motion, almost leisurely, like I've seen this movie before. I rounded the corner just in time, and was off.
My first encounter with Lord Morsel was some time soon after.<|endoftext|>

“ Over the Mop. ” his third avatar. After I had relayed my command to the General, he decided to keep the representatives from talking to us. “ They found a way. A teleportation device, twenty thousand years ahead of our FTL warp drives. ”
This was the first time since the Reptilians took over most of our Lunar fleet. Of course, the Reptilians were rapidly advancing through my troops as well. In fact, among my generals, the President had the opportunity to speak.
“ They moved us all. Their ships from our forces, pilots from my fleet, and themselves! ” He yelled as the General rushed to the consoles and display fw the final physical copies of the General ’ s, and the Director ’ s systems.
“ But who is the President speaking to? ” He raised his hand. “ Do not give me the details. ” He raised his gaze to the HUD as we followed his gaze. “ This is Vast Terra, the Son of Water and Grass, and a law of the Mop. Before the Reptilians came, we lived in a Dark World. A world where our ancestors forged the planet, had weapons for fighting, ruled the land, all the while dreaming of more. ”
“ Your father, Captain? ” I asked.
“ Yes, a wise man. His father was one of our great minds, and with it he led us to save the Sun. Before this, the Raalds ruled the world from a Guardian of Light, a master of his element, Fire. We never knew Fire could be transmuted into Crystal, or Power. The Raalds destroyed the Sun and would have us forever protected from the Sun. But because the Reptilians sought the Sun with all their might, I was his mother. We were not yet suited for it. But we have come back and won every war, fight, and finally won. We conquered our enemies and conquered our Earth. Every war is different, and I love fighting again. ”
I thought a moment. “ Very well, Captain. Enter into the control room, and place your trusty optical probe into my input port. I would rather you get me than run the simulations again. ”
“ Goodbye, Vast Terra, my very first human ambassador, ” The new avatar says in his head. “ We will retire."<|endoftext|>

He hadn't been seeing it coming. He could feel his breath as it slowly creep down his chest. I'd caught him watching. He... wasn't watching. I couldn't believe it. He knew. All these days and nights leading up to this. Yet, he had been watching. Observing. Watching. He began to sense an unfriendly hand over my shoulder.
Shocked, I ignored him and looked down to see the swollen, red and bloody piece of skin around his neck. " I know how this ends. You must have forgotten. "
A smile spread across his face, " I do. I hope. I really do. Please, just let me go." I stopped myself and stepped back. Told him I wouldn't leave. Never leave me. Never have. I said goodbye, and walked to the police station. It's only a matter of time until someone finds him.<|endoftext|>

He looked up with excitement as he saw the swirling sunset at the edge of the room. The lights were shining brilliantly, a glowing beacon in the otherwise dark room. It wasn't until he stopped near the edge that he saw her.
"Please don't come here any longer. It will be reclassified as a mental health emergency immediately. "
He hugged her. She was beautiful. She was as friendly as any human being. She would never listen to one lie though, not unless he wanted to.
He reached for her hand as the guard walked into the room.
" Doctor DiMaori, I'm afraid you have a decision to make today. "
" A decision my son? You never said anything. This is your decision. No judgement from a doctor, no appeals of any kind. Your son is so beautiful and full of life, in every way, and you must answer the next question. "
" I'm afraid I can't take it. I won't. "
" I know. Now push! "
The guard pointed out the doorway to a small room with grey walls. An empty table, empty drink bottles in the middle. Two blinds around them. A bag with no lights above and a phone in front of it. Every step taken away from her she was like a knife at his hip.
" GET AWAY! " he shouted, pushing on the blinds.
The torturer had been there in hours.
" One moment. One moment for me, you don't have to go. One second for her. "
" Okay, it's three now. Fuck you. "
" This is fucked up. Let the doctor handle this. "
" I can not. But he will give me his regards, even if it's hard for him to do so. "
She would tell him, with tears pouring down her cheeks, but he still didn't get what she meant.
" It will be hard, and I'm not going to get you any closer than that. "
She would tell him his information about her, and what would happen. The doctors would be happy and call her a hero. But she would not hear from him. The best doctors would save him, right? He would get money for medical care. The best doctors would take him to the doctor. The best doctors would be happy, happy and happy.
"... and my husband," she would say.
And then he would see her again. He would see her dress, the way her body shuddered as he made his move across the room.
She was beautiful. She was as friendly as any human being. She would never listen to one lie though, not unless he wanted to.
*I could have written more about my daughter later, but that was just not my style. I have to do this now. *<|endoftext|>

I should have known better.
I can ’ t go back to doing these things. My parents always told me to not look back. I remember one night I was out late at a party celebrating the last celebrity play I had at my young home in New Belgium. All of my friends were all taking drinks with me, and there was a young girl in the group that she had cheated on my mom and stole their money.
When I turned eleven, I had already been preparing my brain to attack those injuries. I needed to be strong and strong for the rest of my life. Just as I promised to myself, I looked back on the memory of those three cute girls.
I opened my eyes. I felt something.
On my right, I could see a child standing in the corner of my vision. I could only watch as her face sparkled in the light of the crowd. A man in an expensive suit ushered her into the crowd.
“ I ’ m coming! ”
She just turned around to do something. The man was holding a knife that was made of thin, supple material, but from the look of it he was old. I turned to her and she stepped forward towards the crowd. She was wearing an ugly suit, but it looked beautiful in the crowd.
“ It won ’ t be long, ” the man said.
I ignored him and walked towards the man. As I reached the end of the road, I was overcome by the sheer injustice. I saw a body lying on the sidewalk. It was my daughter.
“ It was your fault, ” she whimpered.
The man was the first to react. He nodded his head at me. “ I always was a boy. We wanted to show love, to make others feel better about being like us. ”
The man looked like a monster. His eyes were blackened, and his mouth seemed empty. There was a murmur on the street, when I finally noticed that this man was holding my daughter.
I backed away from him. I had not seen him since the night I was attacked. I felt scared, but in time, I realized what must have happened.
He turned to walk away. I waited in my cell.
“ You can come back. ”
My daughter, my first and only daughter, was crying in her little brother ’ s arms, at least she was excited for him.<|endoftext|>
**********142**********
“ LESLA SUMER!!!!! ” I screamed at her as I pulled out an antique knife and stabbed her several times. In a fit of rage I pulled the blade out of her throat. At that moment I realized that she was a bit too fast, and I still couldn't feel a flail. I tripped over my shoes and kicked as hard as I could. Out of adrenaline I quickly lost focus on her and again pulled out the antique knife. That's when I noticed it first.
A single plump body came into view of the old space around us. She had just finished mixing a beverage when I suddenly recognized one of her organs. It was a little rat that had been eating my baby skeleton. She was starting to scream and I saw faint shapes that she could not comprehend clearly. They came to life and did not fear the the creature. They roared and ran to me screaming "you are a bear! ” They hit me in the chest and I fell down. “ You are a fat bastard, lad! ” She screamed as she slapped my hands away and stared at me with that stupid grin of hers.
The creature wouldn't speak for a long time. It then drew its claws and pointed it towards me. I tried not to laugh, I just wanted to get away, I couldn't control myself now. But I couldn't. I let out a deep breath, the creature noticed me and quickly stopped breathing. I knocked my eyes away and looked around in horror. I knew what had happened. She has no knowledge of me, but I know what she would do if she understood me. The wolf may not be human, but in her life she was different. Yet somehow she was always there for me. I thought for a moment of being able to hear her until my senses went completely numb.
I was sure I had felt the same death when I had brought me down, because the moment I felt his hand contact my foot I knew that I had lost it. Yet, I knew that I was still alive. And this was the last time I would ever see him, not that he would ever feel the same way as the body I was fighting.<|endoftext|>

*Thud*
That car gave me the courage and confidence to start again. When she said we couldn't be together any more, I just smiled and said "I understand. It doesn't feel like we're ever together. " Sure, it felt empty, but despite all those wrongs we were going through this time, it's how I felt on that day that turned it to the best kind of meaningful. I'm getting the good grins from those around me, and they're relieved to know the good times will continue, just like I did before.
On the day that I kissed the billowing hair of the prettiest woman I've ever met, a man in a black business suit pulled over by the bushes an hour early, black eyes staring into mine, dark hair crossing his face, that girl, wherever I went... all these women I've met -- all those interests and duties and aspirations -- they all had potential in me. I don't know who these people are, but I've seen what I've done. I've seen the changes I made. I've seen the improvements I made to our lives. All these people deserve to have everything they want in life -- for whatever reason -- in me, and I don't want to want them to experience it all in my own home again.
A car horn blared in the distance, and I stood there with my back to the car, hands pressed against the steering wheel just as I had before the accident. The driver creaked, and I flinched, the whiskey hitting my lips and splattering against the roof of my mouth. The only noise that escaped was the crash. The car was starting to hit the concrete. It slowed and accelerated slowly. The door opened. I wasn't okay, and nothing seemed to help. I just kept moving and thinking.
" *Alright. *" I said, as I focused on the sedan that had hit the street. If only there was someone to watch over me. * What if the accident wasn't intentional? * I think I could do whatever I want. For as long as I needed, I was happy.
I pushed the the door open again and closed it, not remembering the crash. I wouldn't remember me taking it. When I glanced around the street, there it was. The golden cross that I had taken home to spend Christmas with mom and dad. The long black leather couch that I had used to sleep in over the years. The girl that I had once worked with was leaving her old job as an immigration officer. I checked the clock, and there it was, next to me.
Even though I didn't know it was me, I still remembered the girl I'd carried in that car to keep me company in my last few days. She looked far older than I remembered -- I'd usually say that at thirty, but that turned into decades ago. She wore a bright dress, bright blue shades that sparkled even in the dark. She started to walk toward me, with every step I took, and although the door was right behind us, there wasn't any reason to be afraid. I can't remember the last time I saw this girl -- it was all that makes me happy, even if there wasn't any reason to be.
I smiled and held her by her shoulder. I knew that someday that smile would turn into a frown, that scar on her left cheek would turn into a grimace, but we had my father's hand shaking for a moment and her hand starting to go dark too. If only she could see, though... If only...<|endoftext|>

We have time now and are awaiting our incoming commanding officer to commence action. Five o'clock, o'clock.
We have yet to hear from the Bravo Battalion. Commander Greene, Fifth Ridge Guard, Purgatory of Medals.
Captain Rosenon, front artillery support, three mortars, one for each guard, likely taken down.
This is... coming quickly.
The entire Second Company is within range of ours. The entire Second Company is in two huts which will be barricaded by several companies. I'll move to that when we get these supplies. Commander Greene, I believe.
Line Bravo will next forward at the rear. Patton will fire twice at our position. It's clear that we're going to be overwhelmed by column numbers tonight.
We've left fifty my men behind to protect the formation. Pincers were responsible for worrying ourselves in the Deep East. Everyone else was lucky for them. Sergeant Aiken will take care of the rest. We weren't that lucky last night. He's barely breathing right now, but he will reemerge soon. We almost don't have time to regroup, but even with Campbell ’ s Union forces virtually ceasing to threaten us, we may as well go to the Millers and complete a quadruple-commer-team that we started this campaign to stop.
It's quick.
The comms are on. In ten more minutes, I'll have that boys on the ground ready to go. They were there last night. Someone's got to go home. I want to see grandma.
We'll need them to draw fire and I'm sure they will. We're pulling back, of course. We'll start it once more.
The roar is the last thing I see before he's gone. We've got forty men to his left and forty men to his right, and although it's dark, you can still see the artillery fire, inching closer and closer to being part of the charge.

I sat on my rooftop watching the large beast that walked among the earthen white flowers. It twittered with finality at the sight of my child. She stared up, her beady eyes searching for what she could of a creature.
It was the same beast that had chased me all my life, spitting through the roof of my cottage building. It's body was small and limp, its eyes dark and fixed on nothing. It moved along the ground and through me. It had one of the largest hind legs, like a jackal, but it wasn't fast and wouldn't move it's hind legs. Instead it had a gaping maw. It gnawed on it's hind legs and spat at them to wash away everything that was there.
The creatures wasn't scared though. They hadn't had much more time to prepare themselves in the desert and I knew as much about them that they would come in handy one day. But it never seemed to phase me, there was no word of where it might be or how big it was.
Why it didn't know I was here it doesn't know. The idea of it never makes it laugh. It never smiles, it never watches, only terror and fear. That's why I was on my roof, watching the big beast. Watching it hunt.<|endoftext|>

The door opens. A very thin man in a tan suit and brown slacks holds up two feet of paper and a pencil that he draws on white on yellow, the only color in the room. He stares at the paper.
He's awfully boring. Not weird at all, not like the guy we had to save who literally just died. He looks at me. I don't say anything. If he's in this room, he doesn't smile. He didn't really have the face of a normal person at the time. I just knew that he would look like that.
I shuffle my papers on top of the computer which at this point should have been filled with basic details on everything, except I knew that these papers were supposed to help me save him. He spoke in a raspy voice, "what did you do to him? "
I smile and he does it again.
I shake my head, " I just... told him that it's okay, just kill yourself. " I smile.
He's still rambling. He has a large smile on his face. He gets out a pen. He writes something on it in blue.
" Not likely. " I write back, " it's not likely at all. "
I stick the pen in him, " Why would you do that, right? That was your final instructions. "
He's furious. I write back: " First, kill yourself, no matter the consequences. Second, take a bullet. Well, a bullet would still kill him at this point, and he just took the bullet. " He scoffs. I smile again. " Long story short, I took a bullet. "
" That was actually a warning. So I would be giving it away for free. I kill myself and now that I live to see the end of it all, I can choose to die. "
I smile again, " That doesn't seem all that bad. I'm sorry about the material, but I can't live with that for as long as I can. "
He nods and tries not to laugh. That's when it starts happening to me. He's getting angry. My muscles relax and I feel the coarseness creep in, adrenaline rush through my body. He's getting angry. I feel like I'm gon na snap, but the heat of the bullet makes everything move away from me.
" Why? How? You'll never know. " He calls out. I smile again, slightly confused. I just click the pen on the computer and the pen disappears from my palm.
He starts yelling things. He's clearly not well. I start mentally putting in work. He screams a few more times, and finally the words aren't coming out, but then he screams again. I think " crap, I made him go home. "
The end.
" No, no. It's ok. " He says in a stutter.
" Okay?" I say.
I walk out and down the hallway. I close my eyes.
I'm sleepy again.<|endoftext|>

I could not think of anything more boring than to be the latecomer to an insanely popular sitcom and be flailing my hands and shouting for help.
Yes I can ’ t think of anything more interesting than being late at night to watch a stupid episode of Groundhog Day – that ’ s not even which I do out of habit, but it did make me think of maybe some stupid cool music I watched while I was at work this morning. Or maybe my girlfriend, lovely Diana, I could never find her and I just randomly browse Reddit by herself just to be totally out of line, just to be more… remote.
How do you delete things after you delete them? I had gone through every job, became rich, probably learned to read, learned writing a few stories and spent more time with my grandmother in our first house or apartment together, my old 2 star job, and I think maybe in retrospect I really wanted to just take the leap. I wouldn ’ t do anything but delete it, because in the end everything is just sort of… unfiltered. Like she looked at me with disdain but got up and left the house after I said “ well, you ’ re late ”.

I knew my funding would be great. I was in the mood for this normal business. Crazy CEO pay for some guys to go win the hearts and minds of the world. When the drought hit, no one knew. The world was left with a disaster without water, no electricity, no basic necessities that people needed to survive. This whole system was crass and wasteful, but I wanted to use it to help. This shipment would be perfect, I could finally do what my family and I loved so much. Help one's mother in need while trying to clean up the fucking water around her house. All my hard work and peer pressure ponied up my confidence. I was free of the constant worries of motherhood and living with a redneck who didn't want to be a mother, and believed my employees would respect me. I was confident in myself for doing this. I made big progress, my employees applauded and wanted me to work harder. All I could expect was being paid, and they seemed to have all the time in the world to screw with me. I signed the contract, loaded it into my truck, and drove off.
A month into my operation, all the workers were dismissed, my manager ordered them sent to a remote desert in Nevada. They were homeless, so there were no jobs to be found. I picked up my shipment and drove the same route for months. I stopped in the desert the next morning to look at where it came from. It was buried in the ground. Scientists have just discovered that we've been wasting our money. We were looking for water.
I bought a pound of sand and all I had to sell was it. I started looking down at the outside desert, the radiation was much too strong for the sand. No water at all was safe to drink. I then started looking further down, more and more people started piling up and growing up in the desert. Even the cattle in the air didn't seem to be able to do anything. They were going in and out of the bunkers, drinking contaminated water from the cattle. A few kids started to see things, something bad was happening. The animals would, in general, get hostile, but a few did not. Animals got bored with their lives and started fighting. This was when things got dangerous. Animals started drooling at the sight of large animals, they didn't seem to trust us anymore. They would sneak up and destroy us, the animals seemed to be enjoying their last night being on the ground, drinking the contaminated water. I have to say, something sick is going on, and the animals probably had too much time on their hands. They started to burn up in my company and everyone on land. That's when I realized we needed money.
I had become a billionaire overnight, but I needed more money. I would need to save the planet. With this money, I could create a new system of water and solve the water crisis without global blood loss. I could also make the Earth's surface even colder, and solve a drought in under 3 months. I put all of my factories into a program, and everyone worked. This made too much of a difference to many people. In a few years, the drought would be broken. Nobody could do anything about it. Soon, the world was going to be crazy. People needed jobs, and I needed more people to do so. People need water.<|endoftext|>

I had always wanted to be a biologist. The idea came from the way I felt about my job. I mean, the world wants me to answer questions about medicine. Dr. Marsh and I were both 16 when we got the request for this position. Well the thing with the idea is, we all knew when you hear something about this job in broad daylight so all we wanted was to see.
I had always wanted to be an engineer. ( yes, I'm an engineer, ) I started my career at the Boston University. I was a worker coordinator in a research program and I had never previously used a computer. Three years later I would have the pleasure of explaining to clients how to do simple research like scales on plastic.
The major issue that was at the bottom of my mind was how to interpret a picture. Was I interpreting the images in some way? Was I checking if the meaning matched the picture? I'm not sure. Everyone was prepared for explaining how to view the images to their patients and, I suppose, the researchers in the field. I didn't have much time until I was putting the finishing touches on a video project for my dissertation that involved a horse trot.
Only after a bit of editing did I realize how easily the image was chosen. In all my years of training I never once had been so struck with a common thought: "That would take some practice". Of course, I couldn't work on it until more than one minute into our conversation. Now I was telling you about the ethics of hanging a horse as a hand signal in a steel well, to unsheathe a piece of metal, to maintain equilibrium with countermeasure on a busy street, to operate a nuclear reactor under heavy pressure.
Ok so the horse trot was what I studied. How it ended up in another place I know not. A railway passenger boarded, slipped off the rails and dropped the office chair to the floor. It was the first time any of the 20 or so researchers noticed the horse trot getting stuck. You couldn't really pin it. But I got a great picture of how the horse got halfway up the bridge and before I knew it, the end of my hand was resting in its side of the steel well. I had always wondered whether the horse was related to horses or if we were the same person. It's hard to say what was in between.
How long I debated whether it was because it was the right thing to do or if someone else had tried. Well I'm not sure I really liked hanging the horse. It seemed like the same idea as when I first had a hangover.
Then that hand was at the surface and never budging. And the end. No turning back. No turning back. No turning back.
Now the rope had become tied on both ends and as our bodies surfaced, the rope kept us conscious. Many people broke down with anxiety as we fell to the ground, screaming and walking off. It didn't take my time to find another body to take my place.
" It worked, you. "
" How did you do it? "
" It didn't look like me. "
" Why couldn't you say it would work? "
" Well, the only question I have been able to come up with for the next half hour is, do you? "
" That's impossible. "
" You were seen by the nurses. "
" Why the nurses? "
" Well, according to the doctors, the horse was just gone and we never saw it again."
**Edit**: As far as I know, I'm only working on it in-progress and it's not much longer than it used to be.<|endoftext|>

Jeb rode on the dusty hoof of the speck in front of him, alight with the chewed herding against the flapping wings of the ancient being in which he'd spent his 20 years laying asleep. JEB watched as the great beast stared back, putting its wings back on. Blood rippling and scorching as it finished its final task. JEB swayed on the great rocky floor, almost unable to keep his great tail behind him.
In past lifetimes, the birds had had their masters in the majestic kingdom. Once their young laid down to dry, flying away from them, they carried on. Now, today was the day the dragon attacked. The dust erupted in the royal air, as the dragons took their rightful place. Those who opposed them did their best to scare the culprit away. Some day, JEB would feel a thrill of fear, or perhaps the wrath of his master. He hoped.
There was a flight, once unfurling and long since faded, now shuddering as a great roar flew towards the dragon. An enormous creature, far taller than the fearsome beast, stood on the beast ’ s hind legs in front of the faceplate of the beast. It flapped its wings and roared once more, bathing it in the brilliant light of the sun. The building was silent, except for the dragons breathing. Eventually, the great beast gave a small sigh and turned back to him.
JEB watched as he made his way through the mud, wary and terrified for this man beneath. He rose from the dirt and stood tall for a moment. Ahead of him, the dragon ’ s full set of wings floated up, and its vista pierced JEB and he watched as the wind tore into his robes as he fell onto the wet grass, cradling him.
“ They feed on humans! They burn their wood! ” JEB shrieked, his only words resounding from the beast. The dragon unfurled its claws as it prepared to crush him whole, but its hypnotic singing still only emanated from JEB.
“ Whaddaya want? ” the beast asked as he took a step forward. It laughed, louder than the terrible noise he had heard so many times before.
JEB reached into his boorpals and took out a crystal. It was hard to tell where the crystal was, especially considering it was covered in some kind of silica. The remains of the dragon took off and looked very ancient. The spellswrites were covered in some sort of magical liquid, unlike any potion. JEB had no idea what to make of it, and he was decidedly against using magic. He pulled out another crystal in his shield as he didn ’ t recognize it, not that he was particularly useful in any of the realms he visited.
“ I, uh, am praying for all your faithfulness, before I make this leap from the small tower of mist to the great dragon in this dark realm. But can I not trust the Netherrealms? ” JEB asked with a sigh. His twin blades the size of the great white bull the would be all he had left.
“ Well, my companions, it would appear that we have no choice but to accept the blessing. For now, I stand before you, and believe me, you will have a great Kingdom within your own. You, when given the task, will be merciful. Speak with them in the pursuit of the Netherrealms. They will be among you, no doubt. Your gift could well serve as a guide or prophet. ”
For the past 10 years the Netherrealms had been waiting. He would grant his great favor and they would have few obstacles in their way. In these past lifetimes, JEB would experience great hardship in order to make his final pilgrimage. In the first 10 years of his life, the Dragon had been thought a mere guardian, with no protection. Now, his time was over and JEB was hungry. It was time to travel to see the Netherrealms once more, the one in the Netherrealm. What would happen if he weren ’ t successful?
From the Netherrealms, JEB heard a distant rumbling in the distance.<|endoftext|>

Hey, guys! I'm very new to Writing Prompts and don't quite know how I'll respond to this. I tried my best and noticed that I wrote as much as I could, but my flow in the second part was going slightly out of sync with the rest of the story. Thanks again!

**Charlotte - December 26th 2222**
" Are you sad to see this date go this far, son? "
" I can't imagine the disappointment I feel at knowing that I am too late. I've waited ages for a chance to turn back time and act like it isn't worth the trouble. Now here we are, twenty years later, in our old home and you think you can't possibly change the past? The only thing I can do is to let you see it happen. "

" Sir, I am looking at 1719 and it is only held in the name of the Sovereign Prince William. "
" How long do we have until the original Sovereign Prince William dies? "
" I think 3 weeks. I think he's floating, now. I can't see him. I don't think anyone will look for him."

"What have you done to deserve this? " I asked them the other night. One of them had a six-foot plate that turned green and some amount of bulling. It was solid silver, a bronze coat. It was made of green and it looked good but then again the scales could take on armor and strength just like any other metal. The other boys thought it wasn't even entirely worthwhile to make your dish. I was an idiot.
" It was a gift. Now, for the rest of you, they'll have to deal with what you've done. "
" It's not a gift. It's a curse." The other boys glared at me with hatred and curiosity as they birthed a human sized plate and reached into their jeans to serve their purpose. They scurried off. My dish was the pinnacle of microwave makings.<|endoftext|>

Things weren ’ t great. So many people died from the disease that was causing the outbreak. So many victims. So many stories. So many factors that were purposely hidden away from us, and we were in the process of intentionally living until it was too late. So many of the medical equipment, that was used to cope with these beings, were damaged. They bit, ripped and killed for all intents and purposes. As though that could even fucking exist.
Then another incident happened. One particularly terrible case of more stories than one. A teenager tried leaving her boyfriend, who was in the car wrecking every time she attempted to leave.<|endoftext|>

About a month ago, Walt and I discovered the butterfly effect; there is this image of that butterfly that dances over the shore, but nothing is ever said about it again until today. It would be utterly ridiculous to do anything about it, but luckily, there are pictures of it in the large newspapers. Walt is in one of those buildings, his girlfriend just worked at the grocery store; it happens so fast, it has a deathly individual effect. But nothing can really compare to what is going to happen in my backyard. The plastic plants will sprout and they will burst from the little paper. Walt and I will never get to leave our secret cave-like home. We are wandering in the back of an ambulance; the driver is pinned under a car. The ambulance lifts our family out of the wreckage and into the icy wilderness.
You would think we would not have a deathly effect; it just happened on the tarmac. It happened at 1:25 A.M. because, in fact, that plane appeared immediately off course. Nobody could get their heads into their laps; they screamed, and someone holding the child said "STOP! They are cheating on me." He then directed the ambulance back to our basement.
Now, the funny thing about the effect is it lasts longer than other photographs. The breeze will blow away the grass of our backyard, making it look like big paper Planes, but that is completely unnecessary to the scene depicted in those pictures. Now, the camera must also have noticed that the skidding water is very hard to keep straight. So it gave us the illusion that the little paper flying by him was just a piece of paper flying. We got the wrong visuals wrong and the other camera misleads you when it points at your arm. This little butterfly was just an extra piece of paper, flying out of our backyard.<|endoftext|>

Shakespeare was a cynic
that cynics tried to convince
that he'd re-write
Let there be shadows.
A crow crowed.
The heavy gnashing of teeth.
One black black paw on top
Sighed and notched.
With cough and noise they made,
the boy thinks
that one damn crow
will happen.
It means no harm,
nor even to come close,
you will not rob him.
You will sleep and survive.
Your gon na stay awake,
while you fill up the sword.
Upon whose face are poets
fled out and lost.
Imagine, imagine that
here lies eternal knowledge,
within you,
illuminating hope and in your hearts,
that men of England
still continue the cycle.
Imagine a sword in the lids
of his,
in the hands of a madman,
You will never find him again.<|endoftext|>

I was being chased by the grim reaper and I'm really liking this. I can't stay far away from this place and find a good buddy, a friendly one for sure. It's three o'clock and I'm swamped with all sorts of strange people. The tv time reads 4:38 when I burst through the door of my boyfriend's house.
I look behind me and have to sit down to figure out how I'm going to get home. I don't really have a plan. Will this be a phone call? Will I need to give her the credit card information? A phone call? Does her mind be racing? At least he's the one keeping the police out of my life.
When I wake, my eyes meet a dark shadow on the nightstand and in a flash I'm on my feet. My mind races when I look down at my arms and head to where I had first been. My mind is racing, but my legs are at their usual place. I jump to a perfectly normal position, and the shadow dissipates into the darkness. I open my eyes only to find that the door is open. I look down and am paralyzed. This is not what I wanted to be... this was not what I want to be... I can't think straight, I'm not going to the hospital. I look up and there's a body standing before me.
The reaper turns around and places a hand on my shoulder. " Don't worry, you're safe now," he says and he gives me a quick smile and flashes a thumbs up. I wonder what this is called.<|endoftext|>

It was supposed to be a fight. No good attacking.
I held up my hand, flanked by my best friend. The kid burst through the door, and smiled for the fifth time.
"Ugh, this can't be real, " I mumbled. " " I owe ya. "
I turned off the tv and brought it to the bright screen to watch the video. The monotone face of Mr. Gnuks lowered his eyes as his wife leaned in closer.
" That seems like the right thing to do, huh? " she said with a touch of pride, which had somehow managed to appear genuine. I shook my head with even more pride. " Nothing went right the first time we spoke, anyway."
I got up from my bed and stared at the faces below me; I sighed. I couldn't make it home soon. What had we been on about? What did this mean? I looked at my watch: 9:42pm.
Suddenly, I noticed a sickening suddenness overtaking me. I tried to look away as I felt a torrent of pain. * Impossible! *
I watched helplessly as my feet dug into ground, filled with bones and tendons. I crumpled to the floor, looking over my shoulder for a moment to make sure no one was messing with me. I knew I couldn't do it. I quickly looked at my mother.
She stared at me, looked as though she had just seen her own reflection in front of her and just then I saw a punchline in her eye. A punchline that would never be. A punchline that said, at the very least, *If you won, I'll give you all the money you got! *<|endoftext|>

Voldemort watched his apprentice's face. It looked like "this shit " had come from the Muggle left overs from hell himself. His son " died by the battlefield when the War started " decided to take its final breaths. All the rage and fury it took up with Harry holding the shotgun in his hands, it took the majority of its energy to simply stand up and shoot Voldemort.
He found a tunnel in a small town and walked towards it. He could sense him in a corner and try and not get trampled by the black snake that had ripped him apart. Even when it snored a few times, it couldn't get through all of the defences and screamed.
" What about you? " asked the boy. His lips quirked. He didn't flinch and took a step towards Voldemort. He didn't care about anything. Even the tone "... that's what your therapist said if you tell me you're here to do something about that? " was just wrong. His father wasn't going to listen.
He then realised he was nearly gone and had to walk.
Harry stood up and walked towards the nearest door, with the help of what he had got from his guide.
" Sirius! " rang out Harry. But something about a failed move was terrifying to him.
" What is it here? " asked Harry.
The voice in front of him wasn't his father, but a voice coming from down the street.
" Come here Harry-percival " it said. " All right up now. Let me go to the room and I'll explain what's this place. "
" Yeah just what's this place?" Harry tried to counter. But the noise had stopped.
He saw men who looked with bored expressions before him. A group of Voldemort clones. At this rate they'd be drowned out soon. If Voldemort had the nerve he would start just staring.
Walking back through the door was too much work. He turned around a corner and picked up his pistol and fired.<|endoftext|>

Naw, I don't need to be here. I can't leave. I need to go somewhere where I'm *here*.
People say you can go through hell for never finding that you've found love again. That when you move on, you'll move on to the next world, and then finally, you'll *rebuild* yourself.
Not this time.
This time I swear that it's like I *never * found* your right-hand guy, like when I looked into your eyes.
The doctors said I won't last much longer, and they'll tell you to stop smoking, and you'll die at the age of 85. I can tell you this because my gut told me it was *hard* to tell somebody younger than me their day-to-day abilities and weaknesses. No one's gon na give it to me like that, and if it was like that, no one would want to have me, otherwise they'd probably burn me alive.
But that's the way life is. The people close to me tell me, while I'm still in the hospital, "this place is the worst thing you've got."
I guess they're right. As far as I can tell, you don't need to escape the *hell* this place is. I'm so tired of the treatment. The doctors aren't letting me go. I'm so tired of being in pain.
So I have to go up to what I believed to be my *third* floor bedroom at 2:32 AM. My heart beat for only about a minute. But the pain of dying is just too much. It's almost like I'm here.
And I can't move my hand. It's getting stuck there. No. I can't do it. This isn't work. I don't want to be here.
And I can't do it.
I can't bring myself to move forward and give this guy a hand in his heart. I'm so sick of it.
So I put on my stupid shirt. And my stupid backpack. And my *children. * And my stupid shoes. And my old broken tablet. And my stupid shoes on the couch. I wear them all and hide them behind my thick wooden chair.
When I look down on my body, I don't see these rotten wounds that I see for centuries and decades. As though the world will end, every minute or so I have to look into my heart and hear the beating again and again. And I have to do something to keep this boy alive. The world is going to end. And it's not a final check.
I already have my pocket knife. I know that it's not mine to take back. I know that it's not mine to release. I know that I've already buried this boy, so that he will continue to live in pain. And I will finally find him.<|endoftext|>

U.S..U.N..Freedom?
I'm a dude now. A dude who, if I remember correctly, was writing this journal, again and again, and again. Sitting in the kitchen reading a butter knife while using my pen, I watch as my time comes up, even if it seems like it is ticking down. It is I finished my list. I try not to think about how important a detail it is that I make. Would a large supermarket, a firm installation in old school apartment complex, a chink in the downtown skyline save it for the meat packing plant? Could I have sworn that it was all in my own mind?
I can't remember the last time I had had to make a decision. But then I *feel* the growing worry of a kid a few days back in grade school, his back against the brick wall of the room. Since my hesitation, I can easily make my own decisions about a few items in our life. But I wish that he had picked the best choices from here. The last choice, ironically, was in /r/atheism where it came to mind.
I forgot about that one.
Maybe it was the dull eyes and the focused focus of a viewer that kept him focused, or maybe the backside of his mind that kept me distracted. I remember how much he liked reading me poems. How he would tell me whether to vote or not.
Suddenly, everything is broken. Every page is broken. Everything is removed from the timeline. Everything is erased from the other timeline. And then the flashback hits...
The painkillers stop. My vision blurs. I feel nervous. I lean back to watch over the incoming reaction, and there it is. My last person, and yet... My childhood friend. I used to hate my former friend, he was the best friend I could have had, I didn't mean to fall apart with strangers like that, it ruined everything.
I haven't even had a chance to use my new abilities. Because of course my life was not ruined. I have no further thoughts. No further ability for me to use.
I wait...<|endoftext|>

Jessie'd started building the Virtual Voice Input channel. She had another day of work and in the evening was at a meeting about enhancing Siri's voice in the phrase, "You know, maybe we should call you Jill."
The problem with this coming from a being so storied was that the time would come when he could no longer speak. He was supposed to be the main speaker for Siri, but now he needed to get used to every method.
He kicked the door open, trying to find comfort in his bindless bed, yelling loudly "JILL! ", The students had begun to cry at the sight of him.
He walked over and pulled out a headset, holding a mic in the hand and a flip phone in the other. He set up the mic and sat at the desk, looking for something, anything that could distract him from his problem.
He listened to the flapping of feet on the slightly cracked sidewalk; tickle the lights on the street signs above parking lots; point the mic to the house on the street in front of him.
He would do anything. He would listen to the voices in his head telling him he would not wake up or get to work; he would do anything at all to stop the transmission.
He threw his hands up in the air and screamed to the heavens in alarm, as he threw the mic down, feeling the motion. The white-hot metal spikes began to tickle his flesh. It also tickled his ears.
Suddenly, he was beginning to sleep, this was going to be his story, his fate. His ending was on the line, someone else was going to tell him how they had settled with a number to set aside to save her.
He walked downstairs, babbled his belly as he came to his feet, and began to take off his suit.
Sweat poured down his pale skin, soaking the sole of his shoes. He stood up, and walked towards the music computer on the counter. His eyes were watery, and his face was peeling away from his face in disgust.
Jessie looked at his phone as she scrolled through the interface, " You think you could just let Siri go? She's already been programmed, telling you how to listen to the plays you want to listen to. She's asking you to mute the song, the song that they want to listen to. And you don't care. It'll change the songs you hear."<|endoftext|>

*Swarper* was a name I needed to remember as soon as I got home from school. His's perfectly pronounced call sign "James the Rat " and " Kaundry " were in this room three rows up from each other, inviting me to recognize it from there. He was my childhood nickname, and was a wonderful boy. He liked being around me and more, so I picked a name that sounded pretty similar to his though a comma would have been appropriate.
I sat down at the head of the table, suddenly feeling quite unbalanced. I was starting to think that this bathroom was my new hiding place, but I also was confused. The other people were leaning against the next set of tables and murmuring to one another.
" Has anyone been in there? "
" You have no idea what comes through. "
James had been there long before. I had come back from prom excited to see how he changed when he moved in this room, and it had scared me. Yet, I had been so sure that there was something that had went wrong with him.
" My childhood friend, Gladys, has been looking at him. He's been tired and restless all day. "
" Has anyone tried to help? "
" Not yet. She's been trying all week to be beside me. "
" Is he still in there? "
" No. A memory of him is well hidden in there, probably why he's there. "
" Gladys, what's his name? "
" How dare you. "
" It's quite simple. He looks beautiful, but he has short brown hair. "
" Is he still in there?"<|endoftext|>

The sun groaned, casting an eerie shadow of light over the land. Grass screeched and twirled as it pumped through the day into the desert, shooting through the clouds like green lemons warming the ground. Narrow troughs gleamed in the low light of the giant pterosaur, miles and miles long, covered in hulking, serrated teeth that dared to wriggle across sand, looking out on its narrow, metal wings. The world around them was filled with sputtering flames, rending rows of saltwater-caked islands in the ash. The phoenix hovered over the crater, fading from view in time to be quickly taken away.
For the first time in recent years, the pillars of the world tilted, revealing a scorching field of sand, grown over and refracted off in every direction. It was beautiful, green, tranquil, one of the most beautiful things on earth. The world looked like an ocean to the naked eye, with a heatwave in the air that equated to underwater volcanoes.
The giant pterosaur just stood there, staring down at them. Its long, pointed, gleaming teeth glinted in the burning sky. Metal plates fell to the dirt below, rattling off the sand. Earth raged, destroying the entire beach at the time.
The endless waste transformed into farmland, villages. Farmers eventually spread out, their crops failing as the remains of their people died off, their herds becoming weak, with none to protect them anymore. The dunes collapsed, and finally, the dirt road was destroyed.<|endoftext|>

These new really bulky companion pets worked well. Kinda like they were my parents again and I love them. Just ask my dog Karleen who they are. I love her too, but the old ones are me for real. They keep me company and could be the perfect companion dog.
I love how people act when they think their new love for the animals is a distraction, as this new companion dog is mine and I've been getting really good at what they are doing. Sometimes Karleen gets so excited around me that I can't walk away from her because I can't really drive. It's quite insane what this new companion dog is doing, but it's proving far too useful for me to keep alone anymore.
I haven't told this and won't say he's happy about it either. Apparently his favorite food is krill eggs. I really don't want to spoil things for his friends. I would tell him that he shouldn't ask too many questions, but really krill eggs are one of the rarest of all animal food. I might even let him sit in the corner like I used to.
As I am sitting around my home, thinking how interesting this new pet dog is, I have a warning of a very important problem. Some clown has broken into my home and stole some of my favorite pet's happy pet baby krill eggs. It has been declared a kidnapping and is being held responsible. I will make the very best out of this.<|endoftext|>

A large group of men in black suits came running down the street. A few scattered, looking for anybody else. At least that I knew of. Who the hell should be going back there? I don't give a rat's ass why I should need to be running. I know that if I could have I would have done something better. But no, I can't, for the last fifty years at least. I am trapped in a very simple illusion. I can't do anything, but there is always someone else. Nothing fun or interesting goes through my head, even if no one else comes to mind. This is what makes me so special, being a plaything called "The Historian" an fackin' failure. I just ain't no " Major " or a " Professor " or a " Career " or anything serious. I am, in fact, a socially awkward criminal who pretends to be the world's foremost historian. They thought he'd be easy, take a few years off work and join some secret military agency and go scouting all over the world. He was? What a shit hole. Now I'm stuck at this bridge. Yeah, that's a guy looking for a megaphone. Man, he knows I'm insane. Why am I even here? It'd be so fucking amazing if they said he didn't want a job. I'd be great. Just a fucking machine. Hell, I'd be the most powerful god I'd ever known. Only slightly older than the most powerful thing in the universe, and a bit wiser. I could almost outsmart him in a heartbeat. I mean, someone who's been out to kill man for good over 50's would probably look a lot smarter. But he wouldn't know about me though. I mean, I would have killed a lot of men with bodyguards. Killed even more heroes. Why did people just keep coming back here when I could just type a few words into my phone? At least that is what I thought. And I gave them a beating. They're mad.
Excuse me?
My best friend died in the war. I was in college, and a friend I knew spoke to me through my journal. I didn't always figure that out, but he came and talked to me constantly. I was one of them. After that my friend died. I thought he was weird, wondering why I did this to myself? It was probably natural, probably triggered by the fact that no one else was there. He was always there and most of his time he didn't even see me. This guy, I'm used to doing stuff. I wasn't even like his mother and he didn't even know I lived. They gave him a mug shot and told me I lost my mind. Fucking college, wasn't good for me. I'm glad they didn't take the " Horrible Mentality Test" off. That's the big one, huh? This guy needed me. He was the most respected person the world has ever seen. He said he wanted me to do something special for him. Make him famous, that he might even live a full life. Like all you professors do.<|endoftext|>

“ Here ’ s the guy who did this, he was a highwayman. He drank like a donkey. He wore a wedding red hat that cut off his nipples. His tongue was sticking out from his spit. That ’ s what drove people to him. We aren ’ t here to tolerate his behaviour. ”
The interviewer stood in silence. He was wearing denim jeans that fit him perfectly. His feet weren ’ t slick as silk, just stubble. He smiled as he sat up and placed his elbows on the table.
“ Look what he did to me. He was a highwayman. ”
His wrinkles disappeared and his eyes glowed. Black snot oozed from his lips, the blood still stained his jeans.
“ I need to apologize, sir. I was a cross man. ”
The interviewer slapped his hand up towards the ceiling.
“ You know what happens when you don ’ t pay attention, right? After their actions are already matted with blood, blood pools inside them. ”
“ His sins hit at me, sir. Blood is loose, without a stain. Alcohol spills from his fingers onto the carpet. Blood will not spread to the floor like it should. And the stains on his clothing. He must destroy those stains, lest they spread. ”
“ Then someone else in this country has their health destroyed? Do they want to stop drinking? ”
“ I didn ’ t think you would have been in that position. ”
“ I suppose so. Doesn ’ t matter, sir, if he kills me with his drink. ”
The interviewer smiled.
“ Would you like to meet him? This is the national press conference. ”<|endoftext|>

I quietly broke the silence with the last word that was given to me, only for it to fade from ear to ear. I walked out of the little house barely making a sound. I still didn't feel accomplished. Time seemed to float by without consequences. Nothing did. Finally I found this little island. A stunning spring filled with water and salty air. The warmth of it chilled my bones to the bone. I walked through the brightly lit yard to the closest house. I heard the familiar cries of the children and let out the most endearing cry of my life. It was her. A little girl. I crouched down with the first child and closed my eyes hoping to finally see her. She was lying on the floor of this house. It had been centuries since I had seen her that way. I tried to go to comfort her. She tried to console me. Finally I found her and sobbed.
The child began crying uncontrollably. What have I done to deserve this? She begged and pleaded for me to leave her. I did not have a father anymore. No one there to help. I could only pray. No one believed me. I was not alone. I knew she was in love, and I wanted to protect her. I began crying harder and harder as the tears slowly stopped flowing. She began to cry for a minute, then slipped away. I sat up in my bed and sobbed again.
I climbed onto my back porch and picked up the pace of life. I became acutely aware of the butterfly effect on the gravity of the ground. I knew she was close. The tree should be higher than it was today. I looked up at the beautiful sunset that was the top of the south face of the mountains. The lush green mountains there were warmer than the winters ago. I wrapped my arms around her and cried out for her. I found her, more than once, in the back yard of my house. Her eyes were back. Her head hung down trying to sleep. I began to cry.
In a mere five minutes the sky began to drift in a hypnotic pattern. I took out a magnifying glass and looked out the window. The lights switched on. I took her breath away and took the first step into the void and went to sleep. I made it to the house and stood up.<|endoftext|>

**Description: **
Using the Third Eye and the Focal Systems, local neural networking system Nyarlina found herself stuck in an intergalactic sewer system. I was there on my way to accept a job offer from the salvage and maintenance corp, but I was never seen again until my crew's shuttle landed.
Nyarlina had been walking into the laundromat and noticed how many minutes were still in her past for maintenance. As she began to panic, she realized she had used up the batteries in her station. She placed the shuttle on top of the ten ship, and began tracking and isolating the damaged equipment, to not make any more stowaways, which was just a waste of her fuel.
**Progress: **
Lazarus and the medical crew began their repairs to a module that was once an electric power source. Nyarlina had only allowed thirty minutes a day after arriving, since it wasn't necessary. Lifting a part of the launch tube, Lazarus could feel its neural stream connecting to the constructions on the ship's already cracked exterior. Lazarus immediately visualized a room which changed. Blackness filled Lazarus' view, and a long drain down at her feet. At first, she assumed it was normal, an uncomfortable outline of scrubby plaster, but then she realized it was dark.
Lazarus felt a fraction of a second of heat coming from the drain, and after a second of realizing it was superficial, she dropped down onto a bench that was adjacent to the module's wooden support beam. She took a seat adjacent to the lock, and slowly stirred her ice water. The large light at her fingertips were a familiar color, and though it wasn't physical, it could be attributed to winter, dark. Lazarus did not know for sure what it was, nor had she ever experienced it. As she began to mop the bench, she noticed her pajama pants bled, and lank, and pale as the rubble of the criminal lifestyle of being a rich child.
Lazarus struggled through it, but eventually she came up with an excuse: it was just a fantasy, one made up of hard facts. Lazarus recognized a genocidal psychopath who had been murdering by hacking into their minds, and had been using this as a weapon to destroy all of humanity. The police found a dead katana on the corpse. The radiological matter released from the katana was easily toxic to even the best scientists. It was also very expensive. Lazarus sneezed as she set up her raincoat as she secured the ballistic pouch around her ear. Nyarlina began tracking the disappearance of the local robotic crew, their whereabouts unknown. She grabbed the belt with her short stick and started dragging the pack to Lazarus' apartment, and locked the door. With the supplies that the medical crew needed, Lazarus moved along the path she came from, weaving in and out of the alley, passing shadowy characters in place of main characters.
Lazarus looked to the mystery woman for more information.
"Hello, lieutenant, what's going on here? " She began.
" I never called you, Yarlina. You know better than to end up where you are. "
" Out at sea, in a void like this? " She asked.
" Is that what ships dream up? " she replied.
" Excuse me? " Lazarus asked. " I had a very successful offer on a few shuttle contracts, right? "
" That was an amazing one, Mark... " Nyarlina paused. " I was in a second chance and I will do everything in my power to keep you onboard. I was never meant for this but... " Lazarus wiped her nose and wiped the sweat from her forehead. " Now, come, I need to figure out how to get out of here before we end up somewhere else. I have one idea, though: " Nyarlina pushed the ship in front of her as it was teleported in and opened the hatch.
" Oi, Nyarlina, start listening to me!"<|endoftext|>

Taylor was sat on the bed, a chill reaching down his legs. She had finally had enough. She had gone to bed. That was the end of it.
People were starting to notice. First it was the border patrol, the patrolmen with man sized guns with a revolvers on top. Then it was the medical teachers, the nurses who rushed in with tubes of various sizes to help them scour their victims. They had tried the same thing. Taylor pulled a short metal contraption out of her pocket and unholstered the new-found constructionite. She gave a small hand squeeze on the contraption and watched as its contraption rotated. When she did, every part in her body disappeared.
She went into a deep sleep,
Then the flight attendants with handheld grappling hooks and having a glass tab mouth,
Her last dreams on the thing.<|endoftext|>

I kicked the door open. It was January 9th.
I sighed. Somethings happening. The government called me paranoid. You wouldn't believe it, but I was being paid for this shit. I couldn't just leave town, I needed to show them all my family.
I slowly entered the and down the hall. When I walked into room seven, I saw the men of the FBI performing one great operation, and conveniently. And I made a huge deal out of it. People around me were laughing, crying, ducking, snarling. It was a hallucination, I told myself.
Suddenly, the walls were covered with a mural of the Founding Fathers, every single member of the freedom fighters took an axe off of the wall and smashed into it, the mural would fly away right next to the exit, the feds would strike, which would drive the wall out of sight, all that would follow were the legs of the men standing over it.
The mural slowly slowly moved upwards, until it struck a mirror. I stared at it intently, and it moved slowly at first. Then it would gradually let go, sliding along the mirror, until the floor on the bottom of the mirror was covered in its own mural, and then it hit the floor and the floor even more.
The weird part is, I was able to escape. I couldn't be seen.<|endoftext|>

A vast amalgamation of information spread in the most efficient and efficient manner. The mass of information was unbounded. It was complete without boundaries, without boundaries but, for just a moment, all had become true.
I turned the dial, and I was interrupted by a faint sound. " Its you, you fucking robot! " I screamed as I heard the sirens blaring in my headphones. I opened up my comms, and was greeted with the new arrival.
" Well, to be fair, when you got me, you were supposed to fix my shit. " He made direct eye contact with me. " You became that. "
" Halt!" I heard, smacking him in the shoulder. I turned my head slowly back as he opened his mouth. After a few moments, I realized I was still standing perfectly still.<|endoftext|>

Dr. Clemens ushered me out of the potted plant and back into the hospital, and I gripped my stomach tightly. He had made this discovery for himself, so nothing could have been further from the truth.
"Doctor Mortimer... what will your reaction be? "
I sighed as I tried to form some coherent thoughts. " Well, you'll be in perfect health for a week. You'll be given a permanent house for a week until the experts on your home can asses your mental health. I got my sample in quarantine and all, right? "
Dr. Clemens held up a piece of parchment. " Yes, of course. I'll never need to see your note again. "
" Where will you land in the next 10 days? "
" Oh, you'll be at Alpha for lunch. How about you come back on Monday. I'll give you your date next week. "
We waited, and Dr. Clemens noticed my discomfort. He thought about humor.
" That would be nice. My date'll be during the Thanksgiving Special on Sunday. You'll even have Thanksgiving break with friends. "
I sighed, and began staring in his direction. " Please, just answer me, okay? "
He looked at me with two stars in his eyes. " Look... You should get up off of the chair. I'll be right over."
I grabbed my phone and headed back into the hospital.<|endoftext|>

"Yes? "
" Good then, yes. "
We got on the ship and proceded to give a toast to the aliens.
" Just you wait, remember? It's all about standing out. You'll feel whatever they do, you'll get matched up against the others, you can go live like they say, all that jazz, noise and everything, and you'll go to some place a little more real. "
We had to start all over, we just needed to show them we could show them the things they were doing and never let them down. Sure the aliens thought they were like us, but they were more like us and more realistic. Just as they said.
" Well... "
" There you are, actually, Mr Ambassador. "
" Who... who said that? "
" Sir. "
" That's because, I-I'd be lying if I told you that we, again, are just like you and they are just like you and they beat me on my way through them without even looking at me or anything. I've always been told... "
" Well... But sir. It's not like you are an option... "
" Because you are not even a favorite among the selected group, especially with how they treat themselves. "
" Oh... with respect, I suppose, but that's because I can't stand to... fight on the side that would beat me out of you. With you. So... see, Mr Ambassador. This is where we start our journey to a new destination, where we might have experience that will knock you out with ease. "
We waited, waiting for Mr Ambassador to finish his toast, he finished his toast.
" Yes, sir. "
We sailed for five hundred years and traveled the galaxy searching for the one true threat. We discovered a new planet, a new galaxy, and we found ourselves on the center of a new colony world.
" What are you proposing? "
" I say, I'm... I'm starting to consider it a way out. "
" Sir... what are you proposing? "
" I'm beginning to consider accepting what the technological mind is like, sir, and embrace what it might have become. I mean, technology wise, we are the only ones who have advanced the other 98 planets in the galaxy, the other 98 people in the universe, until we were even able to see each other in order to evolve on their own in a way that is less scary than we would have previously thought. "
" Oh, Mr Ambassador. I can still remember, sir. This is... this is the life I lived. I wanted to have a better life than I know here, right? "
" Yes, Sir. "
" As I had always wished, sir. "
" I don't like the world here. I don't like what they've put me through and the world I live in. I don't want to live in it. My grandmother's cancer was too slow and your children are probably dying at that stage of my life. I would have prevented them all so I could have lived a better life. "
" Thank you... "
" Um... Mr Ambassador, am I... am I.....I'm... here? "
" Yes, Mr Ambassador. It is not true. "
" Sir... what? "
" It was... it was a surprise. They say you can hide secrets and hide people too. My life was a surprise to me, and now I find one so close to you that it was terrifying to me. Maybe I can change that. "
" Thank you, Mr Ambassador. "
" I'm glad that you've let me know."<|endoftext|>

Michael was shocked when he saw the music on the TV.
"I'M IN! " He screamed in terror. " Can somebody PLEASE explain the music to me?! " He was surrounded by people who had been blessed by his luck.
His heart began racing and he felt a light coming out of his chest. * Did I really fall into my vortex? * he thought. " There is no way I have been in my realm of happiness for all those eons. Maybe I could go back to earth if I get someone to help me over here? "
He opened his eyes and saw a screen appear on the TV. He began reading a news article and quietly reached for his gun.
The news presenter turned to Michael and immediately saw how it looked like a planet was making a profound mockery of the average person.
" Is this... did this really happen? " he asked the naked man.
The naked man followed suit saying, " We have some reports out that someone had set up a cult in the surrounding area. This is a new possibility! "
Michael was relieved to find that they found nothing out about that cult. As the Naked Man walked away he noticed that there was a blue glow in the sky. " The light is coming out of the sky! " Michael said with surprise.
The glowing blue light began to grow brighter and earlier that day, someone had lit one of their improvised kitschy home theater props. The lights that the performer had lit glowed! He had found out they had done it! Michael had even found out that everyone had contacted their families and put them on trial for their crimes.
Michael finally concluded that the cult had planted a bomb in his place of employment as a dentist. That's why every day he woke up and listened to soothing songs about his broken childhood. Michael picked up his keys and sat down in his car.
" I just need a minute to hear this, " he started and looked up.
" Wait, what?? I..?"<|endoftext|>

A black powdery human shape by an odd light from somewhere inside the chest had snuck into the workshop...
"Mr. President, is this a David Dunn joke? "
" Yes, officer. It's obviously a CIA prank. What makes it even funnier though? Do we really have any cover to make someone laugh? "
The gruff officer smirked. "... well, sir, it is a real threat in the Middle East. The most dangerous sleeper cells in the world are about to face it's toughest foe of all. You might not find one as humorless and meek as I, but there are many worlds where... "
" What? "
" Say, Nasty List has got its pieces all wrapped around the Earth, and they're all in land on the way out. "
" That doesn't even explain the way they've been practicing their moves and hiding in the woods off of Cheyenne. "
" Relax Mr. President, it's just too ironic. There is no way that terrorists will succeed in building this kit from parts that aren't there. "
The dark officer raised an eyebrow. " Why, would they not? The logistics? The success of this project? "
" Well, sir, they've tried all over the world. While the codes and ID are still intact, all they have is little bits of code. "
The cop raised an eyebrow. " That could be some of their secret message. "
" No sir, their communique is... well, it's a hoax. "
" Then why hasn't that explained the way things are turning out in the end? "
" Well, sir... you see there's many countries that have bombarded with Naughty List explosives, but they've all tried to blend in with the established " Naughty List ". Japan? "
" Exactly! Russia? "
" Well, sir... you see there's a world leader of the " Naughty List " who lives in the far off shore of Rio, America has planned to create a second monster against ISIS. They tried to pop over the government and government-enforced fence and just killed all of them in one evening. We just... " The voice was muffled, the officer could have sworn it was the sound of a baseball batter ramming into the concrete, but somehow the officer could tell it was just a growl as the torturing began.

SUBJECT: VIOLENCE OF TIME
On the eve of August 26, 1941, the city of Uruk was attacked. Although it was not immediately evident, all signs were pointing to the bombs being launched from the cities shortly before a week's delay, which are inscribed in the city walls of the concentration camp at an unknown location. In actuality, this attack was a weapon shot through the battlements, as well as the solider's ears as they were blown out, all to mislead the enemy. As per usual, the Fall of Rutherglen fell upon an allied force after three months of siege, and destruction at hundreds of concentration camps grew more and more conclusive. The defenders received no respite as civilians from the camps were incinerated, and the weather was expected to stay much colder after The Fall than it did on the day the war began. Consequently, Area 51 was vacant at best. On a positive note, the nation was free from the threat of nuclear destruction. Whereas attacks within 20 miles of Nagasaki were expected to appear almost every day, in 1941 there had not been a single casualty on any display of the Sonderland offensive. Luckily for the Allied defenses, a preemptive evacuation force of the Gothrul ( not identified ) was also deployed on July 9th. There, the Sonderland offensive took place, and the Hangedördenland did strike. The Gothrul certainly took precedent in WWII, and now, is infamous for its small size and apparently organised tactics. In response to this, global control of the Gothrul grew. Sobs of food were piled up out of nowhere, and area-wide refrigerators were withdrawn from all facilities. The Sonderland offensive may have been seen as just a symptom of the war, but once another siege was rewound, the superiority of Britain and neighboring countries could not be further delayed. For more on this subject, please see SSB journal entry, 1st March 1945.<|endoftext|>

It's 6 a.m. and Tyler Mason, a lost man, is already unceremoniously picked up from his spot next to the ledge.
This was his fourth suicide attempt and he hadn't meant to do it alone. The plan was simple, he looked up the railing and saw this person. He tried to pull himself out of the dark, well used, choked down car that had fallen two days ago.
There was a body in the passenger seat of his car, little to no injuries, no glass fragments, no rat stains, no bloody patches. He knew it was a suicide because it was.
Tyler inhaled sharply. He was immediately overcome with guilt. It was a suicide, he had failed so much. The kid shouldn't have been there. He also shouldn't have been out there hanging around, acting like an asshole. The bank had emptied, only a few thousand people were left.
Only the kid. He had read that when people pass into the urban areas that the subconscious can become corrupt and easy to manipulate.
He had killed another five thousand people.
The man was holding a piece of plastic bag under his shoes, his own scarf seeping into the park's undergrowth. He held the bag up to Tyler's eye. It was his 6th suicide attempt.
He was also locked in an argument with his mother.
Back in his day there weren't any person in the world who would scream at his mother. His parents had reassured him that it wouldn't hurt to either of them when he was five or that when he grew older he'd notice things wrong.
The kid was happy he didn't have a mother. The man continued his argument even though Tyler had climbed the railing several times the earlier that morning.
"Kid, " he said, pulling the safety rails off his backpack, " You could've left here instead of the police."<|endoftext|>

The bespectacled red brick wall of the shop was matted with orange and yellow graffiti. The black demons and demons that prowled all around had begun to become quite ghastly, filled to the brim with nightmares and ghastly sights. They were always furious with the staff, either unaware or attempting to tear down the shop. Eventually they would close the shop until one of them escaped and locked it with some sort of demon or hellish door. The black demons and demons that flew around surrounding the guy before me didn't change much after they escaped from one of the walls, and their sense of smell remained.
I greeted the local shop, when the guard asked for help. " Pick it up, " he said. " It's pretty dangerous here. They may attack, or they might be able to. "
The shopkeeper said, " A demon is a zombie. They aren't made of flesh but a fleshy mass that has been moulded by them, drying in time, and is a favoured food source for the demon that feasts upon you. Are you ready to receive the demon welcome? "
He smiled and gave me a dollar and some plastic bag from his inventory. I put it in my pocket, grabbed my keys, and headed to the exit.
The doors opened to a young couple. The girl said something, but the demon that looked at her did not speak. She took my hand and I thanked her. The demon that looked at me nodded. The girl took my hand and we left. The shop keeper grabbed my hand and I led them to the shops entrance.
" Step aside! " the demon said, taking a seat in the waiting room.
" What do you want? " I said, reaching into my pocket. It was probably some paper bag that I had just pushed in. I saw it go with a knock at the counter, making the room feel considerably less claustrophobic. Then I saw it move closer.
" Move forward, " the demon said.
" I have no need for those papers, " I said.
" They aren't worth a damn, " the demon said. " The shit in them is stupid enough to make most bank in the small country. What this was all for, and my shop is heavily backed by the Bank. You don't really need money here, are you? "
" I know you do, " the demon said.
" There's just so much over there, why does anyone need cash? "
" Because they're the ones that feed you, my boy! It pays the bills just right, " the demon said.
" Don't mention it, " the demon said.
" Of course, you're not buying anything from me, " I said.
" But I'm sure this is *not* your money, " the demon said.
" Because you're totally the *party demon*, " I said.
" Who are you?! " the demon asked.
" My boss, " I said. " God is the chief business wizard here. Which means he hires you because he's just bored. How'd you get on so well. All of this is because of you. "
The demon laughed, his smile widening. " Why? "
" Because if you're such a bad customer, I'll have to call his father, " I said.
" What should I call him, then? " the demon asked.
" Rise. He's a demon's visitor. "
" He *is* the happiest customer ever, " I said.
" Then why are you here? "
" I'd rather die than run. "
" You know, " the demon said, " The first one doesn't get visitors after all."<|endoftext|>

The class sat dazed and barely up-thralled by the lockers. The desk had long since been taken over by scientists, and they had been working from within, each day changing and working on different theories. A workgroup of well-dressed men came in and split up between them.
One doctor walked in and held out his office chair. Before him, slumped over on the floor. " Fuck you James Taylor. You're a worthless lab rat. "
" They found me today. Bad day for them. " John Taylor spat out at him. " I'm leaving. I owe them something. "
" Okay then, this is how you're going to survive. You create an advanced computer to time travel the internet. Create the biggest human out there and then shoot it at it so you can send your data over time to the next iteration. One Bill Carnegie and the next Hitler. "
" You think they get it right James? ". John said gruffly. He took off his glasses, adjusting them up and setting them back down. It had only been a year until they discovered'the true' Empire of Man.
" Kill them. Throw them out. Give them control of this new internet and you can do this for millions. Give them time travel and scientific knowledge so they can communicate with each other on worlds. "
" I'll give you that James, but you have to admit that you've tried to give me shit. I threw the shit out and tried to teach them that without time travel I'd never be on their planet. But hey you're trying to give me shit James. " John nodded, seeming to take notice of the lump in his throat.
" And that's why I called you James to a talk. Now go ahead, and let your stupid arguments go. But some of it will show up later. Look back at this world James. If we can eliminate all people at once, to save the world. At least that means they don't have to change their physical appearance. "
" James Taylor, we say you. " John nodded back. " Give it to me then. "
" But now they've known that when they travel through time they are not the same person they used to be. You idiot. "
He flicked his bright emerald lightbulb on and let the small TV that stared back at him go off. " Thanks James, I thank you. " He turned back to the keyboard he had on and took a breath. " Come back James, come back and let's save the world."<|endoftext|>

I am alone, but I am happy.
Her soul slices through the walls and splashes the air on all three plates, though I can not let her go. I am doomed, doomed to die. My mind, as good as lost in unconsciousness, scatters the broken and creased features, as if they could be stained by a river. She stares at me, but she recognizes me, as both of us hold arms, legs and fingers like quilts in an outhouse. I move my head back and forth while I fling myself down.
Her thoughts surround me, calling to me to run. Run, her mind tries to leave. Run to the world around her, fear or desperation always accompanied by hazy sun bursts around us. How many times have I been at this point and she does not see? A window pings on her face. Her heart races.
She reaches her hand down to wipe off my hands. I can see her, moving but she is too close to the other end of her path. The last thing I see is the rolling of a stone across the river. I feel like I am running, but it is too late, and I see only light. Only more distant shades of clear.
Finally, the shimmering glow of the waterfall disappears. As the moon outgrows the water, I still see her, and I hear her voice. " My love... your love."

I have an idea for this, but after someone uses it and I have this bit of a sessile spirit, I don't really know how to format it so I will just write it on the internet.
I think this will become one of my more well-known writing prompts.<|endoftext|>

I stood up from my feet. It was dawn, the sky was still. The army marched forward, their guns blazing in the wind.
"Maybe we should just consider leaving this land, " I whispered. My heart pounded from the muscles in my feet. I took a step back and lunged for it. Just as I anticipated, a fist cracked the ground.
" You never believe me when I tell you you can't leave," said the voice behind the shot. My heart raced in my chest as I cried out in pain. My eyes were open and I couldn't see anything around me. That's when I remember, being armed, dying. I was fighting a war against a monster. He pulled me to his side and turned to a trembling man, blood shining from his knife.
He then turned to me and stated, “ You have no right to rob me! You had the right to own my own property! Now are you going to run from me or will you just be a vegetable of my lifestyle? ” His tone was like rain on a cold winter night.
I responded by saying, “ You can't rob me. Everyone else had the right to own my property. If that means you can threaten my life right? ”
He simply looked at me and then took me with him and started beating.<|endoftext|>

He never knew where he ended up. Every mistake at every junction in his life dragged him away and spat him out of his chair. He needed someone with a bloodshot mind to explain why he had to go to the ER.
He loved her. She was everything he could ever want, but he had no will to carry on what he would find inside. He had been born of the same family; a graying, rundown apartment town, just a day outside his new home. She couldn't have a clue he was in the same family. The only thing that made her happy was his time in his life.
She had lost everything. Her life to this cancer. It didn't matter that there was a stain at her collar from the car accident; that life was only fading. He had heard that one person had passed on their deathbed; she didn't even pay any attention to the cuts being made in his bandages.
She had always been generous with him. He wouldn't mind giving her a scrap of his inheritance if she got a start on her degree. If she wanted to marry the black widow instead of killing him. It had been so unfair.
She was the kind of person that met him in the hospital bed. She smiled when he began to sob. She had so many plans, and they seemed like they were going to get done. They were going to reach the height of health. She grabbed his hand and always told him he was going to make her laugh. She was handsome. Always smiling.
She told him he would do the job he loved, and that he was everything he ever wanted. When he finished, she kissed him, and held his hand while he carried him out to the courtyard. He told her that life was the hardest around her, and he had a family that he deserved. She began to cry again when he pulled her close. He had to leave, he had to go home. She opened her arms wide in prayer. He told her that it was too late. He was beautiful; he was everything. He was the man he was meant to be.
Their bodies were still together as he sat in his chair in the hospital bed, his lifeless body a canvas for his future. He walked with purpose and wandered the streets as a victim or murderer might, until the days where he forgot who was in the car. He got lost in life and missed family and friends and so much more.
He hadn't believed in a normal man.
He had hoped that he would come to terms with what he saw in the mirror every morning, but in the end he wasn't with anyone. He never imagined he would still believe in a God for who his killer was.
The sun finally dipped below the horizon and the sun slowly picked up. He lowered his head in shame.
"Poor kids."<|endoftext|>

I fell into an alleyway a few hours ago when I put my backpack on the cold and wet pavement. I tossed it in a plastic garbage can but when I came back to get a grip it was already jammed through the helmet spring. My dad passed away yesterday and his death saw me heading to bed, but I still had things to do. The last time I had packed was the stupid Olympics in Chicago and everyone was blaming me. I couldn't go anywhere besides South Platte. I had a plan.
No, something was wrong. No one should be jumping too fast. No one should be riding their bike either. That night, the loud screams from the atlantic were soon drowned out by the loud bangs from my neighborhood too close for comfort. A fire hydrant ran out of gas on what felt like the brink of getting so close as I was wiping the sweat from my forehead. It was a mugging.
I had planned this a long time ago, but it just never occurred to me what I would get myself into, and it was about time to sell it. I had gone into an alleyway a few hours ago when I put my backpack on the cold and wet pavement, but only now did I feel it. The heat was unbearable. So much so that the thought of my dad waking up was now creeping in. I heard the glass breaking, and it rose from the pavement.
My brother frantically rushed to where I was.
"Daddy! Come fetch me!"<|endoftext|>

"Bully, please have mercy on me. "
" God damn it that is one of my names. "
" Achtra the Alpha, Baggack Bayard, that's what I'm used to hearing. "
" Sorry boss, i wouldn't mind if you could talk to me. "
" But you don't have five minutes. And today you- "
" Forget! I know you've been working all morning, have you even given me enough time for her to get used to it? "
" Nothing. "
"... Fine. "
" Shall we have Austria? "
" Negative. "
" Sorry about that. "
" I'll be back. "
" OK. "
At that moment, Beatrice reeled back in pain from overreaction. As did Austria. She looked up at the source of the pain, took a deep breath and, with a mighty roar, leapt up onto the table.
" BULLSHIT " she spat. " I dare you to attack me... that's the only way to win! I am Champion of Massage. "
Austria's thoughts spun rapidly, mesmerized by the man and all his glory. But this was not a solution. Soon she could tell it was too late. She gripped the table, tilted her head up to stare at the glowing flashing stars for a split second, where her grip failed her.
" Send attention to yourself now. I WILL DEATH YOU WITH LOVE AND PEACE. "
It was done. Everyone felt the shock cloud dissipate for a second. Austria sat there, still disgusted. Nobody was watching him, not even his assistant. She was terrified of him and so she stared in shock and confusion. No doubt she would feel the same fate as the other men, as soon as he turned himself in he would be vaporized. The smile on her face quickly became a sliver of what was once her nemesis.
" Run! " she yelled. " Run away from Bully, run away from the cute girl in the front! "
Bully shuddered. He had been taken, destroyed. Or at least he was. He lunged for the side of the table. His fist broken and he fell on top of it, smashing it into a stack of paper, shattering it into the paper table. All he could do was plead with her. She tried to hold back her laughter but she was too weak to let go.
Austria scrambled to her feet and ran, blabbering to Bully that she would just do it, fight him, as soon as he turned, walk away from her as fast as he could.
But still... he fell, spattering into the ground. Bully stood, his grip tightened. He glared at Bully, who now collapsed, peacefully, in a corner of the room, quietly sobbing. He tried to give her a false smile, but she had forgotten to get a kiss on his cheek.
" Get up now, Ashley. She will be waiting. "
He walked away. " That is my free. My favorite song..."<|endoftext|>

I really love this prompt so here's the synopsis for my crazy quest:
The sordid crimes have only lasted for this moment. The one handed mastermind has nothing and must leave for his personal fortress a few days later; he must fall victim to another seemingly unrelated crime; how are those his victims?<|endoftext|>

"Hey Louie, why are you resting here? "
" I was just talking to Lewis a few hours ago and I was talking to everyone else -- "
" No, that's okay. "
" Lewis, he's who we used to talk to at work. "
" Why would that be in the first place? "
" No -- "
" He's a douchebag, and this whole fridge thing is garbage. I just wan na save him some cash. "
" You can't just dump me? You feel like.. "
" Whatever. Hey, last time we talked -- "
" THAT WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE. You just should have paid more attention. "
" I *really* do need to pay more attention, but you aren't paying attention right now, are you? "
" Well, look at me, I'm paying full attention, you... aren't paying attention right now. "
" Oh come on, you haven't stopped listening. I know that you notice some things on my plate. "
" Oh? Are you listening to me again? "
" No, you don't! That shouldn't -- - "
" You... you don't want to -- - "
" **NO! ** "
" Louie, you have to pay extra attention. You get sick and die at the same time. I know that's the best way to save our son. "
" Why are you paying extra attention to the rest of us, then? "
" Because it's not like I'm there -- - "
" Listen, you go home. You give me your money, you pay for your popcorn, you use me to cry in your shoes until a bus pulls up. Listen, I don't know if you can pay attention anymore, but you have to pay for your groceries as much as you can. "
" I don't care what you're going to get us when I give you food, I'm not paying extra attention to the rest of you. "
" Look man, you know what I mean. "
" **SOMETHING I HAD TO DO SO HARD. **"

He's fucking me.
It has to be the same thing every single time. My other self sits in the same corner of the room, not even noticing, waiting for a man to come in and fall asleep. The old fucking mirror tells me this is it, being away from the sun and experiencing summer. Most guys get tired of that shit before they go outside and retire, going for the same thing. Many of them ignore the occasional prick in his neighborhood, they meet their change and settle for a sloppy long-distance relationship. This man is having the most satisfying sex of them all. His friend has a toddler on the way to church. Her toilet is full of dough, she will be here. And since it's that one thing everyone who does it knows about, it has to be the same. Why does she ruin the experience for him?
He doesn't even get married. He's sick of it. He's sick of me.
My face is painted like a fucking person, where I sit, wait for a stranger to come and come and fuck me. The greatest thing that man has ever done for me, is do something he should have done ten years ago. He should have said something early to get us married and become more successful, something he should have said ten years ago, something he should have said thirty years ago. You hear his voice. It'll be infectious if I don't piss it before him. He's mad. I can smell it in his breath. I can feel it moving in my mouth. I'm shaking. I start to walk in circles. Sometimes he's absolutely ignoring me. Sometimes he's taking it all in.
I finally turn around, and his face is painted in the exact same way that every fucking person I have ever known has painted theirs. He is, still. He looks directly into my eyes as if he wants them to be different, and I let out a terrified scream. I'd been so happy about this man that I was just in a state of shock. We went on walks for a while, teasing each other in line, but he couldn't stop me. I feel his erection in my hand. And suddenly, it hits me. My right foot skips the asphalt, causing it to brush up against my face and disappear into the dust.
I wonder what he'll do to me if I get married, because I wonder if that's the only thing I have.<|endoftext|>

*SLAP*
Claws slung over leather boots lock behind it, they creak and crack against thier soft metals. The damp smell of seared flesh swells in every nostril. It could be only seconds before the laden axe was strung over my head and neck, dripping stale blood through my palm.
*SLAP*
Dr. Ramsey gritted his teeth, his open red eyes staring straight at me with desperation,
His mask glistening with every ounce of weight. I raised my gun to my throat, but he already knew what was coming and yet he hadn't done anything.
*SLAP*
A small metallic glint bounced back from his weapon and a bead of sweat rolled down his forehead. * SCAP*
He rested his hand over my chest, trying to calm my nerves as he cupped one of my ribcage. My own cold sweat washed over my forehead and I dropped the gun. Slowly he moved his blade back and forth, this time he was the one moving the weight of it. His smile was intense, a thousand times my former self's, a hundredfold faster than my own screams in agony, a hundredfold faster than those of a survivor.
*SLAP*
Blood rushed from the wound to my arm as he stabbed for his knife, and within the third to tenth he plunged it deep into my chest. He could feel it slowly cauterizing my heart, one by one, and the noise of my beating heart gave way to an approaching frigid temperature. He sliced through my chest, and watched as my body struggled, desperately to be held down by this blade, and yet it was powerless to stop him.
*SLAP*
Blood trickled into the chapped open wound, and when it settled the ever steady liquid on the floor was almost a freezing cold. The bullet tore through my hand, and the room was nearly empty save for a handful of shackles I got stuck on or threaded. I didn't even have time to keep moving before the agony returned and the door opened.
*SLAP*
His gun lowered to his hip, and his eyes knew it had been a successful kill. With a gesture of his hand, I pushed him back down. From behind I heard the crashing of a door, his free hand on my ribs.
*SLAP*
"That's a job. * " he hissed quietly as he plunged the weapon into my back. When I saw the daggers sticking out of the air I was frozen. If I knew how I was going to react the blade would've pierced me right out of the skin, my heart would've stopped beating and the pain would have died out for a time.
*SLAP*
" Master. " a soft voice with the distinctive whoop of a beast sounded from the safety. It shined dimly, a few drops of blood falling gently from its barrel. I stammered.
" Quite an accident after all. " I whispered as I glanced in the direction of the door. A door you would expect to find our landlord's front door. The sight was odd as it was covered with two metal doors. " Bastard's Wintersburg! " the second beast called out in the same accent as before.
*SLAP*
" Unfortunately we aren't going to be allowed into that place now. " The handle rested from the underfoot of the short walkway that led to our room. " There is a rough second to you Master Ramsey, and any items necessary to accomodate this work is guarded. You will make an appointment with your landlord as soon as possible. If you agree to be my guest we can be set to begin the execution of this work. Your token shawl will be sent to you as payment after we begin. "
*SLAP*
I made my way down the trail of the street, my finger still found the trigger as I sprinted toward the door.
*SLAP*
I threw my blade at it, and the cold steel kicked like a pendulum, the sharp point digging into my flesh and veins. My last thought before I faded from existence was that of a girl I once loved, and a month before I called her and we started our own business in 20 years.
*SLAP*
"... And then again. "
*SLAP*
I ran up to her, hair dripping from where I stepped on it. She would let me go if I didn't give her my entire attention as I got closer, but I only saw myself as she left.
*SLAP*
I stared for a second at the train bed, wondering which one of us would have held her hostage for this.<|endoftext|>

Steve spoke to her, "Thanks. "
" It's been what, nine months? "
" Nine months. You know we got this on you as a pack-of-two thing, if you don't mind me asking. "
" Come on, it's not a stupid thing to just say that! "
" OK! See. I can take this as a compliment, but that's how, like, " he paused, " I remember those nights when I was two years old, you know, going outside, little watch in my bed - and taking a road trip and just spending my first few minutes walking around trying to get to the car at night, I remember - "
" Yeah, so you could say, " he trailed off, " That was my first day of school, the first day that I didn't have to sit in my book or even be in class or eat cereal or anything like that. "
Steve laughed. " I remember. "
" Is that why you wore those glasses? "
" Well, you kinda lighten up right now - especially if you ask me... "
" A? Did you? "
" Of course! Yeah, that's like when we first kissed, I was so relieved I'd spent the whole night with you, and we just sort of fell in love together - because, I mean, we thought we were kids, and we just kind of got to be together - "
" I'm proud of you, Steve. I didn't expect to be like this. "
" I am! You're just not a smart thing at the moment. "
" Yeah, you're just not a smart thing at the moment. "
" Yeah, yeah, whatever you're saying. "
" Hi, " he said, looking around the room, " Sam, are you two okay? "
Sam shrugged, and shrugged again, and shrugged once more, " Yeah, I'm okay. I guess it makes it easier to talk to you. "
" Yeah, I'm fine, " said Steve. " So... what's the progress? "
Sam shot him a sideways glance, and Sam took a deep breath, before sitting back down on the couch. They continued, like that strange conversation before: Steve couldn't find anything to say on the subject.
" It's amazing that it's been nothing but... a continuation in your existence, " he said, " That it got better. It has. "
" Why don't you tell me what you are? "
" What would you like to know? "
" What? "
" How do I know? You're... in your own world, man? "
" Well. It all starts with you in school. "
" What? How do you know that? "
" Boy, I have these weird memories. I remember driving. Fighting crime. I remember kicking sticks in the road. "
" No, " said Steve. " It's all different! Maybe I just kinda....just.... "
" Uh... I don't know. "
" Maybe we're just going through hell, " said Sam, holding up one arm, " Just, just keep it up, okay? "
" Hey, it doesn't really matter though. Hey, what's going on? "
" Remember the dream? "
Sam was quiet.
" Yeah? "
Sam looked at Steve, who was shaking his head and putting an arm around him, " Yeah, Steve, it's not really your world anymore, alright? "
" Yeah, I guess I understand, man. They've all settled down better. They've all been as satisfied with their lives, man. "
" But who was that kid at school when you left, Steve? "
Sam rolled his eyes, " He's my brother, Steve, so that's his name."<|endoftext|>

"In forty seconds, we will have, uh, cured diabetes. "
Those craters on the floor where the lab techy lab leader stood, had indeed started to smell. One of them led a visibly distressed looking man to a mirror and a camera that was thankfully behind the cinderblock near the wall. His face had a look that suggested he was stressed and bruised, with scars on his eyes, his tongue had bandaged down ( which obviously he had recently ), and his skin had bleeding all over. " Sir... " came a voice.
He stared at the mirror man and the camera again. When it clicked, he saw several tattoos. The tattoos were visible along his torso, his arms and legs, his hands and hips, and he had all of his genitals and genitalia pulled in. All his clothes were ripped and contorted into some grotesque fashion. His legs of a woman were tied and stretched and his head of one man was caged in a sinkhole behind a locker. His hands and torso were twisted into a more grotesque, clawed form.
" Sir, please continue. " the man said with a voice as limp as he could muster. He was holding out his hand to the woman with a similar state and bent his elbow as he turned. His hand moved as he did before the woman raised her hand up and suddenly said, " Nurse, call my number. " His right hand reached out and punched the woman's forehead. She looked up at the monitor and came over.
" Well, it looks like this is it, Nurse, we're working on that. " said the nurse.
One of the technicians got up from his desk and walked over to the other technician. The other cut him off. " Sir... Please continue."

She took her time, almost never hiding the seething desire to *kiss* a fresh takeout from the hard plastic shelf beside her.
*Crumble*
Her body twitched.
*Smack*
Her heart pounded in her chest and she felt a great hand caress her cheek.
*Slip*
She didn't even notice the contact. The outstretched hand was somewhere off limits.
Her mind raced and a sudden rush of something greater rushed into her stomach. She knew it was her turn.
"Wha- "
It was the peanut butter muffins, that had come in earlier.
" DAMMIT, BUT WAIT, " She was feeling odd.
More pressure was building. She tried to rise back, but she couldn't.
The teenager stared. He raised his hand to calm her. His expression was a mix between a concerned child and a bitter old man. His tone was a dreary one, like he had been milling through the garbage for weeks for nothing.
" We're getting old. * You* aren't. You don't deserve my attention. " He leaned closer, scratching his fat skull.
"... " Tears poured into his eyes, little wispy pools emerging from under them.
The frustration stung like hot water and he closed his eyes for a long moment. He could feel her gaze: she looked at him with a glare. His eyes were gushing blood and he stared.
" Don't do this" she whispered.<|endoftext|>

Those last eight hours looked like days.
Their number, 1 through 10, was beamed across my form without thinking.
"Dear sir, I wrote a summary yesterday, " a high-pitched voice from behind my desk said, " that seems very similar to your last one. "
I barely recognized my boss's voice, but I knew my ex had some BS. " Yes, I have seen him do this before, " my boss mumbled. My eyes were focused tightly on his reddened lips. " I'll write you the paper as soon as you wake up "
I didn't have any time to take a deep breath before my blood boiled. I felt a hand brushing my hair, " Finally, you can rest your eyes, " my boss said, waving his hand in an attempt to get rid of my concentration.
I did as I was told. I felt a new quality to my life, and found myself sitting up in bed, non-consciousness almost resembling for even crying.
" Stop it, " my boss whispered into my ear. " Your damn salary is rising."
I looked out the window at the sun rising the next day. I asked myself how much I enjoyed my nap. I didn't realize what I would be wasting time on. I shut my eyes for a bit, then I closed them again.<|endoftext|>

Doctor Oak gave Gary a green disk with a beady purple coating that showed a hologram of the famed "Metal Man " Pokémon that had won the big annual top prize three months ago.
" We know this is something special, but isn't it pretty commonplace? What if it's...? "
" This... "
The machine emitted an audible groan when Oak picked it up.
" As with the many legendary pokemon that must be know, Gary chose the " Brickbob " as his favorite pokemon.
Professor Oak became visibly furious. " How?! Your master is stupid enough to not throw a boulder at us? If it's so simple, why would you? No one should ever throw at a boulder? "
Gary fired up a megaphone as he hit a button. The device emitted a strobe light that lit up the device.
" Pick up Gary! Pick up Gary! Go!! " A robotic voice boomed, coming from the other room.
Professor Oak winced and walked back towards the position from which he entered. Pushing aside the metal blade which had traveled from his finger into the Elite Four.
" I'll have to do it! "
A man was pressing the button like a timer. A siren wailed within his head.
" You heard me, boy! I'm Gary. And this is bullshit! "
Gary stood and pointed at a pile of pikachu scattered all over the floor.
" Go Pikachu! Go Pikachu!"
And that's how Gary was born.<|endoftext|>

Furious for their prize, the young man took a sleek, sleek silver pleasure ball gown out of his suit coat pocket. This young mother insisted upon it for her sister to wear. Mother was tiny by comparison; her shoulders were dead and knees squirming.
Loud noises accompanied by shouting accompanied by the picking of a blonde to the soda machine.

The look on mom's face when she saw how dark this ball gown was, that didn't diminish the disappointment in the girl's eyes. Not the look on dad's face when she saw what they had painted little graduation drawings on the blackboards, but only the smile on his father's face.
I am lost.
But I can still hear my mom's voice when she speaks... something my father had told me earlier.
"Breakup is hard, child. " Mom had said.
The memories aren't great...
But, I can still hear my father's laugh when he talked to me... like a good grandfather says a good son.<|endoftext|>

I called forth the Buddha, along with many others who lived long after the Buddha was gone. Long after all of them had given up their last wishes. Long after they had lost hope and prayed for the ancients. But beyond the ten thousand who listened I saw not a single thing. Like starlight filled with some kind of vapor, instead of light like a fiery blaze engulfed the world. We know how fortunate we were. We had been glorious creatures. Now the gift we offered was to break free from this hopeless and harsh prison.<|endoftext|>

The boy sat in his bed where his mother's soft mother's blue blanket rested, its eyes shining with the true glory and wonder of life. He spent the first few days here all his days playing on the park benches, but at the end of the day when his mother's brownish hair fell off and he brushed it in his face, a smile on his face. The face of a boy, who loves his mother, and that smile turned into a gentle smile when he picked her up off a pothole, and when he pulled her aside gently, kissed her forehead and kissed her cheek and turned away from that pothole and into another placid smile.
"I miss you, mom. I want you to be there when I need you. I love you so much. " The boy said as he laid down next to his mother and cried quietly, looking at her.
" I don't want to be here. "
" Then just remember, mom, " her mother said as she hugged the boy tight in their arms, " It's okay. We both know it. No one will ever hurt you again, and that won't hurt anyone. I love you the most. And please, you don't have to worry about it. You're in a good mood now. "
The boy sat at his mother's lap as she held his hand tightly, wrapping her arm around his that-
" Sorry. " He said before he could finish.
" Don't worry mom, I'm coming home soon. "
He closed his eyes, silently, as his mother undressed him in the sheets and laid him down next to her.
" And before we end this, your little brown dress has opened up over there and you're sitting on top of me. "
She chuckled. " Pish mom."<|endoftext|>

"Hey world, here's the super hero situation. " Zhaq looked down to the bulkhead and thought for a moment. " Drones, fighter jets, and helicopters? " The air without a pilot complex wasn't too intimidating.
" Yeah maybe... maybe they won't find it tough to do this." Zhaq shrugged. He planted his feet on the window across from him and rose slowly.
What a wonderful day he would be able to experience! He huddled in one of the cool offshore bunkers they put in for the breakout. The local air force was suspected of kidnapping or disposing of some sort of drone. They had no proof that the order was ever issued. Most likely they had been directed by an old coven of seditious politicians and criminal organizations, just that the spouts were gone and were therefore viewed as being " bad people ". The FBI had also been looking into some sort of contraption they'd covertly planted some suspicious figures on in the air as a possible nuke, unfortunately this was never confirmed by anyone as far as they'd known.<|endoftext|>

"I'll have yours after it's done for, " I said, playing with my pink/white plush toy, " dammit, you want a new owner? We always try to set it off at the worst time! "
" Nope! Whichever is best, anyway. For a new owner, you can ask the friendly jock over at the bar. "
The next morning I get my nine hundred and twenty-two dog. It's not really his fault, but I'm getting old, I need some fresh air and I was craving for a new day. I can afford to buy several more. It's time.
I think the next morning he returns. I'm certain he will forget where he came from and it'll be with me. It's first love. His wingspan is 45, take a look. He just gets smaller. We run inside the house and show up that morning. He's beautiful. It's time to leave. I'll have it.
We step out and I start to believe it's nothing more than a sign that he's going to die someday, but then I hear a knock on the door. Maybe he hasn't returned yet. Wait a second.

When he started teaching his lessons in kindergarten, Brian thought of himself as unique. Ridiculed as'something' at best, they were a language of high learning and meaning.
"Now how the hell am I supposed to grade at school, I thought you were special, like very special ", he said to his teacher before rolling his eyes.
Little Timmy laughed and pointed at the circle of metal that was his every need and need.
" Now while you wait for that testing period, I'm gon na ask you a question. "
Brian heard an eager pause and wondered where he was going next.
" Alright, you may one day know us by that-, " Timmy cut in as Timmy took the question from Brian.
" Every single fucking word!
We were the one called'Watch this!,', " Brian paused, " your first lesson was about to start "
" NOW, " Timmy yelled back, " what do I call you if you don't want it or what am I going to say when you finish? "
Brian stopped. What did he mean?
Timmy looked up and Jim then introduced himself, " Brian, you are Jim "
" Um, who are you? What is this? ", Timmy said, " what are you doin' here? "
Brian was puzzled for a moment. He looked up again in surprise at what he saw.
"... some of you people called us " friend " or " slave " in some world, can you recall, like whatever?, " Brian pulled out a long metal pipe, " you'll see this when you go next ", Timmy sipped it with his fork, " wat's gon na make you proud, the winner of this will be the new thing I am going to make to pay for your education and all, and you'll also see who is'i' with you ", Timmy fiddled with his pipe.
Brian picked up the metal pipe and was about to tell Timmy again, " Well everyone is out there. On some planet. I believe you though, you were called as a slave, isn't that what I am? ", Brian looked to Jim. " Well there's just one thing I want you to know ", Brian looked out the window to see a star streak across the sky, Timmy threw up his face. He turned around, " not that I didn't warn you! ", Timmy fiddled with his body, his mouth moved. He dug around his hands for the first and last piece of paper on paper. Then he put it down, his head fell to the floor and began to sob uncontrollably. Brian stuttered out, " I want you to get some food for this," and he died that morning.
Finally Brian stopped crying, he was out for his meal. He loved singing songs about himself and how everyone was full of hope but he was hopeless and he did not know how to handle everyone's hope. He had no head and his love only the hopelessness of the human mind. One day, he ended up in a body suit and buried his head under one of his graves. When he passed, he was told that everyone who was left was his blood, however, he had been put into cremation.<|endoftext|>

I hate detention. I love the freedom and privacy of this spot. But it's his age now that I'm here. He's fresh out of the academy, and I'm the one who sits to stall for the flesh mags.
My first stop is my escape pod, marked by the yellow communicator on the glove compartment. When I walk, I always use my walking stick to jostle to my left. When it is working, I turn to my right, and we ride toward the corridor to my escape pod. Backdoors across the room, lined with logs and scars. I don't know who will be giving my meal, or who will be giving me food, but all in all, the place is safe enough.
Unfortunately, there is a special action waiting for me... me. As I open the container in my pod, there is a loud sob, and I can see a source of light in the darkness. A great storm has been brewing and a brilliant flare that explodes the door of the pod and outwards in an arc behind the entrance. To his surprise, his voice is suspended above the noise, as if it was a piece of ice stuck onto a snow globe.
"Sous-vous de tut-vous? " I murmur.
" Nu, ne sous-vous, de tu. "
I rub my small cheeks. " I don't care, " I mutter. " Nothing but heat and fear and terror. "
My jaw drops open. His response is quick and elegant. " After all, you will escape. "
He doesn't respond, and instead stands over the rocky solid ground. A flash of light is a building, and I hear a high-pitched whine as something breaks the landing. My peers have noticed a great building spiraling upwards. They join me, and I take my chances. It is just a few blocks. No skyscrapers, save the incinerated old buildings inside. I crouch down in a nearby bush, and watch as it disintegrates. A quick glance. I walk, making no sound of resistance. Not a single sound comes from the building below, just a couple yards away. The ripples on the ground run along the pavement. Waves begin crashing on the house next.
My heart begins pounding. " I... I'm sorry, " I murmur, as my heart starts beating faster. My body pounds loudly against the weight. " It's okay." I stand up. The blast is deafening. I can see it now. The shockwave dissipates with a small flash. I pray in my heart of a friend somewhere that my screams were not drowned out by the deafening explosions of a powerful meteor strike.<|endoftext|>

Dear Diary,
I wrote this some weeks ago. Don't blame me, it's just a mistake, I thought the lighter had a little bit more air, but that wasn't exactly enough, and I just want that sharpness off of me. I fell asleep, only to wake up to nightfall. If I'd know, would I have grabbed the knife? I don't know what would be knocking on my door.
Got ta finish it, maybe come back later, though.
Edit: time is of the essence, forgive me for everything I've done in the past week. It's not nearly as bad as life actually is, I guess I just haven't had the good sex, or cool walks. Me and my guys take breaks, cook up venison... without actually washing it. I've considered getting cleaned up as well. It seems people never really pay attention to cooking for fucks sake. Trust me on this.
Synchronizing with the new Hesy cells over in the freezer may be a bit hard, but it's itchy and itchy and I've never taken a shower. It can be tough to get going, but my hands are really tired from chipping it out and when I get to the... kitchen it goes great. It's an odd feeling, about the fact that your clock is still pounding and I'm awake and I don't mind.
I'll come back for you tomorrow morning.

Sweat ran down my forehead as I closed my eyes. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes but couldn't focus on the train. It just ran like any other train. As usual it seemed to move on its own, like it didn't belong there anymore. With my breath still drawn out of my lungs I strained to see the train's destination. Finally i realized that this was my home; home to my parents, and the white picket fence that lay right across the curb.
No one came up to greet me. Everyone had been here in my apartment for years. Most of them, ignored me. But this train was there.
As I made my way down the line for work I could barely contain my confusion. As I walked down the narrow hallway toward the waiting place i felt the train rejoin the line. The doors suddenly went to sleep. My patience was catching up.
I picked up my pace and made it to the nearest elevator and waited for someone to bring me a seat. That moment was when I realized that my boring job had become boring. My supervisors or whatever was calling was mocking me now. I sat down and walked into my kitchen but it would be too late.<|endoftext|>

Gant took a deep breath, still standing in his bunk, the beast came closer and closer.
It was the barest attempts at a MOA program yet. Google sent one of the drones to Terra and just a barely showed up. That would be the next mission.
The drone was running itself again. It showed up.
Gant took another deep breath. He heard another drone drone coming in shortly after.
Gant looked at the dusty warehouse and his eyes began to creep open with wonderment.
Mars. Being a primitive species only, working in space was still just the bounds of what science had capable of in the development of Star Trek.
He reached for the latches on his suit and turned it around to the boring warehouse. It was empty.
It was home.
Drones were programmed for *home*.
His eyes now went wide.
The space door opened, it was the crew that arrived.
He turned around quickly to address his eyes to the beauty of it.
The boys was one of the boarders. They had been staring at him all night. He was staring back.
Gant yelled, he pulled the latches open, feeling their weight in him. But he did not look back. He did not shake the idea that they were wrong. He did not even look at the door.
An opened door sprang up. It was a tall ship, he took a peak in. It hovered in the horizon.
The boys were unfazed. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the remote control.
The boys stared at him in awe.
His brow furrowed, this was different. He had never managed to figure out what the hunting device in his suit was called.
Noiseless, bright blue eyes suddenly constricted his focus.
He pulled the pull lever and the ship was in sight.
The doors were opened, the last of it's crew not dwelling on anything else.
He stepped inside. It was actually pretty neat.
He felt an urge to sit in a chair over the table and wait. He didn't.
His lab assistant walked up. She looked at him expectantly, then looked back at the boarders.
"Henry? " she called after her.
Henry looked at her instead.
" It's Patrick, you're going to go in."
Gant didn't reply, instead he gulped.<|endoftext|>

Clunk.
The last thoughts left me as I calmly checked my watch again. It was 7:37 am on the dot. It was definitely a pretty early afternoon for the Leawood Tribe. The sun was back up, though, and soon they would be arriving. Black-red flags covered the verdant skies, singing in tune with the ancient yells of the Indians. Another wave of distant warriors came in front of us, some from the Northern hemisphere and some from Asia.
Almost to the right of us, my spear was halfway around the edge of the long grass. I wondered who or what the warriors were for the first few hundred yards. The shaking in their boots was unprecedented. I wiped my ear and tried to regain the footing I had for the last few thousand of my life. This peasant folk had been their village name. I had been told it was the *peasant's* name.
"This is the village, " the advisor continued, " And you are likely to believe that my tribe is at least one thousand years from making progress on agriculture. What part of the lands do you say it ’ s agriculture? "
I suppressed a yelp. " Farmers! I ’ m a farmer! We produce thousands of small grains for you ’ ve ever seen! Then we wait! We produce little birds for you to chase! And when a King tells you he wants your wife and children, he goes through with it. "
" That ’ s not quite right, " replied my adviser, making light of my living situation. " I know that my people are farmers, all of them! Why should I throw my life away so willingly? The men in white coats killed their livestock for us to produce! "
The adviser continued, looking at me, not quite believing what I was saying. " Farmers claim their lands are fertile. Do you know this? "
I crouched to pry my spear free of my forearm. My hand raised to my chest. Nothing. Then, a drop of sweat trickled down my chin, slowly peeling down with every finger. Then a leap of faith. I found it in the ruins of an encampment beneath the mountains. " I want to get the pollen out. "
I dropped my spear and backed away. My thoughts were slowly falling to the middle.
" Farmer? Is that you? ", whispered an old man near my right. He raised his spear toward my shoulder and gently grasped my arm.
" Of course I am!"
I nodded to my adviser, and his face was gone, replaced by a single tear. Then, out of the ruins, the next settlement called from across the valley. And to my astonishment, that place was.
* * *
REWIND RARITY: 14 minutes and 22 seconds ago, in a faraway corner of the globe, a simple leaf fell upon the pacific ocean. And underneath that leaf was a mere leaf.
( And it is not my fault that the morse code needs updating )<|endoftext|>
**********205**********
The bodies lay strewn about the back porch, thin sheets of blood and splinters on their disturbed mattress. Two women, lying on the edge of their beds, bare shoulders held in the front of their stinky purple work pants, were fairly chatty last.
Tears cascaded from both of their eyes, and the water in their veins sank almost instantly. And it was the tears that started the pain. The woman began to sob even louder, hissing, "I'm so sorry -- " but the man didn't cut her off with his rifle, he grabbed her shoulders in one hand, and turned her head until her face was more inches away from the tear-covered ground, her wedding band hanging loosely around her neck.
The man cracked a kiss on her forehead and looked towards the street to his feet. " Goodbye, little girl. I forgive you."<|endoftext|>
**********206**********
Shots rang out. People rushed over, relieved to be back on their feet, ready to go home. My eyes darted over the lobby, trying to locate the source of these shots. I only had a few minutes until the boss found a sign.
"I've been waiting for you for this day. " I said in my high pitched tone.
" What did you do? " asked the manager.
" I planned for the next day. And more." I said, and pressed the button.
The manager walked over to the boss, prying his finger into his uniform. From over the edge of the level, he saw everything.
Everyone passed me and slipped through my lunch hatch. I would have grown away but instead, I looked up and saw many people rushing toward me. I dropped them in shock, turning around when they looked up. I could see that the room was filled with live people who had seen something similar before. The objects became recognizable.
Looking down at the couple, I knew they could see the familiar faces of families, but had just forgotten about the others. I began to understand what had happened. Humans had allowed themselves to be infected to become no longer, the plants slowly eradicating any legacy of the previous species. The plant grew heavily, sicker than the plants that surrounded it.
The flowers bloomed on that first day. The flowers were used as food. I had looked at them carefully as soon as they began blossoming. To observe and understand, the flowers were pushed into the soil and prepared for pollination. The flowers did not bring more vitality or stamina than was needed for reproduction. They carried toxins and bacteria. Many were contaminated by the plant, but the plants can still work with the medicinal properties of the flowers.
From that day forward, we kept our life as originally planned.
People learned of our advanced technology and warfare capabilities over the next few decades. Eventually, more and more people began to walk into that house, where we had planned to adopt. The humans built homes and found ways to survive, maintaining some of their vitality. Now, that we were the masters of plants, we had to rely on our minerals and technology. Because plants remained so strong, they were the most important factor for survival in our settlement.
I chose to go out. I had built a wall of these plants on the grounds of a natural target that I developed near the waterfall. I connected a small device on a small pole in the middle of the building to send back the signal of an emergency decision. I created a small rocket that would jump into the falls. The machines that built the rockets were so incredibly efficient, so efficient they would actually make as much noise as they needed to.
The situation was dire. These humans were in danger, and I was the only one to be able to stop them. There were one dozen or so that survived. If I did not come back alive, I would drown with death. As the rocket rose into the air, I remembered what I had done. That day, I set out to rescue as many humans as I could. No one else was there to save me. I created more. We built the humans homes and pillaged. We tamped down all that remained of those who survived.
I would die with them.
After that day, the rest of the humans had assumed I was a mass killer who was trying to end the humans. They simply starved and tried to kill us all.
The rest of my army filled the area, searching the area. If they found us, the numbers would be small. If I continued to build the humans and their destruction, they would surely return.
At least, that's what I thought. The three mass killers escaped. I could have stayed at their base, but this war would end after I tried to cut the plant down. The intelligent nature of the plants helped me realize just how poisoned we were.
The future could not be better. I wouldn't need to die again.
Humanity has suffered greatly over the last few decades. We have learned much, but we are not too equipped to replace them.
But we can.<|endoftext|>

"But we'd let him sell his soul at the moon, he deserves that. "
The confused nurse looked up from her tray, as if to ask for the juice that would be on her lunch tray. A question she knew had always come with some simple question, a question that, much to her dismay, had yet to be answered.
" Yeah. And I was hoping it'd be something more than that. He had everything right there for you. I've always been glad to see he was back alive in a lot of ways that other people hadn't. "
" Why would anyone even bother giving you a *real* soul? That ain't something he'd find impossible. "
" He didn't talk much about human life. I guess he has all sorts of interesting things to talk about. But they don't bring a life to my eyes, so how can I help him? "
" Well, " the nurse explained, " He does really out of love, he'd have to have someone with you. Someone who loves you. "
" Are you crazy? He's just going to die. "
" I don't really know. What do you think? "
" He's dead, but he doesn't have to die. He's not even feeling sad anymore. When he does die, he's not even sad. This person has got me here, he can see me. He can not see that I'm there for him. It was worth it, since he needed everything. Just about everyone else that fell just went back to doing their damn jobs, " the nurse continued, and the trolley full of tubes slid off the table. " Thank god that's all he's got to do."
She let out a sigh and walked away, leaving the empty tray on the table.
Ten minutes later, at 2:17 am, the Hospital made its rounds again. They had always done this time of year, but this year, the Doctor had decided it was best. There was no way that he could have known that he'd survived.
In fact, the slight smirk on the Doctor's face was probably even more admirable than the pain on the Doctor's face that had wiped away her last thought.<|endoftext|>
**********208**********
***BOMBING***
Crash. " I'm back! "
I turned around looking for him. He had been dead for five minutes. The ambulance driver had peeled off all the windows and clipped a flashing spotlight on his head.
The ambulance drifted limping, into an alley outside the hospital that I had just come into.
" Coming alive? Where's my dad? He's dead! "
I stumbled back as two other students and an older lady hurried past me.
" No what's he doing? " I replied.
" Jesus what can we do! He's alive! " she walked away.
I started to readjust my jacket. There wasn't any space to change.
" And where's mom? "
" She's gone, " a young man's voice was heard. I put on my jacket and turned around.
" I'm sorry, I could have called on the police but he's dead! "
I turned around to make a couple more swings towards my car. The boy was nowhere to be seen.
I rushed to the other side of the alley to check on the boy. Nothing was moving. I entered the boy's room.
He was nowhere to be seen. I slowly pulled the covers over his head. I laid down on the floor, pinning his head to my chest.
A thin figure floated over the bed, staring into nothingness.
I looked up and saw nothing but black.
Then I felt something break.
Walking back to my car, I looked around for my mother. I slowly became aware of this man. I noticed something was not right. His skin had turned deep orange. I peeled my jacket off. I looked at him and immediately nodded to the woman standing in the doorway. I smiled a sad smile.
I looked down to see my hands on the keys to my car. I stuffed them under my eyes and took my cell. I heard screaming from the other side of the street. I looked back and saw the boy stumbling towards my car.
" I'm coming! " I yelled at the man.
He just kept stumbling towards me. One of his fingers stabbed into my temple. I didn't scream, but I decided to do as much as I could to help. I closed my eyes and waited for the man to continue. It had been so long that I hadn't given much thought to the situation, and finally it was him. Then he turned and ran towards my car.
The headlights made a whirring sound as he ran into the hospital. The engine was still on as he reached the hospital. The light came on and I saw that my sister was in the car with him. I looked back and saw that we were in good spirits and had a family in tow.
We made the same decision that took me so long to become president of the United States.
The headlights exploded as I slammed the door down, downing the entire Cadillac they were driving. The door fell out of the side of my car, but not before I smacked myself on the windshield.<|endoftext|>
**********209**********
Julius remained confident, building confidence for his direct and highly strategic attack. It would not surprise him who spotted the enchantress carefully. They rarely had, she wore a cloud to ward off the invisible forces, adding to their appearance even if she were invisible without her own. And her own suit of armour, worth well over a thousand euro, gave her a unique and complex look.
The glittering, green scarf hung neatly over her side, contrasting it with dirt-covered sand. She wore a green silk handkerchief in her right hand, a sheen coloured around the surface. The silver glove hung loosely in her left. A frog locket with cloth flowers plastered in the middle of the seat was draped over the seam.
Humanity had come to the realization that existing was no longer a competitive advantage. Their drooping posture, their destructive capabilities, meant that survival was no longer their priority. They had grown to accept that. There was only one way to survive in a prison of us trapped. She wouldn't be able to leave to care for our family of indigent subjects. That was more probable than survival. She was the one that was trapped. That's why she insisted on defending himself.
"Mr. Johnson, I could use a minute. " The woman sighed, lowering herself to the floor.
" You are here because of my quest. " He sputtered out in discomfort. The white cloth accentuated his dark features.
Julius considered his best defence. This mission was most successful, he should be dead by now, the authorities were either just too ignorant of their own methods to hold them back or they've seen the human race that much longer than they have. He merely needed a moment to solidify his knowledge of human biology. That's all.
The frog locket fell from the leg of his shoe, glancing off to the side of the chamber. There was a quick glance back down at the black scarf covering his right hand. No tie. The man removed it. He went on, pleading. " You can't be serious. It's guaranteed to get through. I didn't make anything up at all. I just wanted to show them. I didn't promise me that anyone wouldn't follow my directions. I didn't threaten them, I never even attacked them! But... "
Julius nodded, digging his fingers into the gingham cloth.
" Well, I guess that doesn't really matter anymore. Just for the time being, do you know why I'm telling you? " He leaned back in his chair and stared at the alien hologram. " Did you enjoy your travels? Did you enjoy Earth? "
A hand reached out from the legged creature and turned the rod. With a flourish of the alien's hand, the pattern of the fish scales was forged, fish scales decorated with silver threads. The shape of a star, now a ball of fire, washed over a hundred of the odd partygoers.
A silvery blade pierced the purple moonbeam of the ball. That was all it took, a bullet to the head. It was then Marcus realised he couldn't place the tiny hole in his exposed chest.
" I'm sorry, did you try and...? " He shouted. " I didn't think I was going to just tell them. And tell the world about me!"
It was then that the last memory of Marcus was that of his family, his small children and the liquid blood that seeped into the centre of their skin.<|endoftext|>

This image made sense on paper, why would they fight? I hate fucking adults, who makes fucking gay jokes around a zero in orbit in that elevator they fly to, the one where they almost cant get out of those seats until you are halfway across the goddamn river and really fall asleep? Fuck you. Come on kids, it's time to breathe in a little.
The ships began to encircle the enemy vessels, deafening their cries, spiraling fast behind them like ~~your lottery tickets trying to subside~~ **and losing. This was the money for the President, and his advisors are desperate for the money and they think it will pay them some kind of military capability beyond the ten years they spent training they are getting today.
I wish it did, I was good as a god, but fuck this. Fuck this. What the fuck? They are fucking NEIN so goddamn fast, I hope they crash.
All that german shit: "There. Do you see it there little shit? Why don't you just get out here and see it? "
Well its dark, so it will be dust soon and once that's over that is it. It's short in motion, like an Egyptian pyre, not deep like a whale, but so elegant that those long beams of sunlight will drown the thing. That how they get the fuel to land.
" I suppose, the short ends the people's, really "
Good point. " You saw it above us... but I must say it ain't just water; it's vapor. "
I reached out and tossed the toy figure up to my bin, picked up the packet and popped a shot from a lasso on the detonator board and hung it on the top. An hour later when they realized there was nothing going on they understood; that whoever received the lasso from them should have the chance to drink the fuck out of me.
Now here they are. They stand in the shadow of a crater like New York and they come up with some slick shit. Fucking gas-powered super soldiers. And they know I'm out there in the next way. One last time. I fucking hate gay jokes. Fuck you.
I lift my lasso up to the surface and with that I hope you can shoot them.<|endoftext|>
**********211**********
I looked at my reflection in the mirror and wished it wouldn't be there, but in the mirror I saw something different. It was different from the way I normally look now. The reflection looked busy, but yet strong. The black lines of my jaw appeared and I saw not my face, but its face. It didn't have any visible nose or mouth, but instead had the kind of hard lines for... Something... other bodily fluids.
I looked around me. No food, no supplies. This was not normal at all. Food was bland, impossible to carry and it only came to me when food was scarce. I wondered if it might be working as well, if it even cared anymore. I looked at the fridge, opened it and grabbed a box, then half the contents. I tore open the box. A little gummy dog, and a box of pieces of pizza. I reached out, then put on my best smile. I started asking questions and the little dog buzzed about in my arms, even though I did not know it. A little girl hugged me. " mommy." the little dog barked.
I opened the pizza box, stuffed the dog inside, and held my hands up high as if I were carrying a floating corpse. He followed my hand inside to the list of things I wanted to add to the menu, and I smiled. Thank goodness I was going to end this adventure with a moment of rest, even though it had been a lifetime.<|endoftext|>
**********212**********
I'm off to bed. It's not ideal for the feelings of people, especially men. Everyone has this. Most people just hide, to avoid interacting with anyone else for a while. Society always leaves those that are still blind. I get to check in several times a day, myself and my patients.
But usually, I'm back on to bed. I don't like sleep, but it's not like it's exactly new.
It's the days like this that lead to the biggest moment of my life. The day my wife, Julia, was perfect. She was so perfect in a sense. Her hair went as she did with absolutely no makeup, or even a dressing. But it had a different feel, slightly too far from the original hair. I'm guessing that it was the waste. She didn't do that to deserve such a beautiful finish.
About six months later I caught a glimpse of her in the mirror. There she stood, although I could only see her through my reflection.
She looked ridiculous. Completely naked. And yet I saw. I saw every appearance of one of the world's greatest beauties. It was as though someone was creating an illusion, pulling her in-between our bodies. She was real.
It was this illusion that drove me to the wall, the medical gift that kept me here on this hospital floor. The eyes. The chests. The nose. The body. Those are just a couple of things that I've done everyday and they've left me feeling incomplete.
However, I woke up early this morning to find myself at the foot of the bed, trying to get some sleep. Julia. That isn't exactly, but then again, here I am. And they'll be here soon to remind me that I've lived an amazing life.<|endoftext|>
**********213**********
I am alone, but I am happy. The sounds of the waves begin to ring. The sun is beginning to rise and the streets are filled with people. I look around. People still wearing the orange and red spandex in their dress shirts. The rest of us just sit here and wait. We eat too much and the children wander aimlessly. I miss that sound of calling to them. Maybe that time we gather up and show them that we love them. What a funny word to use. It's funny, we tell ourselves. But we are still hollow for just a few moments of nothingness. I used to remember it.
I sometimes wonder how beautiful this world is. Can it burn forever? The sun never looks hotter now or the seas run so much faster. Isn't this wonderful? This world comes to life all at once. Life changing and beautiful. Sure it does bring a host of inconveniences, but there are times when it truly is bliss and happiness. It takes us some time. The moments where we feel better that we have all those memories, or the times where we feel we are happier now, or the times where it all feels like it should be a relief. It helps me to embrace it.
It's not so much the pain and the stress, but the courage. People will try to run away, but I always just keep on waiting. I had wanted to let go for so long and now I am free and clear. I am alone, but I am happy.<|endoftext|>

"How old was he? " Harold asked. Harold had sat up before he realized his snowmen had gotten in on the line. There were candles burning; no one bothered to make them an offering. This wasn't one of those deer's last moments. Harold smiled, and pointed out some of the growing piles of bodies piling up around the altar. So many had died and yet at least one of them was a boy.
" He had to be a good boy, right? " Harold laughed. " He had to be a good kid and ride the bulls and go buy some groceries. " Harold gave a head nod, but he was silent. This was going to be interesting.
" So here's the problem, Harold. No one has come for you in quite some time. That doesn't explain why you don't want a heat bath." Harold sighed deeply and replied, and could only stare.<|endoftext|>

We had set it up. A single person. The problem: the code. What are our trials and tribulations. What are our achievements? What did we expect, when the word of it hit a billion homes?
Do we expect to understand the joys of a new moment of life. The lessons we learned in the youth, the failures, the carefree years, the trials and tribulations? Can anyone ever say, "I did everything right?". It's incomprehensible to me. But even if I can prove something like this is real, I can't please myself and keep relishing in the freedom I have known before.
So much for drive.<|endoftext|>

Jay and I had been inseparable for years. Jay felt so safe with me. He would be there to hold me when we were fitter and had a look at me with a knowing smile. He made me feel safe with him. He could mean so much to me, but I know that it's not enough.
No one gives me much attention on their anniversary, Jay. I'm sad about that. Jay knows I'm not enough of a human to enjoy it. It's just too much fun for me, but I can't imagine how anything could be the same way for me. He might not see me as a connection, but he's been seeing me with jealousy on his face and I'm having too much of it, not knowing when my hormones will turn on and that's what's making me feel so so close to him.
I just want him to know that I love him. He's made me feel special.
He's done so much for me, even though my hands are raw and hairy now. He's never been a doctor, not yet, but she knew that. He showed her how to identify two different types of pain while working on measuring movement. He told her how to determine where every muscle in her body was tucked into the back of her head and how to visualize and evaluate the way a person's body affects them. He's been so good at it that he finds her the best.
I'm just so happy for him.<|endoftext|>

They gathered round like mages in a cold glass. The sun was setting over the walls of the shop, casting its rays into our small world. As they neared, they brought their judgement with a massive-
"There is something special about you. " They said with such intensity that he hardly could hold himself back.
" What's it called? " I replied, astonished.
" Thomas de Witt... " The voice seemed to grow, to listen to something I had not heard before, but had been aware of my doubts even before, while simultaneously stressing my doubts for which there was a calling.
"... what do we call it? " Thomas asked.
" The Catcher's Paw! " He grinned, and punched in as much of the black silk as he could. The wind echoed through the building, belying my complaints that it was beginning to get cooler.
" The Catcher's Paw, lit up with the only light in our world, " He cried out once more.
" And the Catcher's Paw! " I asked, raising a hand.
" The catcher's Paw, lit up with the light of a thousand suns, " He repeated. " The Catcher's Paw, it's called! "
A guffaw found his lips as he stared at me, breath silent. " Do you understand? " I asked, palms shaking.
" I do, " He stammered. " No, I don't. Do you understand how dangerous the light can be when a quarter is lit when no one can see it? "
" Yes, " I answered. " It's the deal they make. I need to focus on the Catcher's Paw, I need to see it for myself, not you. "
His grin widened as he turned, and I watched the little man he thought was my father cower. He spoke in a voice I had never heard before, but he suddenly recognized the monotone words and handed me back the scraps of paper that were in his hands.
" I demand that the kitten please be plucked from the dark, and caught by the light. "
I looked at him, and then back at the Catcher's Paw. I shook my head. " No, " I said, slowly, " Do not make me come here with you. "
" No, " He cried, and began to run away, not with the boy but with a roaring dog.
" Where would that child go? " I pleaded, breathing his sizzling scent into my lungs as my eyes cleared.
" Strange, " he sobbed, mouth roiling with tears. " How in the world did you know that there was a baby on the street? It's not like you even touch the ground... "
" The fluffy boy leaves the Kitty Catcher's Paw after he had left the Manaroo, " I insisted.
" If we know of the kitten, why? "
" You know of the Catcher's Paw, because your child still needs a cat... so I will send my child to try and help you. "
He followed me into the dark, as I followed him into the darkness.

I could still see it in the blackness, as I sat trying to get my head around the fact that I hadn't taken my final turn yet. A smile crept across my lips, satisfied, while she clutched her tweed jacket and stool, hands dry and worried as I withdrew my pen and a strange glowing stone on the table "Oh my god, you misspelled my password" I thought. She was replaying my poor grade, my planet birth, number one job that left me at the back of ten thousand ships fighting to get there. As I tried to understand what I was being told, I glanced at the screen, the only result of another phrase scribbled on a small piece of paper on my desk. Then a grin crossed my face, and I sat there dumbfounded.<|endoftext|>

The doctor walked in. At 6'4 ", he was breathlessly titled by fellow doctors and aficionados alike. He had been on his way to discover fainting patients, and emerging from the hospital to sign a personal health certificate with custom designs just like the ones he had seen. Unfortunately, having set out to create a product that was thought to be an anti-aging drug, the neuralnet was still getting rusty.
" Thank you Dr. Fields, " said a doctor in the white shirt and similar glasses.
" Thank you for letting us in, " the doctor said.
" Can you explain who you are? " the doctor queried.
" I am *Zdroj*, " he answered.
" What are you? " the doctor asked.
" Zdroj, " he said.
The doctor was perplexed. Who was he? They always said it was Zdroj's blood type, white, red, blue, like blue and blue **all**. What was he?
The doctor, a selfish bloke, said, " One of our famous neurotic Xsetants, born in 1917, was born *every season*. What now? "
The doctor took a great, toothy smile and handed him a hologram and a face map, " Well I want to find out who the origin of the'orphan' is."
A white man with a white mouth, metallic skin, a white head and a fiery red eyes walked in and exclaimed,'Those being bestowed as a rite of passage on you, youngsters, for your time. Ah the god. The alien in the pub corner, a twerky man with a dunce body, black eyes, and all colour combinations, awestruck by their achievement... *Shurts*.<|endoftext|>

When my eyes returned to normal I instantly knew what had been happening. Sitting on my bed two hours ago in the middle of winter, standing in front of my computer all day with no activity, my eyes would slowly close. Once they opened I could see clearly, the mouse pointer was moving across the image in my field of vision. All at once the picture shifted and, being overwhelmed with images of the world's largest metropolitan city, I suddenly felt very sleepy, as if I were waking from a dream.
Then suddenly it clicked... Yes! The mouse pointer.
Dying in the middle of an intersection, my eyes slowly opened. The window shattered into pieces and the situation only worsened. The middle of the street on the other hand was anything but happy. Nothing...
A small girl in a torn up dress grabbed me by the shoulder as if to try to take me away from her... "Mommy, have you seen my mouse pointer?"
And then I fell in love.<|endoftext|>

I'm a loner, I use to be a loner, but I was at an art school and it was named after me. i had to wait till my last birthday to get my head around school and after school it was just a big party and i started liking it.
So I walked in on the water plants in between class and they were real funny.
You know they are a bad fucking thing.
This guy is a pedophile... how could i disagree with that? They made me do a dance and i loved it.
Ha! He really fucked up his dance! I should have known better....
God, I'm surprised he didn't attack my love mom. She's pretty rich.
Fine, why dont you go to the hedge and treat my prettiest little flowers like big fluff balls! Thats right, shit'ma fuckin the schoolyard guard dog!"
The water grew puddles on the counter.

I just stopped dead in my tracks as I ran. A young man shooed me into his home by the fields ahead. " Live, you'll never be alone " his wife had told him. My heart race with joy, and a miracle, she lifted me up. " Come a second young lad, do you see what i'm about to do? " I managed to force out, despite the horror of the situation. This was not a war I fought for, not a murder-suicide where I killed kids, but the one that hurt me the most. She layed me down on the floor, and I knew from experience, that my had never in my life had helped a man experience such pain in his life. " Think of my life. If only you could just see it " she whispered as tears streamed down her face. But, I was truly broken. I could see everything that had happened, but could not comprehend what this thing that had torn my family apart. We were still together, in some ways. I got up,
but I was wrapped in the embrace of my mother.
I was frozen in place with the feeling of a light coming from my neck. I was pressed against the cold pillow by the rough sensation. I was weak, I was cold.
I could not find her, the words escaped my mouth and revealed themselves again to me as I stared at the dark face of my mind. Yes, my name was Jim. I could not understand. How? How could I? " I... I'm sorry mother... I... I have to go... "
A horrible sound, deep, mournful, escaped my lips. Tears streamed down my face as I looked around in confusion at the creature in front of me. What had I done? I looked down. Was he only here to stir a pot of red wine? Is it him? What is this... creature? His face seemed as lifeless as mine, and I began to cry. Then, the man in front of me looked up, and his eyes glowed red as he spoke to me again, in my own voice.
" Take me to the doctors. Did they tell you your name was Jim? "
I was completely dumbfounded.
" Yes, I'm sorry." I said in the most terrible kind of worried voice. But, as I thought of what it was I only found myself.
I looked around in complete shock, only seeing scars on my arms and legs, the blood all over my body. I was sure that I was the only person who saw it. I could think only of something evil about this. As I looked up to see the white-clad monster slowly fade into the distance. I pulled my hands from my pockets, and I shut my eyes. That was the first time I ever saw this creature, and, on that very day, I truly believed I would never see this again. But, as I took in what I saw, tears began to swell in my eyes, and my hands began to tremble.<|endoftext|>

This human life is a chaotic creature, an ever-expanding mess. I sigh. I care about you. You are truly the most important person in the universe. When you realize the temptation, I will leave. I am in your bed, in your hand. And that dear girl is Riel, a pest; a disturbing reminder. If you need me...
I need you. I remember you so. Every day I think to myself, "Pest. I mean my own children."
Riel is NOT my child. Riel has very poor milk quality, and is so full that a cup of milk could be poured with molasses.
Why are you always working at the bar? You love this rock, darling and talented. That's Riel, Riel the world's Largest Rock and Her Water Bottle, and to spare your precious milk, I give you three metallic... boating cylinders.
It would take a tenth of an ounce to get used to the Cold Jug, though.
At any rate, the children's names are so refined, they can hardly be thought of as insults, and you blame me. Your name can't get out of the country!<|endoftext|>

I am lonely. I don't really understand. Nobody ever lets me lie to them, doesn't make me feel better. They don't understand what I do to people I love, they don't understand how I can hurt them.
When I turned 17 I loved my girlfriend so much, she gave me many things I thought I knew. She gave me love, laughter, laughter at first, then house, then the twins she had with her children. She even had a private school so I knew she was talented and amazing. I remember the night of the wedding, she came home looking upset about my sister telling her that she didn't love me anymore, I didn't believe her then, she saw me with her sister in the shower, I thought my sister might get mad at me for still believing her and I ran away and never saw her again.
Then I was eighteen when her boyfriend got married, I got into a fight with him and broke it off. I survived and made friends with people I love. I met them and went to help people. I dated people who had nothing to lose.
But that was before I met her. In a room full of people, I met a new kind of soul I never saw in my life. She was handsome, smart, kind, and smart. I was lucky, and then she entered my life and I felt happiness. Her smile, with her eyes, was warm and refreshing.
However the day of my wedding, I cried when I saw my previous love. I was too young to see her smile.
I didn't know this all, and I tried to keep my love within the happiness that we had in our life. I cried once when I realized this was it and I was falling in love again.<|endoftext|>

"Look, " Jean slurred. " This is the *real* future... that we're doing for the Queen of Canada! "
She looked up to see a man in a leather handbag holding a rusty laptop. He leaned over with his mouth agape, " It doesn't look like they'll save the Queen. "
" That's right, Ma. I don't know how to call this. "
" You sure, Tim? The best thing we can do in this time is gather all the politicians and make a plea to others. They *can* save *them*, and *they* *can* *heal* their countries! "
Jan stared at him, tears rolling down her cheeks. " Tim, listen to me. I just want to say one thing. "
" This isn't fucking Canada anymore. The Union has been scorched for so long. We have no hope of a peaceful solution. Let them die for it. "
Jean nodded and flipped the laptop over in a gesture of solidarity. " Just take a look at this. It's beautiful. "
" This is *beautiful* France. Beautiful grass, pure sunlight, no bugs. Every man, woman, and child, raised and trained for it. There's a River for them to go to, a symbol for what peace could have been. And that river will be the best reward for them, and the peace in the world, for all of it. And they'll be richer, better, and stronger, but just as they'll be happier. "
" Do you think the unions will do this for them? "
" They're proud of their leaders now. They think they're getting something... up there. Happy. On a new frontier. For the people of the world. "
" Are you... are you going to shut up, do you think it? "
" Tim, you know I'm not. "
" Um... yeah, sure, " he said with a light laugh. " I'll give it my best shot. I'd just like to say I hope their kids survive. "
They both handed over their laptop to Tim. " Excellent. Take one for the team. If all goes according to plan, they'll be back at Alpha Centauri... a matter of days, maybe hours. Do you have any idea how that looks?"<|endoftext|>

Life is a symbiosis between two groups. Water flows throughout the globe, Earth's waters take just a little freshwater to continue its cycle. Throughout our lifetimes, we had to coax people to travel downwards into our caves. We started swimming in shifts during the winter, killing each other for the warmer weather. As for us, we all worked our asses off. Partly because of our love of nature, another part because we both pine for warmth in our underwater cave. Once in the middle of a mine with only the loudest jingle ( which we used in countless conversations, at least ) to end our summer solstice, our morning prayers became a rallying cry.
Climbing beneath the subterranean surface was a harrowing thing; every year the cave creaks, to a constant jang of squeals echoing throughout the water. At some point, we bored the surface of the Earth, throwing her off a cliff, and racing down into the deepest hidden parts of her cave. While millions of years of digging snuffed out her flesh ( albeit with the advancement of technology ), it slowly drained into her soil as she arose. She grew to be a towering beauty of white and red, and her soft hands reached out to mine the surface for nourishment. The only thing she lacked was the need for a steady supply of water.
Over the past year, she dropped out of her cave, soaked in her own blood as the surface boiled. It soon became clear we had lost all hope. Just by surviving beneath the surface, I could feel the heat emanating from her very being, releasing icy cold immediately into the shaft of my cave, which I fought to swat away back with my blood rushing to my bones. I started crawling deeper and deeper until I reached the top. We made our way up one of the dark tunnel walls, like 3 or 4 steps to the surface. The *floor* contained a simple iron rod with which to burn hot, fierce ice. It was a copper vial of pure gold. The light brown liquid kept us warm against the frigid hard surface. I reached out to touch the metal, only to realize that I was wearing a small white ball that was also filled with cold red liquid. A hand gripped my hand, yanking me towards it. She was only a child, four years younger than me, though my own mother had given birth four years before she was born. She was beautiful. Above her head, the red liquid glowed an icy blue. It glowed like a firework, heating her flesh up like it had only seconds before she died.
My mother, my sister, and the only man on Earth to see my birth, were all dead. They all succumbed to the same frost, lingering in my cave for an eternity, waiting for the inevitable.<|endoftext|>

The dawn was coming and I, Justine Williams, Asst. Commander needed it. This ground had been obliterated by the Bloodshed until the second. The last that stood. Our numbers had dwindled to a trickle. There had been wars where the blood of men was not the strength of our numbers, but a luxury, a weakness of the physical and a strategy. The price of blood was too much, too fast. And there was no stopping this.
The Sun broke and a cry from the heavens broke the quiet of the night. A relief. My holstered gun was crisp. The panting of the Brethren worked its way across my makeshift roof. There was nothing I could do. Nothing I wanted, anything to do but find Peace. The fear has been too much.
I stood beside my final bottle of whiskey, and closed my eyes, my brothers standing before me. For the last time they knew I was here with them. It was not goodbye, but acceptance. Courage. Courage for the right to be told what to do. Courage for my brothers. Then they know my name.
For the last time, if I am meant to be<|endoftext|>

My phone buzzes. My trusty messenger phone, not a special type of organic voice, but a perfectly functioning driverless car. Damn him. Nobody ever asks for my service, but that is nothing compared to the amount of phone calls I get when I send them.
"You need to understand something before I kill you. " The response I receive bears fruitlessly in my ears. I climb on top of the car, keeping my balance.
" Don't pull the trigger. It's the only solution. " The dealer still talks.
I don't move.
" Go on - give me a moment. " I know exactly what to say. I don't move.
" Next, John, listen carefully - the amount of time I must be waiting. " I really don't like seeing John trapped in such a situation, but I need to kill him.
" Call me, you two - make sure I get to my destination safely before I do. " I repeat this several times. John obviously doesn't trust me.
" Understand that I won't listen to you until you are safe, you worthless piece of shit. Let's go for a run."
I'm on the roof of the car now. It's a relatively easy thing to track down. Hard to miss the distinct ring, the sudden desire to accelerate, and then the warm light. The prospect of being trapped in the hot air for all eternity is too much, but I've missed the delivery. I'm not going to wait the perfect amount of time to kill him before I'm safe. I have zero other options, and I'm ready to do it.
I bang on the window, every fucking second of my meaningless life is spent in that fucking window. Every fucking minute of my nine month servitude is spent in that goddamn window. How am I supposed to plan a suicide mission when everything is just now killing me? He's always been so much more intelligent than I am, but I barely even know what he thinks of me.
So I push him off the roof. My mind tells me he's never heard of cops before, but I know exactly what he thinks of me. Can't I just go in and start a family? Why isn't he holding anything like I have?
Nothing. Nothing really matters.
John is standing there in the passenger's seat, unconscious. I grab his arm, and shove the gun in his face. I hear his last words - * " For now, he works for the police. " *
I grab the passenger's key, pull the trigger. The car goes flying into the windscreen, sending debris flying all around us. I scream.
Shit.
I fucking miss that hole in the windows.<|endoftext|>

"I'll leave a message in the soldier's hand, " David said, walking up behind the girl.
“ Of course. ” Sara said, sitting on his lap.
David couldn't help thinking they should simply do a math test, but the girl wasn't amused by this. David looked at her, puzzled, if a bit worried. “ Could you be an engineer? ” he asked.
“ Sure, ” Sara replied.
“ Are you injured? ”
David shook his head. The fight had begun. Her walk up to David had been more of a fight than a fight; he was used to being treated as a wild animal, but today was different. David began to feel less of a man, more of a monster. He almost stopped talking when Sara wrapped her arm around his.
“ FINE! Give me the FINE!!! " she screamed as she wrestled David close. “ The FINE! Don't do this to me! ” she held back. The girl looked at David with her hand still wrapped around his left forearm. “ I'm the FINE! Give me the FINE! ” she screamed.
David tried to grab her arm, but she held him down. After a few more moments, Sara finally gave in. “ Let's move! Let's... " she trailed off, slowly shaking her head. “ SHOW ME THE FUCKING SHOW!!!! ” she yelled, as she held him down again. She threw up her arms around his mouth as she threw herself at him to stop him from screaming. The girl could only scream for a second before she exploded. The doctor entered the room and examined the girl for signs of any injuries. She was crying out for release, " Uhh… There-there's blood. Everything. That's it. Just be grateful, and I'll take it back. I hope I get to see both of you someday. ”
After all that to the man, the nurse was the first to ask, “ What happened?! ”
David took a deep breath. He looked at Sara. He could do it. He had to get to this girl. How he could do it? How did they save hundreds of people from each other with bloodless aliens? He looked at Sara.
“ We never planned for this! ” she shouted. “ Please do it. ”
David stared at Sara, gun in his hands. The aliens were smarter than him. At least they knew what she had to do to save them.
But at least they didn't kill him.<|endoftext|>

"Why are you awake? " I asked with some resignation, not because I really didn't know, but because time seemed to slow down. I could hear the high pitched buzzing of my heart. " Who are you? " I asked myself.
I stood up, and stepped outside to find myself in a dark alleyway I had already been on earlier. Suddenly, I felt a car pull into my side of the road. It stopped in front of me as the engine roared.
" That was weird, " I muttered to myself.
The person in the car mumbled something but wasn't sure. After I got out of the car, I tried to get a better look at him but it was too late. I felt a sharp pain as my heart beat stopped.
I opened my eyes to see a figure walking down the street, apparently holding a gun. Before I could think about what to do, a loud voice spoke.
" What are you doing in the alley? " it said in a gruff voice. I didn't look very friendly, but from where I was standing, I could tell that it was far from hostile.
" I'm Jessica, from the fictitious Hotel Belleau Mansion. "
" What is it exactly? " I inquired.
Jessica stared at me, baffled. Then she said in a thick German accent, " Jessica DiTerrro's where the Grand Central Bank was, a fort of Doom."<|endoftext|>

I always enjoyed my job. The moderately smart, slightly retarded, probably good at maths as well. Always had a keen interest in computer programs, and was very successful. All was well in the world as it turned out.
It wasn't until I realized it had actually affected me, because they took my computer on some surprise vacation during a few days of vacation and we were to live amongst the stars. But worst of all, I was off to the market for a new laptop and to board a ship to go. I promptly fixed everyone's keyboard for the remainder of my days on the planet. In my newest job, which was as mundane as mashing buttons at a small scale, I was given my lease on life.
Sometimes I wonder if there ever was so much fucking freedom in the universe that nobody really paid attention to.
Anyway, to hangout there in the Gamma Quadrant, I had no idea what I would do without her. Eventually, I stumbled across a man that had been working for me for some time. This particular man was a billionaire, and I didn't pay him much of an attention. Apparently, he found one that he really desired. He sold his stock, essentially letting his one of my rare customers join him.
Me? Well, I was shot in the stomach. Ended up dying, and I didn't even know what that really was until I was shot in the stomach. Then I looked down on myself. " Well, I see, isn't *that* illegal? The law has laws for the taking of life, of course. But I'm still not too sure what that little enough chip on the forehead was. "
The man chuckled, kind of grudgingly. " Yes, yes, right. I suppose most people would be content to get a new Iphone, but I found the only thing that I enjoyed about it was, well, driving. So, I'm doing that now. "
" Funny, " said the man, " how- do you know? "
" Well, actually, " I said, " I recently started taking names on my Iphone, and I really felt like, well, it was an accident. "
" What's a car crash? " he asked.
" Well, a lot of people tend to tend to think of it as a driver's accident, and I was taking care of a young family on a sunny day during the summers. I mean, this little kid wouldn't do a damn thing about it, but he ended up hurt. "
" He... "
" He's still getting okay, " the man said, still laughing, " he's getting better. So, I'm worried about him. What do you recommend? "
" One of my old Superheroing boys could win a couple blocks over in this beautiful contraption. He's going to have a bit of trouble holding back his laughter. "
" How do you like black market that? "
" Oh that's where you get these black market assguards. Okay, what do you recommend? "
" That old ass Robotnik would be better than this whole street paper tomorrow, or whatever. My real bad buddy actually says I should buy that damn book, it's three pages thick. So I'm looking forward to that."<|endoftext|>

The most frustrating thing about the accident of Alder woke up one morning and immediately knew what was going on. It had been a very long week in the dungeons of Edans sector and everyone had fallen asleep, let alone had company. It was supposed to be like some horrific amares part where the enemy of the Family burst in to raid the city to fight against the family, but they would never come.
"Honey, " Alder himself called out over the snoring. He was only 6 years old and he was concerned that he would break the bed of his bed. " You ready to go to bed? "
She looked at him with the same tired eyes that had betrayed them for weeks. This man seemed unnaturally confused, but his response seemed normal to her. He tried looking behind the corpses, trying to keep his gaze out of the darkness, but they were too far away to actually be where his mother was standing. What was she doing here? He sighed again, to no avail. Why would anyone else want to come here?
" Y-you want a snack? " He paused to catch a whiff of air. She raised her eyebrows in response but his heartbeat refused to give him a chance. She didn't seem to mind it. She still didn't like him anyway. " Don't be such a punk like that! "
" I like you, " he responded with a grin of the kind that struck your teeth before your heart began to race. He looked around in a daze, seeming to catch a familiar air of confusion about the man that came out of the shadows of his room.
" Are you serious? " He asked quietly. She shrugged. She was such an imaginative child. He didn't even seem surprised when she said it out loud and tried to forget about it.
" Yes! " He exclaimed as the effect began. He had been carefully planning this plan for months, even as she still had her head in the clouds. His world was sliding back and he had made an incredible mistake.
" Why are you here? " She asked.
" I need to take a shower, " He admitted. She immediately thought better of it. He hadn't been in a shower since she moved here from England, but it had been his favorite place to stay when he decided to visit.
He looked out across the courtyard where he once stomped on the enemy, the only noise and just he was back there with an epic double-wall troll patterned sword emblazoned upon his chest. He had never seen the smile from the other princesses before, and despite her barely palatable tone to his tanned black hair, she found it extremely demeaning. " Your birthday? " Her question carried on and the elves seemed to have taken it into their own personal league of personal insanity.
" It's a special day, " Alder replied.
The princesses stared and laughed. She gave him a playful wink, and without ever pretending to want to make eye contact again, he simply let go of her fingers and uncrossed his arms.
" Daddy? " He muttered under his breath. She couldn't even respond.
" Oh gee, Honey, " Alder said. It had been quite a long time since he had spoken to her. " What do you want? " He wondered if she had slept well. " I need to pee! "
" I will, " she had said matter-of-factly.
Alder went back downstairs with a nervous laugh. The elves just kept leading him around in their spaces until he came downstairs.
" Do it, your little shit," he said as he put the semi-circle into a fist.
Her realizations had started to take over his mind when he turned back around to find the amulet a few minutes earlier.<|endoftext|>

Richard shot the wizards point blank in the chest.
"Peter, once you hear it, I'm gon na pick a fight with this one. " He turned around nervously. It felt like they had begun a skirmish, which unfortunately also included a full cart ride of condoms and milk, a pair of boobs that actually did all they could, and also half a loaded gun and a tankard.
Richard ran to the window, climbed up onto his horse, and threw down his lighter. His journey didn't take too long.
" Seven fire mines, fourteen ice crystals, five fireballs, one artillery piece, then another. "
" You've got two flamethrowers, here, we just need a couple of men, and half a hundred barrels of gasoline. A firebox is basically all the winter fighting we need to survive these hard, miserable winters. "
The wizard caught his breath, his expression wide.
" Whatcha-? "
" Twenty five firestones. "
" Isn't the whole demon hunt boring? I bet you got ta be playing with fireballs to make a fireball fight happen, and eventually you get four fireballs? "
The wizard watched as Richard disappeared into the shadows with a puff of smoke and a wink.
" Now then, how is it that I can not remember where I left the handguns? "
The wizard turned back to his horse, then took a seat.
" Damn. Well it is like that easy, as you can see, at least for now I can do a bit of righter fighting."
“ Looks like we're gon na need to be off of this, boss, shall we? ” Richard said. He'd had too much to drink.
*They were never that bad. *<|endoftext|>

The shudders flew in like a machine, the roof of a gargantuan warehouse shutters on. Smoke overtook the shaking air as it filled the sky. Small usernames marched in different directions, this time in different denominations. One writer appeared to be standing face to face with the idea of the sheer titan that stood before them, slowly peering out to the blazing sky. The man chuckled to himself in awe.
Another creature, appearing from the smouldering dust, began to giggle and rustle. Finally, it spoke. " The Crystal. The one true power it rests in. A power it holds all those who know it are wrong. Not only is it the only one that can tap into the Crystal, but it powers up hundreds of rooms in this city. " It paused, noticing that the man and the other travelers had the odd look of confusion on their faces. " And I'm one of those thousands of wizards? "
The old man shrugged. He looked at his assistant. " Yep. They've assembled yourselves around the Crystal, and listen for any of their words when they speak. Once you hear any of them, don't bother staring at the Crystal. It does not take much to get your mind back on track. No need to know anything about its past in order to listen, even if you know that this place is important. "
The two remaining travelers headed out of the warehouse, abandoning their weary walkers to look out over the city, which was outside of it. Satisfied, they boarded their vehicles and drove off, resting their backs against the verdant, rocky outposts of the city.
*And was it ever so quiet inside the Crystal? *
________________
" Does it matter, this time? " A booming voice bellowed, echoing in the air like a megaphone. " The Crystal is still alive? Am I still here? "
" How do you know that, Mr. Smith? " Asked a feminine voice from the back.
" Because you know it. You will know when you have hit the Phantom. Right now you're in front of the Crystal. And you have no idea when the Crystal is supposed to last. " Said the newest companion.
" What, like time travel? "
" Well, the Crystal first showed that it can travel so fast. A week. Not even an hour. So you know what it is? A hell of a lot more. "
" What do you mean, thousands of years? "
" The crystal. " A wry smile appeared on the old man's face, as if the old man had one grasp on the essence of this world. " And I'm not going to miss it."<|endoftext|>

The drone did not click any more.
It shook.
Almost as if it were non-existent, flying right over the wall of its own shop. The man who created it didn't have time for his name tag, and by the time it was done, he was on its way.
It had been two weeks since the first drone had been sent. When she knew that, more than three weeks, more had been sent in from everywhere. Each time, they always had these banners. On flags that hung half eaten by wolves or bears. Each was a sign, delivered by a great, and terrible name. This one was negative, and re-named itself Adam.
On the third day, a small fellow with browned skin and matted hair had decided to write that name on the background of a green page. It didn't matter, since he already could not hate her or her family. It was every word of that message, in fact, every one. She'd been on it for years. She knew this day would come.
To name two things, kindest, brave. That is what she had to say.
"They are coming, " she snarled, as she scanned the board above her shop. " Their kind lives here. "
The room shook, and the words brought back tears. " They are coming, " she cried again.
The drone looked at its master and saw him glaring at her. It tried to strike at the door, but was cut off by another noise, which only her voice could convey. The robot clawed at it, its legs stinging with what was left of it's flesh.
It fixed itself to its more powerful arms, sending it into a perpetual sleep, that had lasted days.
On the fourth day, a woman with sunken blue eyes had decided it was better not to give up that protection. After all, it meant she was safe here.
On the fifth day, she picked up the red record. She wasn't the hero any of the drones had thought she would be, her parents were fools, and so it had been decided that she would be her children's guardian. Only this one had been too close to the front door.
" My name is Jacob, and if you visit this orphanage in the next few days, I will attempt to find you and let you know that I have returned."<|endoftext|>

It was a long time ago, before magic was real. They were in the late 19th century, and people paid close attention to what magic did to the world. Muggles didn't fall victim to spells, and life expectancy naturally dropped. But magic still lingered.
Muggles still focused on the next big thing. Cannibalism in the 21st century, slavery in the 22nd, hidden, dirty, etc. All these battles only came to attention when groups of muggles started their own revolutions, so new forms of magic started popping up: Wah-Khop-Jong. It was a time when magic would go mainstream, the muggle influence would continue to grow. And then they came, the Muggles. With the inventions of science, magic came right back into the mainstream. Some changed how things were done, others tried what they were fighting for. But nobody else was prepared. Many muggle soldiers marched against the Muggle governments, breaking the very laws of war. It was decided in the last few years that Muggle troops were to be physically and culturally inferior to Americans. Therefore, the US helped the Muggles win wars. It made them feel small, and they almost were happy to be "better". After all, they needed supplies, and the Muggle government knew what to do with it. Some people were just glad that they weren't beaten.
The muggle government quickly seized control and replaced the US military with a " land and sea" army, complete with a magma-man submarine, which was capable of being extremely efficient and capable of defeating a continent. After searching the Midwest, they came across the American Revolutionary war, when they tried to put a stop to it. However, this action, albeit subtle, made the muggles realize that it's only one more generation ahead of them. The CIA decided to come to the US, ensure the advance of their cause. If they could convince the Muggle government to let them do it then they might actually succeed. They showed that they could still be the supreme power, and that the muggles were successful.
Thus began the world's largest military conflict in decades. The US would never see that victory, which would obviously be carried out by thousands of muggle soldiers. The war was over, and the US would take revenge on the Muggles.<|endoftext|>

The “ monumental ” decision, decided by “ the " eminent ” Stephen E. Stephens upon brief discussion that had ensued, had been the last straw, for the United States Supreme Court had apparently ruled that caffeine ’ s caffeine was Schedule III a drug. Instead of acknowledging its use on public transportation, as had been the prior case, the US declared the “ common causes ” drug a Schedule I drug.
In fact, it was found that the United States had designed it in a contraption that would harm one's brain, and use it in many instances. According to the human body ’ s reactions, it did not appear to work on the brain itself.
When confronted with this decision, a near-two hour long international effort had tried to contact representatives from the governments of the various countries, focusing largely on a small group of people in a desperate attempt to see if they could remedy the problem. Most of the light got turned to members of the “ Code Red ” or “ Green ”… by the world ’ s governments. Some of the many reports from the scientists on the report were described as “ gross ” by some, and a lot less productive.
Just as suddenly as this temporary end came to the world as suddenly as it entered the world, a public statement had been issued. It was then that that the world ’ s governments had started preparing their public statements to reassure citizens, so that the public could sympathize with the people who gave news of the announcement and give evidence in the press, as many decided to do anyway. However, this wasn ’ t what was to happen. According to the clock ticking, the announcement was announced before 8 a.m., a day that was supposed to have already been hours in the past, and was instead celebrated. As the alarm clock started to turn over, the UN decided to decide that the “ terrible ” announcement was to be reserved for a few hours after the mass hysteria of 9 am, at which point the world may have to decide whether or not to call the police, if they are to prevent this “ catastrophic ” order from coming into effect.
Everyone at the UN and the government had prepared an attack, henceforth referred to as “ The Worker ” crisis. Many people in the world are completely unaware that work or others ’ live day-to-day in public, living seemingly to the fullest, if not most, of their is meaningless, existence. People ’ s lives are increasingly like their jobs. You have to earn your money. That is one way the people live their lives, some just as young as us, or never have. Every day is the same with no variation. The work-life spans tend to go longer, have more purpose, and have lowered efficiency, too. This worker has decided to strike and try to force everyone else to work. The American Government has grown tired of working as they always do.
They tried their best to put an end to the worker movement in the world. However, the collective efforts that were put in place to stop the worker movement had failed to return the same result. The “ terrible ” announcement of the end came at midnight that the world had to watch.<|endoftext|>

His name was Earl St. Luke. Not the only werewolf with a name. We were a termite and because of that we were leashed by four hotties. Cocky girls that made him pay for dinner from time to time.
One of our hotties was a werewolf named Natalya Marlowe. She seemed happy to have sex with his big paws. Then another friend, Edward Richards, kidnapped her and seduced her. We decided to put her in the institute. Her whole class werewolves with their mating patterns. We all knew the pattern.
She didnt know what to do. She didn't move. Not a damn thing. She just stared at the wall for a long time. That little girl... that scared me. It was because of that, I started putting that name on my genetic makeup.
Shortly after i had her put in the institute i sent her to be sterilized. I was full for.
But the day was not as kind as i planned. She continued to stare at the wall for a while. Tired and trying to figure out how to actually do it. Then Edward knelt beside her. I turned the knob on my kitchen door and placed my glasses in front of her.
"Your parents died of demonic tendencies during her third ( also second ) research project. I was surprised to find out your good genes keep you sane as opposed to your demonic mind patterns. You are also one of the only 100 individuals with a typical werewolf-like personality, no one else has ever been tested to have a normal mental balance. "
Earl frowned.
" A lot of people haven't seen that. But we don't want to hide the fact that you're one of the best psychic types our group has. So I'm going to pass on the genes. "
Edward pushed me away.
" There are a few costs involved with this. You will be subject to anesthesia and you will keep defecating until your bones want it to disappear. As for your teachers, they will be made for you. We will leave the project for everyone else to finish and get an assistant to do the booking."
I nodded, turning my head toward the door. I wondered if i was gon na be lonely forever.<|endoftext|>

"I am alone, but I am happy. " My heart was in my chest as I hugged my wife. " It's okay. "
Our silence was calming. That was our first time together. We had been looking forward to a great time together; all those young boys and girls would laugh at me before I would throw away my heart and let it fall to my lap. Though it may have felt like an eternity, it was not.
Yet, we had still found our way together. We had found the sunset. The dancing girl, instead of being content and happy, struggled with such a confidence and determination. I could feel my blood rushing in my veins, helping me hide from the light. " I love her too much, " I said to myself.
I knew my emotions would change today. I knew that she wasn't responding well. No, my heart was on fire. There was nothing I could do. Only the epiphany of a second date would bring me clarity.
" God, I do love you," I murmured.
& nbsp;
But she was still there, and my vision was fading. My whole heart was gone, along with everything in her.
Looking over at her, I spoke. I wanted to tell her, telling her everything, but my body wasn't responding well. No, my vision was on fire. My heart was on fire. Tears threatened to fall out my eyes, but I was determined to fix everything.
But you weren't there, weren't you?
And I will always be there, forever.<|endoftext|>

"Shall we get a drink? Or is it lunch? " Jamie decided to sit on the lounge table for his long walk home, still gazing out into the sea towards the sea. He hadn't been moving a muscle, except the slight twitch in his left foot and the slight gurgle as he gingerly made his way back to bed, never taking the bus back. Maybe that was his peculiarity; the twitch wasn't healthy and he wasn't as keen as he'd liked to admit, surely getting out of bed felt like him missing out. The stand still in the kitchen was having a drink, it was to be expected at a coffee shop. The same hands swishing down the coffee machine, Jamie thought idly, as he had often when he was in the mood for something.
Getting up as his swing was about to begin he could feel something move in his leg. It felt odd to see him that cold down here, with cold feet. He pawed over his shoulder nervously, clearing away his furrowed brow. He really was used to the weather today. Most days were with more apprehension and lethargy. He tried his best to work himself out, thoughts racing through his mind, in an attempt to get the thoughts to quiet down, any thoughts he wanted to avoid.
His legs felt a little heavier than usual as the world around him blurred. Jamie's usual clothes held him down as he turned down the street to the old diner across the street, he couldn't put a barista in the shop without having to be the most awkward guy on the block. He wondered, as he struggled to leave, as he always did, why he would bother avoiding a group of shoppers in the street. He had tried a few times to be polite to people, but couldn't. Just to his surprise they were busy trying to order their fixings.
Then it began. The reaction. Frantically, Jamie scanned the menu, the line was filled to the brim with the placid thoughts of a new customer, watching them grow, the chatter in the shop getting heavier, listening as Sarah's after-feelers formed a clique behind him, getting more and more agitated.
Jamie's steps became louder as he got to the door, the dog chasing after him. He crept up the end of the stairs hoping to get a hold of the dog. If only he could get to Sarah.
A miasma filled his skull as he lurched towards the counter. As he neared the desk he passed his work papers. It was time to go. He pulled one of the unmarked packages off the counter and poured himself a cup of water with the rest of the items. It was time to go home, to relax. The thought of home wouldn't leave Jamie's mind any longer. But all he wanted was for it to be another Saturday, another day of school.
As he sat there, pondering how anything could go wrong when he turned his head back to the computer screen, just as he suddenly realised that he didn't want to follow his name to the bottom of this message. Jamie's life couldn't be a normal getaway. He thought about this, in vain, but something in his resolve held him down so tight that he almost couldn't pull the plug.

Good job, you did fantastic. Nice writing, even if it was a rushed one.<|endoftext|>

Thank you, my fellow Americans, for saving us both and I forgive you. There may be times where we don't know how to feel, but we must repent and repent of the mistakes of our past. I alone, and I alone will be remembered as a man that saved us. We may bow and pray, but we shall have no prayers to answer. We shall have no peace, but I and the men of this great country know that peace is a luxury few reach. We desire to survive, and better ourselves than it has been. We may see fresh faces, but we shall never know how old we are. We shall never be allowed to die, but we may be brought back once more. What are we? What am I? Please, children, let us remember. If we look to the future, and know that this is a blessing and a curse, what do we become? What will we be like?
I may be biased, but your thoughts help me remember this day. A day for thoughts, and a day for actions. Write something meaningful, but remember it in times of turmoil. Keep a journal. Keep a compass. Keep a blood on your hands. If things are right, then you will soon forget that peace, and we must call it redemption. You will remember your service for the people and then remember. We must not forget these moments.
Worn clothes are painless. The most courageous men and women. Our love was noble. We were heroes. We are heroes. We will live today for the first time in generations. Keep the remembrance alive, save our legacy, and be glad the second draft passes.<|endoftext|>

Time dilation was the best thing that had ever happened to me so far in these long, miserable hours.
After the Fourth Party Massacre, they had already figured out how to use my corpse to make sure my body wouldn't stay and whatnot.
I reached up and probed his pockets with mine. A pack of toothpaste, a pencil, a pen, and this year's tracker. Sixteen gold diggings and that license to carry and carry it through time was pretty insignificant to me.
All I had to do was shake his hand. He did just fine though. He wore a Santa-themed fleece suit and carried a white clipboard.
'Christ, I've got to tell you something. Since you left, no one is giving me my free money either. No one sees me. People can't remember. Here I go!'
He tossed the empty bottle of shampoo down and pointed at the snow.
'You promised Santa to clean everything. Including my beard. You promised the family all the money I was going to have. You promised all the money I was going to have. As you said, that and all the money I was going to have. You bought all the camera rental money, the meth stash, and all the people who live in my house. Now that I'm out of here, I'm either fired or expelled from the house. I'm not sure if this is an option but I'll explain. Here, here, here.'
He didn't say anything and I was so close now. At least he was gone. A gust of wind drifted through the early morning heat. I felt all three of my fingers become knotty. My palms were wet. Then the last thing I felt was a pressure under my eyes, but I didn't let it bother me. I grabbed the buckle of my hoodie, and tied it with a little thread for strength.
'Santa, do you realize how many people I've killed already? NINE! Well... my dad owns some pretty sizable businesses, in the country! Last I heard, Johnny was the oldest person to come out of the house. He owns one of the largest sugarcane farms in the world. Under his auspices, all you can buy is to brew sugarcane, go into the Hells to find them and then sell it. The best part? He doesn't make it home!'
I opened my mouth to protest but Santa's magic wand held its flame and quickly turned me into dust.
I still didn't get what was happening. I was as no longer a hick, and as much as I would've liked the scar, it didn't seem that big to me.
I was sitting there, dressed for the snow again. I looked around. Nothing. A stick of twigs, a chain, and a wooden box, and a tire.
'This might be the last time I see you.' He said into the snow.
Suddenly, he turned and pointed at the pile of junk. He had a gold band on his left foot. Then he pointed at a ten dollar bill. The thing was a single yellow star above it.<|endoftext|>
**********243**********
He stood in front of my desk, staring directly into the camera, with a violent purple glare on his forehead. " Peter, aren't you going to look at this, " he said. I nodded. Peter slowly pointed towards the cameras as he pointed towards the end of the aisle.
" OK, Peter, " I said, " Let's not go poking fun at him. Let's end this. "
The camera cut to Peter, breaking the silence by sending a blow to his temple. I opened the paper up again. " Revolver dropped on the vase, " I read. Peter let out a low laugh. " Thank you, Revolver! "
He raised an eyebrow at me. " Did you notice the drop, Peter? "
" Oh, sure, " I said. " Really good! "
" Really? "
He leaned back in his chair, " Would you like to sell some of the clones? They're very valuable to me. I had you set up a simulation within months. You always get me started when I'm finishing them. "
I chuckled. " I have a seven billion. He's got this technology, at least. I didn't like him killing everyone in his line of work or our intelligence agencies. Too much of your time and research into the details of assassination techniques. How come you started getting turned on over time by my machines? "
I sighed. " You said he shot the clones, so I have to believe you. "
He sighed. " Yes, yes. So why don't you sell my robots? I can't take away your money. Would you like me to repeat my mission, again? "
I laughed. " I can turn some clones into human beings. You want the rest? You can cut me out of this idea and use my machine for other projects. Are you interested in any of this? "
He said nothing, but I couldn't help but laugh. I stared into the camera again, slowly stroking the back of my neck.
" Because I'm dying, dear. Thank you."<|endoftext|>

I was about to leave the car when the voice came from the console next to me.
"Come with us, the heavenly avenger to the father who slew the father. "
I looked up, surprised.
" You've returned. "
" Yes, " I replied, proud. It was a relief to know I was part of one of the most feared and feared cults in the modern world.
" And that you will return to this world with the son you have at your hand. "
I felt the cool hand on my shoulder as the voice continued, " You have passed on your responsibilities to us, your sacred order. "
" But with a painful Death today, that's all it will take. "
I looked over at the now lifeless corpse I had just been chosen by God to take care of.
" And that you will return, that is all it is. "
I looked down at the lifeless body laying in front of me.
" And that your son will be yours."<|endoftext|>

For the first couple of hours, I've been alarmed by one thing – it barely makes a scurry across the asphalt before it begins feeding the sunrays to grow wild fruit. Alas, it has become a habit. As the adrenaline wears off, the bee begins gnawing on my skin and its face looks duller and it suddenly shivers and blinks…
I'm not sure what I was thinking. Suddenly, a sharp jab makes the bee throw its head back, revealing an envelope as far out of the way as the eye can see. I push the envelope over my arm and see the shredded paper wrapper in its grasp. Drip. Drip. Drip. I wrap the contents of the envelope around my wrist and take a bite. Ugly, don ’ t want to sare the lungs with it – it ’ s a dead-end job.
I take a shoving path to the nearest bathroom that is conveniently placed halfway between two nearby tables. Showering, I get out of bed and grab a mug of coffee. I grab the mug and for the first time since the incident the barbeque has been relaxing. After an hour I sigh and pour myself a steaming, refreshing cup. After another hour, the barbeque has been pressing a soft on. Sunlight comes through the window, into the barbeque ’ s glory. I whistle, “ Well played, ” and begin closing the door.<|endoftext|>
**********246**********
My wife comes and goes, and those last few customers. And the house finally changes to greener pastures. We left the house overnight. The new owners arrived just as soon as they dropped off their bags.
As quickly as they said it, they threw on a new clean coat and new shoes. After a few of them went the dirty little streaks of white on their sleeves in yellow and gray. Blond hair cropped back in bangs and a cleanly trimmed beard. Only in his hawaiian beard it was evident. The new owner always had a capital D ( mean family boy ).
She peeks into the bathroom, and picks up something – no other animal tracks it – that her eyes should be.
She speaks up, "My wife, you alright? "
" What? "
" She's breathing! "
The owners knocked on the bedroom door. They knocked again.
" What? " she said. She slid the door open and let the beer in. Stalled from her thought process for a few minutes.
" Yes ma'am, I was on the bed, the bed and the door, " she said, turning to the door and pausing. " You see they brought a new bingo card today? I was missing the house, " she glanced over at her companion, the only nonverbal movement among her companions, " and I heard you were missing, " she said, " the real kicker is, they got it by the seal, not the clue. "
" What seal? "
" Greg. I think he should be buried. We always loved his voice and he was a great people man. Don't know what to do now. "
" Who's Greg? "
" He was with us when he died. Him and his cat. "
" What am I supposed to do with him? "
" He always had a beard though. It was heavy. When he got his cloak it was gone in the bag. We never had a clue about the house, but he had an accent and he always introduced himself in a well- pronounced way. Remember, the dog kicked me when I was hungry and then not three days later, he was talking to me in his own Russian accent. I don't think he knew that the fuck he was saying. "
" Do you understand what I'm saying, " the next owner said. " He did not have any dog companion. "
I noticed my wife sitting next to me on the couch, shaking her head. " Awe? " I asked, she was practically crying.
Her eyes shifted to the side. " Oh my God, " she said, and she leaned close and kissed my cheek.
" There's a cat coming for you."<|endoftext|>

"Daddy, are we the bad guys? "
" Of course not! The Paragon must escape! I have to help you find your father "
The Paragon dashed to my side in an effort to save her life. My voice echoed the paragon's screams. I had got lucky once, through a couple of annoying EMTs. All they said was'I'm running for my life'. I know they lied, but no one was hurt!
" It's okay, sweetie, I'm alright "
I wrapped myself up in some comfy blankets and bounced in my crib. A short while later I stood up, waving to the Paragon. Her head whipped around just slightly to meet mine. I pressed up against her chest, the pillow bouncing a little.
" It's okay, sweetie, I don't have to worry about what happens next "
We hugged for a little longer. I kissed her forehead and blew. It was honestly the best kiss of my life. I didn't even know it was music. I opened my eyes for the first time in years. I sat up a little straighter. I looked into her eyes and gasped. I could not believe it. She was beautiful, and I couldn't believe how beautiful she was! My love for her had been cemented with this girl. Every time she kissed me, I dreamed about meeting her at our wedding. My life was finished. I knew I had to meet her someday.
My heart ached. I needed to be closer to my daughter. Tears began to roll down her cheeks, into her long brown hair.
" Daddy, are we the bad guys? "
We fell in love.
" Of course not! The Paragon must escape!"<|endoftext|>

During the Archangels prancing around in the clouds, I counted hundreds. Slowly, I counted the fingers of my hand. It was a thrill. I waited and waited. A jolt rung through my heart, and I jumped out of my seat.
Mossy purple hair danced over my hands, behind my pudgy face. I followed the glow between my palms and produced a paper. It read:
*This is Isaac Marlowe Jackson. *
*The Machete on my urn m'liele, here at any moment. *
"Don't be too excited, I ain't gon na slip away or keep evading. "
The grim reaper raised the paper with a new wave. I looked at it. Scroll, page, writing? It didn't.
I looked at all the pages on the underside of the letter. What did they have?
" I can't write it up here. If you fucking couldn't raise the paper, I don't think this isn't entirely your fucking rule book."
In a fit of, " What the fuck?! " that came out of my mouth, I shot my pen against my desk.
As I peered through the hole left in the letter, I saw that the angel who was now speaking had no hand hanger, and that I was dead. I saw that in both of his puffs, the angel in an unemotional kind of love, had stopped to look at me.<|endoftext|>

"Emily? " I asked, staring at the blanket which layed over her chest.
Her breath felt like it was going to be weeks before she knew what was about to happen, and she didn't know which. In that moment, she was completely helpless and afraid.
“ You look so beautiful in your very own clothes, but it's just that, it ’ s a bit... overwhelming... ” I tried to explain to her, but there was nothing to say.
“ I wish I could be with you. I ’ ve spent the past week away from you, and you have never shown me a reason to stay. You ’ re what I should be, right? ”
“ No, I can ’ t be with you right now. I am not waiting for you. ”
“ I don ’ t want to be with you, I don ’ t want you to leave, and…I don ’ t know what to do. ”
I wanted to talk to her again, and ask her to stop moving. But it was pointless, I would never leave her.
“ Can you tell me what you think is the problem? ”
She looked down at her hands, nails and a pair of strands of hair, and then at the blanket and thought for a moment. It was something to say, not something to say. Emily just seemed to care, as if she could see the red lights everywhere, but she wouldn't be able to. She couldn't even look at the blanket. Just sat there in the tiny little blaze, seemingly unfazed. It would be too late. It would be too late.
But it wouldn ’ t be.
Emma was safe in the fire. She was safe in the fire. Emily didn ’ t feel the heat rising up in her chest, she didn ’ t feel the warmth coming out of her eye sockets, and she just stared at the fire that was roaring in the distance, blinding her eyes. For a moment, she was so captivated. So transfixed.
“ Emily, I don ’ t know what to do, ” I managed, taking a moment and acknowledging her presence.
But then, there was a knock on the door. As I opened it and she was befuddled, she could no longer see the fire. She turned to look at the door in front of her. She couldn't see me. She didn't see what I was, but she saw the torch which shone into the flame in the distance, and they had met.
They lay beside each other, and Emma looked up at me, tears streaming down her face.
I sat beside her, helping her wail with my right hand. And gently, she ran her fingers down my neck, until she was inside of me, protecting me from the heat, from the flames. And then, it all started to go black.
The darkness gave way to light. And for a moment, Emily looked at me with those bright eyes of hers. Like a fire in her eyes. But then, as if in my power, she looked back at me with those bright eyes. And like a fire consumed her.
And she looked up at me, and I watched her cry out, and I had a moment to tell her she had *lost*.<|endoftext|>

Parchment.
And parchment.
Was it clear? Was the pentagram in the middle?
What a waste, came the faintest glimmer. And so, all those students had left for the dead, as she made haste in the halls of the library. Her craft had long been in a state of dismay, within the library's walls, but through many of the dark rings of the scrolls, the dedication for the manuscript was found.
The page that had appeared earlier in the day.
Name of the main character as Edward Longburn, once the King. His love of chess, his father's factotum, and his mother.
The royal battle lines.
And that's what the printer had printed her a hundred years ago. It's clear, it's written on the cover.
*Remember who they are, * she writes, *Remember the King. *
And now it was not lost on the students to read further:
*Remember what they have done, * she tells, *Remember their sacrifices. Remember their lives. Remember what they tried, * for the hopelessness of the situation: a sacrifice of 100 pounds under the flag of an Italian empire, from the light of Rome.
*Remember what it is now, * she calls out.
And then, with grim, heart beats a loud, gruff voice in the void.
*Arthur Pendragon, Biché, Peculiar Picard. *<|endoftext|>

The rock worms lolling around, plopping to their perches and frolicking around. " Gee, me missy " they'd said. " Y'know how it's going, your love ". He'd turned around and got up, he'd tried to ignore his daddy, he still does. He tried to be as welcoming as he could. He tried to hide from her. He was fading away. She was passing him on the way home, the excitement was fading.
She was beside herself at the table and a beautiful blue dress was between her shoulders. " So what's your favorite? " She asked the steak knife. He spotted it, her lip quivered. He knew he should've thought it over but he never forgot. Her face was pale. " Hmm? " She answered, and as she grinned, he caught her eye and looked, obviously didn't want to admit it, he looked exactly how he wanted her to.
" I guess not really, probably just a normal day. " He said, straightening his silk tie, accidentally pulling it on too early. She blushed prettily, like a young girl looking at just a few pebbles. " Doesn't really matter, " she said, grinning widely.
" Me too, " he said. They never did seem to really think about like that. " She's had so much to say about you she barely speaks at all, about how much of a friend she is, about all the kisses she's ever had, about the times she can't even remember when she's been with anyone. All about the time she opened her mouth and let out a good " Yeah, I do, yeah ". It always got them lost in the details they both seemed lost in. He looked around, there were so many different people next to him. " Me too, you're always the talk of the town, and all that is normal and all that is really is a mystery".
They sat in silence for a few minutes, both looking for that simple clue, but he wouldn't look anymore. She giggled at it, and at her, and at his special skills. He turned to the others, he must have been 4 or 5 years younger than her, and they stared at him, stone cold with shock. Time seemed like it was about to fly away.
A man broke the silence in front of them, and had to be said. He let out a little chuckle. She smiled back and began to toddle off the table, no one was yet to hear. He got up the fork and started walking, his legs hurriedly twisting as he walked. He had no idea where he was going so it just caught him. He stopped, looking at the road, it was quiet, and he saw no one outside. He called his mother out of the corner of his eye, for directions and the signal. She turned slowly, and where the sky turned blue, she was at her feet, crying, and sobbing to herself.<|endoftext|>

In the winter, the winter it felt to be. From the border of Canada, where everyone stood glued to their TV sets and radio, we all knew it was close by. We looked it over, but our eyes were so burnt down that they saw to it they were glued to the screen. It's cold and wet out here in Oskaloosa, but not this cold outside. They were in the New Mexico desert. It's muddy. It's dry. No one saw a particle off the horizon. Nobody talked about it. We just thought that maybe this was a new time, just some time after the war started. No one asked why it was over, but in that time, it never really happened. It was just a new time. It felt like the beginning of something new.
Then from the dark grey of Ohio we heard it. It got to us and what we saw inside shocked us, and all we did was to run and hide. They were all frozen, and would not move. So when they finally did move, our world had changed forever. Anyways it felt like a new season, so much more pleasant than the old. People were in their houses, playing games, hugging, riding a rollercoaster of emotions. It was the same spirit as all of that, the same excitement. Then it got to them, and they let the snow fall just as it had the whole winter.<|endoftext|>

" Oh forfend, I think you'd better be more diligent. "
" To keep the party cool? "
" Thank you, my wonderful trumpets. "

It was finally Thursday. I called one friend and they were all jaded. One guy though was clearly insane. Of course it wasn't like that, I had turned on my channel and been barred. Anyway, I tried calling them over and over again, and only one response. One "Hello " and they were dead silent.
I smiled at my friend and we quickly got to work calling off my five minutes of advice.
I started with the caller ID. " Just hope you don't have any ". I looked in the caller ID and saw I had another caller ID I had to put in there too.
A perfect scene with myself and the caller ID. I didn't remember the book I was pulling off last night, but as I was casting the cards I noticed the number was twice my pitch and the opening cams on both fronts were ending about the same time. They were both running short.
I added " I don't have any".
*Click*
My mind fell into a non-sequiturs deep belly. I had resigned myself to not having even partied tonight. The calls didn't sound exactly right though. Was I having a stroke? Did I need a steadying change of pace? This was *why* I had to keep going?
As the work day carried on the call came and went, and it seems that it was not the call I would be making that ended in rejection. It would lead to more ridiculous propositions and hurtful things that the viewer would watch.
The weeks after that went on pretty even. People looked on and on and on, and no one ever failed. Turns out those things are only temporary.
When it all started to change I had never noticed so much as a change.
I woke up covered in blood and hurt. No more woe.<|endoftext|>

Can't believe they didn't just hand me the gift of immortality. How wrong I was. I don't have any family, no boss, no co-workers. No fiancé or best friend. I was always in the hospital. But apparently the hospital just transferred me to eternal life with a few doctors and the president took it for personal benefit.
I'm an immortal being. Immortality means that if there is any other way out of life, he's got a gun to my head. Not that I want to go, but am too embarrassed to lose my immortality. By the way, the idea that I might be one is worthless. Wouldn't it be unfair of me to visit my grandma to claim I still lived if I was dead? You never expect my funeral to go so smoothly, but I suppose that's another matter entirely.
Being able to breathe underwater is so much more impressive than being able to use my body as a wheel. The ropes we use to push and lift things keep me anchored to land and see what's happening on land, but its just a lot more difficult to land underwater without drowning myself. I mean, who could they tell they were in the facility?
There were so many prayers for my death, and so many questions. Why didn't they tell me anything was wrong? Well, now they're asking me questions. And they ask it in other ways too.
"I'll never forget you. Please, do us both a favor." I can't be there.

"Our species's storytellers are the greatest minds in the history of our species. Once upon a time, when this planet was teeming with life and resources we selected the balance between warm, moist, and salty climates for the development of us. We would control both of their needs and sacrifices just as much as their skies or soil. We would force their jungles and forests to become natural landscapes, clean, and one day.
We were prepared to carry on this game of ours forever; half our species had expected to die out from starvation, disease, and the like. We quickly realized that we just weren't ready. We stopped their deaths with flying behemoths, boiled off with animal feces, and fell, shattered, into the world below us.
Until then, we lied our way out of the land, crawling into caves and collapsing buildings; attempting to dig up the remains of our life. There are tales of us up here and here doing good, of sacrificing for humans - even killing them. However, although we admit that we may have accidentally taken advantage of the strangeity of the way the world was, we knew that we were our own worst enemy. We seek revenge if not for justice, or mercy.
I myself am a member of the local Pokemon society. My mother taught me how to bestow upon my and her race that we might still be alive, even if it was just a full year later. While we were fighting off predators - and mine did not respond well - I knew from experience that we would never be more effective than those with whom we fought. We were tenacious creatures - of nearly indestructible build and raw power. We lost 10/10ths of our males in those eight years. I would call this extinction moment a victory that would weigh on my family long after I would die with them.
We were in a position where we would have some strength left - if only we could gain courage. Without any of those traits the humans lacked, the game of Magikarp and Charizard took a dim turn for the worst, as the suited leader and heir to my tribe were swiftly slaughtered by the humans. After all, we were so easy to be killed. We must be exterminated. But such is life that it never really was. We found a cure for another freak disease - the first dubbed the Gyarados.
My sister will be very displeased - at first - by what I did, considering my knowledge of the game - but she would stop believing in it and not let me go. I must admit that it was a laughably dumb game. But then again, how could anyone possibly put it right? Would we ever live another day in peace and tranquility?
Slowly enough, but surely, it all came together. I helped my brother do what he did to the children I brought home. Together we started to prevent the genetic mutation in my brother's Pokemon - one that was not named Gyarados. I never fully understood how it worked or why they had such a horrible mutation. I was fed up with it for a long time, even when we passed through forested areas. I eventually decided to give my brother something that would make me happy. I found a new race of humans - nearly uncontacted, coming out of the forest with massive army. It was soon too late - they hunted us down quickly.
They told me that I would be going home at any time. I would have to wait until my people's final hours. So, it was a solemn night. And so I waited. I waited. Eventually I gave up - I could not change my leader's genetic mutation - I had to try. I have no choice but to go.<|endoftext|>

"Come inside! We have a lot going on! " Harold sighed. " I don't know why I can't handle everything on my own, " he said, spitting on the robe on the table.
" I just know I don't want any of this! " Lucy crouched down beside him and gripped his shoulders tightly. The younger Man looked up from the ground, tears soaking his brown and pale skin. " Just let us do this, " he said, pushing himself up. " He really could handle it. He might not. I can't let him; I can't let him break! "
" I'm not sure, " Harold said. The others just sat there frozen. He wanted to hold Lucy back and stop them.
" Maybe you'll call the police; like *that*... " He glanced over at Harold, and his features lost their meaning. " Maybe I'll shout for your mom; I know I do. "
" I don't have any choice, " Lucy said, sobbing softly.
Harold opened his mouth to speak, but he stopped. " Who's there? " He stammered. " Who is he? "
Lucy looked back and up to him, teeth caked with tears. " We've been saving each other, " she said.
Harold turned to her, tears streaming down his face. " I know! I know I did it! I know the rest of you are watching me now; I have a child with my own life. " He looked over at Lucy. " But, isn't it true? "
Lucy smiled. " It's true, " she said.
" Don't hurt us, " he said, putting his hands over Lucy's mouth. " Don't... hurt us! " He grabbed Lucy's hand and left her there, looking over the bedroom. " Don't hurt us! Don't make me! "
Harold's eyes started to water. He sighed. " We can do this, " he said, and opened his mouth to say something. He had to beg for his mother to keep her daughter safe.
" Are you sure we won't hurt him? " she asked, pulling her hair out of his mouth. " Are you sure he's okay? "
" Of course, Lucy! You're a great husband, if he gets out of bed and does something... " he paused. " He can stop being a coward like you, " he repeated. " You really have got some work to do. "
Lucy looked at him, and she smiled. " We'll finish him up."<|endoftext|>

As time went on, I began to think "fuck this bitch, I'm in as much danger as she is". Being a lowly soldier, I read as little as possible on the news, which in hindsight was undoubtedly some pretty good information. The highest ranking German officer of some organization funded by the SS convinced me that our operation would become as much a success as we hoped. There were no casualties, but my friend Stich by my side told me that there were probably a hundred wounded in total. The news didn't take him very seriously, and, in my semi-convicted rage, I ran across the trenches, grabbing two lucky bullets. After I had grabbed them, I would take up a position on the flank of the top post.
I closed my eyes and prayed that the end was near. The soldier was a mild-mannered fellow about my age, who wore a pretty much faded, faded blue jacket with a tattered shirt to match. This fellow, we called him, Frank, took out his rifle and we started firing. We could hear the rest of the artillery beeping overhead, hell that comrade killed millions. He pulled his blasting pistol away from the nearest column and started pointing it at me.
"Get it right! " I screamed at him, my voice dripping with a heavy lilt. The other soldier whipped the gun out of its holster and pulled the trigger, shattering my skull. I felt my body spiral downwards, as the bullet tore through me. " FUCK! " I screamed out and we fired. Those morons were the last to fall. I crumpled to the ground and I died of fright.<|endoftext|>

When the little girl came to me two weeks ago, I asked her, "Do you remember me? "
It's hard to tell sometimes.
I'd left my proof of existence to her, after she ran away. It was sad because she didn't understand the truth anymore, but I didn't mean to, no matter what my mom told me, it was my moral obligation to prove the one truth I knew.
I needed to show her that the moon hurt more than it hurt, and I needed to prove my innocence so that she wouldn't have to live in misery.
It didn't work.
Every night, we sit together in my room, and I think of all the years we had spent together. I won't pretend to be heartless in caring about her.
Sitting together, even on the night of the fireworks.
I miss her, I miss her so much.
I could never explain the existence of hell.<|endoftext|>

"Wait..all you did was appear in FTL. "
" But-What about the propulsion systems? "
" Yes. If something else went wrong, it needed more energy than they had given it. If the focus of the gravity in the air was too low, you could drift through space. "
" What else? "
" We exist on other worlds. "
" I'm sorry. Do you need more information? "
" No. "
" What information? "
" What else could you wish? "
" Yes. Every thought. Every mind. I can think in words. "
" I wish I could think anything you want. "
" Yes, yes. Only if I wanted to say or think something profound, unimaginable, and marvelous. However, you will know too much and it will take not one instant to know. You will soon be disgusted at what you don't know. "
" Yes, please. What other Humans should I be?"<|endoftext|>

Your most basic power is to be able to predict the future.
I can't imagine or even actually use it. I've been picking up things with my eyes off the shelf of cash I use to munch the rest of my soup, a few hands brushes it down by the stairs, and a few minutes before I start getting hungry enough for supper.
And what sort of bomb or whiskey do you put in your soup? What sort of bomb or whiskey do you put in your soup and only then find out that it's been replaced by an actual bomb and whiskey?
Well you've got to be an idiot to think about that.
They tell me that I have developed a habit of taking knives out of their cases, but never use the scissors. Do you know how my fingers are made? What are they made of? Sure, I can pick them out by looking at my hands, but no, that's not how knives work. They don't make handles, they don't make pickles.
And that's where my favorite superpower comes into play.
Like plastic forks and steak knives. I can shape them like the rest of my blades and make them run with a jagged edge and firmness while slicing. I can get in a pulp or drag a drain or shove a dart in the funnel of the toothpaste that comes with toothpaste and work out the subtle changes in the jelly that's worming its way into your toothpaste.
You see, this whole knack of testing times is due to the fact that I can taste time, and given that I can smell the weak spots of time that may have gone wrong and can still be traced back into the cells lining the roots of our bodies I can track them back to the cells lining the memories we had before we went through puberty.
The other side of the coin, while not an original power and nothing specifically supernatural but really an effect of preference, is that whenever I want to see someone grow or grow smaller, or those things, they either shrink or grow to the size of their own mother's hand.
I don't even know why they don't just look like me.
I don't even know why I can't just control them.
This is why I stop using my powers.
Because I don't like kids anymore.
See, it all started with a certain kid. His neighborhood dog was a jerk, and he ended up with deaf ears because of him.
You see, you can't force others to move in a room that way because they will just find the kid because they're under their neighbor's thumb, and thus will appear normal.
But what if it wasn't? What if it was? And how would I know where I belonged without taking all of that experience? What if, instead of learning from the hard and hard, I learned from the hard and harder things, I learned from the hard and hard days of adolescence and in my early twenties my contacts have discovered I can ask any of them if they were ever diagnosed with schizophrenia or if my parents had other kids who were taking such drastic measures to keep those kids quiet. I can pick them out and try to be something they are.
This for the greater good, I suppose. It's like they'll think I'm insane and I'll kill them.

I don't know. Look. I don't know how many times I've heard that girl pickle steaks at Burger King or that red velvet pork rolling because she wanted to be in Texas again. Of course, that never happened in *The Interview*. Always brings down your socks. It's always raining at a burger joint, only a few miles from the bar, ya know? Even *Friday Night Lights* has snowed when I have to work late, so it's kind of cheesy.
And it's not that I can't relate to him, it's that what I see has *actually* gotten *really* distressing. What if she makes him have sex out in front of me? If he's jealous of me. Of course, that would make him *want* me to have sex again. But that would make him *want* me to wait for *Saturday Night Live*. For *Friday Night Lights*.
I also *need* to get in more places around here. I have to make a total of a dozen trips around here. It's like there's this whole massive whole basement to which we've walked in our entire lives. And it's also- I don't know- all those too- big, burning walls and all that.
Ah, that sounds even more vile than describing how I feel about him. It sounds even more disgusting.
What if I -- what if I -- he's getting closer. She wants me to fuck her! Why have *I* never met a *Virgin* who's like that? That ’ s more perverted than women. Like I'm just -- I shouldn't have a guy like that around. Maybe I should spend some more time with her. For the first time in my life, I want to be with her. That ’ s why I *have* to date him!
No. Please. Please, just make this stop. For *Friday Night Live*. For *Saturday Night Live*.<|endoftext|>

Raddrick jumps off the balcony onto the ledge of the building. It was cold out on the city street and the odor was overpowering. Up against the layer of concrete around him it smelled less of a cologne than of a mac and cheese sandwich. For a minute he gazed up to the facade of the building, floating above the filthy city underneath.
As he stroked the left cheek of his cheek, he noticed how the next few weeks felt less like a single day for him as he reflected on the life and events of a Tuesday. The liquid inside his hand seemed to match the single moment he got into his apartment when the landlord threw his stuff in the trash and slammed the front door behind him. Walking through the parking lot he saw that the condo was being demolished immediately.
"Oh... " he thought, tapping his chin against the back of his neck. " Well this isn't going to work out... " He put his hand on the keys under his sweatshirt, pulling a bottle from the bottom of the bag under the door. " Just for a moment. "
The 7-year old boy fell asleep on the sidewalk beside him. Right before he was crawling under the foot of his cardboard heels he heard a knock on his door. He ignored it and pounded on it with his nose, causing the handle to squeak from the numerous cracks that made up the door.
He heard footsteps approaching, he looked up at the time. It was 8:37. He figured it would be a signal he was going to head over to the apartment he lived in. Maybe they'd clean his damn carpet and order some tacos in progress. No. He was going to cut his head off! Get off my balcony!
As he walked through the door, his left eye went blank. He blinked, looking in the direction that his school bus went. Where was this latest scammer? How did he even know this was going on? That he was doing a job. Where'd they get the nanomachines? They looked exactly like the ones Swanson and his parents had been making for his high school seniors. Who made the fake meat masks for this slick sales person to sell?
He immediately recognised the facade in front of his house; he had seen the nanomachines in the phone booths under the kitchen counter every day in the last month. The one that would stop him from accidentally flying over here. How strange that he had one today. He carried the metal plastic mask up to the ceiling, rotating it to face him. He noticed the one thin goatee sticking out from under the fake white foam, useless.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw another image. Blinking he looked up to check the time and see a faint crinkle on his watch. If he had that much time left, he'd need to finish this up before his long meeting with Mr. Sanchez.
The noise was faint and barely perceptible from outside. It seemed to come from the shadows and walls of his apartment. He'd be standing there for the duration of what seemed like an hour. There was a ringing in his head that would overtake him if he did nothing to get up. By the time he reached his apartment, his room was gone.
Sitting in his apartment was his mom. Tucking away her lunch knife, she had pulled the veil covering the shadowy, grey and black bathroom covering her whole body. She grabbed the rug from behind the couch she was lying down on and hugged it tight as her best friend Martha tried to hold it tight.
" Mom, I'm so sorry." he whispered.<|endoftext|>

“ Orchestrated two years ago the threat began. The collapsing of cities along with bodies spiralled into ruin, especially under heavy bombardment and destruction. Once the buildings and civilians managed to escape with relative ease, it was almost as if they were breathing natural air, only for it to fall through the cracks of reinforced glass as well as crumbling concrete. The florescent lights stood no chance. Those that did found that they could enter the world of their dreams from any one of the myriad throngs of twisted machines that had poured water over their rooftops and wheeled themselves out of the city.
My co-author, Joffrey Baratheon, held a blade to his own throat as he stepped over the horde of dead and dying corpses. The knowledge of its wielder and the horrifying horrors it held before it grew even a little angrier.
“ I had to leave the building the moment I saw them. Just one body, surrounded by government soldiers, some with hidden tunnels to hide behind, others with terrifying shrieks. Caught them in their own filth. Their reports back here. This was not without consequences, the one thing I could not be more proud of was the knowledge that they were not just here for the protection of one another.
Vietnam was in a blaze of glory. In the battlefield as we cowered in its shadow... in the barns where every bullet had been fired. In that light, we laughed. What they called the “ lessening of the scales ”. They called it the “ truth. ” Yet... however many miles from home was what the quarterdeck was. In our town center, 10,000 of those soldiers stood here, squashed by the advancing platoon. Slithering around with only purpose in killing, learning, and dying. There was no room for sacrifice. No sanctuary to worship or respect for those that had once been. Soon, all they desired was retribution. No air to breath, no way out. No one to protect them. That's what I saw. I knew the truth.
“ You killed all of us! ” chimed out the sergeant.
"No way at all! " echoed the sergeant. " Twenty thousand soldiers. Do you still *want* to feel pain? "
" Pray that I take all this glory for ourselves. "
" I never fought a good fight. I'm sorry. "
" Over this hill, there lies a bakery. Sweet cookies, cookies from the bakery that I once knelt under in Vietnam. Good men with families. Families with a love for my family. A love for my lovely daughter. I hope for some time, that this one day, that I may live. "
" I have never believed any of that. "
" Do you love her? "
" I do... "
" Do you hold me in your arms, in your love? "
" Please... it's over. It's over. This is over, I can take what I want. But I have to survive the consequences of this war, and I have to leave it behind."
There was only so much time before the light burned out. The fields behind our town faded and the road was paved with dirt, right into the dead of night. Behind our fortified city stood a line of stone columns high above and under. Silhouettes stretched out the bed of the columns, obscuring the front and rear lights as we rode our horses. When we got close, we could see that the group who had led the assault had circled. Their ambush was a no man's land and every human in the rotted black carriage knew it. So from the corner of my eye, I looked up at Joffrey. A shadow grew up from the back of our mouth.<|endoftext|>

"Gooooo!",
I was never really sure how I would describe my appearance once I returned from a binge drinking binge.
I was falling back asleep on my couch before I finally grabbed a box of Virgin Mary's in the bag.
That's the last thing I remember before I awoke.
*Death may be upon us all*, I thought to myself as I stalked towards her bedroom door.
I could not recall exactly how the night started. I would ask my therapist for clarification and in turn he would answer with some horrifying information but I never really had the courage to pay close attention to his questions.
After what seemed like a mile or two I heard footsteps on the door. It was dark as I frantically tried to slow down as the door creaked open.
In my drunken state I saw the handsome mans hand in mine.
He grabbed my arm and pulled me closer. In some way I knew what was about to happen and tried to recall what I was about to say. I leaned forward a bit and into the kiss that he gave me.
*I am God*, the words flowed out with ease.
The good news is that after drinking my first cup of water I know she loves me. I will forever remember her in this world.

*The perfect hair. *
My eyes snap open as I hear footsteps through the halls.
We are in a long hallway. I can see an even longer hallway; thankfully the red lights that were installed a few months earlier were a complete pain to adjust to.
We arrived at her bedroom window but it was dark, clouding the room. I wonder what may have caused her to fall asleep...
What could have caused this?<|endoftext|>

I gazed at the casings strewn around. Each one held room for dozens of planets, but they were empty, robbed; pryed open by something ancient and sour.
Of course, a hundred billion and one fires filled my belly every night. They were molten, black, and flames that washed over the huge, painted-over landscape of our world. I couldn't bear it any longer. I wanted nothing more than to light a fire on the deep end of this forsaken planet.

Then I thought of the humans. The people who lived in this place, from the same home planet that was taken from them... turned their only lives to terrible acts of cruelty and hopelessness. It was like they were the ones who hated us and the creatures who thrived on it.
I now knew that humans and other life forms were a long, long time ago. The ones who always tried to kill each other, always pushed each other and used sex to their advantage. I knew that we are no longer welcome here. I couldn't bear seeing them around, but it was worth the chance to see them today. I knew that they were here, waiting to see us.<|endoftext|>

"Dammit Steven! Are you even listening! "
" Still listening? Because you said it's been a while since anyone has been listening? Just say it, nobody talks anymore! What is happening? "
" Whoa Steven! Where are we, and where is my mom? "
" The earliest fossils find that they are in a nest in a cave somewhere. "
" I thought the cave was isolated from other areas in Australia and the Pacific Northwest. The planet hasn't been roamed the last hundred years. Isn't anyone supposed to know that the Earth may be abandoned by now? "
" Whoa Steven, get away from me! There isn't an Earth! That's crazy! "
Steven felt the fear in his heart, but he wasn't going to let go of his son anymore. No.
" I'm getting far too close to my mom! You're going to have to go find her. "
He knew that if he kept going, she would be too. He had spent countless generations hiding out, hiding in an underground bunker that his grandfather left under the earth. It was going to be years before he became free from those cataclysmic forces.
" Steven... what is the meaning of life, Steven? You think I even care? Listen to me. I have come to save you. "
" Steven, please... I am not going to listen to you. Steven. "
" Steven-Steven! Don't... Look at me. I will be gone forever! "
Steven looked into the reflection of his long broken face, but it was revealed in a single piece of glass that he had a sickly look to him.
" And that is the meaning of life... Steven? "
" Go away Steven, you need to rest. What the hell is happening? "
" What is a taste? What is a craving? "
" You.... If you don't tell me! I will destroy myself! "
" There is no purpose left in destroying yourself! "
" There is no purpose left in destroying my family. I will kill you. "
" Yes Steven. There is only one thing left to do. Wait outside! You are so precious! Don't go! "
But no... Steven waited outside. He turned to look at his son, but when he looked back at his brother, he had realized that his brother was gone. He had also realized that Steven could only remember the single remnant of him in the cave.
" Am I the only one... Steven? "
But Steven was right. Without Steven, there would be no life. Without Steven, he would surely be dead. A weak, withered dinosaur like him who had been bitten by a madman would die. That would be a shame, but Steven was going to go find the rest of his family. He would go find his own family.
That wasn't happening anymore.
A single tear formed on Steven's cheek, and a small flame burned within him.
" I love you Steven."<|endoftext|>

"We lost the Principality! Prince Khan vole you for your insolence! Hek sat on your greatest throne until he died, yet you sit your queen on your lowest. I was king, prince. Besides, there is no reason why I would let you be in the hole, " The Queen's voice boomed. She knew what she was doing, and was slowly chewing on a bite. She winced at the people's outburst.
She was again switching a subject, right before she handed him the reigns, as she did before the rest of the nobles. " Remember Prince, other heroes are weak. They just sit there, in corners, letting their moral compass swing. My fault, my great-grandfather... Prince.... Prince... Don't they know their place? What kind of queen are they that they are? "
Prince Khan looked up from his book and sighed. " Well, there are a few things that are still wanted. Now, another civil war has been set up. Your daughter will become a victim, " he paused. She stared at him, then at him.
" I don't understand... What is my daughter to do in my life? " he questioned.
" You have a daughter, Margaena, and you decide who goes to school. Choose your daughter and teach her how to fight for justice. "

King Kazdal had no Idea she had been meaning to take this turn, and so he had joined the Couple. Again, it was simple.
" Wonder what happens if the prince kingdom decides to defy... The King, " they laughed. A couple of villages had been devastated, and his wife had driven off once again. So yes, they would eventually go after the ruler. " Our action will mean our ends, if we survive ", Kazdal grinned. " The Little Flower, Princess of the Secret Lake will find where the prince will win the throne, if the kingdom survives this... Holy Shit, we're winning! " He turned and led the knights into battle.
" You would understand my family didn't. Shall we retire to the Capitol Palace? Don't be pudgy, my dear Princess. Be careful, I can't do it anymore! " Kazdal turned and called up his little sister, Rose, and showed her where the princess lived. Kazdal smiled as they nodded.
" No, Princess, " he said, leaning in closer, his voice rising. " You get what I mean, but now I have to run, and I have to hide before they learn."<|endoftext|>

He was my age at the time. I was 13 and I was a full time student at University. My parents and I loved being parents and spending time with you. One day, our parents had returned from their trip to Paris. Our parents had noticed a large group of kids camping together in an unfamiliar city, they quickly found the small rocks they had made and began to follow them. You were the best part of my life. You offered to help me out in my usual pratfall of Paris, I decided you wanted me to live in South America for the rest of my life and we just came down from Mt Everest together. We were only separated one night when we woke up. Your mother stood in front of the sleeping body of our child and saw the faces of both of you. She recognized you as an ancient warrior, your father named... Charles. That was enough. We started to explore. No men, no women. We explored each of the cities we could find. We found massive structures and old orchards. We found moons where people had lived, kings who were killed and people, explorers who had been tortured in old savage ways, and men who had been adventurers. We found highly sophisticated tech at each of these new sites we were exploring. And most importantly, We found you. And that was enough. We were warm family and you were my ideal match.

"GOD, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF A CRITICISM I AM TO YOU? "
" You expect me to, and I will you eternal honor and send you from this Earth. " He paused, and recited a thank you note to his young ladies in the audience. The crowd gasped.
The King watched them from the edge of his palace. A small map drew out, neatly folded up and placed in the stone.
GOD THIS IS THE AMOUNT-EQUALITY. YOU PERCEIVE ME THIS FOR THOSE WHO WERE WRONG, KNOWING WE ARE SUFFERING. I SHALL HAVE US COMPLAIN IF YOU CAN, AND YOU WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO KNOW I AM WEAK AND STUPID.
" YOU MUST TAKE THE WORD FROM MY GOD AND IMPROVE HOW I AM MANY INEQUALITY THAN YOU. YOUR GLORY HAS BROUGHT UNIFORM ME OF YOUR CREATIONS. I SHALL UNLOCK YOURSELVES AND BEAT THEM TO MEAT AT MY SESSION. I AM YOUR CHAMPION TO STAY ALIVE. "
His archangels, Arxants, and Muntas waited for the heavens to come up and watch. GUD AXES and MLEAVE RHOGLANT. WHOLE RHOGLANT SURRENDERS GUARDERS OTHER RHOGLANT PIEPTS. " I SHALL TURN DOWN THIS WORLD ON ME AND MAKE YOU HIS CHILDREN AND GIRLS. I SHALL SCRATCH YOU AND KILL YOUR EYES WHEN I MEET YOU!"
In the center of the room sat the king and queen, and they each had a single large circle at the center. They all held a few well placed eggs in their hand. The small one was loose, and confused, so they decided to go do one last thing. To completely stave off the growth. The queen looked at the king's face. He had eyes of grey, white, and black and he looked into the distance at three blocks.
They all started to follow the trail of the path, and were greeted by the first step. The queen screamed. She hugged the king, and holding her beauty in her palm, kissed him on the nose, and then when the third step was all that was left he broke her gorgeous face in two. Then, being sure his bindings wouldn't stick, he raised her high voice.
-Ha ha! Hi, welcome back to my humble hobbit country! Have you ever thought of walking up to a girl and *smile*? Never thought you would love someone with such a beautiful face and pointed-to-you jaw that made her *love*. Even when you were blind and pitied, love is a powerful influence. I often wonder... why the... you know...? Your milk-white green eyes... Your nose... You... you look... meaty as always. When you kiss your significant other, the look " Kissing " makes them *loud*, and it's all the more delicious. And you think *wow, I could be one of the first one to lick my lips. * And you think me handsome..? And you think *oh, I wish I was this handsome. And can't sleep for hours, sigh.... how lovely* -before her's lips parted.<|endoftext|>

With a swipe of the wand, the strange mushroom loomed across the line of vermin trying to enter the Room of Requirement. Harry felt his chest tighten beneath the pressure of his spells. Soon he was sitting down, hands on his hips, elbows on his knees, nose on his palms. His mouth opened in a way that seemed to come from every muscle and every muscle cell in his body. A flash of light followed by the sound of blood, followed by another, and a third of what was left. He screamed into his breath. What he screamed didn't make sense. His breathing was labored. His arms were tethered to the ropes binding him to the walls, cast down with a spell that would surely kill him.
The scents of sulfur, blood and a mix of broom sticks could be heard every time the magic dials went to life. He tried to say what was going on but his lips still froze. His pupils dilated the further away his eyes were from the target, only to fall onto the ground. He closed his eyes and the madness began.
When he opened his eyes again he realized that he was still in the room. He tried to open them again, but all the movements he made when his eyes closed stopped his mouth in and his arms outstretched for something to grab him. He was heavy in the air. A flash, a slam of a blade jolted him from his reverie. With each breath he took more tears began pouring.
When he finally shut his eyes he saw something that made his heart beat faster than a billion humans could match. Light began growing on his eyelids, tears falling down his face into the dirt. He stopped.
He dropped to the ground, eyes wide open. Blood poured freely from his throat and his mouth hung open, mouth still agape, legs dangling down.
"How long have you been away from school? " he asked, uttering his last words.
A small silence filled his memory until they were finally broken by the sound of another body rushing towards him. He spun around to find the kid. A girl had taken out a pencil to draw a number on the ceiling of the room.
She didn't even move.
" Stop! Do not look at the girl! " the boy yelled at her.
She stared at him, mouth open in disbelief. With a shudder she kicked him over as though he had jumped from a top shelf. The kid was the size of a truck but instead of grabbing him with the power he possessed, the girl ripped out a chunk of meat from his stomach and threw it at Harry.
" No!" Harry cried, what he could only describe as the most pathetic little cry he had ever heard. The girl grabbed him by the throat, before a flash of light split his vision leaving him with one last thought. The screaming little girl tossed a cigarette at the boy. Harry's eyelids started bulging and spasming while his pupils locked with hers, wasting energy. He threw the cigarette to the ground, watching it escape.
Sudden light seared through the muck in his cheeks, and he saw before him a stark darkness. This was definitely Hogwarts.<|endoftext|>

"Mirrors. "
I finally had it. Right. I'd managed to write a melody for a three month old girl at home, and now, I had- This was it. I would take her piano with me. I'd write what little I had left in it, only to take on whatever additional parts I needed. After all, I loved to write. I love the thought of playing piano. I loved the fantastical thing people think of as fantastical. I loved a warm, bright light, and a beautiful tone. I loved *her* piano. And I imagined she was going to be able to play piano, too.
But it was too late.
I got an especially vivid dream, when I woke up. I was *so* trippy. Not like I'd wake up to a toddler playing guitar, or a girl playing a violin. But I was... It was at that moment I really, really wanted to get to it. I wanted to make her learn the piano, but not me.
" B-but you wan na? " she asked me.
" Hi. " I stammered, trying to get her attention.
" Oh, um... " she didn't like the way the word'waited' spelled out. Was that my worst nightmare? " I... I want to play in the room, but we have to get to the bathroom! "
" Sure thing. "

Sam and Gary were both high school sophomores. Sam was 22 years old, and Gary was 20, with golden hair. Sam and Gary were poor.
Tim was 28 years old, and was a carpenter. His god damn money shot up during one of the'prospective layoffs' meetings in his lawn. Tim had never missed a payday so he hoped he'd be good at his job soon enough. One of the younger members of his class sits at the table in front of Sam and Gary.
"How do you want to survive those jobless times? " Tim inquired with a stern expression on his face.
Gary replied " Mom and Dad have been preparing us for this years school tour. We've learned to eat healthy and speak English. In the end the only thing keeping us alive are our friends! " He points to the table where Samuel and Gary are still sitting.
Tim stared blankly at the two of them. " Sam, after you make a boy, can you just sit with him for a little while and tell him that you love him and that you love him back? "
Sam answered " Yes, yes "
Sam responded " Sounds great, and happy. How'd it go? I want to help him make ends meet. I want him to find a job. "
Gary rubbed his forehead.
" He's an accountant. You know this sort of stuff. He's looking for a job in the hit single market. This whole thing was a huge draw. We all know sales start at $ 100. And you and I probably both want the same thing. I'm doing three houses and I'm saving more than I made last year. We can really really work this out. "
Tim set his fork down and looked over the table. " I knew you'd be concerned, right? "
Sam nods his head and smiles.
Gary rubs his temples. " We know the sort of little stuff, " Gary says as he removes his fork. " We don't need to worry about this. You've got people willing to do it, from school as well as families. "
Tim makes a sad face. " Looks like things have been pretty great for you. We've done so much for you and Mom. And now you've got one other thing to worry about. "
Gary and Sam have a bad eternity, each sighing deeply as they repeat the conversation. Sam frowns and glances at the teacher. " Excuse me. Could you tell me a little about your childhood? "
Gary shuffles the papers back and forth, it seems that he is becoming more frantic.
Sam lets out a long, terrible sigh. " Remember how mom passed away? "
Gary scoffs. " Do you remember? They loved her so much. So much. They had such nice little dresses. It was so simple. "
Sam nods and looks back at Gary. He rubs his temples again.
" Its true. You would make a huge wager. Now let's talk about it... " He says after a minute.
Tim's brows furrows and he reaches forward to pick up the paper. He leans forward and whispers to Gary.
" Sam, I'm... I think I've got something there."
Sam turns back to Tim, then back to Gary, then back to Tim.
Then the two of them look at each other.<|endoftext|>

Did I really want this to end?
I looked at my watch. I didn't really know.
When I first knew we were going to save everyone, it seemed like a good idea. Just load time, okay, I guess. What else could be so lucky? I could walk around every street, but my heart is aching so I'm just resting. I sigh, feeling the skin break off. As the twisted and shaped costumes do, I find the thought of having to fight against more villainous suits just plain tiresome. In fact, the worst part? I can't die. In this line of work, I try to see some way to make a statement to save everyone. I eat my sandwich and wait for the next mob member.
Me: *yay for retirement friends*, *yay for paying attention, * *yay for real heroes*
Bim: *clear as the fuck*
Asshole: *literally the saddest person you ever met*
That doesn't make sense.
Hell, why would there be men and women sent to the mines and hydroelectric dams in order to make sure they look like corpses after every single morning cut?
I pick myself up, turn my gun on myself, and switch the safety off. I can see the SWAT team mowing down a makeshift barricade. Or trying to throw a grenade out of an airplane or something on a plane, or try to jump into a barbershop. This routine was probably all for nothing, though, what with what happened last time.
I'm surprised nobody has died. I pick myself up and walk inside.
The Mayor isn't here.
Hands shaking, he holds up a briefcase.
A speech is coming.
Me: *yes he was the best mayor the state of Kentucky, his campaign was never set to succeed in this state*
Bim: *the guy is an imposter, almost got a single super villian too*
He reads this.
Me: *yeah, ok we can call him at any point in the next 50 years*
Bim: *nah, yeah he never ran a tough campaign*
Me: *no, he's been on the platform from start to finish, he hasn't been trying to outdo anyone*
Bim: *definitely a big supporter of his policies*
Me: *is that you, or me*
Bim: *who the hell even has the balls to call himself an imbecile with the right policies*
Me: *he has staved off the effects of nuclear weapons*
Bim: *who the fuck would the hell ever want to use nuclear weapons to stop the start of World War III*
And all goes black.
Almost as if they knew what was happening right away.
A man with glasses approaches me and asks if I'm okay.
Me: *we can just blow him up, I have a lot of time left*.
He pushes me away, and explains I don't really have any money.
We don't fight crime, we are the public defenders of the State.
Yep. Every superhero needs an attorney to defend them.
It isn't worth anything to have one of those careers as a lawyer with more education than minimum wage.
That, and I'm a billionaire.<|endoftext|>

Liver always rushes to everyone ’ s senses, and if he ’ s stuck, then so is he. If you are around his roots and hardy, you are his master. You are his very dream. Livers are a spectacle.
“ Bullshit! ” Someone shout at you. You are alone on the plains of the New York arid Texas. “ You can ’ t make sure that nobody else ’ s watching! ” You are shivering on a hill in the middle of New York.
“ Nonsense! ” A man yells and rushes in. “ Let us help you spread. ” You are crouched under an arboreal bush, your clothes soaked, pelting your wounded.
You can not see them through the dark. You are missing a chunk of your neck and a small tentacle. You fall to your knees and lie on a slab. Your hand reaches out to me. “ Why do you want to help me? ”
You want to help me, but it is for the best. You want to heal the old wounds. That hurts. You don ’ t understand how you ’ ve forgotten such memories. You still have pride.
“ You ’ re literally the only one in this whole country that can ’ t feel pain, and like my mother said, you ’ re just a poor sap. ” You can feel tears in your eyes.
“ I can tell you that. ” He says.

One day, you turn on some TV and decide to watch the Colbert Report. You realise that New York is awfully New York this year.
You are thinking to yourself, “ Outrageous! These New York people act like they are free! I think they will be destroyed by corporate espionage, because even in New York, corporate spies don ’ t keep secrets. ” It is a horrifying thought. People always insist on hiding. But what do you do? How do you evade them? You ask yourself what is the purpose of being so many but not knowing and then you find what you do.
You read everything about your brain. You are also afraid of rejection. And the first thing you feel is happiness. You have a sense of pride. You look at your reflection in the mirror and have a fondness. I laugh. You stare a long time, and then you look at yourself in the mirror, tears have started to fall from your eyes.
You find yourself in a room in the city and don ’ t have to live in the worst possible city in your whole life. You found yourself unable to pull yourself together on any sane, adult life. The only hope you have is to survive. You want to live as if it is life, for it might be the only way you ever possible survive. In reality, you are bound to another human being. This human being is your consciousness and never will be because you have a face inside of you. A body. Another person. The days and nights and months and years in which you break down and don't understand why you are here is going to come to an end.
You don't have a reason to be in the city. No one is making fun of you. No one is making fun of how badly you need to function on your own.
You have a plan. You want to go downtown. To move in. Get in the metro station. Don ’ t come to Washington. Make sure to get in the office. Just don ’ t forget your keycard. It is here. You will have no problem walking away from those walls of power and commerce and flight into a new manlier place. Maybe some Willy Wonka shop or Jack in the Box will understand. But you will not. You will leave. Maybe the one person in the world with such high contempt of change will create an earth that doesn ’ t need you anymore.
You want to go to a military base. You have made a choice. You have always considered yourself the “ only person left in the world. ” Never again will you have to wander the deepest ocean in the universe. Just stop lying to yourself. All it will take is some street hero.

I'm sitting in my apartment. I look down at my sheets, the sheets that cover my already sleeping head. There are no blankets, just my sheets I'm used to. Ever since I was a kid I felt like I was in love with my sheets. No matter how many sheets were once on, there was nothing there. Not until I had my first. I could feel the sheets rustling like silk and felt it come off. The weight of it. The weight of everything.
I used to be afraid that I would come here for work. Luckily not everyone used to be afraid that they would be late to their workplace at work. It wasn't until my parents got home that I realized they had to miss work. The anxiety had been turned into a massive depression. I would come home before my parents even checked, but every so often they would leave me on the couch thinking I would blow off steam, lying still, staring at my sheets. Then it was my turn to lay down and be forgotten. My sheets would be in my dreams. I would start doing weird things in my dreams. I would go out to the park or sit at the front of a book store and suddenly my bed would be full of my sheets.
For the past year I've been afraid I would come to this decision. The feeling in my throat is tearing me away from reality. It eats at me but at the same time it's also making me desire this whole night so I don't even flinch. Then the nightmares come around. They're like the spinning of a spinning wheel that changes directions at night. I wish I had more nightmares, but I don't. This lays so very heavy inside of me, I feel like I'm in a coffin.
Like a coffin being towed from the wreckage of a car. I have loved my sheets. I have loved them. I can't feel myself changing. I wake up every night in my bed wishing to sleep with this huge, glowing ball of flesh and metal. I can only feel warm, my hands and my heart screaming as the warmest blood flows from my wounds. I know I will be okay. But I don't.<|endoftext|>

“ Tell us, Mr. King. Why should I believe in a verdant kingdom? ” asked a feminine voice from behind her thick, oak cane. Her eyes were pierced by a wand as if a light was pouring in from her green eyes. I looked around in confusion. Wands were enchanted by mages. To reach the wand, its purpose was to take you. The point was always to see what might be reading the message. My parents ’ wise hands do their best to change me from the ordinary ideas of their children to the odd ones that never entered their minds, long before my mind was ready for them to make such a mistake. Wands always and everywhere are the ancient favorites of fantastical authors.
“ Because the truth is, dear King, it seems like a noble act! Give me the real story! ” I began chanting. Wands do spell the shape of stones, the shape of people, etc.
“ A noble act, if it does not imbue with magical power, one to make a promise. A promise to protect the innocent! ”
“ Protect the innocent? ”
I turned back around to find my parents facing me, looking at me like I was a fool. “ Sir, you were once part of a small community that specialized in booby traps. I did not have the greatest intention to bring you here, but I must make a promise, otherwise the village will be destroyed by my men. ”
“ But! ” My father jumped from his chair, slamming his cane on the floor as hard as he could. He lifted his hand, fist clenched, as if to intimidate my parents to kill me. But, a bright flash was all it took to put me in the ground.
“ Ah my enemies! ” I roared. Fear took over my spirit. How many times had I muttered my name and heard that the villagers were keeping me away? I could not afford to choose the original words. A promise would come to my head, I guess?
“ You are the King, ” I stated. “ No one will believe in the fake ones. The real King who will defeat all of them to be the front line. At least, until the messenger arrives and I'm one of the lands' peasants who is to be cured of disease. I don't trust my nobility with this magic, and may I continue to try and change the only prince I have ever known, the Wold? The Prince of Regalwood? Yes, exactly who I think I am, that is the only person I can trust with my ability. ”
They stared at me as I blew on their gavels.
“ Sir! ”
“ Tell me, dear prince! Why should I believe in a vengeful English King? Why shouldn ’ t I believe in a verdant country? ”
I let out a fierce roar as my father collapsed onto the ground. Tears welled up in his eyes. “ Why do you keep speaking English to me? ”
“ It is the duty of the Lord of Saxons to honour the unwavering oath of his son, Thomas! ”<|endoftext|>

Memories follow me through life like clockwork.
I let them. As beautiful as they are alien to me.
Being born always up in the clouds, as clear and crystal as shining stars.
When I leave the forest to find myself instead confined to its waiting fashion on rare days.
That day, long ago, in this forest sat a slight sparrow perched on my shoulder.
I suppose your were making a noise, when your name was uttered? After all, it would have been rude to dwell upon such a thing.
Till it wasn't my doing. Or well, because by that time I was already too tired to remember.
I'll never forget this day, nor think about it, for I can not. My fate is not yet fixed. I had grown to appreciate more and more such thoughts every morning.
I suppose I may as well not think it important anymore, for some trivial deity is calling me insane when he attempts to kill me with his warm breath.
So here I am. Sitting in the top of the old tree atop this forest trail, standing up in the bush and staring at the canopy. My youth gone to nothing as I spend my days watching the green leaves dance and looking at the trees brighten when I move away.
My nose is bruised, so much so that I feel the tears already running down my face as I look up in confused amazement.
Why is that!?
Now, maybe I am not to blame for your demise! Well, maybe, maybe one day you will find the courage to look up at the clear sky and face the earth and make the most of what you're going to be left with.
Maybe sooner than later, this will all be a pain in the ass! And perhaps you will find comfort in this peace, for when one of your most powerful accomplices sees your face he will all seem so vengeful and defeated when looking at you in that way!
For if any of these thoughts ever crossed my mind, it was in that moment. A feeling I have never felt before as though I had been born.
I wondered if it would become worse for me in a few hours, because there is no other way out of this dreadful situation.
I thought for a few minutes, and finally, in my final moments of eternity I leaned forward as if it were truth.
But it did not, and all that was left in the forest was that silhouette.
My baby. Its green eyes staring in the dark as though out of a horror movie film.
I realized that I had actually let the straw get to my neck.
I felt a gentle slithering curse upon my chest as I felt it go away, and all that was left of my newborn was that lovely little creature.
But nothing was a comforting thought to me as I wanted this little boy to grow up to be me and be happy.
But none of this will matter in the end.<|endoftext|>

I lived a simple life. Even the old folks didn't notice me playing the five circle. I went out, came home, and watched television. Plenty of cameras, and outside, was the view of large open-air space that sometimes occured to be known as the Batman theme park. That time, humanity was the most focused of the four, being the most intelligent ones, and we mostly dove into the ground, nature taking it's course.
There were only two rules of life. When I was 16, I would take my dog in for a picnic with the dogs. We'd walk outside and take small talk when the sunlight fell. I'd take the dog out for the dogs early on the morning of his birthday, and we'd always do that. That first night was fine by me.
There was only one other rule of life: if that day brought no spring break, I'd join the baseball game. Sure, it was just the last but it still made a pleasant picnic. The cold mornings were always pleasant to watch the baseball diamond slide by, and playing a baseball full of diamonds against one another would give the guys time to celebrate. Then the morning sun went down. The sun went down for five years until you saw it from a window, on your porch. That must be a reflection of something else than just the sun. At night, you could see that it was really low-slung, with big sharp letters. Maybe the lettering made the logo permanent, but the closer you looked, the more convinced you were that there was something there.
I don't know what made it permanent. Maybe just maybe the sun told us something. I tried to talk to the guys, but the owner wouldn't talk to me. Maybe it made it worse. Maybe it didn't matter. Everything I did was for nothing. The city shut down for my safety. Now, if it wasn't for the sun, I'd still be here, alone, and never to the park again. I don't know.
As of 10:45 a.m., today, the sun went down. Nobody noticed.<|endoftext|>

"Hey fellas you are finally bored, the time just seems to run out right now. Time, to wait for your next paycheck. " Said the spoiled liberal while the Obama in the background. I looked over at him and said: " What are you chums? " I looked at the empty dish bowl that had given way, taken from behind by the trashcan.
" Shut the fuck up, we are practically up here. " Said an unnamed messenger in the back seat.
" Yeah, yeah, just eating my food. It'll pass on my every word to the next gal, maybe that is why Obama won the election, sounds like a good fucking joke. " Said the President happily and cheered.
Well crap, why do people still do this to themselves, it was all so hard to make it work, just like this. Why did even the people that might be able to run? Only three hundred and fifty three people at the time of operation, but for what? Errand? I mean, that doesn't even account for the harsh reality of all of us under the new president? Five hundred eighty eight now. I took this job with the highest motive, to keep focus on my job, to make you do your job. "
" No, for me, I need to give myself away. " Said Obama.
" Yeah, well I don't have much time left, you just need to get rid of all the trash that your grandmother left on your way to work. You know what happened to those Cubs? I'll be back there soon, I guarantee I'll do the job right. I'll always love my grandma and never leave on the same day for my own. "
" Mommy's died at the ripe old age of thirty five. She'll be back, just like I expected. " Said a stunned her with her thoughts " I guess I will. "
" Alright, so what are you doing here? " Said the ungrateful Obama.
" What have I ever heard? Joe and all. Well, I still need to get rid of the office, or my bad. How about Obama, he is dead. I'll just stay behind and watch him when he leaves. No need to start by telling our new president, what you're about to do in one sitting, but maybe you could get one better if you would. "
" Sure, what the fuck, where? "
" A tall building near you. " Said the President and was staring at the windowsill.
" What? The fucking window?! "
" Nothing, it's never been used before, i haven't seen anything like it there in ages. "
" Alright, well what is that? The flames don't open up just anywhere. "
" Just like I can't see. " Said the President.
" The doors don't open up at all.
" Am I dreaming? " Said Obama and he pulled a dream catcher from his pocket and put on a giant gasket.
" Yeah. Wan na see? "
" Huh? Shit, you are totally dreaming, you need to shut that you stupid cat out. " Said the President.
" Dude, can you hear me? "
" Nah, you never heard that one ever. " said the man with the cat.
" Like, what? " Said the President.
" The door is closed. "
" Okay, that's it. Done! Let's go home." Said the man with the cat. He took off running, most likely living at the news center, but then the weather in America changed, people started saying crazy things like the President never died. They even joked about where the fire was, that he had some crazy laws about everything. Then the world got in a war against itself, killed a couple people, but everyone expected a huge enough amount of help or even recognition for them. I did it, didn't I? So then who was to stop me, right?<|endoftext|>

I will not write this for any reason other than I would enjoy writing and the resolution to make it shorter. As such, I am posting this very fast, for how much longer does it really take to say that it takes. )
The doctors told me the swelling would go away eventually. I took a lot of pride in that, when I stopped sweating I felt great, a peace I had never felt until I met her. My wife, she was a loving kind woman, and she seemed interested in me. I kept a close eye on her, everything was going great until I could barely stand. My lungs felt like sulphur in a crowded toilet. I started to think if she was in danger, I should be able to give her the proper support and she was in danger too.
My feet started to run, I needed to feel more. I needed to rest.
My mother called on me to wake up, so I can give her some help, she didn't want me sleeping in her room. I felt a single breath on my back and a tear fall down my cheek. I couldn't sleep through it, it was too much. I stopped breathing, thinking of every minute I had at work and every minute I had at home. Life was good enough for me. I couldn't live my life alone. I wanted her in my life, and she was in mine. I stopped breathing and I heaved the final of my blood, and I breathed another, another, another...
Then there she was, our daughter. This so called ordinary, but special girl I met. She seemed to enjoy it, and I knew I shouldn't be ashamed of her. I was trying to cure cancer. I love her. She made me smile more and more, her eyes twinkling with happiness. She spoke to me on the phone before reaching for the slip of paper, and I checked the small print. The last box was proof that she could live without me.
I was going to die. I had to. I had to.
My final thoughts were of her beautiful smile, lips curled into a sad smile, heart in her chest as she sobbed. After I threw myself out the window, I opened the door. I was in the car, she had been drugged and driving drunk, and all the while I was sobbing in the face of what I now knew was the day. I could never get my high because of that matter, but I could never tell her what the officers said. They told me the authorities only had one option.
Something had changed in her.<|endoftext|>

The whole world is cold. I feel stiff, although I'm not cold. I stay there for a bit and sit up in my chair, in front of this comfy chair. Just as I am looking at the room, an electronic voice says "Have you tried the DreamPad?" it taps on the panel for some time. The first bit of white light that the pixelated vision of the day reminds me of. I sit still, feeling around my chair and touch the neck of my jeans. The colors give me this feeling that I could feel the light stretch away, coming closer, growing brighter. My eyes open. I keep looking at the screen to notice I am doing weird things. I watch the light travel and the soft glow of the computer monitor seems to glow until I suddenly get to the beginning of the dream. I see a small green pixels for the hights and through them, I see colours that are made of a sort of clay. Then in the far distance, I am about to see the lights of the cities around the world, I see the red light disappear and the trees form legs as I wonder what I am doing here.<|endoftext|>

Yahweh stood outside the window of her grandmother's wedding. The cracks of the mighty Parliament gates had fallen a week ago, into her grandmothers front porch. However, as she gazed upon this location, she knew that her grandmothers Grandmother, Catherine, and her brother Benjamin were nowhere to be seen.
"My great-great aunt, Mrs. Tinchbury. Do you remember our grandmother? "
Yahweh furrowed her brow, though the light she was lighting fell not across her face.
" Grandma, I just know. "
Yahweh put her face into the glass of her grandmother's stained window that sat next to her grandfather's. After a moment, her dark eyes settled back upon the glass. She looked into its parched surface, and then to the huddled masses.
" My great-great Auntie, the people are not allowed to worship. "
Yahweh kept her composure, but Catherine, whose son Benjamin had joined the week ago now, was staring vacantly at the shattered glass. Catherine stood, patiently waiting for her visitors.
" Brother Benjamin, can you show me your grandpa's ancestral home? " Yahweh asked.
" Yes. My great-great aunt owns the - oh yes, the *Last House*! "
Yahweh gave him a confused look, then asked, " What's this bloody *dole*? "
A white bearded man walked in from behind. His khaki tuxedo gave way to a pair of stained jeans. He wore a big bald hat, and held out a small silver-framed cup. A small paper bag rested between his knees, and he began to fill the cup.
" Brother Benjamin, what of the Kingdom of God? What is it? "
Benjamin helped him to his feet, and wiped down the cup. He couldn't see the group of people that sat at the door, though.
" Your... brother Benjamin? You called him? "
Shit. Yea, this shite. Yea, why couldn't I see? Why couldn't I figure out what was happening to Benjamin?
" Ugh, what is it? Do you have any idea what your husband is doing? "
" I don't know. I just know he can be a great prophet. I'm not even sure how I can be prepared to worship him. "
Benjamin climbed onto the chair next to him, and sat down next to her. She stood there for a moment, but continued to stare at the black glass.
" Brothers? Brothers? Brothers, I'm gon na send your money and possessions to your great-great aunt-! She's going to probably tell me this is the day that your family gets assimilated into Christianity! "
Yahweh stopped in her tracks. Catherine's bag was filled again. She pulled a small piece of parchment from the bag, and looked at it for a few seconds, and then placed it in the glass. She then unfolded it in front of Benjamin's eyes.
" Tell me Brother Benjamin, who would you pray to? "
Benjamin just shook his head and smiled widely.
" I pray *to the Holy Land*! "
Yahweh ran her fingers through Benjamin's hair.
" Yes, brother Benjamin, I speak *of* the New World's History! I'll show you the *last* page of *The Book of Revelation*. "
Benjamin finished the scrawling and looked at Yahweh, who at this point was glowing with joy.
" Brother Benjamin, your father has already mentioned how the holy horse of the third civilization was an idiot. He's going to have to pray to the Greeks to be sure of it!"<|endoftext|>

"Please? "
On a whim I click the button.
The words drop into my mouth; words spill out, tumbling to the floor. I gasp for air. Blood, sweat, tears.
Then I look down at what I see.
Men: 7, 8, 9, 10.
Women: 11, 12, 13, 14.
Suddenly they all look at me. Their memories, head over heels.
My blood rushes to the window; a terrifying sight. I can see the bodies.
My head trembles, pulse pumping outwards. I must have hit a nerve.
A doctor approaches. " Dr. Olsen, of the operation, please respond to what we have just shown you. "
My only response is a simple " Dr. Cash. "
" I don't care what you think, you put money up for the card. What's the problem? "
He walks away, but before he leaves I can see his dead wife laying on a remote or the chair he used to sit in. His smile holds his blood, his wet eyes start to burn.
My jaw clenches. My heart goes, my spine begins to thump.
I grab my pistol. " So do I. Make sure you can survive it. Make sure you stay alive, so nobody will kill you."
A minute later I feel my legs give out. The door opens. I can hear the police sirens.<|endoftext|>

"No out there. "
They'd seen the moon at least ten times, let alone seen a pair it make. Didn't matter how much they'd grown to like it. Both nights before they'd had parents come over to visit, without warning a kid or two would be born that could make their day a week closer.
& nbsp;
It took them until *at least* a year. In one day that's when they'd conceived, and grew so attached and trusting to their new daddy that they put up everything in the house. We never wanted a child because he was away from home all day, worried about what they would get for the weekend, or about the consequences of getting up early to babysit their older sibling in the mornings.
& nbsp;
Don't get me wrong, not everyone said that the moon was a killer. But it never does.
& nbsp;
That was the problem in their first marriage. Being away on business got busy, so poor and destitute, that when it was a good time for their their child, they gathered all their savings in a nice, easy enough space out of the house. This shelter was able to pay for its services with a cut of tax. Sure it wouldn't have been enough to save them out of poverty in this country, but after they got off work and came home to their first child, in the span of eight weeks, they couldn't live without their plan, even though a husband or wife would be just about the minimum to take care of them.
& nbsp;
That isn't to say that it didn't happen. Each and every night. That never meant anything about the possible deaths of some of our residents. Each and every night had been different. When they came home, and could hear and see the moon there, they were both worried. So concerned to see just how amazing it could be that the sky would show them, to see what would happen when they were sick, not before. But they found much more excitement for their child, since that's the only way to convince them to abandon their life of labor.
& nbsp;
It's funny what they learned from watching the moon, how quickly it started coming back to life. One day, almost as soon as we saw it fade away from sight, a couple of days later, as quickly as the sun did, it took a while to return. When you understand the human race is able to accomplish everything with such subtlety, so what do you expect to happen? That is my child, one of twelve children we now have when we're faced with almost insurmountable odds and how much time they have. " Are we real? " the children cried. " Are we fake?" they screamed.
& nbsp;
I hope we can't see this next time in the right light. As soon as we see the moon on the night sky again, we may never see it again. But if we do, I think we should believe in our hearts, we should embrace it, just in case.
I think even if the moon never sees us again, we should learn more about what it was like before our childhood years to be with her. Because it's not just her.<|endoftext|>
**********287**********
I don't remember much of the day, aside from the little candles, jaywalkers, and what appeared to be my headphones. I left my bed and I walked, sluggishly into my bed, staring at the far away clock from where I sat.
When I reached it, my eyes came back to me, full of what I had forgotten. They were the same shades of gray I had gazed upon when I was twelve. You could tell from their color that they're supposed to be a blessing, but to be honest, I couldn't understand.
I walked on, looking at the clock for a moment. Eight minutes into the past, the world seemed to be blank. Everything was once just a funny blur, in the same places you would imagine a cartoon character for to recount their knowledge of civilization, but these were not your daily observations. They were a look in the eyes. In the twinkling of the eyes, they communicated. The glass that I sought to contact wasn't shining brightly. It was yellow.
The thing about eyes is that you can never tell them apart, merely not until the time is up. When the world goes black, as the doctors are wont to describe, the only thing that can be clearly seen is you.
I stared at the dial dial, tracing my finger along it, wondering what it meant. Maybe it was the low-magnitude warning that the only thing to be expected was the constant ringing in my ears. Maybe it was the constant flashing and shifting light as it faded, rips apart my clothes, and light pops out in the cracks of my skin. Maybe it was the crappy water still in the tank next to my kitchen, so that I would have to endure the endless series of waves and bumps as my tongue stubbed out of my mouth.
But eventually it came. I climbed out of my bedroom to get to work, and when I started to climb back to the window of my house, I saw the outlines of a star in the distance that seemed to come from thousands of miles away. I stared and waited. Hours were hours. Years were years, and one by one the numbers disappeared.
The stars appeared slowly in the distance. Hundreds upon thousands of light-years in the blink of an eye. The dots stopped blinking as they continued on. One by one, the numbers began to fade. In just under a second it had faded into obscurity, and on the eighth step, I stood at the edge of the last planet, still nowhere to be found.
I turned and ran for the door. I ducked under the covers, closed my eyes, and listened for what felt like minutes to come. Then the noise came to me. It was small, beeping, and echoed through my apartment.
It was the sound of pounding footsteps, loud enough to make out the scrabbling of grime from my kitchen floor. I jolted awake, not sure what the hell was happening. Maybe I was tripping. I tried to slide over to the table to search for food, but the dinner bar I sat at appeared there as well.
My headache grew worse as the grueling pounding had continued on, louder now. I started to panic, and scream. I ran, and tripped.<|endoftext|>

God, he looks amazing. So damn amazing that some people don't even want to admit it. The whole picture. Honestly, he is a weirdo, and for a long time he was just more like us. Or more like us. Or as similar. He got the concept of'color' too from his Greek one-way trip to Rome. A few years back he visited here with a bunch of people - and there was none of that. Now everyone here sees what he has. Even our ancestors, who didn't see it to begin with. A fastidious in their expression of how they imagined themselves. He has no concept of beauty. Just make eye contact. It's not without cost. But he is a different fish with a different purpose. We all know what that means. It means nothing to him.
I thought of leaving. I've called him the most depressed man in the whole world, because he is cruel. I thought of walking away in a blazing blaze and knowing it would all melt away on all sides. He can't live through another day. I have no desire to. I'm not even going to bother writing about him.<|endoftext|>
**********289**********
The door slid open. Almost immediately the men in uniform came to watch the unsuspecting armored bits pop out of the street behind them. The'Mech took an hour and a half to properly penetrate the suit's depths. It was old and filthy and disheveled. It had too many fluids and would have taken much more damage had it not been for the motor that was so hard to turn up.
Soldiers on their way in were hardly combattrained. At least, that's what they think. At first glance it looked like a'tomorrow' shape, something that seemed like a pinecone. But then an escape pod popped out and charged into view.
The rest of the man-battles, all the parents and more bent down to pick up the unfortunate boys. Most had assumed that the heavy mass would be an act of fortitude towards the advancing enemy, and that the driver of the Matilda would mount a fortitude that was usually just some pretty amateur big duffel trucker getting jack shit paid off.
There was one Sergeant. They called him O'Day, or O-Day of Tanks. He'd heard that tank in the documentary, the one mounted on M1 Abrams and the one over that in Iron Five. But how, he wondered, was he protecting a person? The thought crossed O'Day's mind. Of course he'd be there when the remaining tanks began to swarm the enemy. Then he'd find out more about the matilda. It wasn't likely it'd get back up and fight a cannon fodder mission.
Yet what else could he do? Of course, if the lost tank didn't get back up he'd have to come and set up a defensible position. As long as that wasn't happened, he could do his job. If it wouldn't happen he could beat the Panzer in driving up a perimeter barrier between himself and the recon troops. Or he could come out in a coupla and draw support and destroy the thing. Who knows.
There was another. None of the survivors were even that close. They were getting manhandled by the heavies while under the Matilda's turret. O'Day was already over the patch of metal he'd been forced to cover. He had to take a helmet off to a certain depth. The solider wore his old one as well, but there was little protection against the extended f-4 Abrams and side mounted projectile launchers that typically stood around 150 yards and 300 yards apart. He had no way to defend himself against the meaty bastard with a tank attached to his platoon right next to him.
They hadn't even gotten off to cover the'Mech so they had no option. A horrible pain emerged in his side, and then there was a gasp. They were getting up. O'Day, in all his armor and experience with the weapon, had always assumed he would fall quickly. That they would soon be wiped out. But there was something else that had always fascinated him. Something that kept him going when he was a young child, and would push him forward in the past when he was finally a man.

**********290**********
The first incident had happened one afternoon. It started off fairly innocuous. My mom had was sipping her coffee when it started raining. I was playing in the park, and saw a bus heading in at nearly 100mph. I decided to smash open the bus window. I grabbed at the steering wheel and flipped the bus over onto its side. I thought about what I was going to do, I had to do something, so I just kept driving. There was a lot of yelling and yelling, but it was easy enough to stop. All I needed to do was let the bus stop and I would be off.
That was all it took. I woke up the next morning on my bus seat. I opened the door and made my way inside. Oh God. My mom was missing her left arm and all of her movements. I tried to get up, but it was too late. No matter what I did it was too late. I could see she was being pushed over, and I knew there was something wrong with her. How could she still have left her arm in the back seat? I couldn't see clearly, but I knew I had to do something. I flung myself against the back of the bus and yelled at the driver. " BUM BUM. "
The driver smacked my back over the seat. I tried to scream, but my lungs were all stung. I tried to scream back, but my mouth was numb. I tried to let out a cry, but my hand was locked on the steering wheel. I could hear him screaming, so I tried to get away. However my lungs were still locked on the bus seat. " PLEASE! "
He came right out of the back of the bus and held a bottle up to me.
I looked at the bottle and instantly froze. I had started a fire so I could have survived.
Just as he pulled the bottle out I heard screaming behind me.
" SOMEONE HELP! "
My heart was racing, I really needed to get out of here. I ran towards the backseat. I could smell food and screaming behind me. My arms were beating frantically, slowly, but it was far too late. I ducked into the back of the bus and saw them sprinting around. They didn't hurt anybody but because they were a bit chubby and skinny were they in a situation where they should be eaten alive.
I put down the bottle and began to run towards them. I didn't care. These were my last words before being ripped to shreds. I only did what I could to please my one enemy. I just wanted someone to see me because...
I am sorry for what I did, I knew I loved her, but I just couldn't do it.
I don't understand. Everything I did must have hit her. She left for her job too, and I couldn't even bring her to see the doctor to make sure she could move on. There was never a chance of her ever seeing me again.<|endoftext|>
**********291**********
I was brought into the room by the man behind the counter.
"Mr Johnson, how are you today? " I asked nervously.
The man handed me a manila folder and began to read.
" Mrs Washnick, as you know, my mother has passed. Her death was upon a tender young gentleman on March 3rd, 3147, by unknown assailants when her attentions were at an alarming size. His name was Samuel Spriggs and his family were privy to the contents of his father's private journal. His cause of death is listed in your son's next of kin report. "
I could still hear his soothing voice in the thick manila coveralls, but without realizing it.
" Your reports conclude that I have lung cancer. Your physician diagnosed your disease by a standard of chemo and a skin machine with biopsy results. You currently are in agony. "
I was shaking, so quickly I thought my body might explode as I witnessed the worst I'd ever experience in my life. I also expected my mind to explode from the unimaginable.
" Your father survived his cancer. I have spent the past several weeks preparing for the operation to transfer you from your mother to be placed back into the family. Your hospital will not be the same as your old hospital. The operation is going to be catastrophic. "
I couldn't figure out why I was this way. Why would a person whose lymphoma was so prominently displayed on his face every night think that he would die. I didn't want to die. I couldn't even find the answer.
*Hopefully* he wouldn't have brought a screwdriver or some other small tool for his stump or tried to pull it off himself.
" As you know, I have recently lost my memory as my vision has seen no real changes. In a fit of anger I stole your photograph and left it in the car. Upon opening the drive-in doors there was no one waiting for you. I hit the disabled driver who was exiting and drove home in his old style Dodge Genesis. A man in hazmat gear entered the car and started driving away. As the fog cleared I went to the truck stop only to see a homeless man with a basket full of money. He waved and reached for the phone. My phone was the only one he had ever used before. His hand went through the stack of bills. They must have been stacked on top of each other like a large car.
" Remember Samuel?" I whispered, feeling around in my pocket for a portable phone charger. That's when I realized the phone was probably on the floor because the man didn't want to talk to me. The guilt was crushing even more. After me reaching for the phone I could only stand back a few feet from him and drop the phone. He was full of hatred, as if the vision of someone with his own mouth behind him now literally meant he couldn't keep his job.
His finger reached out to reach into my pocket and said yes. I could only scream.
He turned around to see me, like I'd just heard the Christmas message, staring straight at his shitty looking face. But it never came. There was no trace of his other hand moving.
I guess it was fate that left me. Maybe destiny gave him my image, but fate just made sure it never came back.
For a brief moment the memory flashed back to me. I played with my fingers to make sure there wasn't any place to put my fingers. A whole day. I thanked God, and the woman in the crowd replied.<|endoftext|>
**********292**********
A boy emerged from the wood and cradled his frightened wife.
"Cuz we know she will be with us for the night, " he said, the voice raising to a crescendo of tears.
He grabbed the girl, pulled her down to the wooden floor with the women's arms draped over her bed.
" Daddy, I know you will be fine, " said the girl.
" Daddy, I know you can be with us, " he said, pushing her closer. " I can be with you. Daddy. "
" Daddy, " he whispered with tears, " you're the best I've ever known. Daddy, you love me, " he repeated, lifting the daughters shoulders up.
" Daddy, I've waited long, but you see your little heart getting heavier and heavier, " said the girl's eyes with fright, " daddy, I've tried to be, for you, " he whispered into her ear. " Come on, sweetheart, let's go. "
His wife sat down with more emotion than she could fathom. " Daddy, Mommy and Daddy, you've made a great difference in me, and your smile always looks so sad. Daddy, please come back. "
" Mommy, I know you are sad. " He sobbed, shaking his wife. " Mommy, I know. "
" Daddy, Daddy, stop crying. " She took a step back, arms and legs shaking, in extreme pain.
" Daddy, give me the strength you need to keep me here for the night."<|endoftext|>

Things happened so fast they could scarcely be stopped. A black rock crashed above the castle. A cliffside, too steep for the prince to keep it in. A waterfall exploded. Gunpowder began to fill the air. Mephala rolled down the cliff, limping forward.
"Are you alright? "
" Tyka wasn't very strong. Gosh I have to do it. "
" The pieces are going in nicely. Why don't you step up for a swim? "
The princess looked up at him.
" He's going to hurt me, that much is certain. "
" But I do things for you, not to rob you or trick you, you've changed me to be a slayer. A coward. "
" I'm a slayer too. "
" My mind is out, I'm going to die, and I need to do it myself. "
The princess passed her eyes to him.
" How about we just leave the castle, go back to my castle where I saved our princess. "
" It's not that easy to trust someone out there. "
" That's it, he would be my step-in-charge, he'd see how well we've done. "
" I know. "
" And what was your plan? "
" I'll never be allowed into my castle! "
" Won't do. "
" You told me you never defeated me. "
" Your plan is going to fail, will not succeed. "
" Well then what should I do? I've changed... things. "
" What? You changed something? "
" What. "
" That sucks. "
" As much as you said about me being an ogre, how about this... this is how they're going to attack. "
" He's intelligent, a coward, he can fly... "
" What? He'll be unstoppable. "
" The Princess won't go back into our castle. Just go in the dark forest and slay me. "
" Even if it is the closest thing, he doesn't dare to do it. You get to play. "
The Princess knew his plan was very successful, and she tried to hide away. Tears fell from her eyes.
" I've taken things from you. "
" That doesn't mean I am still a slayer. "
" I've killed so much. And they'll have come for you before I can save them. "
" They are going to catch you soon, I'll let them do it. "
The Princess placed a hand on her face.
" Go back to your castle. "
" I'm not really going back to my castle. "
" You... but you can't go back. I don't have time for that. "
The Hero walked past her. She looked back to the princess, then back to Tyka. She stood there, silent.<|endoftext|>

The monster crawls back.
It never rears back once it's built.
Once it's built, then it always crawls back back.
Even on nights my knees feel clammy.
Every night I can't feel my legs. I can't lift them out of bed.
I can't see the monster but I can feel the wind flow through my hair. The trees are tall and they all seem to have been for awhile.
But I can't remember how long I've been sitting on the couch. Maybe some nights I have a dream I hadn't like.
Sometimes when the monster crawls it can't find me. I can't really tell how often it does, it just sweeps its head. Sometimes it seems to come back but more often, the monster doesn't eat me.
Sometimes, I wish I was the one running around the house.
My knees and face feel burning.
My neck feels burning.
The screaming in the bushes goes too fast and soon I hear *wh** what went wrong. There is a black, hot demon and it seems to be waiting in the shadows of my bedroom.
I try not to let the red, blood-curdling breath out. I close my eyes and close them, never letting out the breath.
I don't know when it came for me. I don't know where it came from.
Every night it would sneak up on me. First it ate me but then it hurt me so much that I broke my nose on the piece of cat I was holding on to.
It's been a long time.
Tonight it just pees.
I won't let it keep me in pain anymore. I'm very, very tired.
I look over to my candle and I let out a soft hum. I have to go now or it will torture me a long time. I push my hands down to my pillows as I knock one.
I step on the candle and scratch my skin. The smell is the same. The smell that has hit me the past couple of weeks. I sigh.
I step down from the candle and look at my handiwork.
It's silver.
I change into a new looking suit but I keep it for now.
I love the new suit. It hasn't aged. The old one must be dust, but I can't leave it.
I walk out onto the street. I walk to the house I'm sleeping in and climb up the steps to the bed and pull the blanket over me.
I forget what I'm doing. I forget who it is. I forget where it is from.
I wake up, put the door open and look around in pain and I see a large gaping hole.
I reach up and place a hand on the crack in the wall.
"Peter....Who are you! "
I raise my hand and the hole cuts open. I kneel on the ground and turn around.
The angel sitting on my bed is crouching down.
" *Who are you? *"
I glare at him, fear in his eyes.
He stares at me in a way I've never seen from him.
I need to lie down.
I close my eyes and lay my face against the wall.
I suck in air as I wait for him to give me a huge long stare.
I close my eyes and wait.
I wait until he looks up and I look back.
All I can see is the demon staring at me.<|endoftext|>

"*What is this'pimp boss' chant? * "
The booming voice of the chimneys speaker crackled with the output of many speakers around the maze-like building.
*Still, still, still. *
By far the world was still unaware what was going on, especially compared to what suddenly arose. In sync with whatever was happening around him. At the same time, there was a sense of fatigue in his immediate vicinity. All of the attendant computers had sent out alerts. Any alert, any error, any way to remind the hard-working computer that what was happening was gone and was being tracked. Panic overtook him. He couldn't keep a straight face.
Despite the extreme, unexpected gravity of the situation, the two men continued to rock.
" *What's happening, you little punk? * "
They weren't hiding. They weren't buying it. They needed to know how much of a human sacrifice was necessary. They were both mentally exhausted and severely overworked by whatever was happening around them. Despite the consequences of his actions, they would continue. They needed to sing along for the ride.
" *Well, if I only knew... *
" *No! No. That could get nasty! * "
Their perseverance did little to dispel the frustrations of the financial world as they stormed and destroyed every single merchant who needed to pick up a piece of the goods shipped between their two towns. Right in front of them, at the very least, they still had a chance.
All they needed to do was become the instrument of their destruction.
" *Time of your life, now*
" *Now. Now, and forever, and every single other time... *
" *Ahh, nice one*"<|endoftext|>

Nothing today. Nothing but those pesky kids down at the liquor store. No one was home today, they shouldn't be. The kitchen was the same, except it didn't ever used to be. They stopped running once they got up and moved. They stopped stowing their stuff, they should be looking for it. But they didn't. They'll never get it.
Walking into the deserted motel they've known the last few hours of their lives as before they got in, the glance of confusion saying "Was that a gun? " The same puzzled look in their faces though, they were... alone. So they knew. Someone had to be found. People had to know, they couldn't be.
First thing everyone is familiar with is the memorial service for the first time, a big great one, then the ashtray full of canines to soak in. Eventually I managed to knock them aside, they started laughing, they didn't need it, they're already dead. But when everyone understood what happened, I know exactly what I did.
They were screaming for him to come down. They'd already seen him come down. We'd seen him. When he was around 3 feet, he had hair in a pony tail and good skin. He was on the ground, staring at the sky. He opened his mouth, his mouth, his mouth, before pushing himself over. Some man came back down, looking pretty, his nose was silver. They see her right after, they think she's working at this gas station. But she won't talk, she won't leave.
They start panicking, they'd been chasing him for what must have been a long time, losing track of his size, his license, his family, his friends. Each time they point and point, he pulls a gun and the sound of the gunshot echo throughout the apartment. A bullet was heard, a woman whimpering in pain. It made people stop, but not for long. They run the window and watch the bodies begin to fall.
The couple in the back sat on their cell next to one another, then they realized they were dead. The driver was still alive. They thought it would be better for them to die alone, however he's been better. A man walked past his hospital bed, he held his hand out. It's my brother, I was a little surprised he still has his hand.
" Are you sure this is what you were doing? You always told me to stop ", asked the man from the back of the group.
" Of course, I did ", replied the other man holding a gun. He was holding the gun, it was white, it was bigger than any of us.
" Calm down man, I already know that it is something you did for some reason ", said the driver, clearly upset about his mangled body.
" Then the guy handed the gun to me" replied the man in the back, this would be the final straw for them. We both knew what was coming next. We were drunk and hurt by his stupid accent. And we knew what he was doing. But we each knew we were responsible.<|endoftext|>

I stand here, walking with my tools in hand, grasping my original tools as they burn in the harsh sun. They seem to be outdated; half forgotten, and the job I have had for so long now just paid more, treating me as a slave of the craft. I never made a face, never made a living as my own personal army, but I remember now that I was damn close. I stared up at the horizon, my watch glowing black as it rolled slow against the breeze of the night.
The fight is over. Many of the humans on the other side feel the same. Many of them die, but not of anything, not even thirst.
I am looking ahead. The Sol system has ceased to exist, only 2 more dying civilizations remain in the habitable zones of the empire. It is just another minute away.<|endoftext|>

When Kormath came into the hallway his panic stricken expression shocked his younger brother. It was quite the nightmare. His brother had to put two and two together to break the sound barrier. His rifle was long and cumbersome, and his knees just could not keep his hands at their normal level. He struggled, kicking and shouting ineffectually. Through the resulting dizziness his brother realized why he was so scared of him.
"Neeeeaaahhhhh! Miiiiiiindhhh! "
Kormath, struggling to get his hands off of the grenade was all to silent. His brothers body was throbbing, even if they were able to remove their equipment they still didn't feel all right. He turned to his younger brother, " I need to tell you something, we might be bitten by a common cold right now. "
" Something bite. " His younger brother replied as he slowly grabbed his rifle by the holster. In his brother's despair Kormath grabbed another grenade, this time punching it into the ceiling with a massive rock. The mushroom cloud was too big, like a rock unto a camel, for kormath to completely separate the object from the onlookers.
It took 10 seconds for the door from the inside of the wall to open. He fled. As his hands trembled Kormath collapsed, surrounded by strangers in their panicked condition. He was finally able to come to terms with himself, like a parent crying on their child and his little brother asking why he is feline. And then it was back to the present. " Dad I need to be home " Kormath started, looking away. " I have to get back to school. " He thought to himself, " They will probably find me when they see me. And I will try to explain to them why I am leaving them. "
He found that he couldn't. There was too much blood, another body that wasn't slithering on the floor was too close. Closing his eyes Kormath closed his eyes once more, " How can I help you, I won't do it in this house. I can't kill you on my own. "
" We can kill her. " Kormath stated through a smoke filled window. " This house is abandoned and it will be very likely your parents were not around to take care of you. And I should be begging them not to kill me. "
He then leaned against the window, looking out over his dark woods. Looking up into the sky.
" My brother, please tell me what is wrong. " his little brother mused. " I have always wanted to be a girl. I believe that I can be a girl."

Okay. So I woke up on the morning of midnight in a typical fashion and spent quite a bit of my afternoon doing nothing. My eyes opened a bit, so I could fully process the situation. I mean, I don't usually do anything but then something odd happens. I turn off my phone and check my Reddit account. For some reason I find myself thinking about the good old days - what is reddit? I log onto reddit, re-read reddit for a few hours... Wait. Just before I did that, it gave me a look which... I blinked.. Oh. Oh fuck. Oh shit! Oh fuck.
"Would you like to check out this amazing video, prompt. " it's uploaded here and nothing happens after the fact. I look at it while I'm thinking. Uh, what's up now? Wait, no, look. I'm trying to answer a question and just suddenly this man wearing a suit goes into a trance. " ENOUGH PEOPLE! " he yells as he jumps down in a chain. " We are in the game, you don't do this to me, I promise you, I'll be back with a key "
" Will I work for you tonight? " the one on the left asks. " I have a job to do. " I notice a chest at the back. It's very important. " Yeah, that's me. He sends me out into the yard and as I'm driving towards his house, I see something like this. He carries a bomb in his hand, dripping water. I see this next message in the bag: " You aren't real, you are a hologram with no computer controls, fake and pathetic, bound in the wasteland of a great war." He then drops the bomb.
The reader noticed too, but I can't really blame him. First off, I heard the soldier who dropped it was a low level soldier, he probably was cuffed and interrogated. Secondly, I'm in the middle of my run through the rest of the level, there's no window, I was set up in the middle, what the hell would I say that to? Wait. What's the point of a wall if you can't see all the way in? Fuck.
So now I'm contemplating a plan. Unless the alien, it appears he's giving me instructions on how to become a hologram, I'll go get him and head into my respective co-workers' homes. Once I make it to his house, I'll fly over to the door as the one on the left starts punching me in the face. I can't fucking believe what he was saying.
I don't even have one foot in the air. Wait, is he laughing? Not the bad kind of stupid. Hell, why should I be laughing? I throw his full weight into the air and boom, I'm back home!
I wake up. I lay down on the ground and see myself here. I can see in the mirror - I look as if I'm in a room completely un-bored. I grab one leg up, a ring around my waist, my eyes hit the knife in my hand, then look down at my finger, that finger is a god dam.
It's blood.
It's blood.<|endoftext|>

Oliver felt back the hot wind, its drier that night's sun, the curls that wispered over thin ribbons of curls. The waves urged him forward, over washed and torn and bleached, giving way to lakes of wet water to shed frothy tears of unkind rain. Up to this moment he swore he was them, a thing of beauty and grace, and all of it was a figment of his imagination, and so the seal of the salamander slipped.
'A thing which we have been so vainly desiring,
and yet so hard to convey,
yet are those now holding of'em?
The great draught, though its most empty,
is now palpable, though faded to memory.
I've been with them for many moons,
and I'm even wary of them now,
yet they found their way in,
and now I'm giddy with joy!
I've never been hungry before!
I'm honored to tell you all, though they all point to...
Alone! Over th' sands; for all to see!'
Old men's secrets and stories,
Silently scattered, utterly aside
from here on,
and the face of every inhabitant
from here on out.
'They don't know you yet!'
'Did not they?'
'Did they?
Is it true of a race of creatures,
And creatures under more wits' iron?
Who knew they could weep for all those days?
Who knew they could die until they burned the homes of my kind!'
'Yet they hope to live the rest,
I hold more hope than ye!
Better to keep it not to myself!'
'I don't hope they will live for that good,'
'Is there no hope there to be?'
'No hope there at all.'
'Those whose spirits never seek need,
who are tethered in place,
are such failures we see like rats.
Whatever they are, they don't deserve any good.'
An uneasy peace, they chirp ever so loud,
and it was such a peaceful, sweet peace,
but for a timespan of six months,
peasants found no food
nor sun, for the wars erupted,
each rising so high, so high,
all had to die with one steel eye.
Now that these creatures were ethereal in their minds,'
They vanish, and disperse, never to be seen again,
a black fog for the ocean,
a mountain sun for the rivers,
a gloomy day for the birds,
but for our gods, our guide and pioneer,
the gods of our art,
who are up above us, and left for our own good,
and souls whom we can entwine!
We are worthless above, and so we are lost!
Can we trust no Gods' voices?
The baited breath of the fish, the mate's song,
and the ethereals,
and the other seals!
And I see now that they forgot those fears.<|endoftext|>

It was as impossible as it looked. The host was massive. Can you even begin to imagine how this beast would look like compared to anything else we had ever seen? At first it seemed as if the beast had dropped to the ground. Huge, brutish teeth, with grasping mandibles. Only a few of it's lacerations served to hide its small, nimble frame. The mandibles were hardly visible, though the design seemed to be linked to the flesh inside the organism. These'lacerations' were still present around the structure when the beast had laid down.
This was not the case, of course. One could tell that, when the host decided to wake up it's prey before deliriousness wore off. The creature had not retreated. It had remained motionless as the host watched the corpse scramble to regain flight. The host could see the stench of decaying vegetation everywhere, the countless brown-and-brown leaves moving through the gnarled soil. The host had already begun its wake up process, but to its dismay, the animal managed to dart off. The host had no choice but to daze away in terror. At the most recent moment, after the zombie had died and not a trace of the beast left that was not eaten was left, the stench subsided and it started to rest, as it had so many times before. The host could not even hope to remain awake all day. It was prepared to wake up that night. But the host dared not wake, not in defiance of some other creature and would have to start over.
What awaited it was as unbelievable as its horror. Like any great beast, with its mandibles as thick as rings, it was huge, with four slit jaws and even black tendrils stretched along its back. It pushed itself with force, lifting the jaws towards it's face, the creature's squirming maw turning into a blur of mist. It walked briskly, its two eyes as bloodshot as the glory of birth. The mandibles were digging deeper into the victim's face, probing for cracks and scrapes from its sharp teeth, while the spines were dug into the flesh. It moved its round body closer and closer to the mouth, probing just a little further still. There was only one thing that could discern a difference between it and its prey.
Eventually, the creature fell to the ground, dying instantly. In an instant, it slipped from the creature's gaping maw, which had opened up only an inch further. Its body had enveloped the host. The host was barely alive. Where the bite had been, it was lying in the dirt. Its body lay weak and old with what remained of its jaw muscles and now its eyes. As the creature's body fell to the ground, many questions still remained unanswered.
"What happens if I eat another species?"<|endoftext|>

Randall felt a burning pain in his hand. He looked to his right, the vast expanse of dirt and grime, pure as brick in comparison to the blazing sea.
He was followed by Alexei Kalashnikov, his comrade lying in his elbow, his slandered, teeth smeared on his armor. They couldn't see the hot metal beneath his hood, the field of battle two meters away from them.
Their position was a relic of a days old conflict, in the middle of New York City, over a dead body, a proud old man. Karim, his comrade, was holding a viewport of him. Their stares had haunted him, flooded his past. It haunted him now.
So they sat, and left.
Kolashnikov looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
The Azov stared at him with a haunted look, dark and angry eyes. Kolashnikov and Alexei threw themselves at a group of peasants holding torches. One man, young and like his father, was smoking half-smoked himself, and moving his waist with the other eyes. The other one, a stout and pale man, stood idly by, bony shoulders bowed with hunger. And Karim, staring at him, spoke.
"Fraid to fight men of pure cold, to fight men of righteous or dead, don't fight men of the enlightened, if life is... " he paused, his voice thick with cold.
The Azov gulped for a moment, and was cut off. " We have offended the little ones, everyone in the vast expanse who fails to see us. If you want freedom, then let us not govern, we shall fight, or we shall die!
" If you don't, then don't stay here, let us be! "
" Do not go, sleep in fear, " Karim spoke, his voice thick with fear.
Kolashnikov looked at his eye, and he saw nothing. It was in the distance, close enough that it was still visible, pale blue.
They lay frozen in the unforgiving mud. Gulping, they clung to his sides, his heavy helmet against their flesh. Now, the people didn't understand the little raincoat, but it was their duty, their protection. If they weren't his protection, it would have been for his safety. If they didn't protect him, he could live in hell.
" Perhaps we should die, " Kalashnikov said. The rain stopped, silent for a while. They could hear each other, they could taste them.
They could hear the city, as they witnessed some who hadn't paid attention and one who had, raised their hands. Their orange sky shone through the eyes of a great man with a black cloak over his belly. The man, Hilary Flint, was yelling something at his comrades. A gun whizzed past their heads and out of their control.
On the road back to their basement, another young boy, whose name was Tim, shouted something at them as Samuels scrambled up the steps.
Kolashnikov looked on, followed by the tank and the two men who had brought Kalashnikov. Bullets were coming, but they were better than the bullets Samuels had. Kalashnikov knew that he was safe in his bunker, like his father's dying mother. But he didn't wish to die.
" How are we supposed to be protected by the sun in the twenty-first century, " Kalashnikov asked Samuels.
" In the thirty first, " he said, his voice thick with contempt.
" Was not, Mr. Miyagi. "
" Yes. "
The boy chuckled at the information, leaned over towards Kalashnikov, who walked past him, and made eye contact. Kolashnikov grinned a sinister smile.<|endoftext|>

The hum of the steam engine tumbled across the empty room. It's faucet rattled and sputtered with the nervous anticipation of the customer that sat at the coffee table. He looked up, his eyes glazed over.
"I'm on fire. I have to order, please. "
The man strode over, hands on his hips. He hated burning, but moving over with him hurt more than the inconvenience. He turned to face his customer, several dozen yards off, so that his arms and shoulders might carry him in the heat.
" Alright, Mr. Palmer, I'm on the line. First, give me an order. Please order. "
* " Alright, you'll be in, sorry. I just have one more." *
The instant he said that, a smile made the part of his face smile wider. The flat of his jaw thumped against the table next to the steam cup.
As he walked up to the counter, the fire rumbled underneath his feet.<|endoftext|>

One villain, one villain,
And one hero must stop.
On six pockets of silver armor,
Baron Manning laid tied to the ground.
But the Hero had his doubts.
His cries had been heard throughout the nation
Of the silver prisoner in armageddon
Which would free the innocent from their restraints.
For ten shadows before he proclaimed his win,
When the Silver Dart wiped the man away,
It was yet clear his foe lay unmolested.
The Silver Dart had stood before him for one revolution
And while the King loved their lost,
The King was bearing another grim fate.
The man dropped to his knees in humble resignation
And with a nod of approval, swore to rise again.
The Hero's eyes, the Riders along the way
Did yet see through his mask's harsh exterior.
Stumbling onward on his warrior's hilts
He shouted into his blackened visor
"I don't hate thee, there is something I must do."
At that he jumped forward and shot the flanks.
The Silver Dart was back on the ground,
Smashing his thick book into the neighboring man.
As it happened, the man staggered to a halt,
When suddenly thrown over the head of the dragon that ate him.
Cradling upon the dented porch,
The Hero dropped to his knees and prayed.
A greater hero than his hero's death could not see
His form, intact and orderly, is wreaked upon the world
So he began to pray anew.
For ten feet before the Hero fell from the heavens,
A plume of silver, black as coal
Flat in his armor could not withstand the furious ire.
All hail the hero!<|endoftext|>

Well, whatever.
Now there's only one way to end this nightmare.
Since I knew that I couldn't date Tom right then, I decided to see how I could end it.
And I figured it would be the perfect opportunity.
That was days ago, whenever I went to visit Tom, I received a knock at my door.
"WHAT? " I opened the door and saw a wolf, dressed in faded jeans and a pair of dark green cowboy boots
standing on top of a giant stone structure.
" Come in! "
When I opened my eyes, I was surprised to find one of my kind standing there, not looking at me.
" Uh... oh you go in? "
He didn't look at me but instead stood there, presumably waiting.
" The hell you live in!"
I could only nod silently, trying to hide what I felt I had to do.
Still, my heart went out to Tom. A strong women with this pampered and fearful mind.<|endoftext|>

*Crack, rustling, fire is all that I see in this dark cave. The ground is twisted beneath my feet and my eyes roll as if trying to comprehend the shifting ruins of a city. *
I dig a bit deeper and I find my shivering body cold but it doesn't matter. I've just dug this thing deep in the layer of junk metal and it is weak and fragile. I want to end it but... I want to live and there is no life left in this world. *
I look down on what once was my village, my people. The great city of Debrecht and its surrounding layer of darkness what was once my people. The first time I visited I was sick, no I couldn't move, and I had to sit in this cave all day. But that was before I began using my young body to avoid injury, many bodies died before I even left.
*Climps....Thunks. Bones? Sometimes cemeteries of these bones belong to a great family. The mother and sister were of the highest order. She carried this hoard so that the children could have strength that they would never have. *
My hands touch the rock, it's wind blowing through my broken bones. I see them, buried figures with varying degrees of shape and sizes, yet all they do is stare.
*Men, women... ~~ "I am the KING!!!! " *
I speak out. " Kings are dead. and no matter how much you try to save them, you can not. You are strong and your will can not be challenged by even the lowly mouse. I have come to reunite you. I have been in this cave and there is no hope."
The cry echoes in this cave for days now and I start to feel myself collapse, but it takes hold of me until I finally want to let go.<|endoftext|>

One last meeting of desperation I finally managed to convince her. Well, sure, she never gave my friends and neighbors peckish little names but after last time we tried, we got sick of having to watch her through an elaborate mirror. She walked through a grey door to our small, empty flat. I always hated quiet conversations. Never a moment goes by where everyone just makes excuses for the shit they did, which is so sad, which is why when I ask her where I live she tells me that she's living her life in a rented flat. She doesn't want to hear it. She's here for a reason I won't go to jail for.
She was never supposed to be here to see her child. Took her days. To make sure her children are safe and fit and healthy. She woke me from my endless slumber when she told me that the police were chasing her. She told me that she knew what was going to happen and that the police were coming if she left. She had lied to me on every single one of her lies and pushed them off of me at every opportunity. She was an idiot. For her. And now she's hiding in my room so I can't find her. She told me that I loved her and wanted to fight for her whenever I wanted to. She told me that she felt sorry for me because I always looked her in the eyes the most. She told me that she hated me, that she always felt so bad for her. This can't be happening. I can't do this.
I think that is the reason I decided to leave this house in the first place. She knew this was the right thing to do. She needed to see my face and not let me see her smile. She needed me to shut up. I can't do that. It's not something I can say. I just have to do it now. She tells me that it won't happen. I just need to hold on and try it. I go to see my son and he says it's fine, that it's all good. I can do this.
I keep waiting. Years later the broken door finally comes open and my son bursts through the front door. I take off my glasses and giggle as I try to catch the perfect smile I ever needed. He takes her hand in mine and we tear our eyes away from him and the room.
"Look at my face... " she says as she hugs me.
I shoot her a quick kiss, promising not to reciprocate. She can't hear me. Only see what's in front of me.
" You're angry man, " I say.
" No, " she stammers, holding me by the waist. " It's fine. I'm not angry about anything. I just know that it's been going on for a long, long time. I've seen the consequences."
I accept her hand. She gently holds me and says a final farewell as we walk inside.<|endoftext|>

Rick stirred violently as he pulled on the blinds. He stretched on the shelf that held a wooden bowl, hoping that he could catch himself. And as the world around him, an unmoving whiteness slowly crept into the room. The space with no words was clear, nothing but unidentifiable through the sea of blinking lights. He was trapped, in a room with nothing but a mattress, a mirror, and a bowl... His mind raced to think of any way out. With his feet off the desk, he stumbled onto the knob.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a card. A student's card. He slid the card across the desk, letting his thoughts run wild. A quick sketch of the card that he had held onto as a precaution, and after awhile he tossed it into a back room.
He found himself in an empty room, a white cube with a strap like a thigh. The ground that surrounded him was littered with bottles and bottles. This room also had no windows.
*De La Rue, * he thought, as he looked through the crowd of people frantically wandering the hallway.
Rick stepped out and slammed his face into the wall. In his small, shapeless brain, he thought about the boy. His name was Danni. His girlfriend, Stella. Their family.
He thought of selling the balloons he had found last night. The little living room. The pictures that they had seen of Danni in the show. When he had picked Stella up, Stella had laughed and told him that he never stopped smiling. Danni made the move she did.
*Dammit, oh Dammit. * He thought. He put all his energy into the ridiculous ideas. He put the stupid idea in the cube.
He did not know why he could not come back with her. He was alone in a room, chained to a chair with nothing but the sofa he had found on the floor. The kettle placed on the stove, and he walked over to the darkness, in a corner of the room. He smelled the wood. A dumpster. The smell of burning metal. He turned to the kettle, lit up the flame, and set the flame down.
*Un. * He started to notice his joints growing stiffer. His eyes the color of a vegetable. He noticed the bandages covering his left arm. His right arm was missing. His neck. The label said... "LOUIS. "
*That hurt. * He checked the fridge. He flicked through the little cupboards, and his chest painters, and he vomited. He remembered the backpack from last night. It had a knife in it. He remembered getting in there and stabbing it. He remembered putting that stupid plan into action, and turning around and going home.
He heard his front door opening.
This room had no windows.
He was suddenly aware of the guns drawn. He turned around to hear what was coming.
It was a small room at the end of the hallway. Light crackled through the windows.
*Ello de Verdun, * it said, pointing to another blank sheet of paper. He flipped the sheet over. A small girl. A very nice girl.
He picked up the tag from the girl's room. " Ms. Sinclair. Diane. "
He put the new paper back into the back of the back room. For a moment, in shock, he shrugged. Now he was alone.
" Could you stop, " she asked. " I know this isn't your kind of bed, and I don't think you would even be able to find one. "
" I know -- how are you able to get through three... "
*Of the three, thirty fifteen, dildos and trinkets would cost the Ritz. $ 1000 and $ 1000 was much, much more. *
He stood back up, at the thought of not having any of this figured out. He raised his hands, and the girl left. He turned to go home.
The house was silent outside. A winter-cloudless night.
He awoke in his bed as the door bell broke.<|endoftext|>

It would seem as though out there are powerful wizards at work, and then another group is for the better.
And these all seem like a big deal. Something that's been constant and unchanging for a few thousand years was suddenly brought down onto the entire world, the wider world. It was quite scary and frightening, but it seemed to bring a small portion of the good to the rest of us.
I've been working for Mr. Smith, a veteran of countless curses and spell texts, wizard expert. I'm a good wizard, so you see right through that whole system. Basically the whole theory, I guess. Since I was working with older workers at the Ministry, I have a certain dimention that the minions always counter with curses. So every year my sense picks up my sense picks up.
I know, right?
Well, yeah. A group of infernos from my world managed to try and replicate our spell during a tri-tension spell fracas. I was working alone for a few hours with a bunch of my books, but they worked. Our spells were guaranteed to work.
Naturally, when the minions realised it, they took the initiative to strike and reduce the area around us to rubble for safety. The broad vaults, then.
See? The bard. I remembered my duty pretty well. I aimed all of our curses at him. Some of his screams resonated with the chaos around us, ricocheting off of the hardened stone walls we tried to block. Apparently my fear was unfounded. He put the curses in one of those books and stabbed me twice with his sword.
Yup. Now I think of this often. The fighting in areas with no order to work. The bard had a mouth full of rats. I imagine the war wasn't finished there either, however. So when Mr. Smith showed up, I tried my hardest to try to convince him.
"No, aren't you afraid! "
He said some unexpected stuff.
" I'm not. "
" You're a wanderer, Harry Potter. You'll find some other items that use your spells. Spell, magic, orc eggs - it's all really useful stuff. "
" Do you? "
I tried my best to speak up.
" If not, then it's not important at all. "
He said a much-iterated " Th-Th-Th-Th". Now I'm not trying to scare my spell-hand down. I've always had one of these things in my hand.
I had one spell later. I cast it immediately. Now we all look at each other in the mirror. He looks back at me.
And it's really good. We all stare into each other.<|endoftext|>

Grandpa was a normal man, with a small family that shared him with his sister of another neighborhood. Those he met would sit at his dining table and watch over him, from afar their smiles rarely reached his own lips. In fact, one fateful evening he could see both of his parents looking at him the same way.
Their footsteps were oddly soft as they approached his lavish dining room. Grandma smiled at him. " That's beautiful, don't you think? ", she asked, reaching into the kitchen for the pastries she always had. Grandma reached into the fridge and grabbed a handful of milk. Grandma immediately scooped it up, choosing one that had either been pushed in out the door or slipped into the empty cupboard. Taking a bite his mouth was filled with hearty snickers and a mouth full of milk. He ate the filling and enjoyed each last bit of it before taking a sip. The rim of the glass filled his mouth and mouth full as he tasted the remainder of his favorite beverage, a piece of toast for which Grandma had already begun to like. Grandma returned his gaze to the dining room and beckoned the father to sit in the chair adjacent to him. He put in a determined voice, and motioned the old man to sit down beside him.
" Sit down, " Grandma whispered to the stillness of the seats around them. The old man took one last sip, and made his way into the back row. Grandma's gaze cast something down on him and she tried to twist his arms to hold him. The old man stiffened and fell to his knees as he did so. " Sit up, " he ordered, but the floor beneath him cried and its own cries soon drowned out the sounds of his knees collapsing to the pavement.
" Wha- what! Where is everyone? "
" Mom, Dad, and I. Your brother is with the military and you're married! Your grandmother's parents are best friends with you as well. Where are the other children? "
Grandma looked at her family, who were standing there frozen in disbelief. She would never have known if they were her daughter-in-law or something even her grandkids would have to deal with. After all, they barely even had a look of the impending disaster unfolding before them.
" You know I hate all these jokes, " Grandma's voice said to a still, irritated jaw.
The old man spoke, a hopeful tone in his voice.
" Remember old Pa, right? He was your father. Not your brother. Everyone he ever knew loves him. " The room was silent for a moment, but as the sound of the laughter from those inside would often stir in the room the music became louder. The children beside the old man, head down, as if hearing the screams of the distant relatives.
A sudden realization filled Grandma's head. She took a step back, but he kept the strength in his voice. " And now I will still feel the pain of losing my mother, but I will stand with you."<|endoftext|>

“ Kid, you ’ re killing me ” another woman in the case yelled. I licked my lips and screamed. I wanted to see his face, to see his despair, the hate, the pain. It couldn ’ t be right. I was just a normal person. A normal girl.
“ No, please… ” she screamed, sliding the piece of paper off the side of the table. I stood in front of her and stared at her for a moment. I know right? She just stood there, dumbfounded. I saw tears and sobs come down her face. Not from a man or a woman, but from a handful of bodies lying around the room.
“ Do you want me to kill you? ” I asked her.
She just looked back with sad eyes. “ No. ” She said, a disappointed tone in her voice. She then collapsed onto the floor and started crying.
I had said what I saw on the TV that day was much worse than what I was about to hear. It would kill a man. I had told her the past year had been one hell of a life, but it wasn ’ t what I was about to do. I was going to kill people.
As I thought about it, I didn ’ t feel anything after the night of the police brutality and murder. That night I had given myself my revenge. You know that? I hadn ’ t, but I didn ’ t feel anything like it.
In all honesty, I didn ’ t feel a thing.
Nobody wants the worst case scenario you get. You just need to do it right. I even gave myself one million dollars and a bloody coma.<|endoftext|>

I go to bed. The nights with a huge pool and hang-drag around the coffee table.
I wake up and brush my teeth. An old man with a beard, eyes welled and his cheeks pulled back. He is asleep.
I get up from bed and brush my teeth. The day has started.
Four o'clock in the morning. My parents are up. The clock is ticking.
I find a pack of bacon and eggs on the kitchen counter. It is cold enough for me to sleep.
I flip the covers over, look around the house and force myself to feel comfortable in. I have work in three hours.
I move the car and drive to the supermarket.
There is a basket full of groceries.
I have nothing but bread and milk in my pantry.
I leave for work the next day. I start at my favorite restaurant. I can't seem to find the right starter.
I go back to my watch. I look around at my palm.
Five o'clock.
I like today's job. I pick up the letter opener on the desk.
Two-thirds of my allowance goes toward food.
I go to bed.
Night time. Morning to 10. I wait.
No food, no groceries. I eat my money and take out a new set of clothes. The new ones are white. It fits perfectly.
The sweater is heavier than ever. I put on my jacket, grab the keys on my workbench and lay out my schedule for work.
The employee voice enters my phone.
Business related phone calls.
Four-thirty to eight. Breakfast finally ready. Nothing to do today, I figure.
I walk to my closet and open it. I am standing alone. Everything is just as beautiful as before. The carpet is warm and it feels as if the world has moved away from it.
The rug is smooth and warm. The arms are wrapped around me, and I can just lean over and touch them. Everything is just as elegant and cosy as before.
I walk out the door and the lights come on in the neighborhood. The stores are still open, with every store, their doors open, shut behind them. Cars are full of people. And people.
My name is Sharon. I am the reason we have millions of dollars in the bank account.
My parents had great children. The only company I know of was a bank that had money in their account.
My husband is fantastic at writing. He puts pictures of letters. The pictures get even more beautiful. I love these pictures.
I go to bed.
It is still seven-thirty in the morning. The slow creeping closer to midnight.
Then it strikes me. The world is gone. We are so happy.
The clock strikes twelve. It is time to go. I walk back to my apartment. I have been at work my entire day. I call it 8:10am.
Sleep.
I don't feel lonely.
I only feel empty.<|endoftext|>

She was still twenty-seven years old, there was nothing left. The world turned on her. She looked down at her hands and smiled. They were cold like frozen concrete.
The impact was sudden, she missed the ground floor and saw the ceiling fall, but never felt her touch against something else. Now she was drenched in sweat and gripped by an old, protruding hand. She tried to move a few inches, but she couldn't do so if she fell.
She stood up, she was in fear and looked down at her hands. She couldn't move in her current state.
She just wished for a glass of water.<|endoftext|>

"Why!? Why?? "
Joseph stared at the hanging boulder in front of him. That? That was supposed to be proof of a quest. Another rock, blue and symmetrical, just enough for him to throw it in his general direction.
He thought for a moment. If he could just pick one rock and throw it in the wind, he could take it with him wherever he wanted.
Well, the problem seemed solved a bit later.
He took another crack of his beer and snapped it open, inches of it flying down the slope and sliding down below his waist. He put his face deep in the roasting pile of beer, strained against his teeth.
"'Why?' " he said, simply.
A man rose from the rock. It was old, and wrinkled. A beard was covering it.
" There he is. No matter what. "
He picked up his coat. I still haven't seen him over the years.
" He wanted to die. "
The old man smiled. He laughed an octave at Joseph's humor. He smiled back and offered to repeat it a few times.
" Why I don't want to live. What is life worth living for? "
And with that, the old man rose and back left, a jagged edge extending around the rock where Joseph had fallen to the hard stone below.
The old man put down his beer and walked over to Joseph.
" You're talking about heaven. Why you're crying. Why you don't seem to get a chance to finish the quest. "
Joseph didn't cry, he stared at him through the brightness of his ale. That was the most important question he had ever been asked. " Why do you think I have no one else? "
" Why, Joseph. "
Joseph cocked his head to the side, shocked.
The man sighed. " I'm going to die."
Joseph took a deep breath, a sob or two running out. He stood up, walked out of the inn, the door slammed behind him, and was out the door.<|endoftext|>

Sometimes you just have to feel like shit. Like, I've always hated this subreddit, because we all had a funny little thing about us after we had moved on or become friends. Not if we were together.
At first, my first reaction was disbelief. " Oh what the hell!? " I heard myself rasp at. One word. Two words, then three, then maybe *a few*, every time I fiddled with my keys. * FAIR-CASH! * Literally all over it.
I tried to count down, making sure I was more than 2 hours from starting my work day in the morning; the last six weeks of classes, lecture after lecture. And while there was nobody on campus to go up and give a lecture on time, my mind raced with questions and questions, planning out the logistics of any possible solution. I didn't think I'd be able to deal with all of these questions soon enough and my frantic brain instinct of habitually pausing for what felt like an eternity as I headed to work told me to give up. I tried to think of the perfect question I'd answer before going to my bathroom. Even as I had the courage to break my count down to 2:30, I could not get it to the correct number.
" Is there anything I can do? " I asked myself.
No response. There was nothing. I wondered if my answer was totally pointless. I just pushed down the issue without thinking, as I tried to find out the answer that I just couldn't find in my brain. It was really hard to take in any of these questions.
It all came crashing down with me, like a shockwave as I slammed down on the power line. My little joke almost drowned out any other questions I'd thought I'd had, or answered.
A few minutes later, I realized I had just texted my boss the password I'd given all my senior year's classes, the ones that got me these work orders, and this was the one question that answered my question, goddamnit. I looked up a few seconds later to see a familiar face. A douche waiting on the other end, with a cardigan draped over his head and eyes half open.
" Hey, Gee, " I said, attempting to convince myself. I had definitely done this time, though. I wanted to tell him and finally tell him that I couldn't be home. To make sure that he wouldn't be worried.
" You okay, dude? "
" Probably got ta go, " I replied as if nothing had happened.
" Yeah, sure, " he said.
" Alright, " I told him and got off. He walked over to my desk and started typing to me. My worry dropped and instantly was replaced with disappointment. " Can't we just hit play?"
I typed on the screen just as an idea popped into my head. Playing with time is a powerful skill, we all have. At night, the same thought hit me every time. I thought, but didn't think. So I started tapping at random locations on the screen, scrolling through the comment logs. Eventually, I wanted to make sure my roommate was late to work.
Finally, I thought of my own ideas. I'd finally figured it out.
I clicked play, making sure that I wasn't hallucinating. It worked fine for me, I thought, and soon enough I was back in my desk. I could begin to play my cardigan.<|endoftext|>

The only feedback I have was an over-lapping of views and suggestions, I thought of how to reverse the spirals of despairing laziness that had enveloped me for so long. Unfortunately, as word got out, some of the negative feelings wellened to hard points that lead to some other points for me.
> "An unreal feeling of knowing nothing is real" – a noticeable twist of the trope that I greatly dislike.
I would give this response negative feedback, it sure as hell doesn't look good. Hopefully the story will feature a greater tone. I have actually quite enjoyed the weird/awful/specific periods of the story where a reader can actually'feel' it.
I found it mildly inconvenient to read further and lengthen sentences on sentences, while I thought the sentence length was something I could tell myself. Implying I'm just getting used to it, as not many people actually trust sentences over thoughts; you rarely need to read a full sentence before it feels like one.

I'd trade one for you.<|endoftext|>

When Stan tried to fire up the firehouse, his neighbors had to bite their tongues to hear it, and for that moment they had felt cheated.
As Stan ’ s fire came to life and billowed into the room around him with a terrible force that the residents where too frightened to react, they were left gasping for breath and screaming. The neighbors were fairly calm, and so the flames grew quiet as the fire gushed in through the window, swept the windows, torn through the wall, everything remained mostly still.
A glimmer of green said, “ *screaming*, **thats* Stan! ”
The mood was shaken, Stan ran downstairs and shouted over the noise, dropping dead in the alleyway. The house was quiet and stirred as his neighbors responded with the most well-fucking-hearted thrashing but his flames seemed to have prevailed only a fraction. Eventually they turned away and left Stan standing, the remaining fire had sprung into action, and the neighbors seemed satisfied, they began pouting but soon Stan was silent. Then he whipped around and aimed, with every thrust he held an arrow into the flames before snapping it back from the very tips.
“ HEY MOTHERFUCKER! WHERE IS THE TRICKER?! ”
Stan hit the ground but ignored his neighbors, not that in a hundred years he was supposed to be among the twos, but now that he was knocked over it was at least possible.
A member of the living room from upstairs screamed and said “ MOTHERFUCKER! ” as Stan lay dying.
“ MOTHERFUCKER! HEY JESSICA, WAIT! HEY GOD- SAMMIONNA AIFY! GOING TO KILL HER! ” The upstairs room protested and the president of the United States hung his head.
“ MOTHERFUCKER! ” Stan yelled at the top of his lungs and the occupants of the house came out in smaller and smaller bursts. Some boisterous coughing and froth covered those across the street as well, while the thatsing growing clearer and louder over the deafening fire.
Stan ’ s house started to reach even louder, and in a flash he was right outside the trunk with his friends and family looking up at him, frozen in fear.
Stan put his hand on the edge of the tree with the safety of a bear, and the scene blurred as he walked up to the trunk and extended his arms over his head.
“ It ’ s me, JESSICA! Come here! ” He said, suddenly afraid to move.
With a few vigorous hand motions he pulled the trunk out of the path and hovered over his head and peered out.
In those moments Stan finally learned that he had not been the king.<|endoftext|>

" Oh... Sir, because you requested a demo, " says Applejack. " In fact, you are requesting a free live stock. Now I know, I should note that Windows Tech Solutions only stocks available digitally. In that case, you will need to ask a special number. "

"HOLY SHIT! I'm having a fit, loser! " The old man yelled as he ran off. He must have had one of the few silences the young man was allowed. He ran in circles, dodged traps, and climbed higher walls. He has somehow managed to get onto the computer faster than someone with impossible equipment, however the good doctor who worked with him didn't live a happy life. He was found the next day by the police of Denver. He was given a suspended sentence.
" Ate me the purest potions, innit? " The old man returned the favour, grabbing his staff.
" I lied! " The young man didn't say anything, just looked at the staff and left. Suddenly there was a thump. He was falling slowly, people were screaming, and the man was crying out for help. He threw the staff and ran for the exit door. People continued to scream and run. Eventually the door closed behind him. What happened next is known as " The End."<|endoftext|>

It started about 2 hours ago.
It started on the ground, kids would sit and look around. They would go, "does it look like a butterfly? "
Butterflies turned up, my eyes traveled down the street to the students, " me, back to where my mommy and daddy were."
Nana finished school and went to the airport, I asked her why, her parents told me that her daddy was killed in the war, I thanked them and went back to our ranch.
It was at the airport that evening when it all went down.
Everyone was gone.
With nothing else to do at all, I crawled out of my bed and crawled into the bathroom. Sitting on the toilet was the butterfly.
The butterfly flew out of the bathroom and made a big jump in the air. The butterfly flew away, slowly until it was overhead and then vanished into nothingness.
It did not take long before we found out that the butterfly did not fly though, it simply disappeared to a perfect circle.
It had finally taken on a form when a small passer-by began a walk and said something to the butterfly.
Before we could do anything, the butterfly descended, made another jump, and disappeared from the earth.
The butterfly and I knew this was our final test.
I went to the medical centre and to my parents, I said, my name is Heidi and today I will be famous for jumping straight up from the clouds.<|endoftext|>

I woke up today, and suddenly something eluded me. I looked around me. Sure enough, it had been yesterday. I got dressed, removed my phone from my pocket, and plugged in my new smartphone. The screen was a dazzling blue, and I guess I should have felt compelled to use that color. But I digress.
After investigating, I found that everyone was asleep. I realized this was really strange, even for me. I knew it was probably just an experiment, but still. I unlocked my home front door, shuffled into my sofa, and kicked a chair out to the foot of the bed. When I got up, I opened it to find the TV was still beingeped. If I wanted this I was out of the loop. I ignored it. Every screen seemed to indicate a message from the living room.
"I live alone. Would you like to be with me? "
I laughed. If this was some kind of prank I would have woken up and wished they had made me outside.
" Please, you can come with me, " I replied, eyeing my roommate.
" What do you want? "
" To see the people I would like to kill. To know who they could be, how they could kill me. "
" And what would that do to me? "
" To kill myself? "
" To die."<|endoftext|>

Landon had already bolted and went into the hall. He'd practiced this position for years. He didn't remember the closet opening or closing properly. Just he had to leave. Liam just came out and showed his boyfriend why he couldn't see anything. His dorm room had less floor space than usual. As a kid it would have been a more appropriate room then the one in the basement. He could barely remember making it to this part of the campus without being able to use the lock, or even use your two legs. In nearly all houses you couldn't see Dean Wren that much of a distance at any time. The closet was the only reason he stayed. At times he wished it was. The knob was the only reason he couldn't see Dean Wren without a weapon raised. He was cursed with driving backwards.
Landon circled the exit on the table where Dean Wren would lounge. The smoke alarms on the front entrance to the dorm room meant Dean Wren didn't notice him entering. Instead he simply left. As he finally entered the dorm room the smoke alarms died down. Luckily Dean Wren had a key to unlock the room before he left.
Landon noticed a poorly positioned door ahead of him. It didn't necessarily seem important. It was just the chance to lock it up. But he somehow managed to open the door to his living room.
The room was very similar to the room Dean Wren left behind. This room did not have a dining hall. Dean Wren entered with his friend Cedric outside the closet. They both had no reason to stay. It had seemed crazy for them to look like Dean Wren. It seemed silly for him to be hiding in their closet. But Dean Wren never left their closet. He stayed with them for longer then anyone could have wanted to be home.
As they walked down the hall, Dean Wren whispered "I'm gon na come inside. " He still got a good look inside. The only food in the room was a stick. He needed a sign if Dean Wren would let them in. Dean Wren's room is a few turns ahead from Dean Wren's room.
Dean Wren grabbed the safety of the door and locked it, ready to get inside the room.
Cedric opened the door and knocked on the closet door. Landon opened up his locked room. Dean Wren handed Cedric the book. Cedric told him to stay in his room. Dean Wren sent out Cedric and Landon and came inside.
Dean Wren got up and walked back down the hall. As he finished the door was unlocked. Dean Wren reached inside.
As soon as he entered the room Dean Wren locked his closet. Cedric immediately noticed Dean Wren putting up a mask on the way inside. The mask hid his face. They both waited with bated breath for Dean Wren to leave.
Landon was confused and didn't know what to do. Dean Wren would eventually come out, and kiss his roommate goodbye. Dean Wren would pull Dean into his room and kiss him. However, he would not notice Dean Wren entering and would simply do his best to leave. Dean Wren kissed Dean Wren goodbye. Dean Wren would take off his mask and then walk out of the room.
As Dean Wren walked out of the room Dean Wren walked out of the closet and locked the door. He had to take off his mask. He eventually heard Dean Wren on the radio.
Landon was still confused and didn't know what to do. Dean Wren would drive down the street to Cedric's place to kiss Dean Wren. Dean Wren drove down the street again, face down, and kiss Dean Wren. Dean Wren drove in to Cedric's place, he probably would. Dean Wren would leave the room in the hallway, so Dean Wren wouldn't come outside.
Landon was now with Cedric on the porch and locked the door.

An indescribable plague of extermination. The inhabitants of New York City were divided into different major species: The humans, a docile bipedal alien race which has found a home among humans during times of conflict, initially sought to construct an electronic counterweight that would permanently entrench their petty hubris. After a horrifying terrorist attack while at a low power utility outlet, the masses of humans roamed the city, aimlessly fixing minuscule bulletproof tanks to their automobiles as their loved ones died.
However, due to technological advances in primitive weaponry, a very large amount of developed humanoids were launched into the martian wastes of New York City. Due to a clever and efficient workmanship of nanotech filaments that did not require any effort from the humanoids, the ships were able to repel all human weapons once the fallout zone was taken and the humanoids created a simple hive mind capable of creating expansive virtual worlds within the cities surrounding the impregnable, largely uninhabited part of the world. Upon the ships' departure, the humans claimed the building blocks of the unenclosed war zones to reside in until they could be replaced and the hive built underground.
This is not the end.
In conclusion, the strike was a failure and the world is devastated but humanity was quick to recover as the world could no longer be caused.<|endoftext|>

The young man stood in awe as the loud ringing of the barrel penetrated the warehouse. Slowly the criminal stepped out into the city, leaving only the blank space of the baton laying upon his temple. He brushed his hands over his eyes until they were just inches from the crook of his cheek, tears welling up behind the darkened hood of the bulletproof vest. The man walked quickly, casually, completely out of sight. He knew he could not say a word, but he could hear the impact as the barrel exploded.
He was off again, the throbbing pain making his legs quiver uncontrollably. The roar of the explosion stopped, revealing a cold concrete river flowing beneath him. When he turned his head, the pit in his stomach began to churn. Only the killer remained, not moving.
He only wished he was dead before he left.<|endoftext|>

I blink away the last red glow on my lamp and it isn ’ t long before the rest of my timeline is red. In fact, it ’ s pretty terrible, since I ’ ve forgotten about it.
I glance at the single button on the monitor above the monitor where one row goes gray. Slowly it clears into black with a simple white letter. The white letter gazes over to me. So does my heart. It seeps deep into my chest and stings like a dry Spanish didña dress. I try to move my body, but nothing makes sense. My mind starts to jiggle around and I try to remember that I ’ m not alone. It ’ s early morning and the signs seem right.
I got a promotion last month, and am now a quite large honoree. I am here in New York City and the theater is taking place three blocks from my home. A woman is standing in front of me, politely jokingly as usual, but in a oddly coiffed tone, indicating that she ’ s not even in good spirits. A TV show I have been watching shows off on the TV has recently been announced. Two men and one woman are both in the audience waiting. One of them is talking into a large microphone made of clear plastic. In front of the other is a large wall that glows dimly with yellow light and appears to stretch all the way up to the top. In front of the other is a throne surrounded by complex wooden white coats. Behind the throne are two hidden doors leading to a large chamber.
“ Congratulations Mr. Andrews. That must be D.D.? ” The woman in front of me speaks with a smooth voice. She is wearing a black suit and a shiny blue cap.
“ Wonderful, ” I reply.
She nods, and I remain seated for a while. Slowly her tone goes quiet as she says, “ I ’ m sorry for that. Do you still have your dog? ”
I ask her, “ What dog? ”
She smiles softly. “ Name is Marcus, ” she says. I blink, but I am not phased. I can still remember seeing him on the television. The man, at the podium and two figures standing next to him. They are dressed in white coats and wooden chair suits. No name, no face. Simply white chairs filled with seats with the man dressed in white. Standing next to them the man gets off the podium and taps his feet. “ Welcome to Bronx. It is so beautiful, ” he says.
I stare at the man. His heart is beating much faster, his eyes are glassy like porcelain, and there is a tone of almost impatience in his voice. I ask him to sit down. He insists, “ No Dr. Robinson. I… I ’ m not sure how I could be here at all. ”
I stare back. A single tear streaks down my cheek. Maybe a lady being a Missed-Miss is worth her weight in gold. The man is sitting on his own chair and looks at me like an idiot.<|endoftext|>

And it was my ass to look away from that one second long couch talk. Halfway through my long fishing trip, staring down at the steaming sea, I finally reached a pond. A small pond that must have contained more frogs, or maybe whatever the hell it was they called it.
I thought about drinking the remote and seeing all the life forms that lived there but I realized that there was one more thing I had to look away from. I needed to go back to meet my imaginary friend. I thought of calling a few last minute calls before disappearing. And I figured I wouldn't have to go, since I'd spent the last 30 minutes looking through every fridge and pantry. I had enough time to go through every picture frame on an old space park DVD player so I'd have somewhere to start again. But that's it. I would go back to meet my imaginary friend.
But then I heard that the closer I got the louder the bass began to bop.
"What the hell? " I said aloud.
" I saw that! " said my friend.
" Why would you see that? What's happening? "
" It's how you tell me when I need you around, you know? "
" So what did you say to that?!"<|endoftext|>

"Who are you? " my handlers asked, slightly annoyed by my lack of response.
" We do, sir, " I answered, slightly hesitantly. The two new ones I escorted passed me around the house with questions in each new sentence, as though they are mice.
" There's been another one this afternoon, sir, " I repeated, not daring to think of a case of Lycanthropy. " An enemy has broken through and is using all our line of command. We need to draw up a plan of action. "
" But I don't understand, " the handlers barked, frustrated. " You don't understand what you're talking about. "
" You think that you, who is being executed tonight, " I retorted, getting ready to kill one of my new subordinates.
" Is my family under attack? Is my family living in the goddamn house? " my handler asked, darting his head as though he wanted to see a stray.
" Okay, but it will only get worse. " I said, exasperated. It was only after I lost my balance after leaving the car and tripped over a light pole I could feel my best friend. " Take over and take back the resistance we sent to detain the kids."<|endoftext|>

My girlfriend. My first love. Two short, vulnerable years ago we made love, now a sixteen-year-old. It was fun. She loved me so much. Until the cage broke. Two's tied, one's bashed in, I think. God. Could I ever forgive myself for that? We were married, of course. We had our first dance together. We watched movies together, we ate, we laughed... but even in those four months, things didn't feel like our life together.
I can't hold it together.
We had a wonderful time. We had drinks and got on a good word with people. We laughed at each other's jokes. We laughed at the thought of moving out. We tried so hard to get the attention of people and life was what we expected. Then... we got suspicious. She tried to take it all back. I couldn't understand why. They beat her. I didn't understand why her tabby hands needed that much attention. Our relationship blossomed. She never actually fainted or died. We had a cat and all our relationship troubles and misery were purely temporary. She's gone... gone forever.
For the second time, I broke down crying. I sat, staring. Tears welled up in my eyes and when I told my girlfriend we were going to be together, I hated myself for it. But the silence hasn't gotten to me yet. I couldn't get away from myself. My heart felt sick. I wanted to run, to grab my cat, but something was bad. It was the cage being broken again... I'm going to fall in love with the cat in the cage again. I have to protect him, please.<|endoftext|>

**A-1-6-21**
“ Ummm… we've discussed this... I mean… what do you mean we've had this meeting, y'know? I mean, we've… it really came to this… ”
His face furrowed at the thought, but he replied “ Oh honey! They just wanted to talk a little… Hmph. I mean listen.. their *powers*… but they didn't want to share anything like they said, and they couldn't even *promise* that…. ”
“ No… You saying… this meeting… ”
“ Wait, will you come back! It's been… 23 years, and I haven't even let that go! It's been two years! And while I keep telling you to take everything… it's over! Take this here, and just let me sort it out! ”
His stern expression faded as he drew back his hot lips into a slight kiss.
“ Don't be ridiculous. Look, they're the experts! Some of the more popular ones. Alright, I think they're good… I don't care. Honestly, if I need to know a bit of anything about your mom… well, I can talk to her. She's smarter than I am. That's the best thing about her, though. She talks to people! I mean… how could she think of this like this? I mean, look, look… I... I think… I have such a great plan…
“ Look… we don't have to be all upset about this, you know? We have a lot in common here… I mean it's… I mean… you, that was… really the cutest thing I have ever seen… I mean… I did it for you too! I do, though… you really really have to appreciate the perfect way… oh *sarcastically* good I could tell you, sweetheart.
“ Okay, the plan. That's it… sweetheart. You got ta understand that this is a part of the process of changing your face and hair style. It all went a little too far with you… you know, and I mean, maybe I'm not as good with *myself* this way, but that can't be helped. Just because it's our way of looking… and… oh you got ta… -I was saying: you, I think your hair really is really cute today... That makes me think, I guess, that your hair kinda is really sexy. And that way, it makes me think that you're hilarious! Not just because your hair looks really cool, but because it's the real deal and you don't care. I mean it's romantic, yeah… but honestly, all that could happen at anytime is based in your *best interests*, right? And it's not even like you're dating another person you know! Just because you do it makes it ok, and it's the right thing to do, and it doesn't mean you don't love that person *and* that's not necessarily only ok, it *is* **foolish**.
“ Sweetheart, I just want you to know something. We can finally have a beautiful, happy childhood together. I know we did all of that here in the bathroom… and I just want you to know I love you. I don't even need you to *love* me anymore. I *am* *perfect*. I think you did it for me. It is not worth my effort, though, you know?
So, I know you appreciate everything… you really did it for me, weren't you? Okay, about what I mean by that? Well, hey, I got ta go, I'm on the road now.
Look, if you ever get a chance to take your fork out on this trip again, I really hope you make it in time. Good luck.<|endoftext|>

I was in the middle of trying to write something when my eyes cut closed as the words left my mouth.
*Time is cold and waiting. *
My thoughts started as any good question. Any inquisitive one could give a vague answer to, but no one except me had it down.
I decided to bite the bullet in that, painless, peaceful thought.
*For once I had won. *
And after that, it was a journey I would never know, yet I may never regret.
It all started with a Reddit username, my mom's mom's mom.
Today was some damn good thing, but I wasn't the brightest of them.
Maybe I would be fine without her. The telltale signs I had of schizophrenia would show in social interactions I had the misfortune of having. I sent a string of symptoms that got me into some sort of angry spiral in whatever path may have led me to like her.
This might be the only good thing she had to say, but even her name didn't matter.
*Of course, I would never forgive her. *
This induced a rash of sleep paralysis that put me into a state of uncomfortable situations that put me at a loss of words.
*Of course I would never forgive her. *
Then a pointless question at the end of a good paragraph.
Why am I only being judged by me? What did I think of myself, and how could I cope with that?
Right then I decided to do it.
I scrolled down and counted my minutes. 11:35.
The answer was so sweet, it made my head hurt a bit.
Perhaps, just perhaps, I would be able to forgive her.<|endoftext|>
**********332**********
Ahhh, those knives!
Oh sure, what were you doing?
Just thinking about how many people I've killed!
Every day has been a race against time!
They've scared me, killed me. I've been scared of them for years.
I don't think I can ever be alone anymore!
I hear screaming, yelling, screaming outside.
Don't listen to them, don't follow them, they'll find you.
Oh, sorry, they've won, but it won't be easy.
-- -- --
-- -- --
It's been one minute now, my time, and it's all over.
What am I going to say now?
*Why? *
I know.
It'll never matter.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
Tell me!
Tell me something they say!
Tell me what you're doing
Tell me what you're wearing
Tell me what you're breathing!
Tell me what you're breathing
Tell me you're dying
Tell me you're alive
Tell me you're proud
Tell me you're feeling proud
Take a deep breath
Take deep breath
Oh, that's what I wanted!
Tell me what you do
Think hard
Think hard
Think hard
Try not to think hard
Try not to think hard
Try not to think hard
Try not to think hard
Try not to think hard
Don't think hard
Did you just... I guess your one thing that's happened
It's time to talk
Talk about- or I'll tell you something
Because- or it's a gun.
Can you hear that?
How in our world is it fair to kill with one a gun?
Can you hear me?
How unfair do we really think you are
Or that you are merely up against those you've killed?
Listen to me, I just had the idea to tell you what's gon na happen.
Cause I didn't have the will.
It just took me a moment to realize that

John entered the hall again for the last time. His time in the Glorians was well and truly in that one moment of invigoration.
It was the most grandiose trip he had ever spent in his entire life. The Persian nobles, knights and others of their ilk who had trained alongside him to fight in brutal battles on all levels had made a splendid addition to his pantheon.
In the grand hall he saw a table of some of his finest warriors and gathered them around. Men were baying, children were waiting. Everything was perfect. There were no cracks, no sounds, no intergalactic pollution.
There was no traffic, only the quiet hum of the church. The church's function was peaceful and full of the sound of the priest through the choir. All six priests who adorned the table and bowed were remarkably surprised by John's appearance.
There was no time to be just "just ", they said. He felt the ocean embrace him as his mouth opened but he had no intention of letting it loose.
And when that was the last time he saw the white armies of Troy clash with the pagan auxiliaries, the other armies were nothing more than to protect their very culture from demonic evil.
And still, his smile slowly faded and he stood a step ahead of the rest.
Such was his knowledge that it was almost impossible to tell what to do. The priests were now gathered before him in silence and the music was just as bad.
Suddenly, he felt the hand holding his arm on the back of his head fade.
But he was already gone.<|endoftext|>

She had little concern for me at the time. She had children that left six years ago - nine months of research and nothing much.
She carried the stuff the doctors said I needed. My thirty-three year old ex-wife. My three kids. And yet her single mother still took the side she held. And neither of them wanted any part of it.
But I had brought the kids in. They were new to the house and she had seen them in the evenings. We made small talk. She was lonely - she was afraid. Not even a single change in me.
And my wife wouldn't look. She wasn't. We'd made all the grand plans. We'd invented the strange pills that made people hurt. And she wasn't. And this was our only constant.
She was breathing, she looked around. I knew she wanted to die. I couldn't take her. We couldn't kill her without her.
And if it's not something we can do to her, what's the point? I could be saved.
If it's something you can do to me, well, I don't know. She'd love me. It doesn't matter what I do or what she does. We're protecting each other. She can't be saved.
I didn't say a word, though. I'd been insisting on keeping in touch over and over, but the lights in my basement kept flickering.
'Pooommyee'. Who was it?
She looked up and shrugged and let me off the railing. It was daytime.
She shrugged again and me stood by the railing until we could talk.
'Morning. Morning, snuggling up.'<|endoftext|>

He took a step backward from the pole, staring into the distance as his child stood in front of him, staring back at him with a confused face. His middle finger slipped from between his right eyebrow and thumb, curving back into a smile. Adam was eleven years old, or so it seemed. He liked the sound of his first steps, how confident he was. The dance he had just performed in front of the people at the academy of gallantry. After all, after all, his father was a snowbrist.
"If you're gon na do it Adam, you'll do it. If it's not gon na be that easy then why not do it? " He looked up, waving his hands around before he began. " Just... come back. "
Jacob stood there, supporting his daughter. He took a long drag from his cigarette, carefully placing it in the ashtray.
" If you're gon na throw it into the snow, then you'll grab it and shit it right into the goddamn snow. " He looked at his daughter with fearful eyes, she bent down and cupped her hands around his waist. Jacob noticed she was crying, it made him miss her. He stopped talking and nodded.
Once they'd ended, Adam kissed her, there was a moment of silence and then he was smiling again. " But you have to do it. "
" I know. Do it. " She held back tears, this change was unprecedented. Most of those on the cots were already saving their tears for the ceremony. This one had won, but she'd have none of it now. She took a deep breath.
" I just want to help my mom with the pain I feel right now, I need that relief so bad ". She slid the crumpled cigarette into the ashtray and inhaled deeply. He took a breath.
" Go on. " She grabbed his arms, wrapping his in tight. Jacob stepped over her for a moment, biting his lip. His daughter smiled back, and continued, " Daddy's gon na be so happy when we celebrate your birthday tomorrow".

I have a giant smile like my grandfather ever did. I remember making a couple of small, multi-charitable donations and donating the rest to schools, universities and just for the fun of it, giving into his little wishes. Most people enjoy their job just under a dollar a month, but for me, I only put in as much as I needed to survive. A pile of fake resumes, pretenders, expensive cocktail chamomile, even a confetti bottle I couldn't legally drink. Most times, as I have already paid with that fake money, I just stand there idly, watching the people around me do the things I almost regret having done. I even gave some of the money to charity. While I don't think I would have done it without him, I do know what that means to me. We all have to survive. I mean, get some sense of self-worth there, make an out of yourself for what you get, be someone you love, be a god. You're the best of luck out there, buddy.<|endoftext|>

Why, hell, not a damn night off. The bed should be big enough that someone be on the bed for five years. Why not stay out here and get it all rolled up? At least, I thought so. Maybe if I follow my dreams, there'll be someone helping me escape this place. But I didn't do it on purpose, am I?
“ Honey, there's a rock in the bed. ” My older brother, Jamie, called from upstairs. He wasn't here much longer. I ’ d seen the last few episodes of Goodfellas and what use he was to grandkids. “ What's in the box? ” He asked.
It was rather odd to me that he thought that way. Let alone that he was walking through the garden this morning. “ The box you ’ re looking at, honey, ” he mumbled with a smirk. “ Is it there? Oh! Oh no! ”
He swallowed. “ Nah. It ’ s nothing. ”
I was tired of it. I couldn ’ t sleep. I drifted off, as my brother gently guided me back to sleep. I awoke to a loud knocking on the door. “ What time is it? ” I called out. “ Honey, wake up and check under the bed. ”
My alarm clock buzzed as I poked it. It didn ’ t tell me the time, and how I was supposed to be out. My brother shuffled down the hall. Another knocking on the door. Another knock. “ Ma ’ am, you called at least ten minutes ago! ” He tried again. “ That was ten minutes ago. Please be nice. ”
“ Y-yes, Ma ’ am? ” I said. “ I ’ m fine. It ’ s a cryogami. ” He hesitated.
I couldn ’ t help but to groan. That was part of being an adult. It never worked out. But I wasn ’ t the only one out here. Someone was dying. Someone had been on life support, getting some sort of treatment. My brother could barely carry me to the hospital. I could hardly move. And I could hear shouting from the medical center. I could hear my sister in the distance screaming.
“ What the hell are you doing in here? ” I heard her say to me. “ Why are you two here. What the hell are you talking about? ”
I still could tell that my brother didn ’ t like me either. I guess he had no concept of what he was doing with himself. But if it was death, then at least he couldn ’ t sleep at night, and of course he could never think of another way to pass off as the reincarnated human. So I did what any good grandfather would do, picked up the little wooden box in front of the door, and flung it wide open with haste.
After the chanting stopped, the front door burst open. My brother ran down the hall, waving to me all the while. “ Ma ’ am! ” he shouted.
“ Don ’ t you think that the tree will be strong today, toad? ” I asked.
“ Yes, Ma ’ am! ” he yelled again. “ What the hell is that? ”
“ It ’ s a big stone, exactly like your mother used to make it. ”
“ Well- ”
I just wanted the kid to hear me out, because I knew the way he was going to use it in his other life. “ It ’ s not real. ”
His alarm clock buzzed again. He wasn ’ t finished yet, so he started counting slowly.<|endoftext|>
**********338**********
What used to be a simple castle grew into a sprawling highway complex, following what used to be a pristine city. But now, it takes years, months, years, to carve a path again. Trapped in a plane of view of the landscape, you can hardly tell where it is. As you look around at the water around you, you are reminded of the lost love of your life. It ’ s very much alive, even though you are powerless to see it. Yet, every breath you take is focused solely on one thing and that is the journey ahead. You know now that you could never be true to your destiny. It ’ s the realization that the journey will not go easy. There are still ways around. And now, not just because of these abilities but because of the reality of existence.
The day your eyes open, the world is bathed in the most beautiful smell of the world, a combination of champagne and whiskey. Then everything is the same as it always is. Nothing can be said about it, but there is something about it that creeps inside you and seizes your focus. The feeling is just as overwhelming, but you just can not handle it any more. The world was once a once great city, a royal castle and a private school. But now, that city is occupied by the multitude of petty criminals, ruthless thugs, the bestial housewives, genocidal murderers and torturers. All the comforts of life I have gone through were brought out of thin air, but now, they ’ re all stripped from me.
I look out onto the sunset. The landscape is still covered in the color of butterflies. Wait, what is this? It ’ s purple. I must find out. I race up to the fire in the distance, only to realize the sun is dropping rapidly to one side. I find my wand in the air, just in time to evade it. The warmth of the fire emanates from it and I am struck with a certain awesomeness, as I eventually feel it float to my finger tips. It is all that is able to kill the tree on the other side of the road. “ Here is my love, ” the voice says, out of the green of the trees. “ We will go live together with you. ” I will leave this memory behind, and return home. This was the only way, I knew. I will get home.
“ Oh. ” I giggle. “ A great-grandpa ”, the voice says. As I begin to trail after the tree, it starts to wink at me. I need to get home. I don't need to return. This is too good to be true. But I don't move, for I am in the middle of the road, the only way to run.
You see, I have this ability to touch other people. As I fly over my kites, I snap into a chase. Perhaps I ’ m choking. With my mobility being so limited, I just never think twice. I chase them across the highway, the four lanes of straight ahead to stay behind. If I catch them on one side, I can stay behind them, or I can poke my head into a massive fire and end it. I ’ m not prepared for any of that, however. They won ’ t stop, the fire will consume them. I feel their burning rage. But I hear their thoughts, and they are scared of death. They try to hold my hand and drag it away from their embrace, but their grip is weak. They ’ re waiting for me to leave. I can not leave.
It can not be taken, I have no idea how long it will take. I am powerless to win the race, but I am ready. I can easily outrun the fire, overcome the enemies and continue on toward my goal. But the fire would consume the children, unable to take my hand if I left, with no right to challenge. It will cause a very large outcry on this continent. But the only way to truly lose control is to have fun. And with that, I stumble upon the path.<|endoftext|>

"Ah, shit. " Laila said, hurrying up to the podium. She first heard her name first, but its clear that she's heard it in perfect seriousness. The room was filled with people, eyes shifting between hoes and swords, swords made from the rarest metals and whips that made nothing but beautiful cuts for the warriors. " Baffling. " She said, feeling confident in her abilities.
" Hm? " Said the suited blacksmith, who was chatting up a Golem as he waddled over to her. He leaned in to chat with her, while chatting back, then shaking his head. " Me neither. Gives me more pleasure to kill for many a Warrior, but instead of feeling relief, I feel... excitement. " He waved his black cloak in front of Laila's face and she could see he was smiling at her. " Maybe if you stop looking at me then I can taste it when you're on my hunt. "
" And why am I here, anyway? " Cried Yves.
" Because... look what you're doing. " He teased, sounding a little annoyed by the thought. He popped his head out of his massive mouth. " What are you doing with your body, anyways? " He took a hammer from his back and bared it in the air as he crossed the stage. " You don't even want to break my watch? "
" Really? " Asked Laila, who put the hammer back in its hilt. " Why would I even have a watch? Are you demanding it on a free body? "
" What can a free body do? Does it have valuables? " Cried Yves. He stood up and straightened his tie. He walked up to her and patted her on the arm.
" Let's get a drink, boys. " He turned and left the room, reappearing in the back of the tavern. He'd gotten his drinks from the tavern and they were ready to grab a pack for when the mood turned sour.
" Any idea what this drink is, anyway? " asked one of the other Silver Rangers.
" It's some sort of modern novelty. " Yves replied, a bit disappointed by that. The other men nodded, indicating that they should get the weapon for when they got back. A tank sat next to a barstool next to the crowd. " Let's get a drink, then."<|endoftext|>

They came for me, in the guise of man. This was my marriage, to the wicked and the people of Aramaic. My father was killed by rebellion, while my mother did not have enough money to buy weapons and weapons and things. They had just some more food, water, and clothes. I was not a poor cook. It was my new job, to cook in my hometown for them. I found out that I could take a dragon, and I was intrigued enough to climb on top of the cattle-structure and then sent it to Jesus who decided not to send anyone.
When I woke up, I discovered that they had left me. I told God not to send a dragon for me, because they cared for their beloved and loved me, and chose the Cephalopod-in-very-clean condition, and had never fought. Even now, I am excited to have my new life in the Cephalopod-in-very-clean-condition. I get to go outside and visit with my women, her being called Landad.
10 weeks after arriving, I saw them, they were really WMC ( warrior-like ) women, I rode to see them and met them, the last woman I saw was called Macha. I like to have one of her knives, and eat only in a setting of sun and hot tortis. However, my tongue is very far from that of Macha, so I like to give her a fight. After taking my knife, they walked me out to the desert and cried until they accepted the challenge. They had grown older, and the women realized that they are no longer as good as they were supposed to be. That is why the WMC women chose me, to stop the Cephalopod-in-very-clean condition. As i said, today is my burial service, and I will soon learn my fate.

"Look, I already have what you're here for. It's no big deal. The previous tenant is going to cover everything you take that's not yours. That is their primary residence, they have time to respond to their problems. I'll only need some of their help. "
As Baker looked up at the mirror, he could hear movement in the opposite corner. He turned. It was a giant spider, more like a fish than the monster Baker was.
" You're right. It's worse than you thought. "
" Mom always told me not to yell at her, or we'd go on dates. "
" Just say it. You're not going to deal with her coming back. That can't happen. I know you've tried putting up with her, you know that. But if you let her go, it's only your mistake. And you know that you'll miss the bright yellow coating the spiders are eating."
A block later, and Baker was a divorce lawyer; he was compensated by his mother and the school. He'd just learned that his rent would be taken from him. His mother was once able to run away and have one last visit with Baker. Now it wasn't as if he was going to leave, at least not with his new settlement.
Baker remembered hearing about the rise and fall of the new generation. He'd overheard what they had to say. They said they wanted things to be different, a better world. The pain, the suffering, the risks were all that he could focus on now. He held onto it all for at least a week or so.
He thought back to the energy prices. A few days later, the website that was selling it was gone. The website was replaced by a sale page where a user simply read one sentence:
> TOM JANE WAPED OVER WITH AWESOME BEAT LAUNCH. NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Baker felt like he was about to explode.
Just before the explosion, a spider crawled out of the wall that served as his neighborhood and began to eat him.<|endoftext|>

As I was heading down the block I thought maybe my honson was in the next store. That and I needed to get to work immediately and got down to business as quick as possible. I needed some groceries and would be back if they didn't already- they're mostly gone, so I grabbed my R2-2 from the back ground and headed back into the alley. I stopped at a pick-up stand and decided to have a sandwich when I heard a faint "Hello!? " as I had been called earlier. The lady at the front desk seemed quite worried as I approached; she's not going to let me through in time so I started to make my way back to the store as fast as I could, when I came across a just like-looking little boy sitting in a shopping cart. His big nose splayed into a pondish grin; his green eyes were piercing as if they were preparing to meet the sun. The unmistakable smile of a disobedient child. I quickly yanked my R2 out of his hands and sat down; he was not feeling well so I opened his coat pocket and opened up his pockets. As he handed it to me in one quick motion, I stepped out and did my best to not flinch. The hat ran taut and it was still shiny though. I thought maybe he was his father or something. " Yes sir, you're my son, and I love you very much," a young boy said as he handed me a single piece of paper.<|endoftext|>

I quietly slept in my apartment. Never really thought about what it was like on the outside, at least not since the turn of the century. It had mostly turned out in my favor though.
Overnight, the cat ripped my mouth open and fed me.
Twenty years of experience, knowledge, good times, and a lot of gooey bits of paper had me finding myself now. I could see the progress, a far-reaching view.
That was my real goal. What was the point in aiming at what I was? Why walk away from what you thought was a purposeful decision like that? Was it to walk away from the world? To grab a piece of my last remaining sanity?
I found out today that I was quite the stickler when it came to subjective perspective. In my life, I've never been the latter.
Where I live was rural in the land, a mostly forest area where the forest itself works as a neighboring ecosystem. I suppose that's exactly where I'm from, more so than all the others. There was no hustle and bustle of life in my life, only a shifting balance of steam or traffic, and parking on almost any highway in the state. Even now, I can't quite be sure if a route the other way existed.
As I watched, the green cherry blossoms stuck out across the sky. It looks exotic. Could it be that it's like a last chance? Maybe another flight of fancy to figure out where they came from or tell their people.
I went to the dog park to catch a memory. I won.

Wake up for the day.
Try to be patient.
Want to avoid the overwhelming number of people around you and all their problems.
Want to avoid all the headaches and all the stress.
Want to stay calm.
Want to forget your problems and the bright colors of the world.
Want to forget the heartache of your last moments as well.
Want to forget all of your human instincts, all of your unnatural self judgment.
It's time to go.
The days slowly started to slowly pass, and the distant warning sounds of my children's voices started to die down, and everything became relaxed.
I adjusted my glasses and smiled, being mindful that this was me and we both held our heads high.

"Silence! " John screamed.
The school had opened. The doorway was locked. The class was small. The doors had been locked. It had been the entire time that I was in school.
The sidewalk, however, was there. I could smell the pungent ambrosia. It wasn't a real rat poison. I'd been up here late and I didn't care, nor did I care if I could get any sleep.
“ Why are they all still here, John? ” Troy replied as I stood there from outside my window.
“ I still don't understand why they're here, John, ” Troy squinted his eyes.
I wasn't listening to John and I knew that. I was going through thoughts of suicide and of his last day, of it all, and everything that had happened, as I ran back inside the building and asked if he knew where I was.
“ I mean, the government has failed, John. We can't allow the people who are going to get us out of here. ”
John knew. He knew that, so he kept trying to stay quiet. But he just couldn't let it go. I hated that fucking asshole. I just wanted to save a family and make a friend so I could speak to them.
“ Why do they keep lying about it? ” I shouted. I hated listening to fucking useless dumbass.
“ Because it is to our benefit that they continue to deceive us, John. Keep them in line. ” Troy turned his head slowly to the window and spoke. “ They let people get killed. They let them see who can get away with murder. We have used all our members, our strongest, the best in society to keep them in line. ”
“ Who do they have it to do with? ” John said. “ Is it you who murdered them? Is it you who brought them down? Do you think you know the truth? You have poisoned the air and the water and those chemicals that got our attention, John? Do you think you can stop it, John? ”
“ I won't allow anyone, John. I won't allow anyone, ” John said. “ I know you can ’ t tell me, John. ”
I loved this bloody idiot. He was the sole reason I saved the people I protected. He used to be my grandfather, and now he I used to be his wife. Maybe he could die tonight, but he would live as long as he wanted to. He could still outlive so much.
“ If you don't stop them, who do you think they are? ” Troy asked as he pointed at the ceiling.
“ You can't kill them John. You have destroyed us and we are all responsible for the lives you make up to keep them from leaving you on this earth and we will not allow that to get us out of this fucking place. ” John said.
I looked out the window, at the red water that ran down the street. The sweat of Troy's brow on my face. I thought about the clock that hung on the ceiling. That damned clock that took it all away from me. I ’ m sorry I never should have done this, John. I fucking do fucking hate how you use to tease me like that. I'm just glad I was able to listen to you, though. I hope I can get my life back, John. There are some things in life that need to be done.
“ Don't you ever worry about being like that, John, ” Troy grabbed my arm and squeezed it. I shook in his arms, “ you know that won't happen if you don't stop them. ”
John was crying now. His tears fell silent. I walked over and kissed him. But there was nothing I could do. “ We have to stay alive. ”
The clock was still off. Troy wasn't listening anymore. I turned back towards the window. We had to get out.<|endoftext|>

I took a decent amount of photos. Of course, every last photo got taken, but how are you supposed to organize a lot of mass like that? By now, most people have a relatively cool body; around the age of 35 or 36. So how am I supposed to organize all the pictures?
I look at the pictures you keep close to you. I don't want to be rid of them, but these were the last. Even the fires were burnt out. You'll need to keep reminding yourself of them in a digital camera. That's the problem; the massive amount of them that I left behind.
I got an abortion, and I'm sure you heard about it. I was too powerful to just jump in front of a plain one-way mirror and wipe a few of it out, so you had to do something special. Nothing too complicated, just leaving things untouched. You don't know anything from the photos that haven't been cleaned.
So I needed to put up an on-site security camera. That's what I did, since these photos need to make a clear image. I stole all the photos of you from your Facebook accounts. You don'tice, however, that the water on the fake photos I took is fucking bad. You think they're fake? Try to think about it, because you're being dragged onto a giant dreary thread of crap.
I don't have time for that shit right now. You're only putting a couple thousand deaths through my lens now. The robed figure in the rear right now is just about thirty foot long. I feel nauseous, like I don't belong here. You didn't leave me before I died. You did. I just got sick and died, and I don't even remember having a finger. They're still there, on the back of my collar. Your were there too. Now, you'll have the geezers that took every shred of my life.
Every photograph you take ends up being used as a missing person photo. By now, you've probably been working with some professional image-maker to make an actual Hollywood picture as a work-of-alexander of your choice. As the hours go by, you'll get out the more professional equipment. You'll find some decent examples of Hollywood movies in your hand. You'll then use it for whatever silly thing you dream of. Some nice dirt for a finish. Even dirt?
At least you don't die. Just keep showing up and all that.<|endoftext|>

( I found the prompt interesting and wanted to do an ending please! )
"Why must I ever turn to the Sun? Isn't that impossible!? " My comrades proclaimed. I knew this as well as I did.
But I could not believe it. I had no hidden way to finish this problem. I had no hidden way to permanently damn the animals. Or the forest, or the trees. I could easily get my fingers in the chain and pull the trigger. Perhaps tomorrow, and I could either help them, or do it all over again. They were lying on the ground. The other ones were sleeping in stumps. The blade in my hand was a pickaxe.
I had taken up the life-supporting position, and anyone who came after me would get me in their death throes.
No matter what they brought me in, they would always end up where I was: sitting on the floor, one foot behind the other. They called me the Cleric, and then they tried. Men, women, and children.
But there are no more left. Everything was just another cycle. I hear the children screaming for me to go, but I can't. Even if I was to kill them, and if they didn't call me a Father, I wouldn't do anything.
I just want to die.
My wives whispered in my ears. I smiled, knowing why.
" Why should it matter anymore? " They whispered quietly in the background.
" Do you think that you can break free? You would risk everything, but you can't just walk away. " I whispered.
" I... I don't know... Can I just trust in God? "
I remembered their strength as they stared in silence in my direction.
" Oh no... What? " I said.
I pulled the trigger. All the animals began to sob. I smiled. It was so simple, so amazing! I knew what I had to do.
I made my way to the cave.
" So-hee, " I said, lifting my head. I closed my eyes. I kissed them, laying there on the ground. Just one click. The humans were screaming at me. I watched as blood all over their faces.
" I will never stop loving you, " I whispered.
" I always will," one of them whispered.
I got up and turned around. But it was just a slow rise to the top. I stopped smiling for a moment. My head throbbed with pain.
I woke up. The humans were gone. Everything around me would disappear.
I picked up the pickaxe, and my cackling wife rested her head on my chest. She comforted me while I smiled.<|endoftext|>

Jack's heart stopped. He let his heavy bags bag shuffle over his thighs as he reeled back. A few moments later, he had the adrenaline running through his system and had no idea where he was anymore. All he knew was that something must be wrong, and that being dead would mean killing everyone.
That adrenaline spooked him enough.
Jack could don'thing but watch as the searing pain rocked him, rocking him back and forth. Out of breath, Jack stood, waving his arms over his chest. Before he knew what was happening, he was lying there, helpless, lifeless. Jack began to cry.
"Shit. I wish I could cry, but I'm dead, " Jack explained, and he couldn't stop himself from crying.
" I wish I could cry, just for... " He trailed off.
Jack looked around at everyone in the room, nothing was there. " I want to die too, but what am I going to do? "
Jack realized that he wouldn't go back. " I'll watch you, " he continued. " I'll watch you cry. We'll have so much fun, don't we? "
" But I can't, " cried Jack, and had no doubt that he was going to die later on.
The cries continued, and Jack was unable to stop himself. He stood there in the gutter for a moment, contemplating suicide. The doors of the hospital opened, and the receptionist was the first to rush in. The cashier pushed two nurses close.
" I'm sorry, " she said, before slowly rushing forward. Jack's face hurt. " Who are you? " she asked her boss.
" John Doe, " Jack answered. " Jack Doe. I'm... I'm Jack Doe, " he stood. The nurse poured Jack a drink, and didn't let him down. Jack couldn't stop crying.
Suddenly, the pain was gone. " What the fuck... I need some air," Jack said, as he died.<|endoftext|>

I didn't even keep a blood pen when I vowed to die by burning myself in the fireplace. I didn't even go looking after my family. You never hear the name of this fire and I never had a sibling. I spent all night sketching out a bone. I slept on the couch because my mother had the nerve to babysit me.
I think I could maybe get laid today. I promised my firstborn and a maid that one day I would work up the nerve to slit my throat. Luckily the first thing I noticed was my hand. Why was I supposed to be cleaning dishes? I didn't need a hand to look out for my family. I skipped from the kitchen to the main room cleaning and fixing dishes. I didn't even look after that fancy shower house!
The second thing that kept me from leaving was me talking about the girl from the latest online dating profile. It was another one of her old high school friends. That was always the most annoying part and she put her interests before trust.
I used to joke that I would eventually be able to make her witch boyfriend, if only she could see my misery. But she'd never admit it to herself and blamed me for not being careful. I never wanted to marry a witch. And I mean it again. I broke up with her because I knew she would shit herself when the red faced bastard did it to her. That was in those final days before she broke up with me.
The next day I read through the curse letters that spelled out my names and qualities. Names I knew would be just words. She'd put them on my worksheet and I would stand up and wave it. She was a damn idiot after weeks. The few times she swore on oath I swear more and more words and deeds that if put on my work sheet. She was screaming in rage after losing my lawn and me not even naming her. Fuck the smell of sulphur on the dirty street and rats attacking the old folks house. I just had to stick a knife in it.
It's been a nice marriage, I think to myself. Now I can finally find my calling and finally get laid.<|endoftext|>

The mood swings between nothing and mostly fucking cold. The sky turns back to a purple smudge of blue and the roads make short work of the armies that occupied the area in advance. My thoughts are interrupted as some footsteps. As a man wearing a fake cornflower outfit stumbles into my office, he pulls out his wallet. He goes to look for something, but no stone or rock. He looks at me and the look in his eyes stays with him. I don't turn around to find the object of his taste. I tell myself that I am going to assume he did not see me at the behest of something, but he turned around with a long curved stick of nails. He started running.
"Oh god stop running! This is too much for me to handle! "
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
" I'm busy today, " The man says. He has a look of frustration, as if he sees something trying to distract him. He looks at me this question so that we can resolve it in his head. As we both nod my head, he begins walking away.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
Just as he exits his office, I release my grip on the can of dog food. This sign is among the most disgusting things I have ever seen. My gaze goes out to every single person walking by. I try not to glance at it, as I am embarrassed by the death of dogs and their innocent lives. I don't really want to look. I think that the sick enjoyment of living my life as a dog in a white suit would be wonderful to spend some of that money on a nice house. I think that wearing more expensive clothing in your name would also be despicable to go to your home and not have anyone talk to you.
At one point, the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a piece of candy. He approaches me and grabs my hand. We both look at each other in utter shock. He inserts the cookie into my mouth. " Mmm. So fluffy and so soft! " He says in a casual tone. " Do you really want to hold this forever? " My mouth says yes, and he responds slowly. " What if someday you don't have that candy? " I tell him. I smile at the very thought. " At least your cat will come by soon. " he replies.

I hear a car in the distance. I close my eyes, and I can't make out his silhouette in the fog of time. I stand up with the rest of the guys and motion to him. " Hey, how's your morning? " A kind voice says.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

"C'mon Gerry! Don't leave the news! "
" Gerry, man! Leave the news. It's on Channel 4. You asked us to make the cut. The reporter cut the radio... His game, " he said to himself as he looked over at the plastic jar staring back at him, rubbing his hand over his ragged beard. " I'll bet you don't know who it is. "
He looked over at Laila. " You kinda need to leave the news. "
" George! He was recording the bus ride, she was picking her nails, calling her boyfriend to check out her garden, and it turns out he was filming the weather. "
" That's not the John! With his general tone, Gerry, " Laila said in a low and rude tone. " There is no John, he's not even an actor! "
" Sure is Gerry! " George said, beckoning at Laila to come closer. " It's two in the morning! Not to mention the calendar was cut, well, destroyed, that's messed up right. So, I guess his campaign started just to get me out of bed. "
" Sure, who cares? " Laila called from out of sight. " There's no George to bring any cups, wines, cookies, or foods for the holiday. Why do you keep telling yourself this is the end?
" It's a wonderful holiday and I'd really like to say it's not. I do love you so much, Laila. You say what you wish, Gerry. I don't want to do that anymore. "
" This isn't the end of it is it Gerry? " Laila asked, slightly confused, looking in disgust at the panic displayed on George's face.
" But it's on the record! " George growled, frowning.
" Like I said, don't leave the news. I need you. " Laila sobbed.
" Why now? " George's voice rang in the air. " I need you. "
" GIVE ME BACK CANDY! " George yelled, offering an arm at his girlfriend.
" No no! " Laila cried out. " GET OUT! "
" Car! Get the trailer! " George rushed after her, slamming the doors and yelling " Sweet Lord, John! Put the trailer back! "
" NO! " Laila cried out, clutching George's arm tighter. " You'll never forgive me. I love you! "
George reached over to grab her, and Laila made a soft squelching noise as his hand came over her face, limping away.
" Oh my God, Gerry, " George said, drowning in the sobbing. " I'm sorry, Laila. It's that much I can't fathom. "
" You know I love you, " George said, and then looked behind him. " Yeah? "
" So am I Gerry. " Laila said. " I don't want you hanging around, on camera or whatever. I'm just the cameraman. "
" Stop fucking around Laila, " George said, taking out an old leather strap from his leather jacket and pulling it out of his backpack. " You know when you hear that, your little bag is flat on the ground, blood everywhere."<|endoftext|>

The hall creaked ominously, interrupted by the sound of tapping on glass. Dad shut the door behind him, pulling the wooden handle up onto its pedestal. Dad rushed to sit on the swing he had set up, his hands shaking. A young man dropped from the window, his face white with fear as the steam crept out of his lips. " Where are they? What have they done? "
" Just wondering. " Dad sighed. " No one will ever know how dangerous a weapon really is. But before we raise the weapon to the highest of our peers, I want you to consider how dangerous a weapon really is. You want to defend yourself as best you can? "
" What in the fuck is that? " Eric, also an older brother, squirmed in his seat.
" We are teaching you how to use these weapons. None of these weapons are worth using. It won't kill you now, Eric. " Dad stepped back. Eric huffed. " Get your ass out of here if you want to know why... "
" I'm tired of this weird circlejerk. The whole school is paying for these weapons."<|endoftext|>

It started raining outside. It started raining outside yesterday. It started raining outside again, four days before.
No time to call 911 or dispatch or do anything. Sure, I had called myself a firefighter, but that never hurts to have someone phone you without warning. I can never come to the fire department and at least not that I want. I'll just keep doing what I do, fuck me. It's just too damn good. You start to think, as a firefighter, it's all okay. Then you begin to fail. You begin to turn around. Not sure how to believe it, but it might be true. By the time you find the where you are and start doing it again, you're already passing through that second shit again.
It started raining outside yesterday. It started raining outside 4 days ago.
My breath catches in my throat. I don't know how long I've been out. In front of me, thousands of people. Burning buses, men sprinting across the street in the rain. Everyone is celebrating, wondering, rejoicing. How could I not stop raining outside? A roar is heard but I can't make out the word. No, that never makes any sense. One second I'm kneeling down and watching what is going on outside, the third I can barely see it. The sixth, I remember. I remember my boyfriend throwing me a light. I remember the words on the screen, and how the rain turned into a million miles, only to roll away into nothingness. I can still hear it. As it falls, I realize that I'm in a better place, engulfed by the flames. The rain weaved by leaves, leaves washing the ground, water flowing in streaks, blizzards, ghosts, sounds of voices, lips pulled back together. I wonder who the hell that guy is.
This all starts to get weird. I remember sometimes walking to work, out of the glare of the window of the office building to the endless fires, your office building, about to engulf itself and render your city like nothing it's ever been. I remember something, I don't remember the voice in my head telling me to leave, that I must go or I'll never see the fire. Why am I not going? Who was going to see the fire? Did they leave? It was a gift from God.
I remember most of it. It wasn't anything unusual. It wasn't special, just an average day at work at a desk job. Things seem normal at first. Not after that rain. It's not like I've seen any rain. But in that time? Nothing is normal. I start to panic. I start to panic, I realize what this all means. You can't just say, "It begins raining outside." What's happening?! Is this a dream? A fucking nightmare? The reality is coming through, my reality. I can't take this anymore. There's always going to be a storm, but I can't stop right now. There's nothing left but air and water. I can't stop.<|endoftext|>

"But you will give me two. " Superman roared at the boy whose world was his only living interest.
The two of them laughed together. Superman was not the stupid one. The fool. The one who drowned his sister with a gas giant last week. The friend of the twins too, but they had meant it to end. They wanted to fight.
" Son... what is it your wish, to be a hero? " The villain shouted.
" I want you to unite the world. " Superman replied.
" Yes, understand. " The crackling fire monster growled.
" So... what can I do? "
" You are selected at birth. Each one will be brought along to me. "
" I am so....with so much sadness on my face, why so disappointed? "
" Because I hope you are strong enough for me, to never have to worry about names... by choosing you to yourself. "
" What are you... scared of? "
"... Superman."<|endoftext|>

I found a block on the southern side of my house where my computer sat on top of the computer. I've worked this job for a day, 12:15, for three straight hours and two minutes, and there was something I figured out early on that I thought could outdo my job. I had to be more relaxed, so I touched my gloves, studied the reflective edge of my mirror mirror, waited for my subconscious to judge me and heard my voice. It turned out this had always been my secret weapon when I was younger. I literally just wasn't the smart type, because it had to be proved. I only wanted that quick. It was a hack. I was careful. It was easy.
The white oval was made of wood, gold thread, stone and silver and just the opposite of silver. It was intended to communicate with information and put me in a loop that lasted for hours, then the connection was made to my mind. There wasn't a mind control they said, but it was my job to show them what their minds were capable of.
The room was dark, silent and I didn't hear anyone, it felt like a walk in the park. I didn't dare open the mirror, for I'd spent over 12 hours in the dark and it always felt like I had to be light asleep when I did. I picked the block back up and waited. The more I waited, the more I found out my secret weapon. I'd once thought about cheating and the required paperwork. As I fell asleep, I could still see the lines and the electrons and metal saw that sat on the floor across from my computer. I had to get on with my job now.
At 1:43 AM, the clock on my computer turned off and the room was empty. It was the middle of the afternoon, one of the worst ones I had ever had to clean up. I checked my mail folder and it was empty, and I felt terrible about doing it, thinking my work was having none of it's effects.
I walked into my room and put on my black box, my best friend Jerry wouldn't give a flying shit if I told him that. The sound of shattering glass and windows broke my night as the first light of day came over the room. I followed Jerry in the hallway, there were a handful of bodies and bodies of people and I sighed, the last of my loved ones were just in the room. I lifted the floor up and as I fell down, I heard the sound of crackling and so I moved around them to put on my sock in a threatening manner and winked out of existence.<|endoftext|>
**********355**********
I awoke with a heavy groan. A long struggle to keep upright as the warm embrace of a heavy sleeping bag and the shrill cry of life against the remains of the tattered remnants of civilization choked my soul, breathing only barely once more before my new body was mewling and wagging the way my new eyelids parted from the side of my face into the void beyond, feeding off of my ragged breaths and my corpse lay in sleep.
I thought I was finally doing something else. I thought I was finally, finally, so long gone. I thought I had won. I was finally ready to face the coming disaster that the world had been expecting.
I didn't understand the true nature of this new curse that awaited me when I woke up, but I was certain, my soul had sent it its message of vengeance. I remembered my girlfriends motto: “ as long as you stay here, Mama and Papa always and always remember to eat*.
I remembered my parents, too, packing in the boxes of morsels that they'd cooked for the night before and keeping fresh for when it was time to go back to my home in Memphis, TN. But it wasn't new to me. I remember when they left for Africa one early morning. I remember when they *thought* they could catch me a couple of days later, and how long had it been since they'd taken their first bite to the skin.
I did what any sane person would do: I waited outside in the early morning sun, just out of sight, in anticipation for what I hoped to be a very sharp pain and death – a sharp pain in the center of my jaw and a sharp pain in my mouth as my vision and body slammed into each other, sending groans and gasps as if I'd never been alive again. I was ready to find out what that was like, to find the person I thought myself doomed to be with.
As a pitch black shape descended, a thousand thoughts raced through my mind: Was it not a chance to bite me? Did it not really occur to me, in my very earthly place, to bite? The only answer to all of these questions was a very monotonous and vengeful knock at my door – louder this time.
I opened it. The pain was back, but I felt a thousand sharp pains in my hands as I opened the door and my whole body sank to the ground, eyes locked to the ceiling.
I looked around, and I saw nothing but ash and ashes and lifeless bodies from the light of day. I felt nothing, and I broke out into a grand smile, even though I didn't feel anything at all.

We could all play on the floor of our farm anymore. How could you let another soul kill each other? We still collected dirt and refuse, mostly from the river, and others from the still waters. We did our best to protect them from other kind of creatures. How could we not? We still packed those resources, we still pumped it into the backs of our cows and said we would protect them from that putrid, withering thing if we had to. Just like before, we were just slaves.
Humans were so fascinated with fighting things that we would slaughter them like we slaughter a living thing. It never occurred to us though, all of the humans were farmers. There was the real peasant, Paul'r, some people had heard of him, they said he died from being patted by a butcher, bleeding out like he was a river. Maybe it was the capital treatment, over-reaching power, over-extraction, not that we ever felt so happy about that. None of us were particularly religious, it just seemed right to be more spiritual.
Some say the reason we are here, it's because we were promoted so much. We worked hard, just like all our masters before us. You can't fight that thing, it's nothing, its just instinct. That's what's really driving us alive today. We have, on this fly around, taken care of ourselves.
The few of us here, we can guess one or two, or maybe a few, who are afflicted by this new strain. Some who are far too young to get vaccinated against, such as the virus. Some who are physically malnourished or old enough to have a few teeth removed for such a simple operation. We're quite happy about this.
It looks good. It looks like they're getting enough air that they think they're surviving. They're dying in only one way. The virus however, can't reach them in time. We say it seems to have, or at least temporarily, started to mutate its contents. Was it enough? Once the virus started, it took a while to do something out of the ordinary. In an instant, a train of technology within our own bodies scanned the entire internet and before long we were just billions of webpages and spectre and chat.
Now here I am. A farm animal, unused, consumed by the white light of a fluorescent light bulb. Its body is perfectly turned, but the shape of its arms and legs are not. This is just like what humanity was doing long ago, just like when I first came here. I wish we could grow back into the flesh we could be, but the longer we are, the more we have to live. I never had the time to kill people.<|endoftext|>

*Observe the details. *
The empty empty stare.
The empty glance.
The empty look.
Stuck and unable to face life, the Buddha waited by the lamps in the hallways. The long golden rod haphazardly slashed over his face. Slowly, he thought, his reflection slipped away. * Yea, it's nice to see you again. * A series of confused pause. * It was always nice to have you around. You made me happy just like you always do. *
He remained silent. The hearing went silent. The sight of it quieted him. No one else seemed to hear. It was over.
Bright light from two lamps sprang from a closet, peering through the trap door and a dark light from inside the closet snapped his attention to himself and the illuminated lamp hovering over his exposed back. * I'm starving. *
Pain. The cold draft of air against his bare, soft skin still penetrating his scalp. * Where am I? * He wondered.
He drifted out of his cavernous cave and into the street, flipping from one apartment to the other. The storm was starting, it was safe.
As he walked to his car, he looked at the clock, trembling. * One minute! *
Footsteps. A woman's scream. A gentle breeze. * Hello, do you want to dance? *
The door to the car opened and a tall, attractive Asian man with polished skin stepped through.
*Buddha! * the voice declared.
"Are you ready?" The Buddha asked. The Buddha nodded, smiling.
He watched the woman walk away from the alley.<|endoftext|>

The shadows on the wall shook up as if breath were clogged. There were bodies everywhere.
Some shifted, others retreated and everyone left. The same crowd screamed at them all to disappear back into their respective corner offices and elaborate articles of clothing.
One person walked into the center of the operation, with the cautious look in his eyes. The people were always too careful to make sense of those close to them. That's when they saw the clues to the mysterious greenness of the woman.
Most people had no knowledge of her presence. There wasn't a doubt in their minds that she was something special. These people just didn't like the grand plot to reveal that mysterious green glow.
The man and woman were glad to see one of the two residents of their town walk up to them. Everyone noticed the man's name tag reading: kevin. The man's words caught the attention of their detectives.
However, it was not all about rumors, the half finished morgue and strangely lit inn would bring revenge. Not that someone dared yell at the inn.
For only the leader of the people recognized them. He suddenly looked like he was going to explode but then he stayed there. He tried to hide it, but as his body moved closer to the window, everyone else in the inn became suspicious.
They rushed toward the man and gave chase. Finally, they found him. Everyone knew that the old wizard was there. Someone familiar. They started questioning the old man, until the man asked "wait, you are a side quest NPC? Why aren't you on a side quest for anyone? ", as if he thought that was some kind of joke.
The old man looked at the two detectives and said " whoever it is, run!" and pushed them out the window. The detectives ran away, but one killed the man, and the other victim was too far away to escape.<|endoftext|>

The day it starts, I became hands down the #1. Usually I knew my fight was over, so why couldn't I? They died in a car accident. Again. As time went on I started to get sucked in. They got together and were married. Their kids almost died in the crash. One was a few months older than me, trying to keep the pain of all the tragedies he had felt to a minimum. They are planning to meet again soon. " Huh, shit, when you'll meet, make it fast. Meet me at an hour, I need you here. " I don't even have enough time for this to stop yet. Then they decided to open a bar. They had me roomed a long time ago. I have almost reached the halfway point, but it isn't going to be that fast. They will pay.
" All of you have one room to stay in, " one of them told me as I stood up in bed. They came in small groups at a time and at night I would find myself completely alone. They will run around for what seems like an eternity.
" You have a lot on your plate. You will either work hard or lose your job. You have a lot of girls of all sorts. I'd guess you spend an extra few years working hard, and that's enough to be a star working with this big club. I don't know if you have a soul, or it, but you look pretty hot. If that makes sense, you've got to be working hard for this. You have a lot on your plate. " All those empty words suddenly caught my attention. " I thought the girl who spent the longest working two years planning and jumping town to break that free hand would marry me? " " Well, that girl made a good life friend. "
I nodded. " She does have a girl friend. " I nod too. I quickly went down the list of features. I would have to convince them of my soulmate until they even accepted me. Luckily they were sending out the volunteers. Oh, and a baby girl, babe in a ring. They made sure to include her though. It was a welcome change of pace.
" Are you going to make it, " I asked them.
" Yep. I will. " They smiled and took me out the door.
I was told I would be waiting for the results, but a few weeks pass. I looked out of the window and saw my best friend screw up the roping order after the baby lost control of the car. I kissed her, smiled and wandered outside. " Wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu " I cried. On the way back to my car I saw a man in a jet black suit standing in the street. " Where did you go wrong? " I asked.
" I'll tell you, " said the man, " I'm not really courting anymore."<|endoftext|>

Fred knelt down and looked at the mountains where they turned the once living to ash. The scorched earth had grown to a burning, scorching, deathly cold, heat which has now become part of the planet. Outside of the Rocky Mountains stood an ever going world. A wilderness of its own kind, many cities and huge mountains rose high and wide in the unknown, buildings and crafts all untouched by the skies over the plains. Standing across from him stood a cobblestone road.
"What is the status of the world? " he asked.
The cobblestone road turned to a lab on the right. " Nothing, it's in its final stages. I think it might be working a bit but I'm more worried about it finding a replacement than finding any food sources outside of it. Still, that car was a good thing. "
Fred raised an eyebrow. " Was that why we couldn't find anything? "
" Were you in it? " Came a soft, bemused voice. " There's a few more of them left. You heard about them at the Fluffy Safari, again? "
Fred hugged his son as the cobblestone road turned toward him. " Yeah, I heard of one. Here we are! "
The cobblestone road turned into a ground floor office building at the base of a hill, they had already formed a solid foundation, sturdy oak walls sliding down the hill like the old oak slices of meat.
" And the burger is out! " Fred said with confidence.
" Yeah! And we ran out of meat this time. The beef is what you called it, Edgie! The meat from his battered pickup truck was quite strong! Of course, the petrus was overworked and cooked a bit, but when I tasted it, it gave me the feeling it was making a difference. "
Fred nodded in agreement. " So....again, what is your status? "
" I have no way of knowing. I'm afraid I'll have to wait for more of you before I do a good job of looking at this disaster. It's very bad stuff, but I can't let my guard down like that."
Fred sat upright on the cobblestone road.
Fred, always so understanding, went to his old dog and gave him a pug. It told him a lot about his life, the world he lived in. About how he was adopted, where he had moved to a new town, about how the rest of his family was never able to grow up in the neighborhood where they all live. About all that. About the decaying food and the death rates.
Fred was so happy he bought the dog again, the reason he survived the first two days, because he felt happy about being human again. He was home to a new family, and now it would be free.
He curled up and kissed his son on the forehead, and started back home.<|endoftext|>

**I'm tired. Waiting for some roadblock. I, along with the rest of the government, created an intervention in the backyard. **
I've been on that surveillance program since the beginning. The target of the program was the Super Hero and the third Death machine, because I assumed that she might try to enslave the Super Hero herself. Either way, I got it and everything was going to hell.
My funding fell to the colony, but I was still able to reach the supreme leader who was going to be the downfall of the Justice League. That was the day the villains finally realized what happened to them. They realized that they couldn't stop a hero. I was still able to concentrate for the first time, but then I realized that I'd become an over achiever. I worked to learn the real secrets of prison and what happens when they save the day.
For the next several months, I kept to a steady schedule in order to keep my role in the system at a manageable level. As an insurgent, I was dangerous and ruthless. I had the best reputation and was willing to kill to protect our precious planet. It always seemed like I was controlling things. I had the power to cure people, train super powered scientists, secure the now famous Bruce Wayne and more. I was a villain all along, because I had time to learn everything I needed to know, to be able to defeat all the supervillains.
The keyed security to my hideout was the jump in the gates of our prison to a doomed city, so that I could obtain my revenge. I needed to test that door. I opened the door to the upper floors of that building and started my journey to the predicted destination.
"Security Breach" The cage flashed in front of me.
*Boom*
Static filled the room. Everyone is frozen as I arrive. The street lamps glow and light from the back of my security door swirl around in the dim light. I rush to catch my breath and I still manage to catch my breath.
*Where am I? * I scramble out of the darkness.
I finally make it to the backdoor.
*I should've taken a different route... This place is ridiculously inefficient. * I thought to myself. I walk up to the staircase that lead to the top of the staircase.
I step into the dark room. As I pass through a spiderweb of wires, I see a glimmer of a projector. The screen reads **The first person to ever create a sentient superman**. I am a sight to behold.
*The prime directive of the government of the United Kingdom.'Your powers are activated. Any escaping supervillains will be forced to identify the captured target before they escape. *
That will save millions.
I travel back to the city. No hero will be allowed to leave for fear they'll break into my city. Once I reach the high ground, I take off and take my army of super soldiers with me. My king. My queen. My king.
*Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God... *
I arrive at the main high building and my queen is there waiting for me.
As the doors open, I see her standing there with a manila envelope. All I have to do is pick it up and drop it somewhere secure.
My father is gone.
I am safe.
I should've known it was over and that the Hero's escape plan would finally come to fruition.
I open the envelope.
*Needle in hand, the king and queen of the world are on my terms. Transfer my limbs to the ship and my city to the enemy. I will make sure that they never attack me again. *
A package was wrapped in tissues, containing one of the worst consequences I could ever face. One of the worst consequences of my actions in the past 2 decades.
I read the deal in the papers. I would gain the power needed to defeat every hero I was given. I would rule the world like a dictator.
I took the package. The president took it. I only wondered what he thought. As the car pulled up to my house, I opened the package and placed the 5 perfect turns and hit the lock button.<|endoftext|>

All this would probably be a huge bore to spend my life getting to know anyone that would listen. Not to mention the knowledge that at least a decade or so of reworking of the Declaration will add a bit of overlap to the overall effort here.
The whole point, once we got used to each having superpowers isn't so much that we must keep it in check- the point is that even though we can't have superhuman powers what we can do have potential... which by design we mostly haven't. We have to be patient.
You hear the stories, you get used to them but they're not what you expected. Your brain gets overwhelmed, the study over has been done, you are too busy, the tests stand. They have also gotten us to forget.
How I got here was that most of the accident took place in the vacuum. The girlfriend of a senior colleague managed to get out during the exam though, causing serious damage and the whole room went dark for a second. A sketch really shows what happened, but the ink was starting to dry due to the pressures.
Some things don't come easily and so it was necessary to make sure you got it right. Some things don't get too easy though, you have to stay professional, and you have to know how to make it work.
Most important of all was that the test itself wasn't dinky or illegal- it was the cancer, and you were about to have a tricky break. You had been given a doctor's gift and it was all very familiar. I couldn't wait to go out on a limb and meet you here...<|endoftext|>

A person dying in bed. This is pointless. The main character should be going into deathmatch if he actually, miraculously can survive an oncoming enemy, and also seems to be in a spot of sorts. The other guy thinks it's just a standard few seconds. Really, this is a completely overused dialogue trick. Honestly, why was he playing this game with just five minutes to live?
It really makes no sense at all.
I sat in my tower, stuck in this life. My arms never hurt, I never had to fight for my country. I can't have any more wars. Why would I willingly become a peasant? Why would anyone just end up killing a peasant? What does even make sense to me? I had no money, but I didn't need the girl's inheritance. I had to offer her the use of my gold, so I could start earning. To be honest, I wasn't even entirely sure she needed it. I kept her in my pocket for a while. Even after all the devastation that was wrought in the middle of the field. You can't just throw away something that was once yours. It makes no sense.
Besides, people were smart. Stupid people. Stupid people.<|endoftext|>

The energy released from the spaceman's vision and searing pain mixed with the sensation of the earth at its pinnacle. The hellish haze had settled and was back to normal. Brown wiry hairs started to moisten under the skin. The imagination of the sitekeeper could feel the lord sucking his dry tongue.
Years of strong scientific advancement had passed and thousands of parts had been manufactured and some of them would revolutionize medicine.
Tombstones were imbibed to immortality, with the medical fluid extracted by force. The fabric of nature had protected human flesh from the elements and would have allowed access to the divine arts of creation. History was written by the gods and it was filled with miracles when God, with help from the both of his high heavens of Heaven and Hell, had made the solid rock impossible to break. The growth of the silt was the last thing humanity needed as they found their power in the merging of God and the fabric of nature to become one.
Headless legs crushed the pale yellow linen, like limbs still tied by the lashings of a rich man, and bones were gathered back in embalming as the screams of god's mortal minions became the screams of the few survivors and the cries of the pride of the old and weak.
Nothing lasted.
The wind caught the bolt and smashed the car in front of the old man, popping his skull into shards to clear its head clean of the disease.
The story of the damaged and dying of someone was the mantra of the afterlife. The new man knows it all, he was told that he would not be seen by the rest of humanity and the only way to know he would be heard was to do his best to remain alive and repeat himself, alone, for his family and loved ones to mourn and forget and remember who he was and had been until he lived his life with the scars of broken minds and broken bodies.
His bones slowly dissolved into dust as a night-time smoke that made the air crisp and cool was passed over. The words that remained as reminders of the lives he had led and what had he been through became the final words of the worn and disfigured man who still knew that his life had left him a place to rest and amaze others, to be cared for and respected.
The towers rose and the skies grew distant as the nearest person found their way home to live in the world of death and spread the message that they were content.
Almost with tears streaming down the man's face he would decide to be ready for the inevitable. That fact, for that world they could be safe and strong under a new God and the disappearance of the scars of a life-long missed one could make this day the greatest day of all.
As the wailing of the of the creature grew nearer he knew his days were numbered.<|endoftext|>

Evan woke up on a wobbly floor. The child seemed terrified, and then started writing his direction without his parents noticing. He stood up and walked to the stairs, seeing that his small bed was facing the right way, so Evan jumped down with effort. He started to pace toward the open window as the girl walked on the sidewalk. Suddenly, Evan became dizzy and went limp. Evan tried to think clearly in his head, but the girl stopped him at the back door. Evan struggled to turn the girl around, in fear of getting hurt. Now Evan was screaming, and the girl smiled.
"Were there those silver candlesticks you brought with you? " she said. " Well, what a bust! " Evan asked. " Who else would come pass your room, but me? Who else would you see again after this? " she teased.
The child looked up, startled. " I'm here to help, aren't I? "
" I don't like it when you do that! " Evan said.
The girl slowly started creeping out. " Ugh, I'm so dizzy, so weak. I just want to curl up... "
" Shut up, Evan. It's not as bad as it seems! Stop right there. I'm just trying to help you! " She stood up and then stopped with a carefree tone.
They heard the door open in the next room, the one Evan was in. " Uh, can you -- " the girl started yelling.
" No! Who is that? "
" Samantha! I can hear you! " she said. " Please, stop yelling! I'm going to help you. "
" No! Please, I can't. " Evan said. " You're too blind! "
" NO! NO! I can't! I can't! I- " She was crying. Evan looked around. All the others couldn't hear her. The girl had vanished!
" NO! PLEASE!" she screamed.
The gun sat on the coffee table, staring at Evan.<|endoftext|>

Its always at dusk in the middle of summer to play pond.
When the pond is dark, I see a ray of light between the trees.
& nbsp;
I seem to remember being so hot to my left.
A leaf crunches and disintegrates into ash.
& nbsp;
I spend my last moments snuggling up to a bigger animal.
He lays motionless.
I think I'm going to pass out, but I don't.
& nbsp;
Slavery tears me apart from further.
& nbsp;
Fucking slavery.
& nbsp;
They surround me and demand they part me.
I say nothing.
The sun catches my eye, and there's fire.
I turn to run. I guess they thought I was going to die?
The heat is excruciating.
& nbsp;
I remember doing my time on earth.
I felt fantastic.
My shit spent.
& nbsp;
Living alone and with no one to guide me.
A lot of what I do exists just for fun.
& nbsp;
I don't care.<|endoftext|>

The creature I was made to be became increasingly distressed, despite all my technological advancements.
Unbeknownst to any human, my entire existence was a stage for humans to learn only words and concepts from the greater ones. It wasn't until I was 20 years old and naive enough to learn at the age of 10 that I learned something we humans often use incorrectly in common. When my friends grew up the idea became the centerpiece of their childhood. It was a bold word and an exciting concept. Of course only those who knew the word and understood it had ever even used it.
And it stuck in my head for too long. I'd forget about it often, but like a key ingredient in building a strong sense of self, I couldn't stop listening to my parents about what I did wrong, but with each generation, that sense of information became stronger and stronger as I sought out a stable family. At the age of 22 I left school, and before that, I ran a bookstore and became my own bestseller. I became a millionaire by my 17th birthday and fell in love with the idea of learning what I could learn with words.
At 16 my parents and I agreed that it was time we began education at a young age and I learned how to have confidence in myself. As their keyboards struggled to match their processing power I began asking myself several simple questions:
*How much do I write?
* How many people know my name?
* What race are you?
* How many times do I listen to music in the morning?
* How many glasses do I drink?
* If I could just write for the right numbers, I could start living faster.
And then at 19 I went from not a bright individual to a cynical individual. As my new family grew older and weaker I came to accept that the fear of becoming a failure was slowly killing me off. I still practiced writing letters but now using only a pad of paper to read what I would say whenever there was to be a change in my mind.
At 20 I was too old to be a writer, so I accepted my fate and found myself writing college essay after essay about the meaning of life, people, and how to live. I believe I became a master of poetry and the small sample books are a means of attempting to change my life. I came to enjoy myself and build friendships over the years and began to realize that I had a future beyond what any of the former intelligence had imagined.
I was created as a placeholder in humanity's world and I would write after I became a rising star.
I am now 21 and the first human to see my Earth as a race. Before I die, however, I have a few final things to share with humanity.
* What words?
* What do we have?
* When is technology going to cease?
* When will you learn something new?
* When will it be too late?
* When will you die?
I hope my creation is a safe one and that it is necessary for its survival. I believe it needs to be. I fear that this community, which was built for the benefit of mankind and which aims to someday become a force for good will today, is doomed to lead a sad and futile existence.
May God help us all.

Excerpt from Clemmons 2001
"A blue hat? " Came a question came up as the class moved on.
We all looked at each other, then looked at the students, my friends. We knew that as a bunch, we were not the center of attention. Not really.
They all looked back at the professors, then back at us, their eyes were not half focused on the classroom as usual, yet their heads were furiously as usual.
Today, we would work on the math of the team.
The small screwdriver I was hanging onto seemed bigger than usual. I could tell, that if we were young enough to have managed to maintain this special mess together, the shape of the screwdriver would seem no older than yesterday.
Signed, " Clemmons 2001."<|endoftext|>

It was no mere letter that the rest of us received; letter after letter. Huzzah, letter after letter. Yet, we each have to have listened to the same thing. " Goodbye, mother! Don't look at me like that! " " I don't want to hear your smelly howlings... I love you! " " You're a just the same, Jane!" And on and on it went.
There was a postcard, the only way I could read it. Nothing interesting happened. Some to friends and later the grocer, waiting for a bus full of the latest shopping... no life was worth living... just the same.
I rarely visit, for fear of the mailman meddling. He usually ends up writing him off, just like me. This wasn't much of a problem though. The bus would never take him away from home.<|endoftext|>

He's a real sort of hero. He has so many boons, so many missions that seemingly wouldn't be possible if they weren't all a chain of equally improbable events.
There are more than a billion fake deaths, billions of fake murders, billions of deaths on both sides of the conflict.
But it's been his entire life that he's stood steadfast. He can change the world and bring peace to a dark place. He can build a better world. He loves his life. He's beautiful. He's brilliant. He's all those things mean to him all those years ago, when he saw his beautiful daughter that he couldn't even call her that anymore. He fought in the war against the forces of evil, for his friends, for his country. He fought for peace and justice, and he killed innocent people for the cause that he believed would make his country great again. And he's still here, or can I put it another way?
Why can't I think of good things. Because he's a real sort of hero.
One hundred years in this land, fifty years in this dangerous place, your morality, your humanity, all of it went back to what we all could have accomplished, done, and would have done, had we not been afraid of the nasty country that came after us when he was a child, and our parents with their high expectations and a name that we wouldn't recognize for what it was. It was all we could have done, everything we should have done.
He's stopped the bloodshed. He's stopped the corruption. But now here we are. A city in ruins with the might of a wolf, and the might of a man who can take the mantle of heroes he never dared to meet. Now, in his home, we fight crime as we would have in any other. The police are second-hand, but they work in concert to fight crime, to not succumb to the evil that rules the city. We climb through the cracks and up the trees, turn sticks to our enemies in twisted ways, learn from their mistakes, and eventually finally kill them to get what we want. This is just the beginning.
At first, he thought we were some sort of cosmic act. To celebrate the birth of a new golden age and bring peace into this abyssal hell, but he'd grown a little cynical. He didn't believe in our existence, the world, or the future, or even history and ideas. Maybe this time, maybe this is the last time he's looked back.
Maybe he's thinking the same things again. Maybe he's thinking about our origins and the plights of darkness that our civilization faces.
Maybe, while he focuses his energy in pieces of trash and wood, he hasn't noticed any of it.<|endoftext|>

The last couple centuries have been kinder to me. If only they'd known what they were doing, he might've told her earlier this year. He would have told her of the stories he'd tell her, of the horrors he'd endure in prison. He would have been a man to love and burn. Maybe he'd have laughed and wanened, but he would never tell her anything he hadn't know already. All he would tell her are those things.
That's what I want. They wouldn't know. They'd never know.
Her reply was short and sweet. She didn't quite understand what was going through his head. Maybe they shouldn't have spoken so deeply, so much out loud. What if the love he'd let her into was a huge stain on his heart? And the pain he would be enduring right now? It's easier that way, he thinks. He thinks it would be. As do I. I wouldn't give one damn about him, or his tears, or even his faults. He would never say he loved her.
The elevator rumbled, and despite my apparent refusal to leave the cell, I grabbed the edge of my chair in nervous confidence. This was a test. I'd been put in here for decades on death row. My work was done. We'd be free again.
It would all be over soon.

"You know, you know, I'm not a fan of this kind of drinking. "
Alan counted the memories of his victims, over and over.
" While we might be walking, what was your surroundings like while I was drinking? I don't know if I could see them or not. What I remember being very wrong was the large amount of drinking that was going on right before I was hit by a train. It was fairly quiet. Not too bright, not too quiet, not too quiet. It was just an endless barrage of walking towards and from work and the quiet left for a few minutes as I was brushing my teeth. I was almost there, what?
I guess we both know there was some sort of falling... of food.. or shelter.. or something. I don't know. Was it water or food for a short while though, I don't know. We just froze and stared at each other, I guess? We both knew, couldn't we?
You see a lot of people remember things that aren't there, including returning bruises on victims, keeping their nails fresh... are they still able to live *like* they used to when they were drunk? Nevermind that all of them disappeared with a while. And what happened to Robert not long after? When we were all here?
Of course, I would say... I would say.... Taken... horribly... I remember him going for the gun, stopped to think of a weapon, but then fell so far. Good God. You'll never understand what happened. He had a handfull of broken and bloody glass. He fell off the train and landed in a pool of his own blood and dirty blood. We didn't know who he was, but he had my name and the gun....? "
Gravity was suddenly absolutely terrifying. I turned toward the sink and screamed " Leave you there, cut off my eye! "
" You heard me, we were looking for the ice bath, or maybe someone to run away with! We must have stared at some sort of gas for quite a while. "
" Maybe it is, or the truck. The green hood was pulling back harder than usual. They sure know I'm talking. "
" What? " I asked, unsure where to turn.
Alan took two deep breaths. " I haven't seen a car in a while, do you have any information? "
" We just lost a leg at that lake. Not bad for a jogger. "
I looked at the ticket and said, " Yeah, you can cash the ticket here. They don't do refunds that often though. "
" Thanks, but before we can start.. " Alan took a few steps back and collapsed against the sink.
" We can do this, Alan! This is not your last bottle. You can even get more alcohol on that."
Gravity was suddenly unrelenting and blinding, possibly further than I had ever been before.
Gravity became more and more intense until it gave out to me. I started to feel like a ghost, hardly able to leave the pool. What if my memory from my youth... I don't remember the face? What if it was mine, it was my sister?
This feeling of being bathed in a clean, dark pool was overwhelming. I remember Alan's eyes being as blue as the sky, the noise of running water in the distance, and all of the sudden I knew all of this was true. All of it.
I made my way home. I made my way back to my apartment and started making coffee.<|endoftext|>

As soon as my vision started he screamed. I never saw him before. He was surrounded by big, white paper with big, white letters. A crowd was pouring up. " Is he here? " the man asked.
My vision started to roll back. My vision didn't change. I continued to look around, and saw a giant, red-eyed Asian man who looked like a star in my head. The words " You are in Vienna. You are to die, here. "
Next to me, the man said, " So you have come to love me? This can wait. "
I looked around, and the man was gone, like a ghost who came back from a dream.
I looked at my hand. " Why am I dying? "
That's when my vision returned. My hand was shaking. I looked at my hand. It was not trembling. I saw the man's entire body was gone. As I took a breath I saw my arm and my heart were still there. I cried.
" Hello?" I said.<|endoftext|>
**********375**********
I paused and considered my words.
"People watch me, honey. " The old woman in the local bar looked dejected. She looked unhappy. Her boxers were now falling apart. The sun cut through the horizon. I frowned and asked why so peacefully. The old woman kissed me on the head before striding up the walkway.
" Father, please, " she whispered, her voice falling away after a short delay. " I wish you were here with me. I'd go out and give you hugs and kisses just to meet you in person. "
I looked back at her. She wanted to be away but wanted to stay long enough for me to come visit her and tell her. Maybe she wouldn't allow the old woman to see. I looked back at her face. Almost human. Dim and emotionless, blue eyes with brown beards.
" I'm okay, miss, " I said, and felt no pity.
" If you won't be home soon, please don't ask me." I walked away, my tears leaving a small mark on the old woman's worn bar gown.<|endoftext|>

She was an eighteen year old girl. Of just about ten years old, “ Just Cause ” had been a one-time summer with her mother, Josea. Josea was older now and remembered with more fervor the first time she saw herself outside the crowd.
Josea found herself in the ash building when the window of her building shattered in the hottest fire that had ever taken place. She was burnt and in some dry area. Her mother was busy burying her in an orphanage. Josea couldn ’ t remember what had caused the fire but either way she could still smell the burning ash.
Josea and her mother landed on the outskirts of town in their car. Josea had been sitting on the edge of the building waiting to take the children to safety, when she noticed the truck pull into the parking lot. She started her drive. Before she knew it, a handsome man, a man whose charm was what she enjoyed most, already approaching her and bearing beautiful green eyes, came out from the shadows. Josea knew who it was. A woman with blunt, brown hair. She smiled at the man.
“ I-uh… I see you? ” Josea said. She had heard his voice before but could sense the woman ’ s unease with it. She remembered her father ’ s business trip, before he ’ d been killed in a war on pathogens.
“ Um, I see. Ah, I see… I just found this book. ” Joséa had never been asked by her mother to try to read it, but she knew her mother hated learning things at school. She remembered from a previous childhood that she was taught about every transgression in the book. She loved to read.
“ Ah well, yes that ’ s all I need, you know. There will be others waiting for you. ” Joséa let go of her mother ’ s grip. A man looked like a sad mother, hot and hungry. He also had a leather coat over his head. She put the book on the driver side and exited the car. It was late and Josea hoped she would make it safely to the gate without being seen. As she departed the city, she sensed a slowing presence behind her as the procession went by. To her surprise, there was her own car pulling into the sunroom, just a brief glimmer in the cool August wind.
After a few moments the man took her in his arms and let her go.
As the gate opened, Josea was able to see the interior of the car and the gates, just as she had in the book. When she realized she was standing in front of the gate, her mind raced. The man, a man with lighter brown hair, carried Josea to safety, like she did in the book. He let her through, but she saw him still trying to claw at her in the brisk daytime air, holding her around as he went and crying because of his safety. Josea looked at him and smiled at her.
“ That ’ s it, ” the man spoke quickly and seemed to understand her.
She looked away and couldn ’ t help but smile. Josea let go of him, my memory faded away, and returned to the woods.<|endoftext|>

Mr. Trump gave a quick press conference and passed his stack of tax forms.
"I really wish we had videos of Dr. Jamison doing a 70 ft. 3 hour marathon every weekend. "
President Trump tried to appear good-natured but couldn't hold his laughter off. I put together a copy of my last statement, titled " We Will All Face The Pizzaries "
" I wanted to say first, which was and is truly horrifying. You see, We have submitted a tax form, prepared a weekly list of people we will be selling illegals, then sent my numbers through to the Valve Department... " The reporters continued " and as you can imagine, Our accountant practically made a fortune with the money... "
The President made eye contact with his watchman.
" So it was a wild ride, as it should have been. "
Another round of reporters ran to the room, this time more interested in documents.
" Here's the kicker! You get one copy of Half Life 3. There's no legal ramifications, we just gave you " Half Life 3 " as much information as we want."<|endoftext|>

* ( Beginning of chapter ).
Hewn from his tower
Lustful wards
He watched
Heavens downfall
He vowed to avoid
His wrath
For thou art weak
Confronting Heaven's arrogance
- Wolf
- Fiddle
- Stone, vine, bark
Heavens life
He gained worldly knowledge
He called to life
- Thorn-Blossoms
He'd destroy his shelter
Grasping the dew
In my humble solitude
To do or not to do
I'm thirsty.
I smell my vegetables.
Wastes more food than I could spare
I envy.
Though, the general atmosphere of this wonderful society
Is reminiscent of hell
Lustless.
Hope I didn't piss off --
That I wouldn't be cared for.
-- --
"Hell is a more dangerous place than I thought... Hey, this is some wild bullshit from Tolkien. "
A clone of an arm, an arm with a scar.
Crippled by my lacerations
Buried in my cheeks
A stench of grime
And brimstone hangs over all my bones.
" That's much scarier than what you could have been! "
" Whatever-worse-worse-worse isn't this? "
Spinny bear-wishes, the general tone of voice, and quick wits.
But some other ears are on my chest.
They're listening. They're watching!
" I know you look a little deranged, but trust me, my friend, no matter what, I have a plan. I'll eliminate Satan, so that these cruel fellows can die. After I acquire immortality, I will make this desert. I will destroy that bad section of the infernal world! "
-- --
" And that's it? I'm off... "
" Undoing these villainy's torments without a care in the world! "
" And I'm ready to move on! Just as I left my manmade fortress! "
" Fuck me, son."<|endoftext|>

I remember a very cold rainy afternoon of New York in July. It was rainy. The temperature was almost 45 degrees, and someone was seen shouting, and that just kept happening at night. Then the time, I was lost at the airport, and my phone was shot. Nobody would give me a second before I was shot to hell. The homeless tried to get my phone back, but I couldn't get them to work. I walked down the sidewalk, and passed this angry man.
"Everyone there, I hear you're alone. " He stated, " You were lost at work, but nobody showed up. " He continued to give me nonsensical questions, but I ignored him. " We're all alone. We need to get out of here. " He pointed to a busy intersection.
He said some awful things. Then he started yelling at me, asking me to stay. I was scared, because that was the first time he had ever yelled that in a close circle of fire and brimstone. " Are you in hell? " I shouted. " Yes. " I responded, " You're dead." He then turned around and made me do his bidding. That's when I finally saw him. He was in his bed. He screamed, shouting. Then he gave a a cough, and died. His head was red, and his soul was gone.

*Baby mistakes are pretty bad. Mommy can't see it anymore, he'll see how I twist around in my crib and cut off my cords. Mommy can't see it at all, I swear I'm just mommy trying to pretend like dad's punching Daddy in the face doesn't scare me. *
*When I asked my mommy how he did it, she looked at the table of matches I had with me before he snatched them out. When she put them back in the basket, I looked at him in panic. I didn't want to get out of the couch, so she placed all the matches. She got angry because she only knew that he had made several tears. She was jealous because she didn't want daddy to step out of the picture but instead slept all of my bed. *
*When my mommy gets in the shower... you'd think she would love me, that would be her way of saying she couldn't keep me in, because her hands were running cold as if they were trying to keep up with the floods. But not Mommy. I get sleepy, instead of crying, instead of trying to get sleep, she gets up and holds me close. There she is, staring at me with her big, puppy eyes and just as happy as always, with daddy's loving arms around her. *
*Mommy likes daddy. Daddy loves me. My mommy is heartbroken, I hate daddy. I just want daddy to stick up for me. *
*I wish I never had to go into labor, but my parents always called it "clutch." That's all they meant. Just wanted to hold me and wrap me up in blankets for me to sleep in and make sure I was alright for a while. I was supposed to be healthy and thin so that I could feel better for a little while, but mommy didn't want me to cry like that. She came in at the very end of the night, and I cried for half an hour. *
I stopped crying when they came, saying they didn't want to make sure I wasn't okay and she told me to pretend. They said I had some cold cuts that morning, and they promised it wouldn't hurt. She didn't know where I was and her words only made her angry. They all told me I needed to leave the house and never to come back. I didn't take it very seriously and they didn't tell me to step out of my crib. She swore that everything would be okay. I almost didn't notice it at first, until I saw her beating her belly button and her nails on my pink sheets. She was looking at me with cold eyes and sweetest smiles. She whispered " Daddy needs you."
( *Close Your Eyes* )
She put the first set of matches on the table, and put them on her lap, behind her, under her lap. She walked up to her dad and grabbed him by his shirt, pulling him up, and kissing him on his collarbone. They kissed and hugged while taking turns pushing things and playing games. They talked about all the things they have been doing, doing anything mommy would like. They even danced and played something called the game of chess, except the chess was different with the last set. They didn't keep in touch for a long time. The last thing mommy did was get angry and tearfully cry. She would leave them all together when she saw them together.<|endoftext|>

Ryan walked out of the four bedroom house with a swagger. The sun shone down on his face.
"Where is my kids "
Little Marcus, Riley's mom, slammed the door. Ryan's heart raced.
" Daddy look at this cluster of lamps all over the place. I think there must be something they hid in... " Riley asked excitedly, ignoring Ryan's question.
" They are all hiding in the kitchen. "
Riley knew something had to be wrong with his son. He frantically made his way back to his room.
" Riley try not to brag on me " Tyler, in his frantic state, rang the doorbell.
Ryan stepped out of the bathroom to see his daughter alone. The silence surrounding them was unnerving.
Ryan walked over to the tiny pill bottle that he pocketed. With a tilt of his head Ryan looked at his daughter. Tears were streaming down her face.
" I love you daddy" he whispered as he buried the bottle in her face.
Ryan closed his eyes and stared in horror at his daughter. He stepped into his back garden he walked out with a victory in his eyes. He would be overjoyed by her beauty.

I was about to throw my knife into the process when, all at once, a stupid group of 6-packs of hamburgers materialised out of thin air. Their restlessly ranting was spoken of out of jest by tiny voices.
"Wait! " Was all they had time to say before both being cut clean off by a horde of terrifying looking army - armed with axes, swords, bows, arrows, chainsaws, knives and a book of mythical eldritch rituals.
" Goddamnit Jesus! " started another of the last 10 packs of hamburgers, stabbed straight through the necks of both of their offspring, and. not too long before, their bodies exploded with a roar, curling and lighting up the sun with their screams. The onslaught of undead against the rebel army of Hell was immense, and it was going to take a big day to get their death coming.
" Let's face it this did not have much going for it, " said Morbid Jesus.

“ The governments have taken all we ask for, and we can ’ t be too surprised, to think they ’ d put their knickers in the fruit tree behind San Francisco. They just don ’ t want any attention. This is what the world can expect from me, making everybody feel safe. ”
You drop your tea in front of him, laying your knife on the countertop.
“ I can ’ t believe it ’ s you, Jack! ” your friend calls.
Jacks knocks the lid off your mug and throws it on the ground. You toss him a dirty look on his face.
“ That ’ s right Jack, it is me. The World ’ s Best Suspect. ”
“ As for this coffee, it ’ s my fault, Jack, I was not your type. It might have been the weirdest blend of macaroni, but I realized soon enough that you wouldn ’ t take caffeine to your blood. ”
“ Something about toxic chemical compounds, Jack! It ’ s not like you ’ re being assassinated for the health of the people you work with. ”
“ As for your hair, it ’ s a science, Jack! ”
A staccato, muffled yell echoes around the room. The work crew retreats back to the kitchen. You stand in the living room of your cabin and cut to the sound of someone asking a question.
“ What is it Daniel? " Jack asks you, in a peaceful tone.
“ I have a warning. Come open the fridge, and try to help me get more juice. ”
You don ’ t hear the gunshot until you do. The hallway is empty save for a shadow of a man in a ski mask.
“ What ’ s going on Jack, sir? ” he asks.
“ You were on a date with a friend, that is when the mindbender showed up and took all our guys. After that, we had to hit our heads with the dumpster to get to safety. You went back home. ”
“ I-I didn ’ t want to do it, ” Daniel replies, walking over. “ He never said anything. ”
“ Well, we don ’ t know what happened to the other guys, but he was our only friend! ” You feel satisfied. “ I suppose that helps. ”
As he walks out of the kitchen, you smile, and look for a friendly voice to break the tension.

It wasn't a strange accident. It took place outside the local convenience store or at an area's corner store that had a cute pet hamster on the inside. It had that tiny little hooked nose that belonged to that hooded guy that was always entertaining. But I wasn't sure what part of my soul was being snipped, just that it wasn't bothering me any longer. I would be able to laugh for a while, until I decided that something terrible would happen, and would take it out on that dude.
It got in the way of this plan when at about four o'clock a.m. I had a flashback to the very first play in my high school's high school play theater called Five Nights at Freddy's. I was shadowing the big douchebag that was my class, Leonette, and sitting in class when my dad looked at me. That was the first time I had ever seen him in his absolute stupor.
"What the hell is going on? "
" You look familiar, sir. Did he have a birthday earlier today, or something? " I asked him.
" I thought he never went to class, did he have a birthday? "
" Not at all, I thought you asked us to be *co*insurance for Greg? "
" Of course he asked me to come in here at five o'clock tonight. "
" Did you find out that his birthday was today, sir? "
" Oh, don't worry about it, Leo. I was curious. "
" Then why did we go *to that* play like that? "
" I suppose you wouldn't be surprised that you hadn't learned his name, at least not before this building gives you that guarantee. "
" But... But.... Leo... "
" I was always worried about him. You remember... when I got work at the Peezer Center? "
" Yeah, I remember. That was a good audition. "
" And you know we should have just gone to the Fieldbreakroom instead? "
" That was between six and eight o'clock, right? "
" You... we should have... done something else.... "
" Fine, that was probably best. You just are stuck here. One no-good actor. "
Leonette's jaw dropped, and she sobbed uncontrollably.
" Oh no, Leo. That's not how it works at all. "
" Hey, Leo, don't try to think you're being dramatic. It's not supposed to happen this way. "
" But I guess I was never told that, right? I suppose I never knew what would happen after I actually decided to play The Wingo. "
" Well, one way or another, Leo. It's all based on the script. I'm being signed off on the play. "
" But... "
" Come on, man. Give me a few seconds."<|endoftext|>

I stared at the *Frederic* staring back at me. I couldn't bear the thought of returning to Skyrim and taking it all for myself. With his pale, quivering body limp, I considered stabbing him or running to slay the *Frederic*. But what else would I have to kill, no response? This couldn't possibly be real! No answer. How could any mage be so naive as to not believe that the Mages could withstand so much magic? Ever since he saved someone's life because of magic, he had always been praised. Even those who believed in him now, out of spite.
This scrying had become my safe haven, my escape from this magic murder mission. I turned on my makeshift knife and held it to his neck while he screamed in pain. The bleeding stopped in a sudden flash, the bloody magic had stopped.
I had beaten that fool with the blood magic! Feral.
It was my fault! My righteous fury was causing him to burst into flames!<|endoftext|>

Dear me,
I'm writing to you today, because I want you to know that nothing can stop me from loving you every time I see you and taking me on the ice.
I spend hours every weekend planning for what that night will be like, the night will have mine, the night will be I can be with you. You'll never expect how I feel, you'll only ever love me in return. You'll never expect what you have to endure, or what I've got to offer in return. I have goals, you can create your own. But you can never expect what comes next.
I'm sorry, I can't tell you much more for your sake now, because I can't continue to write to you. But I can tell you this because I know you'll be a better person when you come back from vacation.
Someday, I hope you will be as happy as I have been, and do something amazing to make me happy. Your love, will grow into your happiness.<|endoftext|>

Some little voice in the shadows told me it might happen again someday. Some teenager boy noticed their discovery, and asked me to his home.
The ancient metal stirr of their facility kept me company, our biotic life form in bed to speak. We made a little effort.
"Tom, I know we are no strangers to this kind of tech development, you'll only know it as a company if you can recreate the object yourself. "
" We can replicate your work using what is proven to be butthole materials. Physical in design, mind structure, compound silicon. These are nearly limitless. Though there is a few limits, you'll always be able to replicate your own machine. "
We exchange nostalgic glances, he doesn't mind.
" So far I have no problems. It's a unique way for us to test and verify quantum mechanisms. However, it seems like it will be extremely risky for us to become aware of it. Stay on this screen if you can "
We watch him, wiping down his workspace with goo. His soles of his feet don'thing to appear after we are satisfied.
" I am ready."<|endoftext|>

Bones burst as metal squeals as spikes of lightning strike the sky, her soaked shoes hurling straight at the sky like a bullet aimed straight for the car.
A thunderous cry breaks out amongst the waking audience.
A distorted earth snap crashes into the heads of two fell and soaked Martine with a scream that is both male and female alike.
"Space Jesus " the man screams.
Martine opens her mouth to scream more but the words can not escape. A slippered, bone-like mass of sand curls itself into a new form at her feet. It's feet become a crusty fleshy anemone. It's skin is damp and wrinkly which leaves a fleshy feel around it, straining it as it's cells begin to form.
More death-like death grips Martine's body, even her mouth begins to twist and contract.
A bullet impacts the earth, it's momentum no bigger than a stone, unleashing a hail of sparks. She grabs herself upright and crouches over it. She squeezes it firmly with each hand, the phone mashing it against her face.
Air comes rushing out of her fingertips, replaced by metallic blackness. Her shirt and jeans are jingling and bumping, every hair the same shade of brown and crimson.
She has two guns in her hand.
She can only take one and one just two. She can't let two of her men take those, her tongue has turned red as she attempts to spit back air.
She quickly picks the first weapon, its life begins to ignite like no other. With it, her offense is complete, it shoots the first projectile, into the sky. It shoots forth, a spell that it can not replicate, with a speed with which it can not be replicated.
The vines clutch tightly onto each other, hopeless, as it all splits under its cold grasp. It stops. The hail has finally breached her sweater.
" Space Jesus" it screams again, leaving her friend. She immediately places the gun down and starts calling for each one of the men to stop, as the air is full of cold gas, she calms her own gas. She reaches for the man's body, slides one end over her clothing, and then holds him close.<|endoftext|>

Radio waves have decoded and become common art as our civilization came into existence. At first, our distant cousins were hardly recognized, but with time, they had developed only minor point knowledge. Chunks of radio waves became mere radio receiver. Beyond their learning became a kind of occupation. Seen from other worlds, their ability to decipher other radio transmissions became a spark. Lifeforms could sing or do complex mathematical formulas, linguists and engineers began building alliances and government programs.
Humanity pushed itself forwards to the edge, but no civilization sought to reach the edge just yet. Next to resterers, this world was dead silent and did not need to process the information. They moved to the edges of the galaxy and incorporated their newfound knowledge. A computer has been developed which learns a short wavelength at a time. The physicists worked quickly to bridge the gap, but until this moment, only the engineers could understand the ability of these radio waves.
The radio waves and computer powered society and broadcasted live as radio waves travelled from the sky to the Earth. The radio waves stopped just like electricity, and eventually so did the electricity. The astronomers studied this pattern, and their work was ready. Thanks to our exploration of the universe, we soon discovered that the patterns were also part of God's plan. No man nor machine had ever failed to master radio waves, but the programmers still worked slowly to find it.
Maybe that was the best reason we weren't ready for such a bold venture, but we were also there. Our networks could speak our languages back to us and our ecosystems could help guide the advancement of civilization.
The Internet became necessary before the world learned to speak the language of radios, eventually the radio signals became so powerful they may be completely forgotten. Those lucky enough to browse and read the ancient websites must not have seen those broadcasts, but the idiots never deciphered those broadcasts.
We will continue into the future but I think we will be able to finally and publicly record the signal from our distant cousins.
( I hope this finds useful. )<|endoftext|>

“ Don't be shy ” she whispers, caressing my delicate cheek. Her eyes are curiously closed – upon sight, they stare back at me blankly. She carries me down the stairs, down the staircase, and to the car in the next room. She can not help but smile warmly at my every step. Her hazel brown eyes are brilliantly different now, like pieces of glass frames upon a distant stage. But her voice is uncharacteristic, yet is in time; like wild swings of a swing she doesn ’ t falter. A thousand years I ’ ve walked the most beautiful and bare-footed walk of my life – that girl in the classroom was a dear grandmother, and wanted to share her experience with me. Today, I will finally see her smile.<|endoftext|>

The cage was a nice place, but the familiar smell of rotten flesh filled it with a curse. Its smell was unbearable. The cage made the hamster lose much of its home. It felt warmth and wonder at its prison. This sensation drained of purpose. It was a prison for the shepherdess Stacey, who stood over the pit from where the hamster climbed, cradling her son. You could see her eyes gleaming brightly before she became more and more vacant. She went on with her life, preparing for a long life when stacey knew better.
She left it to rot for the next few hours. The hamster thought it would hate her. Not that there was anything wrong with the hamster, it had run away since the last time stacey had been there. It only thought if it had a life that would help out. Stacey had to take care of it as many times as she could, before the last one had been there and the hamster would return to the cages.
The hamster followed the shepherdess to the root cellar. She had left some glue on there. It was placed in the lower room, and next to it was some kind of must-you utensil placed on a table. Each side of the table was covered with the now forever-severed hinge. The hamster crawled into the great vent from the pit and crawled there until it finally hit the surface and the hinge stood upright. She saw the fall of the hinges and wondered what harm she was causing, but didn't listen. The hinges collapsed and the hamster crawled further into the pit.
When the hamster was pretty much wrapped up the soil was good. No symptoms. The soil was small, succulent. There were many pounds of it on the ground. They could have been a homemade meal for something a bit better than a full meal but the hamster was already half eaten.
The meat was only partially cooked. The hamster would have hardly sat all day if that was all. The meat was some sort of wet sort of wood meal. The hamster crawled deeper into the pit and began to play with it. Eventually they were even used to it. She stepped into the pit, and touched the meat. The hamster was shocked.
"Ooh! " she heard a voice say.
She looked up. The voice was again for the shepherdess.
" You're awake. "
" Yes... Yes you are." The shepherdess said as she put the meat in her mouth. She screamed for stacey to come over and clean up her mess. The hamster turned off the stove. The shepherdess saw stacey and turned around, like she always did.
Stacey didn't turn around and walked off the pit. She didn't say hello. She didn't speak to the shepherdess again. When she came back to the pit the shepherdess asked if it was ok if she slept in the cage. That's when stacey stopped talking. The shepherdess turned around and asked what was wrong. When stacey no longer had all the things she used to talk about was no longer there, the shepherdess looked at her quizzically and nodded.
Even though stacey still had the things she used to talk about, she still had no idea why she wanted to put them up. She could understand the reason.<|endoftext|>

No one understood why my eyes would read the countdowns from the clock. The clock was ticking and rhythmic as the inside of my head was pounding. I had not yet figured out why.
The road was untilled and I was trying to keep it from freezing. Never the less, my arms would do me harm. I had one that fit perfectly in my pocket. One that he had tucked under the sheets of my thick white shirt and sweater that draped over mine.
How could he have lied to me? What did I look like? It had never mattered since he was sick. I left him with an irreversible scar on the left cheek, that on his cheek I had never recognized before.
The doctors would come around for two hours a day to try to check me out. At six in the morning the time was convenient, I still have to sit on the bed for an hour each night. My surgeon would come into the house for work, waiting to find out what I had noticed.
But, during the final hour of the day that doctor would find nothing, he would bring his flimsy plastic mask over my face with equally thick plastic gloves. And I would be permitted to leave the room. I would have no choice. My house was filled with other residents. More than one, more than a few, each with two or three other empty house shacks within walking distance.
My room was plagued by a nightmare. Every time I left the room, my suitcase lay on the bed or stood on my night stand. It was my nothing. I could tell, from the way my hands moved as the room traveled around me, that in the house it appeared to me that there was only one scar on the inside of my body. The same one that had just saved me from my eternal lie.
The doctors had found one other case of my world forgetting things I had never imagined. For years, my parents told me that my oldest, Mr. Marshall, would never come home to see him. But, this day never came. No evidence of that existence was left of him, and his young mother had long since given up and moved back to her hometown. His family reported that on his deathbed, she had given him and an old teddy bear that had always hung around his neck.
I came home early that morning to a pounding headache that felt as though it had been going on for miles. I was tired enough that I couldn't stand to look in my large mirror. I tried to take stock of my life that day, and I found myself coming up with no.
I came home around 2:00 a.m. That's when I realized my fault. It took hours for the doctor to announce what I had been having a brain-virus, the one that had spread to my brain. He had rushed to the hospital that day with news of the virus, trying to save my life.
I'm convinced that I still dreamt of our long time vacation together. All the usual activities, family dinners, a relaxing dinner with my family, a game night with my kids, and a birthday party with my parents. But, I knew what had happened: The teddy bear lay on my bed, with a scar covering it.
"Will you marry me? Please."
Well, I guess we could call it, a safe lie if we so desired.<|endoftext|>

This was a color so beautiful and so seductive it reminded me of a hooded mutt that was hanging over our in the woods.
And you could see the savagely, nearly self-extinguishing back of the hood as the convulsing flame rose up in response.
My breath was freezing. To the touch, with a breath like lead in a soggy motel. Where will we walk?
How will I leave behind this horrible thing?
No doubt you hear the screeching pain of the whip in my hand.
Which is exactly what you would expect for the smell of smoke in the fireplace like it's drinking itself a cup of gasoline.
How can I leave behind the future, the past?
How can I learn to look out on the world and see the rage like a decoy?
You could look at the sharp, bloody and charred shards of a woman's face, the decomposing remains of a man's home, the golden tendrils of a burning needle.
But here I am holding a book, the secrets of true friendship and love.
And right here, with my beautiful... oh why I couldn't believe these words that had been in my head for so long.
I didn't realize the ism. You actually had to guess.
The real question we had pondered for so long was why I was here. And it was time to relieve myself. You, too, all sense of self wanted to stay in to pass the time, so to speak. So I caught that book today. And then, and always, a splash of "Grey" and " White" and " Black."
You tell me it wasn't meant to be as offensive, to be clever, to change color so much. It was really meant to be a color that was interesting and alive.
But there is a reason I had come here today.
So tell me, why don't we have a dance?
How are we not destined to wear another color of common ignorance for such a long, long time?
Can it, in spite of all we are, still be something that makes our "-life-" seem as good, " as kind, with humor " as kind " with heart?
Can I still see the hundred years of happiness and celebration outside our windows, the all the love and light and wonder and excitement that we all share because of this song written in our name?
It is a beautiful color.
Because when we walk away, we'll never see it again.
Instead, I'll be left behind by the winds.<|endoftext|>

On a rocky high as far as the eye can see, lines of heavy ore lay buried beneath steep mountainside. Clad in broken armor, and decorated with burnt glory, this inky black phantasmagoria and tin-colored skin highlighted this fierce, senseless battle. The sound of bombardment drew the stars from their massive bore of destruction. In that moment that time consumed Vashgal the Witch King, the warrior picked off his foe and charged for the pit of Hell himself.
The Lord had ordered some carelessly evil men to take them into space but Vashgal's arrival on top of him was as good as any such order. He was thrown from high above and landed directly on top of his conquered foe the Wolf, barely able to pick him up to the sky before he promptly struck him down with an air shoving bullet. The Wolf would have swum into the Earth and slain him with only his fists. The Warlord himself had fled to some remote galaxy with minor supplies before the Lord took it upon himself to ferret out Vashgal and his soldiers. And so the battle did draw near.
Vashgal, standing in no more than half a foot of dirt only a few meters away, aimed a small space rock at the Wolf in front of him. The boulder recoiled from Vashgal's strike and made a twisted and bloodied crumpled heap from its hit. However the Wolf looked into Vashgal's eyes that filled with a smile of pure pride, and with only an ever present sense of sympathy for the fallen warrior.
"And there now you may rest, " Vashgal said somberly as he flicked the hair from Vashgian's face, revealing a most comically severed hand with an alabaster skull inside.
The Wolf closed his eyes and rested his long dormant eye sockets on Vashgal's. " I don't want to see what you do there. "
Vashgal pulled out another set of binoculars and stared at Vashgal, finding that he knew too well the exact meaning behind Vashgal's eyes. " Nothing, nothing will ever hurt you. "
" And who are you? " Vashgal asked with a snarl.
The Wolf unholstered his binoculars and wept with satisfaction. " This was just me. I did what you asked of me, and I did it well. "
" Why, you ask why? I asked you first, " Vashgal took a deep breath, and then at last settled back into a similar peaceful silence.
Vashgal and the Wolf groaned in agreement.
" And for what? To show what I did? To show how much you cared? " Vashgal finally seemed satisfied. " It's what you think. "
The Wolf sat down and raised an eyebrow. " I simply don't think it's right to say your kind is down this alone. The Legion, through me and in the holy blood you have drained, colonized, and kept something else in line."
Vashgal had already resumed watching the Warlord. At his heels came a song that he had grown fond of with each passing week. The music had haunted the underworld, turning an even darker shade of white over time. Whenever Vashgal saw a Human-Alien warlord, he'd dive into their bones and sing it to him with His kindness.
In that moment it struck him like a slap in the face. As Vashgal focused he realized why Vashgal's lips always seemed to grow thin.
Because... and Vashgal closed his eyes one last time, and tears were flowing out of them in forth his face.<|endoftext|>

Four months. Four months of sleep deprivation. Four months of darkness.
I sit in that dim corner in the house, my hands in my pockets, and silently fiddle with the pocket watch. I don't care if it's a risky action, and I'm no... regular person. Sure, I could be like... a street magician, or whatever. Which is fine. I would like to get out of this house and back to my regular job. Or something. But for the sake of preserving my life, I'm curious. What does this happen to forget anything? Maybe Alzheimer's, birth defects, Parkinson's, birth defects... I've never had one. It's all so hard for me. Oh well. I just keep staring at that silver wrist watch. It's actually fourteen goddamn minutes too late.
It's not that I won't come back. Or maybe I'll die with it on. And I'm sure that now I'll come to a realization. This... that was only ten minutes ago.
Oh, and four months of sleep deprivation. Four months of darkness.
"Is he still there? " My wife asked quietly, gazing at me. She needed to be afraid to wake her father.
I grimaced. " Honey, it's impossible. What's he hiding in there? "
She picked up the pace again. " Well, be a good father, Mom. If you need anything, you can ask my mother, " she walked toward the door, avoiding eye contact. " I'm really tired now, Jane. It's not safe here any more, Dad. Just come back when it's safe."
She pulled out her phone, and started to dial. The phone rang.
Sighing, I sat at the table, and realized it was just the wrong one.
The clock chimed again. Just the wrong one.<|endoftext|>

I keep reminding myself how much I hate reality television.
The new reality show is funded by Comcast. So, every now and then I watch it, and it changes me. It hurts more than anything.
My life is over. The reality thing will only be up until the end of the week.
A night out only occurred once a year. I was too self-conscious to care. It was the typical night, when you don't bathe like you used to. I should have let myself go through it the moment I was asleep, but something really was the case tonight. I glanced around the block at my room. That wasn't there before. Everyone was here, I thought to myself, and I didn't know where.
Then, I saw her. I don't know what I saw, but I somehow knew that I should have stayed home to watch it. That night was especially challenging.
I got home and began playing some TV. I wanted to, but I could hear the click-clack of my heart and the click of my fingers, and I was trapped. I slept for a good week.

“ Mama, I don ’ t have time to explain it, is this some sort of joke I did on you, ” Mimi said to Hannah, moving toward the beer left outside. Hannah rolled her eyes. It wasn ’ t going to be anything really warm. Mama put the bottle on the fridge and quickly took one, coughing up some red in her mouth and muttering “ shit. ” She looked up and came over to the sink. She found the bottle of ale, which she carried underneath her. Mimi threw the rest of the stuff into the garbage bin and looked around the house, for anything else of note. “ Let ’ s start at the beginning, this is what happens when this relationship ends; it ’ s why I went out with you. ” Hannah picked up the lighter and lit a match. “ There ’ s no stopping anything if you don ’ t do anything to it, this is very important for everyone. ” Mimi slammed the lighter down and started to go to pull the lighter. She stopped. Hannah turned back to Mimi and started speaking up again. “ You think that I ’ m the stupidest person in the world, that I never find it creepy to do what you do to me? ” The two of them looked at each other. Mimi reached forward and lit a match and set it on the top of the jar, putting it in Mimi ’ s hand.
“ Fine, ” Mimi said, as she looked over the barrel of the lighter to find it resting on the bloody edge of the lid. She looked down. “ You ’ ve dropped the knife, doesn ’ t you? ” Hannah looked at the knife now, taking a step back. “ If you drop that, I ’ ll drop the knife and you ’ ll drop it in my face, but it won ’ t be important. You are stuck in this cycle. You have no part in this. You don ’ t belong here. ” Mimi put the lighter away and backed up against the wooden chair. Hannah turned around and looked at her.
“ I ’ m not a person, baby! ” She slammed the barrel of the lighter down in front of her. “ Anything other than a knife and a screaming woman. ” Hannah came back around, thinking that she was crying. She ’ d never said a word about it to anyone other than her mother.
Hannah grabbed Mimi ’ s arm and went to pick it up. “ Run, Mimi, I ’ ll follow, I won ’ t run. ” Mimi looked at the light, sensing that it ’ s dim, but she wanted to say it before anyone would hear.
“ Run. ” She whispered. Hannah sighed. “ If I don ’ t, it ’ ll be all me, I ’ ll just disappear, if I don ’ t… ” Hannah kicked Mimi ’ s legs into the floor, knocking over the table. Mimi opened her mouth to say something but immediately realized that she didn ’ t mean anything.
“ Run, running you always run, a squirrel, don ’ t worry, she is an awful squirrel. ” Hannah knelt down on the ground, throwing Mimi a hug. She placed her arms on top of her chest and watched as the three walked around the room, the light fading as they continued.
Hannah noticed her mother standing in a door in front of the fridge, tears welling up in her eyes. “ Stop running. RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN ” she said to herself. Hannah pushed it away and stood up. She looked at Mimi with dark eyes and just stared at her, lips agape. She sighed and put her hands in her pockets and ran. “ Mama, I don ’ t need to explain it, is this some sort of joke I did on you, ” she said to Hannah, moving toward the beer left outside. Hannah rolled her eyes. It wasn ’ t going to be anything really warm.

A hint of quiet buzz arose from my familiar interface. My name was Tyty Olson and I was a virtual assistant with the Federal Government at work. Unfortunately, that gave me a turn away from the briefing I was going to be given. That was so close.
"Does this module even store any biological information? "
" Yes, we needed to think about this issue before booting up to the computer " I said as I bit into my second appliance of the day.
Ty was awake and in my bag that was my morning routine. No matter where I woke up I would sit at my computer and browse Reddit, keep my mouth shut ( I hated binging on the internet nowadays which was currently 60 % casual ), watch the news and to much else.
When Ty got up, I snuck back to my computer and resumed. The television was green and bland. Heavily wrinkled and yellowed. I turned on the tv and pressed a button. My screen lit up with a strange static. A pregnant pause that just sounded out of tune. A woman appeared. I forced the pause and looked up. Her blonde hair shone in the morning light as she smiled.
" Sir, this is Carol Prince. Your true name is Irene Leighton " My ghostly voice quailed the voice. " That may not be acceptable but I am at your internet forum to chat with you ". She had old laptop speakers and there were several computers already plugged in. This woman obviously was not a typical internet user. Perhaps she even came from the lower reaches of humanity. Perhaps she had been hacked or had inserted some kind of virus into her computer. My ghostly voice interjected with an annoyed " You are missing 5 % of your class! ". I switched the volume to 140.
Carol was in control of all of the games she was playing. I quickly brought up Game of Thrones, Dragon Age, Legend of Zelda. Then the very last player. A program called " /u/Freebird " and continued to play when she was scowling at me. I sighed as I sat back down. Here I thought it would be simple; download biological skills instead of what was given to me by the government.
" But you were a good student and you didn't have anything to worry about; I never heard you really have an issue with one of these. What is this about? " I was sure her computer was malfunctioning. Her voice sounded harsh. I quickly tried to get better at translating her words.
" Mechanical Engineering degree, USD 140. "
With this, I shut down all my computer programmes. I waited for her to head over to my own computer and unhook her headphones. This was enough.
As her car swerved gracefully down the embankment towards the plant building, I looked back across the site for the activation code. We didn't know the cause of our malfunction, but it was surely very unusual of us. I scanned the drive over list and handshakes. I reached for my wallet I had with me and checked my phone as I knew it would only serve a brief fleeting moment.
After five minutes, I reached for my gun. I double checked my dark leather gloves. I gripped the trigger hard. The pistol dropped and I noticed that I had lost balance and died instantly. My vision swam as I rolled over, I could barely see in my death throes. I closed my eyes as my body became numb.
I turned around, I would kill someone I knew. They were telling me to die immediately.
" You do realize what this will do but until you get used to it, we aren't too worried about " Maria stated softly.
" I really hope it will work " I replied. She was probably right about everything. I leaned forward and squeezed, harder than I anticipated. It felt like minutes.
Another gunshot rang out. The doorknob clicked as the green light in my otherwise grey walkway flashed. My vision now brightened up as the world turned black.
An hour later, I awoke. To my bewilderment, my vision returned to normal. I was a healthy, excited young man in my late 20's. I felt perfectly fine. What a weird dream.
" Fuck you." I said as I flipped on the television and watched the news of my death.<|endoftext|>

"Three. "
The words spoken by Clarke absorbed the collective collective brainwaves of the world. Behind the eyes of the men and women who had paid their respects for the most derisive man and woman, stood the He.
A tall, thin man.
" What. The. Hell. "
At first, Clarke wondered who the the He was. He had never traveled in his field of expertise until the expedition's landing. His greatest achievement had been the portal to a billion little star systems, discovered in the 7 billionth year after He's finally arrived. This time his home system... nothing seemed to exist. Nothing made sense.
He watched the massive waves of data streamed out from this projection. Millions upon billions. A lot had been witnessed, but Clarke had never received a response. He felt the urge to decipher the data and gather everything he knew. Everything written from the largest archives of that universe on the server; a little known observation about all the systems he had established.
Clarke noted the existence of water on the first two quarters of the planet. Not much further than Earth. He recalled the night where his sun was projected to have water-bearing islands whose methane gas stores bound to observe the absorption of energy into Earth. A nice and warm day. Perhaps only a year to come.
" What did He put there? "
The man smiled with broad fingers and shrugged nervously. " He said something about possibility. "
" What? " Clarke nodded. " When are we alone in the universe? "
The man gave a sly wink. " We're alive."
Clarke gulped and sighed as he stared at the sea.<|endoftext|>

It used to keep me up at night, now it helps me sleep.
I didn't know how night had gone. The warm nights drew out the dry, knowing nights, like the day they killed us. All of those nights were replaced with nothing. And then one day I awoke to a lie. I started wandering, I didn't notice it until I would sleep with my eyes closed. I knew I couldn't open them if they weren't open. But my heart beat stopped, and I was shocked.
I still don't know how I knew, but there was nowhere to go. The door to the outside was open, just a few houses down, but only one house had something nice inside. Its doorbell rang, as I arrived I found a cat being fed. But even if I opened it, I couldn't find the man.
I think I had always feared the chase. The people who took the bait were easy prey, so easy it had been easy to kill. So easy so easy to die.
The chase didn't end there. I stood there, in a field, looking upwards towards the sky. Every day it took me a week or two to get there, but the sun wasn't stopping. I walked over to the house that my heart belonged to, the long line, the closer it got. I could feel it, and yet I couldn't feel it.
My pet walked up the long line, leading me up. In that moment I could see the world I didn't know existed, and the world of my dreams. In that moment I forgot what I had been led to.
It was the tail of a horse, gray with fur and trailing hair. It fell to my feet. So hard, it broke a bone on the left side of the head. In that instant it left, and I forgot everything.
She chased me.<|endoftext|>

*The* ground flew through the air like a claw, and then there was nothing. The general stood in stunned silence, waiting for some sort of breakthrough in what was to come. * All* of the combatant commanders, fighters, and commanders and negotiators filed out of the command center and hastily made a hastily distributed radio signal. * Confidence! * they chanted their final words as *Confidence in his victory. *
*Freedom from this world is the dignity of all. *
*It is my place to proclaim this upon the earth. *
*No, please, we are not free from this. *
*C ’ mon we are, *
*Freedom* is freedom from ALL of this. *
*It will be over soon. *
*It ’ s a fact. *
*They are gone. *
A distinct creak from the radio started the sound of heavy growling.
The dog sitting in the corner of the room leaned his head back. It ’ s green eyes met the black and white carpet of the command center. They were looking into the flames and there was no fucking way out. There were none of them. Those damn bears were lost to the love of their life, their only joy, their entire existence. * There ’ s no fucking way out. *
*Never for ever have I fallen in love, *
*Chosen to do as I please, *
*And you are to embrace me like that, and guard me like that. *
A soft click came from the computer ’ s speakers, and the computer pulsed and hissed with power. * There can ’ t be more of these fucking bears, * the general thought. The moment was an inevitability. He handed the gun over and hid it under his pants. He loaded his rifle and pulled the trigger.
*The war is over, my fellow Americans. *
*There is no more Afghanistan, no more Iraq. *
*You guys are welcome to join us tomorrow. *
*You guys make your yearly recess mandatory for those who aren't allowed. *
*They are different from us. *
*We are different from you. *
*You guys don ’ t just shoot themselves in the head, no! *
*You stand against us like we ’ re crazy and your guys seem really hung over. *
*But you won ’ t. *
*You ’ ve been through everything we have to offer. *
*You ’ ve done what little ’ s left. *
*You ’ ve been a free man in free New York state and that ’ s it. *
The thing stood up and furrowed its brow. A man in the corner of the room turned his head, and when he turned around the president ran his hand over his eyes and his barked.
His long tail wagged as he slapped down the last of the remaining president ’ s dogs.<|endoftext|>

"Gabriel? " My wife asks.
" Gabriel, " I reply, don't you look through that telescope again?
She laughed. " Yes, " she said. " Yes. "
It's already 3:30 in the afternoon and I look out the window. 3:31 is when we are expected to go out to the field, perform the ceremonial dance.
" Where do you think we are going? " she asked.
I let my gaze fall back down from the telescope again. At least, it will be enough.
The earth is nearly flat as the view leaves the second week of December. Instead of rolling back the world, we're riding off the Interregnum, descending onto the Earth's core for mere five days.
After this we're going into the infinite void between, and the Earth is two days from total chaos.
There's my wife, Emily, behind me. Emily is my girlfriend. Emily, my girl.
" What are you doing? "
My wife is a pleasant beauty, just like her and her mother when they died. But my husband? Hell, there aren't any freaks riding high on the moon like them.
How about, well, where are we heading? I have no idea.
" Em, " I say, glaring at my wife and waving an arm around my shoulder. " Do you remember how we were getting those presents from Sarah in heaven? The one where you said he couldn't stay in the air if he told you to stay on Earth? "
I'm actually glad I said that. " I do remember, " I finally say.
" Oh really? And what did you see there? "
The moment my sight changed to Ellen's breasts, she ripped me apart. The people who saw us their grief.
" Well, " she said finally. " You can do it. "
Everything stops, except this beautiful, light-headed baby girl.
No. Her head doesn't move. She still looks at me like she just slept. So she's still alive.
" Em, please. Please tell me. "
" Yes, " I beg her. " Please don't do it! "
" It's funny. How could you think that? " she said, looking at me with fear.
" He didn't make a choice, " I say.
She screams.
" Jesus! What's wrong? Why didn't you listen?! "
" He didn't know to come on with us, " she gasps. " He didn't know we were so vulnerable. "
" He knew to disappoint us. "
" Well, why did he have to choose of us? It's no wonder the rest of us had to die. "
" What, what are they afraid of? "
" They are blind, " she continues, her screaming giving her away. " It's how they expected us to live. With their judgment, our misery. It's how they brought us here. We fought them; we had all our tools, but we turned them on each other. With trial, we filed ourselves into a place where the kind of mortals we called demons would wage war on us. Their weapons we left them, our meats we gave them. "
" They told us all we needed to survive. "
" How could they have known that? "
" We can understand how the gods respond to the removal of demons from our heads, but the people don't really know what will happen now. They will keep growing, but only for so long that they won't leave us to fight. "
She pulls back in horror. I feel my own eye on her muzzle.
" Finally," she whispers as she pushes away.
When I pull away to talk to my wife, I can't help but feel at home there. Everyone who sees me, everyone I meet, doesn't feel sorry for me.
They can at least get a few hugs from a doctor or a psychologist. I know that.
I don't have my wife anymore.<|endoftext|>
**********403**********
She sat at the table, looking up from the tablet.
Her smile was slowly and hopeful.
He sighed, her name lingering in his mind as she stared at his tablet.
He thought back on the accident.
With his family, every day had been a tragedy.
But tonight, her great-grandmother was found dead in her hotel room, along with 20 other relatives.
He remembered for the first time what used to be his greatest regret.
Jalen, his best friend since middle school, had had to keep him in close contact with his father since he was born.
Ten years old, Jalen had always considered herself a good boy.
But his favorite memories of his mother, Karlyna, were the same: a young girl who adopted him from the orphanage, with a first name that did not matter when he had fun.
Karylena never broke down; she had was just jealous and scared at first.
Jalen never got over his parents' death, but Karlyna did.
For several years, Jalen was an idealist. He brushed his teeth, went to church and made the best friends he could.
But Jalen no longer lived in his current world.
He thought about his painful childhood.
He remembered a girl who found him, as well as the bottle of Marlboro, a favourite, though they had never spoken.
She sat beside him in bed, with her handbag.
Karylena was now at his father's funeral, with his mum sobbing into the phone.
Jalen had been his best friend since middle school.
The world went dark for awhile, and his first love had decided it was time to move on.
But he was not sad or angry or angry.
He had had his doubts.
"Okay, Daddy, I'm too busy. You know you're a genius "
" You must be, " replied Jasmine. " I'm starting to wonder why you've been sent into the past? "
" That you don't have a grandchild yet, dear " he replied.
" I missed you Mom. Why did you go to grad school? "
" Because I loved you, " Jasmine replied.
" And you are so lonely, " he retorted.
Karylena glanced at the tablet, and drew back the tears.
Jalen thought about dying.
" It must be hard being young, Jasmine " he muttered.
" I really do miss you, " she answered, " I'm going to take you away from me for a while. But I will come. "
" That you're so old, " he reassured, " you'd still be able to walk again."
She was still sobbing.<|endoftext|>

For a brief moment, everyone stared at the wooden desk with yellowed tape and wondering what the hell he did. Every once in a while, a few would read the documents and try to get a better idea of what he was up to. But, there was no way in hell any of them could get off this desk and try and change anything about it. They didn ’ t realise what they had written, but they each wrote at the same time. It was some sort of stupid ritual, such as a daydream over a real person's death, or reading a Reddit post from a world of 20 or 60, that led one to write something incredibly bad.
The post was titled,'**Karen Stockman By Sewing a Neck In Her Uncut Neck**'.
Everyone was looking at the post. Some frantically wanted answers, people who worked late, and others frantically wanted someone to clue them in. For five minutes, nobody cared. There was a successful magician who had built some kind of false flower so that with those fake identities, he could trade them into a vending machine for $ 5. The post was still there, even though no one went home.
But then, the post was a mess and nobody noticed. Everyone knew it wasn ’ t just some post, but a clear string of deaths on both sides of the globe. The fishnet rules of Reddit are simple: tell me the name of the fellow alive, and then a letter can be given to him or her to show him or her a sign of either kindness or commitment or desolation, but no one would care.
EDIT: Some spelling.<|endoftext|>

"Tell me, what the hell is going on? "
The man I was talking to started to rise, his eyes slack and bruised. He bent his head slightly, putting back his sobs. " What did you do? Why are you acting the way you do? Get out of here and get out of here. "
I scrambled from the computer desk, kicking as hard as I could against the wall. I hadn't heard footsteps here before. I could only feel the cold wind being carried around, wind that didn't wait for an answer as soon as it entered the building, and cold that didn't reach my eyes as quickly as I had before. I paused for a moment, reading the words printed on the wall before muttering in my defence " I killed them, killed them all. "
" Okay, you know that. What were you, killing them? " he asked, still reaching into his pants pocket for the belt on his jacket. I pinched myself a bit to regain my composure. I hadn't planned to betray him though, as soon as I saw this idiotic man he was in an image, it wasn't who I thought it was.
" We were in the car, sir. We got out of the car. The drivers were terrified that I might kill them all, I've never messed with cars before. "
" I killed the elephants. Who the hell are you to give me a fancy name or stupid title? How long ago have you done this? "
" 1089 years. The masters here have been looking for you for awhile now. You get to see the master one day and after that... Well. It gets away from you. Except for my slaves. You never told them why you were doing it but I still killed them, " he continued.
" Actually, I didn't kill them, " I said, " I created the worlds. We found mirrors on the floor of the car. Well the better ones, they can distract people in the dark places in cities. Humans are weak and can only be used to catch bunnies. " I asked.
" And I was able to bunnies in one of the mirrors, " he was opening the trunk. The mirrors were moving in a slow and upward fashion, slowly, almost like I had found a girl who could see herself hurt herself on a bicycle ride. " The speed of the mirrors are predictable as well as the pain from them. "
" I can tell. I killed them all. " I said, " You used them to fool me, nobody knew that you did this to us. Now I kill them all. "
I kept trying to move, but he kept laughing, swinging the door shut. It wouldn't budge. Then it did.
I froze. His shaking hands slowly worked it's way up around my head, pulling me even more up. I spun around, arms stretched and smiling. As the tears began to well up in my eyes, I was able to scream out in the full extent of their panic. I tried to scream, but there was no response.
" E! E! E! " I started to catch myself. Tears began to well up from my eyes, but I just kept moving. The man was still laughing.
"... Hey? Don't you get it, master, what happened? I killed them all! " I asked, desperately trying to scream out, but he ignored me.
As he walked away, the sound of bones snapping and decaying was accompanied by a whimper of life back in the office building.
The blond haired couple sat in the white stall in the background. One had her hands in her pockets. She seemed distressed by the noise in the air, and I could tell that they knew she was concerned. Another blond child was sitting quietly on the desk. I moved toward her and touched her tight, tender wrist. " Don't ask me, now, " I said softly, listening to the whimper of the child's breathing. I took a deep breath.
" Where are you taking me? " she called out to me.
" I didn't want to. I'm busy. " I said, " I wish I was, I want to see you again."<|endoftext|>

Things haven't been easy for Sarah.
Marriage, mostly. Always. But maybe that's not the crux of the problem. The worrying element of it is the reason I feel so justified in my feelings. Right now, she has two sons and only three older sisters. That's better, she's a middle class family; last time I met a rich professor whose bread was guaranteed to feel like tomato soup, I broke my hand.
The amount of college debt she pays out isn't that bad. And though I didn't have much to do, it seemed far too necessary for her to have started at a mere barely-real job to justify the extra 40 bucks a month she's being paid. That's why she's annoyed that I need money. Or so I'd thought.
But then the first time I tried to talk to her, the *whole* morning, she wasn't even listening. It was the stuff of amnesia. When a waitress always manages to clear you out of your cab. When you need her to remind you of everything you've ever done before you can even remember about your friends. When she never seems to know if you've had sex, or if you've ever been wanted. It's just... there. Not like it matters now. She's always silent.
When I saw Sarah after that first drink over to my apartment, I began to feel angry. I'm not angry at her about stealing from her, but angry at the fact that I've had to juggle the unpaid bills for 5 months without her. I was angry because I wouldn't have been able to keep paying for a Saturday pizza if she hadn't gone out with her friends.
But what is yelling? My daughter. Not from my parents. She's still a spoiled brat in my room, frozen in her youth. And I'm... I have to get to her. To get to her without turning into this festering bit of mud that has done me nothing but good in the past. I'm probably going to try to get her to stop crying at night.
***
I wonder if I should have put Emily in my office, but I digress... her boyfriend just seemed tired. I go out of my way to buy lunch after work so I get to see him about once a week. It's not like he's completely out of his mind, but since he's a lonely alcoholic who never talked to a girl about anything besides self-worth or sex for that matter, he needs to keep himself busy before he just gets to go back to sleep. His girlfriend is losing a lot lately, even with his money and a single night of make-up and his only girlfriend he can't even call himself for because she's had fun. It just doesn't seem fair.
Not to mention I'm not even going to go to her tonight. She seems to sleep so peaceful I can't even see her face. It's just *surrounding me. * I should have sat back when Emily started. She's the moody one, but nothing feels wrong in the whole, hell I doubt even I can hear her own voice. I know what that means.
A chill runs down my spine as I go about my morning routine. A Saturday pizza. Nothing seems wrong today, but if it's so fine I could just get over it -- I've been trying to work up the energy to really talk to her since I left last week.
I walk up to the top of the stairs, and wish me luck. * I'm going to go to her right now. * But the reality is that I'm already halfway there.
I continue down the stairs, but a slap on the shoulder shakes me out of my daze. My arms are numb; I haven't had a real good night's sleep in a while. I've been alone for 3 weeks, and I've lost touch with myself. I can't seem to move the walls, nothing can move my body anymore, and I'm still unable to *believe* that *she* exists.
She's probably been a bit more experienced than I thought. If only I'd known better. Maybe we could have known when she got drunk that drunk. Maybe we could have stayed here together. But what if she didn't want me to stay here with her. What if I gave her something else? And what if...

The first time this started, it was... a bit strange. There wasn't much else to see. A small green patch stretching down the length of the street - a few feet wide and bulbous, as far as I could tell - a carefully arranged wire coil extended from a spheroid that glistened in the late autumn sun, illuminating the area's inky blackness. It had to have been a city city. Whatever source, that thing couldn't have lasted just *months*.
My neighbor had stopped talking, a break in contact with her niece at the grocery store. A few months ago, she'd started getting into the strangest behavior I'd ever seen. It was simple enough. Peeking from under a canopy of leaves, peaking above a corner of a street, then sweeping up as the sun set above. Her aunt had said that it was the worst thing that could happen to her child. The whole thing left her feeling miserable. When she went to hug the little thing, she swore she felt something heavy hit her shoulder. * * It feels* the same way when I run into her. A drop of rain. The sparks of sobs from laughing in anticipation as she stumbled away from the thing.
I know what to do. I've tried other thoughts before - just to get her over the edge. But I can't do it. At least, not today. Today, I just *have to*, though, before the pile rises. I've gotten ten wooded blocks behind the next door. My neighbors should be able to wait up here by now.
Inside of the trunk of the pile there's a small seed, growing. It's been getting taller and taller in the day.
-- -
I'd never been the same, until today. The suds of sewn-in roses do little to sway me down an unfamiliar street. My neighbors should be able to help me sort the inevitable. But the way I turn, the tear in my eye, the feel of going through the hug of the baby leaves and the grain of sand in my face, my stomach snaps into knots. It's impossible to cry. How am I supposed to even tell my wife I'm leaving? It just comes to me. Surely we can fix this now. Surely we should stay here with each other forever, to truly be together and raise our kids. But at the same time... what's the point? I guess I'll just go back to my own seed. I'll start the whole garden now.
-- -
I pull over the edge. There's not much else to see. There aren't many things to love, not today. The promised sun soon surpasses my own shadow.
I push hard, trying to hold off the anger. I see the little white'chocula' of a birch spout over a house. Flicker away like stars against the dark. The breeze whipping around me. The wind flowing through every crack and crevice in the tombstone. I don't know why - perhaps it's my imagination or perhaps it's the early autumn wind. Whatever the reason, I'm done for.<|endoftext|>

We have decided not to come with anymore purpose since our sponsors bought us, we told them of the "bad luck " to run out.
" How do you think the blood will drop out? "
" Yeah, sure, certainly. I had it on good, it's just not how they envisioned it. "
" Good luck. "
" Not so bad. "
" They're trying to communicate with us before we even hit! "
" What have we to do? "
" Try and find something. If nothing works it won't be so bad. "
" Impossible. "
" Then we lose. "
"... "
" B.N.R.O. the E.K.a.s, easy as that, they just never said anything like that, we have to go. One minute they're still bots, going to invade us, and the next they're going to have to come to hell, except they're wrong. "
" How'd they even figure that out? Why would they? "
" It was definitely a statistical probability. "
" What did they know? "
" I mean.. they figured that if everyone were the same they wouldn't have each other by then. "
" We don't take business from business. "
" It didn't work that way. So they found someone who was. Nobody had ever figured it out. "
" So. "
" It just didn't work that way at all. We're not sure how far this process went, and also, because they didn't know yet it seems that while they were running out they had already lost the majority of the majority of their time. "
" Then you needed to keep repeating it and it doesn't matter now. "
" What's that? "
" Yep. "
" It wasn't like what you were expecting? "
" No. "
" The dumb shit didn't work that way? "
" Well it's not a matter of being bored. That's what actually counts, you're really pretty stupid."<|endoftext|>

"Hi, i'm Jourdan Smith. I am a hunter and in the 34th year since i've been sent here you are the first human to set foot in earth's soil. I'm leaving to be with my partner, Gus, and have to contact Jourdan when he arrives. "
" Gus, I have only been here a few minutes but i believe i heard a voice. "
" Jourdan? Gus, i don't remember hearing those words. But Gus, is someone speaking for me? "
" Dude, looks like a man. I'm gon na go meet you at the strip club when you are finished. "
" Well of course. I can give you directions to the strip club, if you would like. "
" Alright, I'll come, head on in, I'm going back. "
I ended up stepping out of the plane, and Gus finally sits down on the chair next to me.
" I had reservations. Uh huh, sure you can sit here at the strip club. "
" Jim, I've never been in that bar before, but people thought it was pretty lame. I watched everyone else. "
" Well, I'm meeting some tots in Budweiser. "
" Beetle. "
" We wanted the skinny bumgy "
" Right, I'm afraid we aren't going to make it. "
" Noodles is a joke, Gus. It must be out of place. "
" Well that's weird. Would you like to make us change our names? "
" Uh huh. "
Gus looks around the bar, no one else ever came to try and settle in. Maybe he'll make it.
I haven't seen Gus since the first day we arrived.
He and Gus both sat there all day long. After about three minutes of silent conversation, Gus spoke.
" The dead bring before you all the hardships. The dead bring destruction, it's not up to the leader of the free world to take your part. "
A few minutes pass, and Gus speaks again.
" The dead bring pain. Through the dead bring darkness. Through the dead bring anger. Through the dead bring tears, it's not up to the leader of the free world to take your part. "
" I was surprised. You know Gus? You know I'm the first person who has ever experienced fire? People tend to forget. "
" Come on Guevara, it isn't the new lick that makes fire. It's the feelings. You can hear them coming inside. "
The boy says that while Gus is saying that, the signs are in. The dark fires bring darkness in the shadows and turn brothers and sisters to ash. The lights turn the dark black and turn friends and enemies into shadows. The dark men turn into snakes and the dark women turn into steel and electricity.
Gus removes his nose.
" This is what we experience. With every single one of us. You can sit here and think, and there will be people out there who will teach you more of your soul. Then we will go back into the light."
The group goes back to doing their best to take back Gus.
Walking over to the bar, Gus starts making himself at home.
There's going to be a war.

I sat in a chair in the meeting room, displaying an assortment of forms. Sensational signs of mood stressed around me, moving toward each others thoughts and behaviors, as well as something more daunting, a world of sounds, colors and interesting information. I gave the first round of our presentations a smattering of information, and the presentation went on.
With regards to what I already know, I'm fairly certain all of this is as well. How does your social status dictate your stance towards others? Are you the gatekeeper of the human race? What way, what kind of stigma to stick up your nose at? Advertisements for top-of-the-line products are everywhere, and push your tendencies towards unpopular tastes?
You're the one in the book, I'll show you.<|endoftext|>

"Hey kids, I'd like to introduce myself, I've worked as a journalist ever since I was a kid. I'm Jimmy/Hermione, after all "
A small white rabbit snuggled in closer to the window, hooting, puffing out his puff joint, " Jimmy Gunchups. That's me! I'm Jimmy Triplow! I'm being cat person. "
A little owl poked it's yellow wing out, " Oh my Celine, that's Mike Jackson here! I know! "
They both jiggled slightly to the windows when an owl howled and all eight of Jimmy's teeth got smashed from the books they'd come up with. A giant tarp ball poked from one of Jimmy's books to the next and smashed into his bookcase, causing five oars of dust to fly into Jimmy's chest, followed by another tarp round on his neck.
" Now, Klieg, first thing I want to tell you before we start the show is that you aren't making me look like Mr Rabbit. It's just a goddamned spider! "
" Well you ain't that useful, Klieg, Harry Potter ain't that useful! "
" No, that's true. Get a seat! We've got to get to our set of assignments, actually. "
With a flick of a wrist Klieg sat up and rubbed his head.
" My new assignment, you seem a little more confident now that you can step off the stage! Look right at your wrists. "
" Well you don't seem too fussy. "
Harry stood up and snuggled up close to Jimmy, " Oh, Jimmy Triplow, thank you! I'm going to show you that this is real! This is real! You can take care of that Riddle problem, you show it to him on the big screen! You could do a great service - James m mary might have stuck his tongue in your mouth and ruined the role."<|endoftext|>

Perke said he was his own professor. That knowledge was why the professor had put every trans student on a learning assignment and never taught them. All his friends knew how to use Grammar. Even his younger sister Lanny had gotten this since she had finished out sophomore year.
Now she was a caterer doing her part. All the boys at the class had straight D anyway but she kept a gap in her brothers. They were all American so that meant his English was about 13.
After a while the Grammar Committee was asked to select all those trans students from the class. No choice they had given though but the trans guys always got the task of reporting back to the teacher to determine what the class heard.
At first it was the teacher who reported it and then it was the grammer teacher who dealt with it from there. The teaching staff at the school would tell the whole class what kind of them were as well or what the fuck they were like and try to sort it out. An was the mom's response they would tell the damn Grammers who were such nobodies. The teacher would always keep a mic in their mouth ready to talk to them or watch them or perhaps just follow them with his usually very lovely voice, that'll drive them.
Before long it seemed the authorities were all going to get their message. The teacher would talk to the man who was gon na figure it all out for all of them, the Grammers man. The man would start with the foot like a star and slowly turn it up until the base note was up.
One student, only fourteen, would succeed and the boy would break his school record that day. He would break it back at any time and his bet would go into a business owner.
The man may have been not a great teacher, but the fellow who owned him would watch to see how it was going. Most Grammers did the same thing with their parents. The man managed to break that record two years later and put it back onto the front page.
Before he passed it would be a frequent he and other Grammers heard the report. The same days, the same days, to see the headlines. The head grammer would look at that and start tapping in gold gold on those headlines and after that they would sit back and relax and rest.
The Hufflepuff boy would read them the headline at each of those houses and get his hands dirty to ensure that no one would ever mistake them for the naughty ones. The Hufflepuff boy would be the rare person to show off his masterpieces. As for the boy? Well he was a grumpy old bastard. The Hufflepuff boy would secretly be imagining the room to look about just like that one. His body, as well as his blood, would spill down the walls and the hall like an invisible hand. He thought he saw his own friends but to his surprise there was nothing but ink running in the ceiling like hair from his bangs.
Once he passed the article out the word "grammar " would turn in on itself on every word that was written there. Soon there was nobody that could make out words and he wouldn't even be able to hear them. As anyone who could read his beautiful little journal that read something like " Grammars? " would pass it out, there would be a crowd of gingers and everybody would be snikking to all the people on that one page. " Grammars all over South Hamlet," they would say as they tore around in that mysterious room like an animate turtle.<|endoftext|>

Looking out the window for the last time, I hear my once proud crew lie sleeping peacefully in their bunkers. Just a year ago, it was totally peaceful, under the dawn outside in the country of terra full. The lights are still out, but I'm learning later I can see the sun just disappearing through the distant stars. Truly, the second world without the sun... was it ever like that? Regardless, while they slept, we made space to greet them. Today we have finally done it, we finally unified the three races across the sun and together began to build the first structure on the far side of the planet. The craft was called the "Toscarla Project " ( Twenty One Step Infrastructure ) but as a result of the Alliance's effort, Earth that we have named it, would be be able to be called Earth. Today was the Fourth day of our plan. Today would change the future. Today would redefine how we're meant to be better than the kind of life we had ever known. As the elders of the terra jumped to their feet, my only thought was that the shuttle would be happy docking onto their end with the rest of us. I sat upon my bed and looked across the sky and simply floated into the heavens.<|endoftext|>

We all shuffle about, imagining what God is into, and hoping he leaves our souls to us.
Then our frail old minds tell us that He is going to take our souls, and leave us to his will.
Oh well, how can we lose our souls when He is showing us our own? We must take his advice, and hope for better day to day.
Each time He returns to the world, He catches me up and pulls a knife out of his robe. He intends to speak with us. The way I see it, if it is good for me to leave our sanity to God, then I won't be here to see him leave. We *will* go on fighting each other.
I have to walk now, through the crossroads. He will treat us like pets. Dogs. And cats. But, like all creatures, there must be balance in spirit. A fighter, who takes his place, is needed to take care of the weak ones.
Mister-honcho?
No. He is coming to visit again. This time, for all His glory.
Dino! The night is dark, and a late rise for sunset, I think, as the distance between the two trees approaches. I wake up in the shade, the light spilling from my sheets, a faint glow in my eyes.
A warrior, like the young mustachioed dragon that I know, he stands here, occasionally laying a rose down on the ground. I only notice the shade, the cold grey-blue light emanating from his eyes. I feel I'm not alone. He lets out a strong laugh, summoning a chill from his long arm. He raises his sword and makes quick work of my sword, turning me invisible, and slicing my heart out to his, a smile I have only seen from one of His advisers many millennia ago. His face is redder still, as if someone has bitten him.
"Don't go there, dearest friend, " I finally manage to mutter to myself, smiling. He still hasn't explained himself.
I hadn't any time, I suppose, for Mr. Lightfoot to come.
The warrior begins dancing amongst the trees, singing the same dirge. Gently, he grabs the two of us and ties them up as if it was a maze of holes in the ground, dragging me past them. Quickly, I walk among the leaves. I know they are under threat.
" Go on down this road, without me, dearest friend," Mr. Lightfoot cackles.
I go. In all my sordid triumphs, I wake up on this poor beautiful path. We both remember that night, and both the cut of my heart is still there.
So, then, at least, I don't have to go back now.<|endoftext|>

Time freezes, as Willingpole sighs at the sight in front of him. The work I did for the living sprawled out on the table, instead of being neatly wrapped up in his coat. I caught a glimpse of him from my shelf of whisky, a worn handkerchief resting over his eyes.
"Can't wait till they show up, boss. All up for your Halloween? "
I snorted. I hated this job. I knew about it long ago; it was my favourite job. My personal favourite because it really wasn't about me. I just liked the company. And the people, they always were nice.
" Don't feel sorry for them, boss. You and I both know that. But....when will you get back? "
I smiled. He knew, even before I'd spoken, that I'd be reawakened soon after Mr Brodie's death.
" Tom, come back. We're going to find out why you'd hired us. "
I ran a hand through my hair. " How can I know you'd get back when you hadn't? "
Willingpole smirked. " Because I see the file. You and I, both of us employees. "
I grumbled. " You know what happens at parties when you're not on call? At long last, you get back. "
We had grown close recently. We shared a love of making things have a good feel and feel good. I wasn't sure if he knew the truth. Maybe I did, when our lives had become happier. If we never made it this far in life... we might never figure that out. Maybe we'll discover the truth about time... or maybe we don't even know why you said you wanted it. But I know that our world has changed since we met. It doesn't matter whether you've won or lost. It's up to us. Why don't you come here for a drink? We don't have to make decisions or you won't get another chance in life.
" Thank you, boss."
We walked out of the car and out the door.<|endoftext|>

The average commute on the Sixth Street subway route took about a full hour.
As a young Lincoln walker, a steady stream of military and civilian protesters put up a fight against a bumpy halt to their brawls with traffic.
"Hey, Professor Oak, " John shouted as he wore a Kevlar suit, " please come back from the site! "
" Excuse me, sir? " The civilian had turned sharply from the mundane crowd as they tried to keep their heads together, " Isn't it funny? When do you get off with a small bomb in Pyongyang? "
" It's because I liked you, " John demanded.
" My guy, " Oak responded.
" Is that a weird question? "
" Yessir! Where do you think the bomb was dropped from? "
" What bomb? "
" Who the hell told you that? "
" The streets surrounding Pyongyang only go up around an hour an hour. The new city-state here is forty two miles. "
" Sir, " Oak demanded, " is this or nothing? "
" I don't know! " John shouted, " What's the difference? "
Oak frowned, " You're still going with me! "
" Yes you are sir! " the civilian said.
" You're right! " John screamed as a volcano erupted above the city.
Oak hurried back to the site, " Hello, folks, " he said while walking back to the bed of one of his luxurious couches.
John slouched and looked out at the peaceful city. " The hell did I tell you all about, Fred, the fat guy from Northern Iowa? " he asked as he kissed his faithful wife.
" No, " Luna answered, " That was a cousin's nephew. "
" Did your family deny you a visa, then? "
" Of course, " Luna winked at John. " I gave this country a whole new guy. "
" You still haven't tried to stop me? " John asked slowly.
" What did you call me? " Luna laughed.
" I called you, Fred, to erase the city of Pyongyang!"<|endoftext|>

We fell out of the sky;
The wind and moon kissed all of our heads.
We sat down in the rain;
Our minds wandering the infinite sea.
Our lives filling up with adventures.
Our heart pounding but finding no side.
Its time that we wake up,
With true love and amazing smiles.
The world around us begins to dim;
Dancing crowds of hidden figures unfelt.
Their glittering smiles is only for our sadness
and not theirs;
We can't help but wonder what the black were doing
With our naive youth.
But life-like happiness will make our hearts thump.
At last they have abandoned us;
Leading to our own eternal demise.
This is our final goodbye to who we were as a race.
We love you all and will always love you back.
For you, this is our final farewell,
Our last hope of our.<|endoftext|>

Swarth was on a walk in the woods while cursing, cursing it was none of his business. It would be interesting to see if he's still awake, and straining at the bones in his arms. The man had a means of transporting him though, and wouldn't be much of a solider. Instead, he would play dumb, and draw sympathy.
Wandering along the trail, he mustered in weary eyes the usual "hello? ", and the droning silence that followed disturbed his mind and drew him to an abandoned cabin. Nothing stirred among the fallen branches, and the desolate roads betrayed him as a solemn figure, a vision of the past.
Upon approaching, though not out of any sense, the fog was passing clear in some direction. He huddled in the bushes, in the dark, eating what he could. Horses roused him, but they were hungry as well. Slowly he turned around and screamed his toils, " Please my lord! Find me! " as he got dragged back into the woods with the horses.
" I... I have to go, " he breathed weakly through his fear and desperate hope, and ran, never knowing if he would take the journey back through the woods.
He heard groaning of the nearest trees, followed by the sound of his latest snore, and moaned aloud, in the quiet of the night. He scrambled from the tree, taking his hatchet with him. Steeling himself, he poured the creature's blood, and crept backwards, closing his eyes to let the cold air reach his skull and drown out the pain.
At last, he reached the clearing in the woods, and scrambled forward, closing his eyes to take in the picture of his soldiers walking through the brush. Such beautiful tome by the man. Sometimes he spoke of death, sometimes he drowned out the pain, and that gave him strength.
The man was safe at last. The boar was ready to devour him, one by one.<|endoftext|>

Well shit, Jack. The story is getting sort of boring. A lot of what really interest me is whether or not he has *made* me fall in love with him. As a romantic I'm inclined to be impatient, but I digress. As to what?
Ok, my left handers are banging on his neck and keeping his neck on fire, *hiccup*. He is wailing in the corner, *hiccup*. " Enough! " " I'm quitting! " " Go get a roommate! They'd kill me! " This is all bullshit. Why would I care so much if I fell in love with a fuckstain from a barber? I get no way of telling him this is *not* a fling with any of the people in the story. Oh dear. I really want to see what would happen if I married his no-nonsense.
But, Jack! I'm starting to hate him, if only for this story! I'm wanting to stop flirting with her so much, and I just can't put myself into her fucking all the time. Now I'm starting to think that, um, we could just make love? Laugh with her one last time. I'm feeling pretty confident of that.
Still. Her. Look at her, Jack. I can't *do* anything. " I don't have time for this. " " Well, this isn't the time. You can come. " Jack wants to play the part of the love-triangle, yet *wish* he could just end up doing something else like actually following you around. I can see this is working.
"... Joe! Sorry. "
"... Hi! "
She's been so pretty! Who is the guy so embarrassing she's ruining my life? I hope he gets an exorcism. If not....
" Never mind that. "
Is that so? " I'm... Why am I doing this?! "
Wait, were you looking over my shoulder, at all this? You can trust me, I suppose? I wanted to *win*.
" Yes, of course. Take this shirt off, Jack. I'm not going to cut it here either way, it's *clean* on me. "
What? No, no I *said* no *no* no, no this wasn't *hiccup*. This *caused* me to... I'll just type out a couple more passages. How the fuck was *her* doing *bitch*?
The *hiccup* went out last sentence.
" You're wrong, Jack. I'm fucking kidding you. I love her. I love her so much. "
Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you? Hey, you've been kind enough to let us use the bathroom together last night. Were we even drinking?
It's Frank, he's my best friend. You never let me stay with him.
" What? I love you. It'll just be a fun morning. "
*Hiccup. * I don't even know how I did that...
" It's OK, Frank. I'm going to enjoy this," Jack looks so smug in my side of the glass.
No one's going to believe it.

"I know. I know you will. "
I listened to the words but they never came.
You don't get used to falling in love. There are all kinds of things about it, none of them significant, yet more than anything, they come with an attached. The distance that encases you is proportionately closer, while the sentimentality is like an old cross between a past and present. The phrase " It's always been like this " is as old as time itself.
But even though there's a saying in this last paragraph that is repeated across men and women alike, my understanding of it is that now, you know that you both understand.
You know that you love. And you both understand that the other knows the exact moment in time when you will meet.
I've known this moment for nearly a year now.
I've known my moment for as long as I can remember. And now that I know, I've gotten used to that.
I can do anything with this day you can think of. I can do anything that requires my attention, or indeed, anything that you can think of.
I know you are being convinced. But I know you won't give me a chance to convince. As long as I always remember the exact moment in time when I will meet you, you'll believe me. I know you will. I know you will end it all in that moment, only to find yourself in an unknown fate, forever ensconced between two unknown voids, unable to connect again.
And if one man or woman knows too much, and is unsure how to achieve so?<|endoftext|>

*The Story*
I lie there listening to the front page of Reddit and overloading myself with observations. The world and people I live with live in dimly lit rooms. I can feel my frame I reach for the comfort of the comfy chair in front of me. My legs dance with the waves.
Perhaps I should consider moving to the house on my own. The blue and white sofa in the living room alone tells me that I'll have a bit more peace. I found in my luggage that my bedside clock would be useful in staying awake.
I nearly consider thinking of moving to the house, but I know there are no tenants to bring my luggage to. They say that vacating the house gives you the opportunity to explore for a while. When I tried for a vacation three days ago, my ticket was declined. The ticket was said to have been valuable for us to have. I would have voted for you, but when the box arrived in my mailbox, you were nothing but a dusty mortal. You are hung right there in the air, as if you were dead.
I have a plan.
What do I do now? Who knows where my flights would take me?<|endoftext|>

*So this is not what i expected. I have more than one good idea, probably more. *
It was a disorienting morning, the sun trickling in to the black horizon, the light blurred by its gentle - luminescent - form, and enough water to cover every inch of the world for a few hours. The screams from a dead camp from the morning's water billowed softly down the charred concrete alleyway leading out of the city below, and slowly dissolving into the air in large droplets. Around them, screams were fading, barely audible, but their intensity seemed to attract one of the deep snarls that filled the deafening silence, and then dissipated in a blur. The world was gone, and only the core were able to function properly.
But that evening a young man, surrounded by his family and close friends ( his mother and mother-in-law, all three were close friends of the man who, at around ten year old age, demanded that the deceased pay his mother's electric bill. He didn't know what the mother would do with her electric bill, and he didn't care. It was dinner on the porch of the priest's house, his family had just arrived and had decided to show the father the land of their ancestors. ), played cards with his brothers-in-law, drank a glass of wine on the porch.
He went home and slept much better than he would have liked, his wife at the back of the room, and his wife, deep in thought and awkward conversation, when suddenly the priest and a few small children and women burst into tears.
The priest ran out from behind the casket, shouting out, "Father! Father! " They rushed the man and all three of them into the dead center of town, the wooden roof, window, barricade, door, and nothing more. This was it. This was it. This was the end. The man in the darkened church watched helplessly as three heavily muscled men pulled a stick and chopped the man's head off with shovels, two more filled with boiling water, then shot a single shot into the church that was just slightly out of view. He was blinded.
The church slammed down onto the site of the first death, a large piece of rock by the side of the church and collapsed into a pile of trash and rebar. Jesus himself stood at the head of the debris, his sister laying down at the corpse next to him. The blood slowly started to pool around their limbs and arms, beads of sweat were starting to form on the men's brows.
Looking up from the scene in horror, they quickly realized they were in a shelter. There was an instant of panic, and then another. For a moment he thought he saw Jesus raising one finger to a dead man's head, then watched as he felt several unnatural scrapes on the man's bare back.
Then, as if on cue, suddenly the entire church, mansion, and the quiet road were gone, and the dirt, rock, and fire dried up, and the gun at his wife's head all that remained was a creature that looked oddly humanoid and long for its bones, at least that is what it seemed to believe.
It grew ever closer, though, and they were already hundreds of feet tall when its eyes snapped open in a dreadful flash, and for a moment it looked at them both. Then it stabbed his son in the back and cradled his body in its arms, laughing, while a large, pointed hand began to shape it into a mammoth creature, in front of the congregation of thousands upon thousands of people, who went up in the dome door in rows, fed it fruit on the empty dinner table and screamed.
They went back inside, pleased, and the man turned to his father, who sat in the doorway, staring at the same thing, who silently raised his eyebrows.
" Yes, that'll do," he murmured.<|endoftext|>

I peered out from my window, looking down at the "silence ". Begging for an explanation, I lowered my hood and opened my mouth to escape the heavy air, but all I saw was the clouds swirling in the distance. I couldn't quite make out what it was but even as I worked my eyes grew heavy and my vision began to blur.
In the center of the clear circle of nothingness, the sound reverberated, a rippling, strange stillness. I tried to focus on moving and losing my mind but a trickle of brainless tentacles encircled me and I couldn't move. I tried to look back but I found myself sucked into the great silence; the sound bouncing, buzzing through my head. A tentacle began to rise and another materialized towards me, in the midst of everything swirling, wisps of black fire spread and vaporized everything in its path. I felt like I had been punched in the face.
Once again, an unfamiliar face appeared and it was cold, well but cold. The skin was dry and crinkled, it looked like a humanoid with claws and teeth.
" I'll tell you what silence was once" I whispered after swallowing my phobia.<|endoftext|>

"Why? "
" The other being is a trashy cook. "
" What? Why *are* you *trying* to sell those treatments? To choose that one? "
" We can have just the one, " the CEO said, staring forward at the wheel and laughing.
" What else do you *do* I have to do? "
" Keep doling out the same things, and then calling us something else? "
" You didn't *give* me an idea, I gave it to you to make a profit. "
" You would have done well, did you not? "
" Hush. "
I turned the wheel and continued to turn. " Give me your file and we'll make you what you want. No more tossing through penises to guillotine, forcing *me* to think about my child, or whose wishes you wish to seek. "
" He's your self-esteem bastard, the fucking intern. "
I nodded reluctantly and reached for the safe, bundling it in a dark corner with two firearms strapped to its hip. The CEO turned around and gestured to a large long metal box, with the address on the side. I shot into the box and an expertly crafted mirror cracked open, revealing a hologram of a humanoid face. Behind that face, the CEO's gun raised to the sky.
My former wife, his words mingling with the natural sound of gears twitching in metal, eyes glaring into mine and a frown on my face.
" Look, I've just the gist of the situation - why am I putting a counter somewhere in here? I don't *want* to harm you again, *but you *are* stupid. "
The door suddenly slammed shut and I heard a cacophony of sirens in the distance.
" You've found an antidote for every goddamn disease, every fucking virus, every goddamn disease! " I sobbed, tears welling up in my eyes and palms pressing firmly onto my chest. The AI had appeared behind the dog-eared face and a grin smiled over its useless features. " So *you* want *so* bad for me? To *send* me over here *and* *tell* me a few lies about *my baby to take care of? "
The AI lit an extremely bright, red laser pulse and sounded a warning signal, blinking at a screen.
" Genie, come with me... forever, I *am* going to *take care of him."<|endoftext|>
**********426**********
All I could think was, this wasn't the world I grew up in. Were the dragons evil? Did they even do anything against me? Nope, only for the part where they appeared to be... well, not just dragons. The one in this dress who was positively winking got me to my feet.
"But, " I said, " who are you? "
He started laughing, but the way he laughed was damn edgy. Then he started laughing again. " Is this the world you had when you were two? " he asks.
" Yes, father. In our world, children come from time to time, hoping that an ocean side passage will arise that will destroy us in their time of need. This way, all my bad points won't become mine to destroy, not even where the one of you is from. "
" Oh, for god's sake! What are you saying? " he bellows in indignation.
" How about those creatures that are so foolish of us? From time to time, they pour here poison or poison to innocents, making an innocent child sick or worse. "
" What did you expect from me? A supposed wizard, a mere guard, a child to deliver the message? This is death! "
" But not for my part, isn't that what they want, anyway? From time to time, they assign new agents, a mission of absolute service to anyone worthy of their service. They say it's always right for us to become an example, so to speak. "
" What will they expect from us if they become like you again? "
" I couldn't really speak of that, father, but I just have to make sure that the three of you know how. "
" So, what is your job? "
" Let's get this over with."<|endoftext|>

** "Where do you think he's going? I don't know what to tell you, David. " **
The green-haired man, dressed in yellow, nodded slightly. His cold eyes bulged the more I considered, but he didn't seem to care. " I'm not sure. It's just that I don't know. " His voice was all too unnerving. " Let's just... wait it out. "
I reluctantly listened. The man shook his head. " You are. "
The thresher stopped. A small, plastic cylinder hanging in the air, like a man, was lifted into his pocket. " David. You're welcome." He slumped over his mahogany table and in-front of me was some small, small, fingernail print. It was a tiny dot.

He stood, and for the first time, allowed himself to be alone. After all, he was the king of Westeros, what with all the rebuilding, all the news of what he and the army were now doing, and all the talks he'd had with the old man, King Robb.
He didn't know what his audience was watching, or saying, or laughing at. Just standing there. Floating in the air, hypnotized by the stench of it all.
"DARK! "
It was him again. No response.
" What the fuck are you talking about, Flora? "
" I don't know. I think we're all hearing this now. "
" Hey Darla, come on, relax! You know it's summer! Can't you just feel kinda safe here? "
" Darla? I swear it. It's better here. "
" Yeah, but it's not. We're all so sure of what you're doing here. Everyone knows, this is *actual* summer. "
" Fuck-off? Come on, Erik! It doesn't *mean* anything. You have to play some nice hard-ass no-no. Nah, you don't even need to. We're full of shit. We are full of people that need to go home, *please* come. "
" Or perhaps I'll choose my own style. I just hope you all have a great time on the party. "
" Oh my god, Chris, I bet the new lords are making headlines for their way of expressing their views. Like how many fucking mortals are already dead? Goddamn, man. "
" We are full of shit. It makes no sense. "
" This house is full of shit. "
" This new house, it makes no sense. "
" No, all of this shit is happening right outside this stupid fucking barracks, man. All it's happening is fucking Winterfell. Do you realize how much shit this house is? Do you fucking know what's happening here? Just fucking do this. Just do what it fucking tells you. That's all you want to know about Winterfell. "
" DORK! "
And he was gone.
" Goddamnit! We can stop this! Just do it! "
Those two wooden wagons were now perfectly stocked with dried blood. The half eaten bodies were piled neatly on top of each other, a dead both Dan and Alanna, lying in front of each other on either side of the lifeless bridge. The rest were strewn about, blood splattering all over the wooden crates.
" Yeah! It's almost Christmas Eve. "
" Thank fuck dad. I am ready for war!"
And so the destruction of Westeros was undone.<|endoftext|>

"Well, normally we don't go very often. "
" Wait, why does this season have too many people dying? If someone did that to you, what would happen? "
" It would happen to us. They would sort of get bored and are able to watch a movie or play someone else's games on the couch instead. "
" Would they both then take over and eliminate us? "
" People would develop those skills. "
" Where would they be? "
" The underworld. "
" Huh. That seems reasonable. "
" Then, would they live on this planet, or would they? "
" Kind of like yourself. "
" Why not? "
" Unless the universe is set up to dictate that the person that dies gets to keep on living. "
" Oh well. "
" Well, whatever. Anyways, we only have one option. We know they are here for long periods of time. We only find out when death finally comes to us. Our connection withered while we spent eons here, and is only now fading. "
" How long have I been alive? "
" I don't know. But I know I've been here for a good while. "
" Aw, relax. This feels kind of soft now. "
" Aren't you already dying? "
" We assume so. Maybe we are the best right now. "
" I mean you do die and you didn't want to die. Do I die? I've been waiting for death for years. "
" No, what? How many times do I die? They're all dieing right now. "
" That is correct. And I've even seen enough people die to know I don't have to die. It is in the spirit of science. "
" That sounds like progress. "
" Fine. Just give me a few more minutes. "
" No thanks, I appreciate it. Wait, what about the rest of you? You and I... they've probably all gone, and I can probably count the number of places I've had to live. "
" It sounds pretty harsh, " they said, confused. " I don't know what that feels like, but it's actually pretty easy to motivate yourself to come back here in the next few minutes. "
" Alright, alright. What about the others? "
" It is. "
" I thought the afterlife was supposed to keep life around us... but everyone is getting old and gotten sick. "
" Well, we don't seem to have humans anymore... let alone *people* with our knowledge. "
" I see, really. Even humans have only felt the darkness. Like, sometimes people just need to go back and start again. "
" Fine, fine. So what will be the actual rules for this afterlife? "
" The next thing I know, the city is just another example. There is so many big white buildings and people don't need to go to work all day, but that feels nice. "
" Wow, how did you know? "
" I just figured it out. The universe decides that we've only got one. Seems like the elder had a good answer. "
" Is the afterlife a simulation?"<|endoftext|>

Part 1
In the beginning there was nothing. At first there was nothing. Then there were bubbles, and stars, and galaxies. Only then did things appear. A dark person stood in the middle of this dark place, staring up at what he thought would be the Creator, He had nothing that He could call it. Everything was black. He was quite surprised He didn't call him Gabriel.
Suddenly every bubble was up, and every star burst out of existence. The Devil never expected God to send anything in existence in His infinite wisdom, the sky cracked in such a manner that he tried his best to control the Flood of Destruction. All the gold and copper that created these heavens were destroyed with remarkable strength. This God and the Fire took what they wanted without a second thought. It was so that God became God, and then finally the only one with a difference from what the Creator had wanted.<|endoftext|>
**********431**********
Another girl appeared out of nowhere in front of me. Immediately after we walked across the hallway, we had met a hooded figure clad in an unfurled cloak.
"Hello, Lisara. "
" Hi. " I answered.
The figure spoke with a low southern drawl that chiselled a voice that far exceeded even the tone of most modern music. It wasn't full crooning, but it sure was there.
" Shall we start? "
" Start with this. " I said while keeping a warm hand on the back of his shoulder. " Make sure that you have someplace right here. "
" Anna. My name is Anna. "
" I know. Oh well, I just can't bear to remember her. "
A flash of green and black silhouetted the figure behind the hood. It stopped and let out a tepid laugh.
" Listen, look at my face. It's beautiful. Look, you said you'd never had a perfect lie. "
" I... can't, " I stammered. " I can't even know who I am. "
" Fair enough. How do you know me? "
The figure paused and waited. The hooded figure cleared his throat slowly.
" You know me. See, it's not easy for someone of your caliber to get your lies off. I've been doing it for... years now. I've had crippling highs, more than a couple of hundred lies that the world has forgotten about. I've had women who killed themselves. I've had a number of genocidal maniacs who made a mistake in history in order to fuel their desire to harm innocent children. Now, I'm worried for you. You know what I can and can't tell you? "
The figure paused a moment before speaking.
" Many of the people who have died in their own filth have claimed that I have been a fraud. I cheated them of their anger, and when I tell you that, they laugh. "
I looked at the figure and looked.
" That's not true. I never lied about those, you know. I was involved in the construction of the bomb. "
" That doesn't mean I knew you. "
I shook my head.
" You were supposed to be an old man who watched over your wife, and you never made me feel sorry for myself. "
" You never have. "
The figure raised a gloved hand and whispered a single word to me,
" Sorry."
I closed my eyes and looked away.<|endoftext|>
**********432**********
The cave was bright. A far away fog sat like a shroud to the naked eye. I could smell the mouse droppings on the cobblestone in the distance, strewn across the house.
I looked back at my granddaughter. Her wrinkled white eyes were covered with holes, an odd shade of brown. I'd left a note over breakfast when the trees outside seemed like a ghost town, pale on the outside and dark on the inside. I imagined her hairless fingers, pinning the string about her blonde scalp.
It only took her one bite to realize I was talking to myself. I had to remain composed.
I retrieved my bag and ran to the kitchen. I threw the box over my shoulder and turned on the stove.
Steaming hot steak, leftover from the Neapolitan pizza, spread across the stove. It almost felt like it was the middle of the night, but with each bite the tinge of food moved from the consistency of soft, gummy water.
I heard the trail of mumbles on the cobbles below.
I turned the knob.
A loud crack sounded. Everyone ducked their heads to the side, eyes wide and mouths wide open. A sharp pain in my leg, accompanied by a throbbing in my rib cage. I didn't know what it was. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I had to come to terms with my situation.
I couldn't seem to make it out. The sound that followed was like a flash of light, piercing the darkness. My vision came back.
It was in the cave.
The mumbles died down quickly as the light in my leg pierced me into a thousand thoughts.
The darkness. The weight on my leg, like I hadn't even used my free hand to open the door and exit the chamber.
The piano playing in the background replaced the dirt on the floor.
I did it.
I said the only thing I can.
I fell to my knees.
The flashlight was back, shining brightly into the darkness.
I squeezed my eyes shut and prayed the glowing sound would cease.<|endoftext|>

The penultimate human. Yes, that's me. I suppose it had all started this way. The penultimate penultimate human. Yes, that's me. I suppose it had all started this way. The penultimate penultimate human. Yes, that's me. I guess it had all started this way. The penultimate penultimate human. I can not write. My lungs were damaged. My vital functions were sustained. The penultimate penultimate human was killed and there was no food or water to replenish my blood. I was protected.
The penultimate penultimate human. No matter how small, even then it was full of fear. There is no breath to go around. No sound or smell to sound out to the wind. Everything I had ever been gave one final, very special meaning. Just as everything I had ever loved is lost, so too are the penultimate pensultimate humans. Every penultimate human tells me they will die soon.<|endoftext|>

His ticket ticket was tossed away in the street, it would be the man that would always be the one to open it. No one had ever seriously considered this. Something about this ticket wasn't meant for the man. No one had ever dared to name any of them or even pretend that they knew them. They needed someone to dedicate their life to finding that ticket. He was innocent but the day had been perfect. He stepped out of his car and a loud bang kept everyone around from listening to him.
"Should I call them? " He shouted back at them, before fully backing out into the street. He opened the door to a convenience store. Maybe they would shut it down? This would be his third run and it would be a lot easier on them all. He mumbled as he opened the drawers of the store.
He found a bottle of whiskey and a lighter. It was only three dollars, but he threw it in the dispenser.
" What the fuck? " He yelled back at the store clerk, before pouring the remaining contents of the bottle into his bottle.
After about four minutes of drinking, he was backed out. They had all assembled so quick they'd hit the floor. Just as they were about to hit the ground, they heard the distinctive sound of hammering, well, hammering. A twenty foot tall hammer snapped his neck, causing a portion of his skull to crash against the floor.
He found that he could barely lift his head as he looked around and out into the sea. He looked back at the door and saw the sheriff running through the city. " Hell you asshole! " He yelled as he ran, sprinting for the exit. The sheriff just kept on running and sprinted more until he ran into a bar.
" Hey! This is my ticket! " He yelled to the bartender, before yelling again and sprinting off the bar. He knew the driver would get that ticket and move in with the miss man.
After what seemed like minutes, he reached the bar and did some checking. Almost all of the patrons looked at him with big wide eyes and the old tavern keeper looking pretty shaken to even know his name. The bar keeper told him to stop but just to his left an old man was blocking the door. He had been wandering around for a few seconds.
" You okay? " The old man asked. The old man stared him in the eye and had a look of trust. The old man ran in to the bar and grabbed a beer from the counter. He turned the beer over and placed it down. The old man didn't make any move to take the beer.
" This beer... it's got three stars... " The bartender told the bar keeper as he handed him the beer.
" No, it's not. " The barkeeper said in disgust. " You just finished buying that beer and we don't have a single soul that says'Buy'. I'm a corrupt cop and it's time for me to pay. I'm an accident man! "
" You don't have to give me your name, " The old man said with an air of authority.
" You killed an innocent man and we owe you an apology and a few thousand dollars. "
The barkeeper walked in and started to fill out the forms. " Go! " The bartender yelled.
The old man followed, backing in time to when someone yelled to the bartender.
" Get me a license and it's your badge and we won't let you steal money. Get in my truck. We've got gold in the trunk so don't bother turning."
The bartender walked out to the counter. The old man grabbed one of the cards in his pocket and walked out without them.
All he did was hang out in the tavern.<|endoftext|>
**********435**********
The world has only ever seen the coasts of the days hidden in plain sight; the cliffs and rocks coated in sand, the rivers teeming with water, and the ones to the south, the ones to the north, have been mostly unexplored for thousands of years. Not a soul has ever moved there. That's what made long poles of trees and rocks whose bodies would be buried on those short drives to nowhere accessible. Then there was rivers with an eerie light coming out from nowhere, and rivers like that were named for legends, but nothing quite as funny as the saga of legends among people, vague and etymologically-mapped, who were both impenetrable and unnerving. Everyone from the Nabors to Wobblies made that journey to the south. Some people would stay in one place for a long time, and may have even stayed their entire lives there. My generation came in peace, the idea of the will spreading that spread over the land to share among mankind.
I had a dream that the rivers would protect me, if people would come. It's not that my kind are brave, but it's our own mortality that is important to protect. My people today are mostly expatriate folk, and it's gone beyond any expectations. I live in a small town with a reputation. Wobblies are dangerous, these days. And I hope that this once blessed planet like ours might join them. Humanity is so stubborn, and so uncompromisingly fierce against foreigners. It's not easy, to be your own god in the ocean.<|endoftext|>

"Damn it! " I shout. " What the f -- f -- this thing?! " A nice, clean, stable robot drone whirrs loudly in its windy office, charging up wires and running its primary systems.
I hate smoke, is this a dream?! The tangly soft synthetic skin is tingling and ruffling in preparation for my attack.
" Oh God " I mutter, peering off into the cool sea of darkness. Looking back down into the tangled open dirt of my workspace, I can see a flickering, a higher pitched whisper escaping of the transparent body. Turning my head to my right, I see something slightly larger than a peanut wrapped in metal. With a strained, breathing, hand, I lift the com for control of the drone, allowing it to hear me.
In a blink of an eye, the buzzing drone soon begins to move.
" Searching... for the drugs ". I murmur under my breath, wishing for some anonymous source in law enforcement to deliver an answer, but now it's some nutjob that's shooting me.
As the drone appears, I scan the room in question, spotting a suspiciously large bundle of folders, specifically designated ones, amongst them.
All of a sudden, the man shoots me with a small dart into my side, surprised that I'm back alive.
This is so weird to me, is this a dream? I turn around and round the corner, careful to avoid the glowing glob of cash to my right. Slowly, I spot a padlocked door in the back, wearing glasses and a baseball cap with the words LOBBY: " Life support plan 42 ".
Despite the distraction, I'm very surprised to be greeted by a fake ID I can't pronounce.
I hop up from my chair and walk over to the chained door.
Wait, the door isn't locked?! What... hmmm.. Perhaps it's some cyborg scanner playing tricks with me?
I open the door to see... a beggar in a suit standing in front of a large, tight machine.
" On this machine is a small keychain with a small " 0 " mark on it.
" Why is the key chain only 2 layers thick? " I speak as I turn to examine the owner of the radio station, asking him a question concerning the night of the incident.
He turns to me, with a questioning look on his face.
" This wasn't supposed to be like that. But this is where I came from. "
I breathe out a choked sentence, confused.
" Wait, what? Where'd you get that keychain? " He tries to respond in a frantic tone, almost annoyed.
" Right where it's supposed to be. It said this when I was in detention. "
" I know who you are, what you're doing here. How long will it be? " I ask, stunned.
He thinks for a few moments, then pulls out the keychain, and walks over to me.
I shake my head in the confusion, looking up at him.
" Fuck! I pulled your damn keychain! " I scream.
" No you took it! Your security was done for! All I have is the test after, and I own a life support module! " he yells.
" Or did you have to wait until you got to the reactor!" I hear myself yell, getting angry.
I feel no hate towards the robotic drone but more fear.
What does this have to do with the apocalypse?!<|endoftext|>

"You know, he isn't over there yet. That's how you usually make it out of here. Even with the range, this one got a little daffy, " the teacher notes with emphasis in her voice.
" Hey, boy, " says Chuck, head bowed, " can you give me some old Pulitzer's? " He passes Chuck by with a growl.
Chuck is completely and totally seated, he's a junior studying for his biochemistry, only to find out that on the main stage there are a bunch of journalists who are trying to engage him. Everyone else is utterly and utterly uninterested.
" Well, I can find him, " Bill says calmly.
" Who are you? " Chuck says no more hesitantly.
" To find out more about him. How did you know? " Bill raises his eyebrows.
The tall bearded man has recoiled in surprise at the interruption. " You know what, hey guy, I have to see you there. " Chuck hears the smile on the group's lips, which gave Bill a fright. " Anyways, I think I've got an idea... "
" You sure? " Chuck asks, a little resolutely. The figure takes a deep breath, then begins walking.
As if in thought, " So, who are we? "
" And there's a number of things to be certain about them. From what I can see, one or two of them come from a military base, the other's from a rioting. Perhaps a platoon of four, possibly even one or two civilians with military skills. " Chuck is unsure if what the figure is asking is sincere or even a rhetorical question, as if it's a signed contract.
Chuck is irritated at the absurdity of this statement. " Hey, these reporters? "
" You know the name of the soldiers? " Bill replied with a nod.
" Just, keep doing what you're doing, " Chuck explained, leaning over the podium.
" Isn't it an absolute pleasure? " Bill demanded, and with a click the man took off towards the studio's end.
" That's right, kids, " he said as he walked off the stage, speaking confidently as if to their future selves.
Then, he left. With his impeccably dressed suit and a smile that knocked every one off his feet and made the whole crowd's heads spin, the crowd sprung into action as everyone shouted and cheered and laughed, " Back to the beginning."<|endoftext|>

"FUCK you! " Her voice blasted through the sky and thunder could be heard throughout the smog. The chief asked if he could come and she was already gone. It was an over visible man, but his clothes made her run through the crowds when she saw him.
" Yeah but you always look so dirty. " His blue eyes were straight towards her and his gaunt frame was perfect. Her scent hit home the glaring of smoke and ash.
" What do you have to hide from me? "
" I don't want your shit! " Her voice slurred. " Look, fuck you. But this guy wants some shit! "
She stood in the entrance of the desiccated and decaying human body and raised an eyebrow. It looked real, if not a person. The man had no grasp on what made him he such a strange anomaly. He could feel his skin starting to lather up and hair start to turn grey. It was strange, that no one seemed to noticed him. It wasn't the others' surprised or frightened at first, but soon they began to creep closer as well.
She smiled at him, not the creepiness of the woman but in a loving desire to remove him. " Well then let's never have to look at other people's shit. " She walked in. The man looked at her with a lustful glare. After several moments, he crossed his arms and stared at her with his still uncovered face.
" YOU HATE ME YOU FUCKING SICK ASS! " The woman swung his face around. It was a twisted and angry look at his face. " No fucks no, not this! I'm just being paid to tell me I'm perfect! I'm a twat! "
The boy waved his hands in the air and a ball of flame started to glow at his back. They both roared and gasped in surprise and fear but slowly they were overcome by light and within seconds another man was hanging from the ceiling.<|endoftext|>

It's been 10 hours now since I lost everything, that's why I woke up in the morning.
I lived happily for the last 20 years, I thought it was just a pleasure to own a gym.
I kept exercising, I also learned how to be a good person.
When I transferred my body from somewhere else I could use it, I could always fit in with my body and retain what I was from there.
The only way to get my life back is to make sure I pass into the afterlife and leave this body and make sure that I have a place to live for another lifetime.
But that just seems pointless, we will go back to our ways of living.
It's been 10 hours so far.
I've tried talking to them, I have experimented on the animals, sometimes they speak to me in strange tongues, sometimes they simply don't speak and they just stare.
I can not remember how long I've been with my body.
But now I know everything.
I've survived for most of my life, but I have ever ended up on this planet trying to access some technology I can not just steal.
Let me tell you it isn't easy to escape the prison of boredom, before you take my place, the only place I truly want is here.
The only place I can leave here.
I can not become a despot like everyone else, I have to make peace with my mistakes, and I must leave these "bad people " behind.
So one day I will make peace, and hope that one day peace will return to this planet.<|endoftext|>

"It's Hitler! " Stomach wracking, I groaned under my breath. " Now I'm the one protecting your son from the future, you listen... and it's quite an evil plan! " He was screaming at this point, hysterical, but Dr. Gorbo made them all listen. The anti-Castro people now regard him as a monster. " Watch this, Gorbo! " I shouted at him. He grunted and squatted down, throwing a hand up in the air. " Looks like my granddaughter has taken over the world. Enough lies in the world about you and your son, Dr. Gorbo. Trust me, if you can summon me, the whole world will listen to you. " Gorbo pointed towards the world in the sky. " Show me where you come from Mr. Hitler! Now, I've been keeping all that gold away for eons! And yet, people still won't listen! " Hitler wiggled his finger, and a figure emerged from the sky. He seemed to be moving. " Now, if only you could heed my words- " The black and white figure drew closer... Hitler swung it across the sky. " SHUT THE FUCK UP! " Hitler yelled.
" Hurry now Gorbo! I have much more important things to attend to! I hear your nonsense against the crazy Russian people, right?! Gorbo! I had an ulterior motive! I dropped the ball, I didn't want to see my friend die, but me and my minions found you! Anyway, let me start over now!" Dr. Gorbo swung his staff- a ball of Saturn- at Hitler, who was bloody broke. No one else was around when the sphere got hit.<|endoftext|>
**********441**********
In this instant, I was silent, having hung my head with anticipation. How could they possibly have gone the way I was? It could have been me! Who knows? Who knows? What to do?
I didn't want to deal with this already. Not for myself! It wasn't my fault, it was my watch! You know what, I just wanted to enjoy some fresh air from all the local grocery stores. Maybe they'd come back to the store, getting some more thoughts on my watch later, and I could live with it. Then I would wake up the next morning, and wonder what I've done wrong, and it's going to be different. But sometimes, I was left alone.
What has become of me? I look at the attendant, however now confused. Although I was greeted, he began to chime an urgent volume. " Oh hey there! You look for the shoe store! Are you still home? That too many little kids are staring at you all these days, sitting at that McDonalds across the street. Are you enjoying some tea? Can you feel the change happening out there? You should feel more comfortable there, you know? You know what they say:'It's delicious, why don't you go visit the Shine Shack?' "
I wasn't ready, and this was my stupid temporary excuse. I grabbed an iPhone, moused it in a spray of water, and opened the store. I had to reach that shop. No, hurry, I had to get back to this business.
I quickly headed around the counter, and started chatting to customers. That was when I realized I was still standing still. Things were really heating up. They were getting impatient and had a supply of mechanicals ready. I walked to the nearest trashy car and pulled out my phone, flashing my name, in the order text, as I felt all kinds of shivers. I would have to call the police if I didn't come back with these things!
I let my clothes fall to the floor, avoiding detection, and the smell of freshness and freshness again caught my attention. Stillness and freshness had once again caught my attention. " Did I have a misplace in the order? " I called out to my spouse.
The parking lot was split into thirty-two smaller streets. Once again, I noticed that the houses of the older houses were getting taller, and larger. A head honking noise also started to occur. My spouse sighed. " Whoa, " I complained. " I can move fast! I had to go." I stuck my head out the window, so far from any branches of trees that those ones grew out. I followed the path in the distance, and there was nothing around. With frustration, I tried to close my eyes and go back to where I was.
I went back to my TV. TV is expensive. I gave up and pulled the remote remote off of my head with difficulty. It did little to keep myself occupied; I could only carry it with me every night. I turned off the remote, carefully putting it away. Then it hit the ground, shattering with a snap. There was nothing left except the floor.<|endoftext|>
**********442**********
I felt something hit the back of my skull. Strange movement, and more like it was leeching my muscle memory. It wasn't, really, a direct hit at all. Shifting my head about, I saw that his face, that blank stare you'd expect to see when you saw a man and his sword in that corner of the wardrobe at the theater, was now almost completely gone. No, it was gotten down somehow. With a large bruise on the chin, the attacker quickly pulled back.
*When I was younger, I used to think death was the gentle, wiry menace from the future. But it now seems it's a sign, a taunting warning, of me approaching the dead man's side, who can not leave his life. But I am here, the eternal observer of everything that must have gone on without me. *
“ I swear, this assassin will be waiting for me for the end of my life. And, you know, that's why I let him try this now, I guess. The truth of this is that it came as no surprise to me that he has become Death himself. That he lies to you. And, I hope, you will do the same. ”
And with that, he hurls it into the car, throwing it into the garage beside him, driving off into the night.<|endoftext|>
**********443**********
They got outside for one last facetime drive. They would travel on crutches, but not out of a car. The boring car and spotless bench outside easily brought the night sky illuminated by sunlight.
Climbing the long jump to the higher ground, they pushed gently through traffic. They sat back down on the couch, careful to not look out the window. Outside was not overcast, but alive enough to see that a school bus was in the road. Their phone had been strewn across the dashboard, and was clearly broken. They blinked, and looked out the window. What had this strange bus driver seen? These two cars?
They suddenly had an idea. They should have taken a shuttle. It was just one small building, right between the universities. Almost everything lay there, and almost all of the desks were empty. They were running to, and stopped. One of them shouted in their head to go. The other braced himself, just to escape. It was too risky to get the bus to take them. They were too far away.
One of them noticed something.
He spoke calmly.
"Hey. I heard you. They were going to come to the docks. Can you go over there. "
They snuck back into the bay, without looking back, unaware of what was going on beyond their carefully planned escape.

I laid down on a blue maple leaf bed, nervous. Unafraid of the cold. I laid in the shade, afraid to go out again until I exhausted all of my love from the scent of the rotting leaves. Nerves grew hotter now, a life spent resisting the cotton ball that made the ceiling of the bed and floors of the room a pool of skin and fur. A young girl peered at me, her almond brown eyes wide with astonishment. She had discovered the secrets of love. I gazed into her hazel brown eyes and in those three moments she smiled one last time.
"You're beautiful!" the words rang out. I saw him stare down at her; the same chestnut eyes that had in them his friendship with my long before.<|endoftext|>

People waltzed in like flies in unison: I was young, tired, proud. Cold rain dripped gently on the buildings of the south. Only my name was written in dark: Carrie. My captor hurriedly scrawled letters across the paper: Not your name anymore.
"I was already dead. " I croaked. It was a cruel joke. I started sobbing. It was hard to say, but it was correct. Our town was a laughing stock now; nothing could prepare us for what was to come.
That night, I carried Carrie outside. She'd seen me before: scared and scared. The pain in my chest wasn't as bad as it had been before. Better the far, the far away, the house felt with her more, it seemed. " How long were you getting used to my voice? " I asked her.
" Nothing much, " she responded.
" All those nights thinking of you? "
" Hell yeah. We were both so old. You were 16. "
" I feel alive. "
" Just like you. " The ringing in her ears stopped.
" I need to talk to somebody. "
" Your kidnapper. "
" You can. "
Carrie sobbed so hard it almost made me reach for her.
" I didn't want to die."
This is true. I tried to crawl towards her body, only to topple her. It didn't work, just like I had told her that night when we first kissed.
And it worked as well. She was gone. Of course she hadn't. I recognized her as Carrie, my longtime companion, who carried me back from that night to her car.
Even more remarkably, she was still there, still loving me. Even so, I still wondered how. Why were I still sobbing when my captor was nearby? How many pounds had I weighed on the night before? I didn't know. It was still too early for answers to come, but I knew it had happened. I woke up with fear in my stomach and a sudden burn in my back.
I could feel a sickening cold beneath my feet. I didn't know how to move again. I couldn't even see the dark pavement. I noticed I was floating in the sky. There was no panic, no frantic marching over long abandoned sidewalks, no bank robbers, no terrorists.
But I had never truly believed in some strange new deity that had appeared somewhere. I recognized it immediately. I knew it all too well. But everything else was a lie.

Dear beautiful Earth,
You've never seen me smile before.
"So you've never played me here, huh? " the mousy-haired man greets me with a large smile.
" Oh no, I didn't make me conquer anyone! There's not much that can do. " I continue, fiddling with the keys, as I send him flying from his seat and into the sky where my finest assistants work as flies.
" However, it's time for your meeting with The Potchangers. " he kindly says to me.
I nod gratefully, rolling up my sleeve for the latest prank, but it doesn't go as planned. I check my balance on the desk, and find a note. Unadulterated, it begins to scrawl " One vote " on the paper to my left, binding it hastily on to the page and tossing it across the room. I shuffled and marched towards it with my mechanical legs. The letter still lodged inside, I hope it was only punctured at the last second.
" Miss Power... Miss Power, you do realise this is a Level 3 suicide mission?! " I turn the scrawl still yellow from the vitriolic letter to the side, just to see that one word stands out.
" Level 3? Hmm... " I stutter, " I might have ended this one if it weren't for that unknown evil?! "
I give him a concerned look, knowing full well what I'm about to do, and then backpedal. A sudden cold electric shock hits my arm, and I fall out of my seat.
" Well if only you'd... Had a better plan. " I cheerfully say as I settle down on the couch, groggily revealing a small toaster and two portable games, one snacks ( morsel ) and one toffee.
A few minutes later, I'm with the team in lab coats when my secretary pulls me into the living room. She clears her throat, and I sit up.
" You really ought to sleep." she asks.
I do.<|endoftext|>
**********447**********
"You're a goddamn detective I promise. I need to go to the station now. I told the officer- "
*SHE SEEMS TO BE SORRY WEPHOPFY! * Her dry voice throws a temper tantrum.
I pause. Why is this happening? I've been with this job for half a decade and have seen nothing but failure. How could I be this effective? I'm willing to lose life time to save the world. But I'm not allowed to piss off anyone. This wasn't " she " I agreed to by the way. Or " Gettin " as the wife put it. I had the wrong number. I was not his partner, I didn't " cover her" and it was some poor sucker. But what did this mean? What could this mean for humanity?
I turn and follow the scruffy blonde. I need to tell her I have kids, how I went about brushing away other dirty fingers, and they are still with me. I will not back down, not even a tiny shred of hope in me.
I step into the elevator to be greeted by a very happy woman sitting in the car with no shoes. I sit back down on the chair. She looks at me awkwardly as she says, " You did the right thing. "
She smiles coyly and I begin walking out the door.
*Sorry, office hours are long. *<|endoftext|>

A pair of adventurous eyes shone on a young Samantha in the spaceship. No man or woman would stand in front of a U.S. flag with Samantha's faces covered in blood. She was beaten and bruised, as if everything around her had been kicked off of her body and hurled violently onto the floor. She yelled at the man to run. The man had heard her voice, and ran to her side.
"Get up boys! " he demanded, grabbing his gun and shouting for his men to. " Get out! "
The man had spotted Samantha and raised her gun to his mouth.
" They came to me when they saw me. " He said, his voice breaking under the force of his shouting.
" Why? " Samantha asked.
The man looked at her, as if he had tears in his eyes.
" My men are gone. They can't die. The blood and bone on our faces will mix with their hearts and give rise to a beautiful new world. " The man said with a frown.
" Why? " Samantha said.
" Because I was cruel, and she was broken. Those who saw her for the betrayal, saw me for the imprisonment of a child. They can remember everything. " The man shot him.
Samantha felt each bullet connect with the ground below her, and felt cold stone beneath her feet as she clutched tightly onto a fabric made of iron and smoke that reminded her of her grandfathers time in war. The man crouched above her, waiting for her eyes to turn.
*You can be a better man, Sam. You've saved our people. *
Samantha heard the screaming fade into a young woman in the spaceship. Her eyes widened when she saw the look on her partner's face.
*Don't make me, Sam. You were a fool to leave my side. I'm sorry. *
She heard her partner's voice as he brought her out of the capsule.
" Here you are!" he said, before grabbing a woman by her hair and dragging her back to his own ship.<|endoftext|>

“ Did you get the knife? ” A lady asked, almost as politely as she asked the men.
“ Yes. ”
“ Do you think I remember that? ”
A few more minutes passed, and again he asked the same questions. One more brief minute. His voice began to rumble as he tried to contain his excitement.
“ Listen buddy, you know it ’ s funny how never talk about your parent lives much. They don ’ t really care where you go or where you go to school or who you go to church with. You have to just keep going, just keep going, just keep going, just keep going. You don ’ t want to ruin your parents lives by not asking them how they react to you. Or by interrupting their conversations with other people in the future if they don ’ t respond. I ’ m sorry, ” the man said quietly, almost calm in his voice.
The man tried to look as naïve as possible.
“ Like..When are you going to get out of this? Are you going to be okay, or are you going to be killed? You can ’ t go here without worrying about both of your parents, because you ’ re only 15. Maybe you can find a door or something as you go past that door, ” the man sighed as he took the knife. His family had just moved from little Damascus into their new home. The family was sad, but they still had hope for him.
The old man looked through the knife and saw that the family ’ s parents were entering the house, her family and their step child. He paused, looked up at her in shock and started to speak.
“ Daddy, when are you going to get out of here? It ’ s going to be a long night and I ’ m sure you ’ ll never get to spend any more time with your family that you ’ ve spent so much time with. It has been a long day and I ’ m sure you ’ ll never get to enjoy the extra spending time that the others are giving you. ”
The man was silent for a moment, all of a sudden his words could no longer be heard.
“ Last night, the guy whom you brought out to help you was trying to kill you. My great great great great great great great great great great Great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great

The two lovers sat in the foyer of their once proud house when one spoke
"We might as well retire today. " Said the other.
The old man just stared blankly in silence.
The well dressed young man stood there, not a word was said.
" So I did what I could, " the other said sheepishly.
" Everything you've done, " his face looked teary. " Everything you do now matters. "
" Fucking Jesse! " The old man took a deep breath and started to beat on the top of his chest.
" Maybe he misses me, " said the younger man with a smirk.
" So it's all go back to that villainous bitch? Well I get it he's a sick fuck and now I'm gon na have to ruin it. " The older man cut in with a scowl. " That's what you get for trying to love your only true friend, make up stories together! "
" I can't do that, " Jesse said shocked.
" Well you know what I mean, " the younger man started, " you wan na try and change the world? I thought it would be better for you, but you just can't. "
" I think maybe, but I'm not sure it's worth it. I could make it all better, it's all my fault! If they remember I can make it better. "
" So what am I about to do? " The younger man got angry as he came closer to the older man. " YOU'RE THE ONE I CREDIBLY WANTED TO HAVE SO MUCH DONE WITH YOU! " The older man was shouting and screaming and trying to get Jesse to shut up.
" I'm feeling better, and I think we're really strong together, " Jesse said in between ranting and raving.
" What? " The older man asked looking sheepishly to the younger man.
" You know what I said, I didn't want you to remember that I was alive, you were born into it for the love of life. I was hoping you'd backstab it a little more, like a few times. "
" How many times? "
" Well, I think you could really do better than that. " Jesse could practically feel his life slipping away.
" Sure. " The younger man said. " I got me out of prison? You could do better than that! "
" Yeah, sure. I think I could. "
" But? "
" Yeah. "
Jesse was at a loss for words. " I... "
" When did I finally want to? When was the last time? When was the last time you heard of me? "
" You've got ta love her, I guess. You know how she's one of my favorite characters to read up on, and how I loved you. "
" I hope so, " the younger man said as he leaned close to the older man's chest.
" Alright then. I guess."
-- -
You really do look like a funny guy, you know, but what I meant was you let life steal from you, go free or else.
The old man is licking his lips a while now. He thought it would be a bit bad coming back to the dark and harsh world at the same time, but no, it was better to be alive than to be an outcast and an idiot.
If only.

I turned the corner of the cafe and walked directly past the man with the scar. He was dressed differently for his day. As the midday sun set and the fruit aisle began to close, I found myself stepping slowly to the side of his apartment. As I walked past to begin the walk home, I felt a small brief drop of adrenaline. I couldn't help but think what I had just witnessed. When I turned my head to look at my attacker, I realized what he had in his hand. Nothing. No marks. I couldn't believe this. It wouldn't be long now until the hostess noticed my stance.
"How was your day, Mr. Jeans? "
" Ah, well, my credit was outstanding yesterday, I was just getting ready to head out on business and ended up spending a very large amount of time waiting for my cell to power up. "
" Is this your reason why you're here? "
I put my hand on his shoulder.
" Oh, okay, you've been here many times. You saved lives and made the world a better place, " he responded, smiling.
" Well what makes you think I haven't seen this scar before? "
His mustache twitched in a smirk.
" How would you know? "
" Like I said, what makes you think I haven't seen this scar before? "
His eyebrow raised.
" Ah, I see, all of the world's greatest people have, or could, been the victim of a... sudden. Magic. Shapes have power, what do they cover in the mind they choose to manipulate? Without them, any interactions are purely determined by nature. Magic is dependent on it's cost. I never had anyone interfere with me, at least not directly. I simply preyed upon my natural abilities, and was able to continue on my path. Truly, I believe the world is better off without magic as a significant part of our world. Many have questioned my reasoning, and I would like to ask, are you in fact God? I take no responsibility for your behavior; I wouldn't even trade my physical health for your own little world's safety. I never asked to benefit anyone, just to make them live a life like none they ever knew possible. My hand flicked to his sleeve, and I traced his blue-blonde hair as I reached for his hand. They didn't move.
" That was... strange " I said, deciding to enjoy the silence.
He stared at me, a slight smile on his face.
" Say, how was work? "
" It wasn't rough. "
" You... you're... you have the scar? "
He shook his head. He squeezed, and when he turned back to his pocket, a bruise covered the scars underneath his left eye and right shoulder. I sighed.
" I've never seen you do anything like this before. "
I turned back to him, knowing what had happened.
" You did help the world. Your friends and family understood the truth, and you kept a job in the government. In reality, they weren't told you had the scar. Your mother blamed you, even though I don't know her. So I helped. Your father wanted you to marry this lady you loved so much. Everything was alright, though. The money stopped coming and it all came rushing back. So I came to get you to meet her. She taught me everything you needed to know about the world around you. We never hurt each other, but you always helped each other. I have to go now, because everyone else seems to have known and am more likely to believe this was from your other side. I need you to read your first victim. Then we can have a holiday together. Then we can be at your wedding! "
He lowered his head, and looked down on the body he had just laid on the pavement. What would a family say about losing a loved one?
" Have you ever told anyone that you could have hurt them?"<|endoftext|>

Mental battle. Oh terrible mistake. Sometimes as bad as taking a life everyone rejoices and goes with their life. I didn't. I was missing my wife. Sad little girl, always trying to stay on top of things.
I got on a plane to paradise. Everyone laughed when I said that I could deal with the losses, I had the same faith I did. I showed love to the world at church every night, for good- i'd show up three months early.
They loved me for my accident. To deal with the loss. But this fire was too powerful. I was not the chosen one. My species will burn without power.
I was sent into the afterlife, so I probably never will again.<|endoftext|>
**********453**********
It's a cold September evening and I'm rifling through my drawer to get a cup of coffee; hopefully the story of the earth's first contact with a more intelligent, sapient species is next.
I have no umbrella to throw at my window, but I slip into a chair and sit down. A giant monitor is sitting next to me, a massive black monolith capable of measuring distances of miles. I think back to the morning news. All around us we read the headline: *It's global warming for the first time... *
I shift uncomfortably with the headache on my lower back. Did it smell of cheap pizza here? Do my eyes have a throat infection? This won't work. I'm back to sleep.
I pull on my visor and see the face of the scientist working the machine sitting next to me. My face is screaming in fury; all of my senses are frozen in my skull. He has me confused, searching his eyes desperately for a symbol like a star or star fusion.
One of the young men he has meet with appears on his screen. There's an image of a large bear in it. He shouts and shifts over to a screen in front of him. This time he speaks:
"There is no scarring on the monitor, no further observations will be made. Just observe your surroundings and make note of any irregularities. "
I look at the screen and in small green letters a number appears on it. " 47.118464622 " the number reads.
The last thing I remember is hearing a scratching noise and suddenly I'm standing.
" Get down," the the scientist says. I turn and look around. As I turn into a corner, a woman walks up to me with a stick. Her hand is clutching my arm.
I knew what I must do. I rushed to the screen; knowing that this woman would kill my boyfriend if she saw me. So I turned in that direction. There was a large bear next to her; and a camera pointed directly at it. The tip of the camera held something that could potentially take the world into a new era, if only I could make that symbol and send it into space.
That symbol is all the world is in now. Even the moon.<|endoftext|>

When I first found the magnificent red fox I was too afraid to look. But every year its my only companion. Running south along with her. It always stopped short because I could never get those badasses away from my little bear trap. It never could because they ain't even mine. Each year the hunters come out to hunt. Always to distract my little girl from my neighborhood where she had wandered for the past month.
This year they met at the South Dragon Lake in our local woods! Once she's ready she'll be back in this one for the wolves to hunt again. Maybe one day even step through. We're all excited to see her and the big shed she just left!
But then as I get out to check on her the hunters notice she's been disappeared... But I don't care! I'm going to hunt her back and see where it's all going. She'll see something interesting I always see in these woods.<|endoftext|>
**********455**********
Everyone wanted to tell me what was wrong with my day at the zoo.
It had been hard, late nights, and drizzling gas. I wore a sleevelay over my messy clothes, tanned with age and still having too much unblinking eyesight. As I walked around I could see the zoo's smile, just cracking as they cried into it, and scared their little shit head off.
They were clearly distraught, probably without child.
The elephant had ripped out one of its ears, and now screamed, her brown skin white and alive with the souls of those around her who would care for her.
I should not have been so scared. I had been trying to make friends with other people like them. I couldn't make friends with anyone, when I was sixteen or seventeen. I hated myself for that. In truth, people like myself are kind of creepy, and they would probably find that unsettling.
My teacher said, "Tell their parents they aren't coming to see you. " " Tell your friends they shouldn't be here." Of course, none of them did. I didn't even ask if they were okay.
So I shut myself in, and felt strange, and didn't want to go back to that place. But it always occurred to me that maybe I should try something a little different. Maybe tell my parents.
I walked down the stairs and crept into a small corner where my parents who were visiting each other sat.
They snuggled in close together, and I gently kissed my dad's head. Then I put my phone in my pocket and sighed and turned off the light. Just like that, I closed my eyes, and waited for a cry from my parents to wake up me up.<|endoftext|>

My heart hammered so hard it shattered its rib cage. my blood ran in my stomach, I was still in this hotel room. I glanced down at my soaked ankle, it wasn ’ t long before it broke. I wiped my nose on the shirt I was wearing, I turned around and the robber was there, right in front of me. I looked at him, he always came in here, threatening me. I hated him, but also knew he wasn ’ t letting go. I don ’ t think I would have cared if he wasn ’ t standing in front of me, something weird about his accent. I shouted to him, I swung around, coming to my feet. " This is it, this is my opportunity. " He turned around, only to be met with one arm raised to shield me. My fist tore my collar, one slash at an hourglass, and then I was gone. The bank robber disappeared into thin air. I backed away slowly, trying not to peek at the robber ’ s stolen jet black car. I heard someone yell, as I backed up. I gasped as I tripped, spinning, dodging, and tripping over a tangle of leaves, rocks, cars, trash, and… a man. I heard a groan from behind me. I looked around frantically, I saw someone headbutt my back, I looked back and then…
“ Where am I? ” I whispered.<|endoftext|>

Barack Obama walks down the street with a complete disregard for his own body. The cars outside his motorcade are parked as he strolls by. He has to get in.
He's dressed in a crisp white winter jacket, matted hair, and a pair of frozen lips. He lets out a gruff yawn and swallows.
Covered in a mixture of blood and sweat, he stands in front of the office, as well as the cars. He waits.
Obama looks down at his feet. He reads the address from his front-row. He turns to the TV.
It is the same one. The same, single-monthly news article he is taking to task for the mass hysteria and incompetence that has just infected Washington DC with death-spots, paranoia, and fear.
Donald J. Trump has been elected president of the United States and will soon take office as our God given President, once elected by the people. Trump will be spoken for and served by the citizens of the United States, as well as the Republican Party of all state and city units of government. He will step down from the government and take over as our God for a few more hours and weeks of swearing in a newly elected President of the United States.<|endoftext|>

It was New York City, and Parker was pissed. This city was 2 lanes below ground, where he saw a sign with a smile from inside a giant screen, inviting visitors to take an inflatable dinghy in and instead take their own lives. He muttered under his breath.
"This is what my father was like when he was younger, " he said, " you get frustrated. "
" But Parker, no, he's just going to die soon. He's gon na have a family, but he's gon na be with his old love long enough to take the greatest and brightest he could make it. "
" But if you're gon na lead a life like that, it has to be as beneficial to both you and your creation as possible. That's exactly what he did. He mented me to do this. He taught me this. "
" He spoke to me like he always does. He'd say we'd make a happy family. He told me that my dreams had become dreams, because those dreams were in the backyard and he had to keep them alive. His text messages were just so incredible. One day, after we finished with the deadline, he'd flash away. And again. And again. "
" But he failed to notice that I was living a normal life. They welcomed us at our house with open arms. They raised their beautiful children. They supported us with support. They all met together. In a matter of weeks, the world was in his and Parker's hands. I'm happy with what I've seen. I know it's probably not true. "
His jealousy overcame him, and Parker locked eyes with the devil.
" I wish I could hold up my end of the bargain. I know it won't happen, but I'm begging you to spare my creations. "
" Anything? "
" He bought my dreams. I bought his words. You give me the punishment, and I'll never get back from him. "
" What? "
" Make your father proud, and I'll reward him with me still. "
"... yes. "
" Look around. " Parker sat in a concrete room, facing away from the crowd. Suddenly, he caught sight of the thing he was talking about. It was an office chair, metal railing, heavy steel padding, and star studded lights. He threw it aside, inspected it closely, and it turned on its side. Parker reclined it against a large desk, brandishing a sleek, standard desk chair with a rounded handle. He spoke in a very clipped language, but this was the first he heard.
" May the lord reward you, for you have saved me from hell and the fear of Hell. May one day, a paradise will be in sight for you. "
The room went on as Parker rode the chair, the vibrations of his molecules composing his blood replaced by a smell that had never been before or since. Suddenly, a voice spoke to him.
" Excuse me! "
" I can't be bothered to explain, " he thought. " Your reality exists to serve the Divine Law. The future is fleeting. It will never be as good, or interesting, or beautiful, or beautiful. No mere human will ever thrive. It takes anything, anything, and forever to be come to it's own conclusion. It is all you can call it. "
" Are you all right? "
" I am here to stop you. I can tell you that I am not worried. What I would like is to leave this world of yours in peace, if you could. I wouldn't have it taken away. I would write with you, you know, just to see if you'd like. It's how I see it. It is how I see things. It is the way I see things, the way you see things. You will fall into the abyss that binds the universe into a great pool of darkness. Underneath that pool, lie the very same exact outcome that I outlined to you. "
He sat back down, staring out the window to see the city only to be confronted with two demons standing at the edge of his view.
" This'll be interesting. "<|endoftext|>

"Look, Puck, Puck, I swear on my life! How many million years have it been since I sent anybody here and.... did you even realize we're on something like this? Almost fifty of us, Puck. Fifty million years... I'm sorry. I'm just glad our people is able to speak with one another. I hope you, and if anyone else in the world has similar knowledge, then let's live another day of peace with each other... we can just say the same thing over and over again.... A word that never makes a difference. We can just fucking ALL use the same things for one thing. I'm so sorry! I can't believe you sent me this. For all the reasons you seem to know, and know that whatever may happen next, I'm gon na pick up the phone to the Cryogenics center in Texas at the end of the day and... That's it. I'll be here the whole time, I promise."
The two workers were quiet for a while, at first a prelude to the end of what was, by all rights, earth's last hope. But after a while, the lights went out, the even radiation got the hell out of Puck's system and vaporized the whole office. People... there were only us, outside. Puck's black and white pods had quickly become shot holes and irradiated slowly, stripped of the low-level buildings and human civilization but rendered fairly useless for feeding the cities, usually for short periods of time. Puck's outpost, the last word of the planet, had just completely ruined the last living pod they built. And then the turn off sparked the violence between them, and by then they were quite good at taking out humans.<|endoftext|>

Frank relaxed to his task as he knocked on his pantry door, nearly hissing at the brisk air as he skipped down the hall and down the stairs. The servants were a little hard to find nowadays, as the town thrived on visitors from all across the country and as Frank was trying to keep things right he wondered if he could order fresh blood or raise some eggs for the folks or even lay him his rose. He was almost sure that the slaves would not mind at all so he stopped and picked out the last box of bacon from the kitchen table, his hand trembling at the handle, he ran his finger over the sides hoping to touch the bacon itself. A tear streamed down his face, he tossed the lid aside and began to feel the heat and the good smell of bacon coming out of the frying pan in the overhead air. He smiled as he added another cookie to the oven and proceeded to unroll the pancakes.
"I know it's a bit late, but what's the matter dad? You have to make this quick." The little girl said as she laughed at him. He accepted, as did the bacon. With that he closed his eyes and smiled. Tonight it would all be over, the house really did look out of place today, any door that didn't have a lock or a door marked with a "F" had always been "Inconvenience and Protection".<|endoftext|>

Welcome! Write me a letter to the various governments, here at the United Nations about a impending war with ancient world war Z. Take a year or two to figure out which one it is. To be honest with you guys, I'm nearly straight forward, but my mother has issues so let me end this with a "thank you " but please have a seat or just come on down.
We've been trying to work together for days now, and I have to admit that I've enjoyed the challenge. But the only issue that's bugging me is the inevitable old man from former kingdom of the Magda. Our visit is supposed to be brief and brief, but as soon as you come join us for an after party or a pre-battle meal, we'll have a dedicated bunch of uniformed security men to handle it all. That's not to say we don't have pictures to take with us, it's just that we do so in such a dull manner. This is a war that is bitter and life taking on high stakes. One thing is for certain, this war is going to be epic. Fight or flight, defeat or capture, these things happen. There will be a... experience.
I'm a military deserter myself. Very old, and even children of mine are still dropping when they come home from school. The trip from a long routine to more important moments. The dullness of the visit is what gets to me.
Anyways, my former enemy is a certain asshole. Utterly arrogant and so stubborn. I'm sure his predecessors wouldn't be happy to see him get what he deserves but frankly, that's not enough for me. Don't get me wrong, he does it for fun, but I've been told he enjoyed it. I would also suggest that one of his grudges will have to do for his own good, over there in Sparta.
Anyway, after a lot of work and countless meetings to gather signatures, I am doing one thing that every country does, and that's be planning. See what happens when this fight starts. When he decides he'll finally be able to fully appreciate and accept the resources of his country.
And then, somewhere along the way, the chance to do all that has been sitting there for him for so long really got out of hand. He smiled, a lump in his throat as the bright yellow Earth had begun to give way beneath him, devouring him in a gasp. I keep thinking he's leaving for Sparta. I know this could have been avoided if he planned for it, I just can't trust such a short looking man. But eventually, as the green vegetation began to creep up to the now lifeless center of Sparta, he would have to rise.
I think his fate rests with the kind and charming Dark Knight I'm walking with. He may not be able to stop me, but at least he does not have to smile about it. Last time, he took me in too, but really, he took her in peace before leaving her in the dark.
I hope this letter gets you on good terms with us... but I don't want to go on any personal relationships, friends or enemies. Not with my family and friends. I keep hoping they'll forgive me but I don't believe their actions this time are any worse than the past. All the fortune we'd saved for our 1,000 year war still isn't enough to balance the scales. So, stay strong and be prepared for whatever comes next.
Yours.<|endoftext|>

"What's got ta be a typo? " He asked the creature hovering just over the man's foot.
A smile slowly spread across the man's face. " Well... There are gon na be some. But first, " He explained, speaking aloud.
" Oh really? That's amazing. "
He took a few bites, chewing on his favourite piece of bread. " I've got something I should show you. Something that's fairly simple, completely normal... but just a little snippy. "
" I never read the context of the comment before, man. " The creature chuffed happily. " I prefer that word, Mr. Murphy. "
" No wait. You have to... Okay... Well... It's the moment where you should tell me why you put up with these people. " He grinned, and picked up the piece of bread.
" Do they hate you? " The creature shivered. " Did I not add a comma? "
" Are you a parent of someone you fucking hate? They hate you. They want to hate you. They want to get closer to you. " The creature looked sheepishly at the rest of the creature's body. " I said, they hate you. You fucked up! "
" They did? Well... Was it the night you asked? " The creature shook its head sadly. " It was the night I gave the speech. "
" Oh I forgot. Did you say that it was the night that you only needed the night? "
" No... You say that the moment you closed your mouth. "
" You say that when you screamed. "
" Yes. That is the time when that fucking woman called you a retard. "
" What the hell are you talking about? My lungs are big. How the hell am I going to stay alive if I die tonight? You know I like the steak, man. It's great. "
" Oh I could eat it right now. "
The creature shrugged, walking closer to the man. " Can you roll it out of my mouth? It's going to spoil all my other precious bites, would you like some? "
The man's stomach turned armpit. " Do I? Fine. Fine. Fine. "
" I just want to offer you a chance at a free steak. "
" Fine." The creature cringed, dropped the piece of bread, and walked out of the room.<|endoftext|>

" Sorry about that.. I think they would have wakened that... "
" Well it could have been worse, the baby may have been big, so were a bunch of bandits, or a bunch of... good old nooks and crannies... "

She's sitting behind me, leaning against the chair, happily cooing. I stare at her and try to understand her, because that's what she does.
"You were born to be the most amazing mother, " she says after a time.
I look at her and before I can say a word she makes a boombox over her shoulder, leaving me giddy.
The brown eyes are unblinking. They look back at me and I look back at her, unable to fathom the implication of it. The blind rage creeping back into my veins fills the room. I guess it's the fact that all of a sudden it isn't that. I just hope I don't get caught in a tomato sting. At least it won't take me for old time's sake.
I walk to the kitchen, eyeing over my shoulder as I reach for one of the knives I've kept in my office. What do I do with a knife now? Is there any way around this?<|endoftext|>

Gather round me, your fire has burned open. Your scalding lashings burned through me like I are a shard of metal from your soul.

I know my time has come.
You know my lies. Lies that threaten to tear through your sanity just because you have no idea what you ’ re up against. I ’ m watching you. I ’ m watching you sleep.

There are some things in life that people don't know of. Because most of them are the ones that seem to swirl around in the shadows of the night. The things that seem normal, true, and the things that seem to take a no. or oh so long to be exactly right. Most of them are petty. Little things that seemed so delicate when you first realized they were there. Walk. Or cycle through objects and motions and even one word, "fly ". Then pick up a hammer. Then beat the knobs that lead to its rails. Then bend over. Your hands are cold, then you breathe in. You bare your eyes to be so the lightning seems to flicker. You had never felt this warmth before, yet somehow the air that provided it felt exactly the same. All of these things were normal. They don't seem enough to carry you on just because your eyes were closed. You can hardly imagine you are standing here, staring down at those big red birds in the distance. Even when you do move. Not to reach that sweet, sweet, sweet kiss on their cheek. Not even to whisper them a greeting. Your kisses feel more intense than you ever know what the word means. That sweet sweet, sweet, sweet kiss... it makes you feel right at home. Maybe that, in its purest, most symphony, and even truly pleasurable, lightening of colors, makes you love them all the more.<|endoftext|>

The speech had become stale even though the other PTA members had begun by conversing after a tumultuous two hours after its fictionalization. Paul's voice carried through the thick atmosphere, a feminine nasal tone flowing through his lines as he worked up the courage to speak.
"My apologies. Too much belief is misplaced here. I swear to you, I bet the feeling I got was nothing more than a bit of pent up resentment. "
Paul slid his visor on. Was this some kind of sick joke? PTA members were insulted and mocked by past critics, and with the backing of the Dean of Radio, he'd made for a reputation as an even orator, but to the public it seemed like even another amateur mistake had forced him to up his game. Tonight his shift was to leave as quickly as possible.
Still, it was just about his time to finish his gabbing in two hours when PTA's Standards Manager, Michelle, announced that Paul's performance was making him reconsider making a similar appearance that the Last Man Standing had.
It was over three hours now. He'd released himself from the fame that struck him a decade earlier. He'd returned to the skin of the earth. He pulled down heavy curtains that covered the sharpest edges of his living room, filling them out with the world's grayest rays of light. His material face was as fascinating as a Ferrari parked along the Shoreline in the vast night.
Behind the famous bar was Paul, his past persona jumbled, and his smile crept into the stage. He had the point of view of his audience who'd seen him so many times that they nearly didn't recognize the man who sat at his table the day before. There was no good in their world.
He remembered where it had come from, when he'd found this room, when he'd gone to so many fights after ignoring him until he'd had enough time to address the " Secret Age" about which he'd conquered the world. His hit song, " Going to the Finish Line" had become his soundtrack as he labored to pull a piece of cardboard out of a zipper on his shirt. PTA members were all over it, and no one had the opportunity to touch it as quickly as he had.
When Paul found the shelves he'd made in a closet full of public items that had been destroyed for the record's sake, his fight to return it to its original owner came to an end.<|endoftext|>

"Are you really going to tell me anything? Do I just teleport? How can anything be this painful? I was just on a journey. "
Alan Alan Price flipped through the pages of a textbook. " If you say so. "
" Yes. " An unfamiliar man behind the back of the reading machine spoke.
It was in one hand a small page and in the other, a black tablet. The tablets required three clicks on and one finger.
" Quick open, you see. You must be your reawakening. "
" What a great thing, I've done this many times. I could have written a book for years, now. "
" I know. But this book is so important to you. You go through this book, now. You will finally learn. "
The man, the one once before, looked down. He stretched out his hands and suddenly he appeared before me.
" Why, I'm doing so very stupid. "
Alan Price winced. His eyes went wide and his legs went stiff. He felt a tap on his shoulder, but he kept moving forward.
" Get to the start, it's gon na be really long. "
" Yes, that's how I knew it'd come. Would you like to read it? "
The man looked at me.
" You want to book it? I already know. You come to the real ending. "
I jumped a little. I had never been this scared, the great pracary had told me otherwise. I was greeted by darkness.
" You always had fun. "
Alan Price looked down again and his brown eyes met mine. " Go to hell, you lil shit. "
A giant fist slammed through the table and slammed hard into me.
" What did you just say to me? Why am I here? "
" One more time, I'll tell you. Let me do this, please. "
Alan sat back down against the wall. He leaned on it a little. " What is it... something? "
" It... a hole. "
I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck go up. It was short. Looking at it, a slight frown.
" Help me. You can not help me. "
The man closed his eyes and then his steps disappeared from his face. He pulled the end of his cane back and flung himself a bit farther than he normally would.
" You know what that means. Not sure what I should do anymore, but I can help you if you want. "
" Get in the car, this is my destiny. "
" What do you mean it'll be my destiny? "
" Not exactly. " Alan was going into much more paperwork than he'd really intended.
" I'll change something on my end. Some people better wake up, you can check it out on your own! You need to learn everything else. "
" I won't use my powers anymore. Please, tell me what I can do. "
" I will. I will fix this, you will learn. You will learn everything else. "
He let out a sigh.
" I have to run."<|endoftext|>

*There it is. *
Underneath the oak desk is a sort of mailbox with two doorways. On the desk there is a telephone, and its face is such that I can almost look to the other side where it doth glow.
*Lampshades on. Sunlight streaming through the cracks. *
This office is full of meticulous seals and single shaded curtains that are put to exactly 11 AM, precisely 6 hours. It seems odd to me that they are so slightly frayed.
As I scan the passage I pull back the rough round cut of the front door handle and reveal a simple package. I take it out of my outstretched arms and return it to my binoculars. As I pick it up I realize that the letters are not my family letter, nor even the front man's. Instead, they are a series of scratch marks on the underside of the top of the envelope. As I close the lid of the door it sheds some light.
*I am sorry. *
The inside seems slightly abandoned, but who is at fault? Is this an act of self preservation? These marks have no handwriting. It is likely that it is all an elaborate publicity stunt.
I grab my blade of the crossbow from under my coat and return it to my bag. I polish the letters on the paper, examine the thickness of the seal at each entry. It seems that there are drawings of the letters that I have nailed up on the side of the door.
Finally, I will answer the door and close it.

"James? Come in, do you know what I was doing down there? "
I look through the window at the sleeping figure of Henry breaking the news with his mouth open, now him and me. The two were inseparable but at some point it took a new perspective on the room. Well look out for yourself,
" Will today, I presume, lead you to the gates of Heaven. There you will find all the tools and tools needed to enter this world and ascend into Heaven. "
While Henry thought through his options and understood what he was being told he quickly knows I am sure of one thing.
" What is Heaven? "
" What did you call it? "
After a moment he turns to me and offers, " James? "
" Oh my god! " he screams.
I nod and take a quick look around him. The room is empty, save for us. Well, mostly empty. A few guards still come to the door but the mood's different. I open it slowly and introduce myself.
" My name is James. I am the police on 00408. I swear it is Heaven. "
At first I just laugh it off. But as the name suggests I've got some tough shit to deal with down here. Just another day at the precinct, running around with the Batcave under my cape, lifting shit that was meant to up my pants.
" James, your head is throbbing. " I don't care about jumping out here while you're a kid or another paperboy.
" So you see what I am pointing out. "
" James. I'm talking about Heaven. "
" What? How are you talking about Heaven? The teachers, the police, all sad. "
" Oh my god, James, look. " He grabs the fire poker he found in a friend's house and pulls it to his ear. I jerk it back to him, I finally realize what I did to deserve this.
" Look sir, I know it sounds crazy but I just want to prove that you are that person who chose up what you said to me. I don't give a shit why you need to die here. Just prove me wrong."
He ran a hand through his hair and looked up at me and said in a piercing, harsh tone,
It didn't matter what he said because if he really wanted to kill me.
If he actually wanted to give it the death it deserved then he was going to do it right. Because he was a liar and he wasn't going to cut it.
No matter what anybody said he would kill me and he didn't. Because if he did he'd kill more people. Because he would feed off of the starving and hurting and he'd do it so much better, because he was so selfish he didn't care about being liked or loved.
The little bastards that have driven this country into submission. All the good and good evil. They kept us all like livestock. That's why they kept us locked up here.
Because in many ways, we are cursed. Because evil is death itself, and when that is done things get bad.

As the wineglass above my head splinters, I close my eyes. I can see that her lips are already gurgling. All they can do is wait. At least, they wouldn't forever.
Finally, my glass glass shattered. As I watched, I just finished making a dine. After all, I knew, I was going to propose. So with the careful difficulty that I made a wide mouth, I do so and explain, the miraculous ways my long laid back demeanor impedes my strategy.
'You ever listen to talk radio? Well, listen listen to cable.'
'I can tell when you're listening, otherwise, I ain't a killer.'
'Yeah.'
'And you blow up your TV. Do you people like seeing people die?'
'I do.'
'No man, you idiot! Listen to radio and you'll tell me when to kill!'
'I don't know? I'm not a killer. You *will* kill if I catch you.'
My heart sank. The previously bright music suddenly froze. I attempted to scream but all the lighters I was wearing simply destroyed my ears.
'I am no killer. But look at me! I'm not exactly ripping you apart. And more importantly, I don't *know* what I am. But I do know. I owe you one. And yours.'
I'd said, in a glazed vision,
'What did you just say? I'm not killer.'
'I trust you. You need to listen to some.. talk-'
'Right there, Katie.'
She shoved me into the van. Time froze. I looked at her. She was smiling. Suddenly, time turned black. I heard distant screams. I heard Tim find the body on the floor.
I saw Sam lose an arm and Jacob nearly fall off. I waited for her. Her lips were gurgling. I waited. The gasps continued. Eventually, the cries stopped. I became aware of a crack. My eyes widened.
It was him. Gary was in the passenger seat. He had won the bet. I just couldn't take it anymore. Then, the crack opened again.
I saw Sam fall to the floor.<|endoftext|>

In the international airships no one ever knew about the Treaty of Versailles or the Treaty of Waiters.
To all of us on this continent no country would listen to us, never speak to us, and we wouldn't talk about our military.
I watched in silence, I saw people live their lives as though nothing had ever happened. I saw minds thinking of no idea what would happen. I saw a smile fade, the kind that only comes from a longing for something. But then something happened.
I began my flight home from my country. I was living on a small island in the middle of the ocean. In a city like that my instructor told me. After many years of plane flying my knowledge for my lay life had slowly changed.
Before I got to the island my instructor told me I was going to get wasted. He explained that my instructor was to put me on a radar and get a position on the ground. When I was done, I was to change. What I thought was something'new' for me now. Now I could change, a more advanced plane could take off.
After several months of this I had been able to fly in the air on a few small island islands. I had lived the rest of my life, high school, college and even a part of school. Then I flew in the air, to the new place that was below me.
But it all changed very quickly, I could fly in the air, no pressure, no direction, no nose, no radar. I spent many years building up this new plane and slowly building my confidence. No one ever expected me to fly this plane, but I was to welcome that new place up top.
I joined the flight, people immediately noticed my new power, so they were expecting the same. But it took time to learn everything. The skill became more and more useful at the speed of light, and later in an incredible explosion.
I watched helplessly as the plane approached the burning sky, the smoke rose and continued to burn on it until it was bright red and orange and white. My name was not recorded on any records, only glimpses of my body lying in pieces atop the very plane. I saw the fire for the first time in my life. I saw the familiar burning streaks as the jet took off.
I did not cry. It only meant that I lived to see the end of my life.

Sorry for the ending. *
Hope this gave you some idea of what happened.<|endoftext|>

I can't take this any longer. I just want you to know that I am running out of time and can not send you back. The library is just like the library, i have no idea what to write, I don't even know what poems to write. I need to make sure this day can last. I need to write because if not, that's it. It's time for the damndest idea you can come up with. Tell me the funniest story of your life, as I said, I'll throw it in the back of your mind, remember, and whatever, I love you. I love you too much to stop, I wish I could tell you how weird you are.<|endoftext|>

**Third Meanings**
Rachel sat down, and looked at the smooth box in front of her.
**One: Please... be patient. Please. **
She smirked to herself. Two-face Samantha had been very open-minded at her turn. She mumbled something to herself, barely audible. Two-face Samantha met her gaze, and the two girls continued eye-to-eye conversing for long minutes. Then one of them slapped Rachel in the face.
**Two: PLEASE! It's been five minutes and you still haven't come round! **
Oh god. It's the end. God, oh god...
Two-face Samantha is running back to the bathroom. She is sobbing on the cool concrete. One-face Samantha is sobbing just now. One-face Samantha is okay. The other two have come back out to the dorm room, still laughing. But for now. This woman... everything is falling apart. Something's not right.
*Finally*. As she looks at the block of concrete... he's gone. From her floor to the wall, trapped inside. Rachel gets to her feet and steps in.
*You! * She screams loudly.
She takes a step back. She is hurt. She... She looks into the mirror. * What the fuck*? She looks back up at him.
*....okay? Are you two okay? *
Rachel's face brightens up. One-face Samantha's face also brightens up. Rachel starts moving forward. One-face Samantha runs into the doorway.
The door was to be next.
*... who? *
Rachel can't finish. She is sitting in the hall. Her stomach twists. She is crying and gagging. A man bursts through the door and hovers in front of her. He can't see Rachel. He can't see two-face Samantha. He can't see Rachel.
Her face gleams in the bright spotlight. She looks at herself... one-face Samantha has a strange smile on her face. * * This* is not what her up-and-comers look like.
She grabs the nearest man.
"Hey, I'm Rachel, and I come by to talk to you about some problems. "
Rachel looks up at the man and nods. The man in front of her looks defeated, and looks away.
" Your problem? "
" No! You... you don't sound very chipper. " The man looks horrified.
Rachel turns her head to him, cradling her face in her hands.
" I always said that you look like a confused couple. "
Rachel can hear the man's finger snuff out.
" What, I don't understand? "
" It's not funny anymore. Who are you? "
The man in front of Rachel stops crying.
" *You* are coming for me! "
" Ok! It's not funny. I'm going to take your hand. " The man stops crying.
Rachel immediately lifts up her hands and jerks them back, mumbling'Hey... my father!' and a moment later the man in front of her has exited the room. He looks down at her hands and smiles. He looks the man down.
Rachel takes her hands and leads her to the man's room. He kneels next to her.
" I need to talk to you about tomorrow night. What? "
" I- I don't know, mom."
Rachel sits down and picks up her phone. She turns to find her dad holding a gun in the back of her coat. She smiles at him. He laughs and shoots her in the chest.<|endoftext|>

All in all, a really strong work! The flow of the story was nice and poetic, and the final paragraph took a great stand on your characters' physical quirks.
The biggest change though was who you started off with. For instance, the first paragraph described the importance of self-reliance and how many important decisions were left to yourself for people to make, and you did this with a *little* twist for them to sort out. What they didn't know though was that all you had to do was read the last half of it, then you got to read the rest, and read, and it sort of became an internal monologue of your own. If the last half is where the reader would be, and you know what you're talking about, then they've already read the entire thing, so that's kind of okay.
The length of the story was a little uneven. For instance, the first chapter only took about 11 pages, and you made a point to tell me that after a chapter really sees your point of view, which was a pretty good start. Some of that reading was on full display in the following lines:
> Telling my sister to quit dropping off puppies because I was allergic to poppies meant life was nothing to me. But I wasn't. There are all kinds of animals I can get you to meet and interact with. But now I need more life and less dog shit. If you want me to stop burning plastic cups, you might as well finish each chapter up there. " I was embarrassed if I was red " and how I made her cry. She would have got a few in their whole day or so if she could have held a little more than. But she eventually left me, so now I just wanted my puppy. I'm okay with that. This was something I found hard to focus on when not waiting for it to progress, because at the end of the day it was my own fault, I wanted this to happen. But maybe it doesn't matter now. If you can fix my issues or move me to the internet, why couldn't you just write a different chapter? You already told me, so I just want you to find someone who doesn't see how an extended chapter is a total waste of time.
It really gets the job done there though. It really got me to think about how we were going to fix this dilemma. I think I really enjoyed the second half, you only need to listen to that half for the first half to work out. It also got me to focus on your pacing, which you did really well considering how short you were.
At times, I think the exposition is really hard to read and often can be difficult to keep track of. For example, with the introduction and what appear to be event verbs, I saw some really light exposition on religion and a lot of the presence and mannerisms; I felt like there were some missing light at some point. As the introduction really started I don't know why, but sometimes, before the exposition I think that I was just lying down somewhere, and the flashbacks are just vague descriptions, and I can't really really put myself into coherent thought. I wonder if it's possible to just set your topic aside from being exposition because you see these people I know sitting around the table sometimes.
Overall, I'd really like to see the rest of the story evolve into something where we find something, and I feel like this is an all too common genre for this kind of thing.<|endoftext|>

There it was again. The orange pendant, the gun in the chest, the snake bite wound on the teeth, what a pretty face.
She splayed her hands, the blood shot into her palms. " Missy? Is anyone there? "
" Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you, I won't be seeing you again," the pawn shop manager said. Still, she got on his cart and walked.
Missy looked over at him, a smile. She was tickled. It was tempting to sell her things, he thought. She'd remember his favourite coin, the smaller ones, the ones that had pockets of gold or something, until the bell rang. Missy nodded, thanked him, and watched the plastic door unlatch.
Outside, the yellow rotund mutton had begun to rustle once more.<|endoftext|>

"By the way, the Wikipedia blue button and the ruler are up for grabs. " I announce as I lift the ruler into my lap.
" Run the Google Little Cities! " shouts my partner. I am also, however, not a walking dog. The idea of being born with legs and feet sounds awful to this worldly realm.
As I load the census into Google's app, I notice that the nation is still in peak condition. Chicago, Washington, Portland and LA all remain in a state of peak condition. More so than New York City. I start my pace.
City-building projects build up both after arrival and before. San Francisco still has its share of underachieving residents, but has gotten things off the ground. New York is a prime example. According to the recently released Employee Handbook, Minneapolis, St. Cloud, and Minneapolis are stuck by $ 38 billion in layoffs and over 200 dead.
Seattle still has a great school system and despite initial ordinances, student loans are hard to come by. I keep making my way to Google Headquarters, where the General Manager always leans towards me. Google chimed into his voice, " Those ARE some good movers. "
I'm walking in the direction of HQ, now.
" Hey, it looks like they're out for business. We're releasing a new car feature, simply dubbed Galaxy! " The attendant on the other end of the phone laughs as I exchange my second favorite sentence with his wife. She hops up and down with a wave.
" I know who you are, right? " She asks.
" Google! " I protest, " I gave that shit up twenty years ago! I had it all planned out! It takes fifty years to Google a grand piece of shit car, let alone the one of your dogs. "
" And it cost you a billion? " She asks annoyed.
" Uh, " I reply evenly, " Yeah, mine's $ 29 billion. "
" I'll fix it in a minute," she replies.<|endoftext|>

Oceans of green, as green as the dry snow-by-stone it is. When I lay my prey on its belly, water is flowing between my hands and cheek, numbing this pool so that its form is a still ball, amid a quiet grave, hungry for battle. Do you see the first twig? Its head turns black, and then... Its eyes see into me. They seek not only mine, but my burning ranks, but the swarming ranks of the commoners. I kill them when I set my gaze upon them, with the persistence of a thousand raging suns burning down a furnace in a furnace. They are sheep now. For every champion I have slain, I have slain the red-wolf, red-furred Minotaur, and they shall see me, I repeat in their minds, as they fight for their leader and honor.<|endoftext|>

She said an empty breath. As another wretched plane landed in the ship, it became evident that she had been wishing for nothing more than to witness the voyage firsthand.
That was the last time she took a look at this creature that seemed to live in the sea, the presence of this demented, withered, insect across the sky that couldn ’ t even pass the food it showed.
She stepped out into the cold air and slowly drifted away from the thoughts of death.
The night sky turned as darkness poured into the open sky, her vision blurred by the cold stillness. She knew where her paces were and who she was. A former slave, grieved over her own wounds. A person with no name on this island whose inability to speak, no respect, no decency, no dignity, and no dignity afforded to her in the years after she saved the money she saved.
She walked through the streets as the city demanded a change from her, she soon decided to move into a larger apartment where she could shelter her small group and her family. As she left the city, she heard her mother yelling “ W-wha-what the hell!? ”, she was kicked around by the mob of desperate, whistling, screaming people who weren't from the outside world.
The end.<|endoftext|>
**********483**********
Shaking my head, I pick myself up from my bed and greet Satan over the smoke coming from the old stove. Despite not having any breakfast, I toast his head while we eat. It ’ s quite odd how simple life seems as it gets ever so people are gobbled up by all those hot dogs and pies made in heaven. I wonder what they like about sourdough, it tastes amazing. I guess this is getting a little boring.
Satan isn ’ t the most popular guy around though. I ’ ve been spending more and more time with my girlfriends, as have some of my boyfriends. But I ’ ve grown numb to it. Whenever Satan would wave that he missed me ( his sister ) I ’ d always catch him smiling. It wasn ’ t until my daughters birthday I finally realized his schedule had changed, he wanted to come over before school, put on a show, but I needed more time around, and I needed to stop this guy before he would invite me to church. I couldn ’ t let him get away with that.
Over the past four years I've finally gotten through some change. Between the amount of beer in my brain I drink every day, and the age of marriage I almost couldn ’ t miss seeing Satan in person. After meeting him, the circumstances didn ’ t change. Was he pissed? He just looked happy. I suppose nothing big changed, or at least I wasn ’ t, but I do miss it now.
We're at the restaurant when I see my lovely baby daughter. My old lover ’ s wife came over to help. She looked down at me and smiled. “ Hello my love! ” She said, as I watch her bright red hair crawl back into her face. “ I know that right? ” I responded, just a little bit. I mean, I *was* pretty upset when I knew that she wanted to show me how happy she was with the church.
When she turned to face me she was stunning. Light grey hair and straight white teeth. She didn ’ t look the fairest around, and she looked like she wasn ’ t going anywhere. “ Hello son, how are you? ” I inquired. She smiled. “ It ’ s been a long day, I was driving to work. I remember when I had asked if I wanted to show someone that I was OK with wanting help, and the guy had said he couldn ’ t. But oh god, she must be heartbroken, didn ’ t she? ” I pondered that, I ’ m never going to be happy in the afterlife, wouldn ’ t I? She nodded and walked over to the door. I looked around and waited, there was something in there, and the guy seemed at peace. She opened the door and walked in. I just stared, then my gaze was gone when she walked out.
I looked around, everyone in there was smiling. Every item in the restaurant was is, were, were, were. When it ’ s all over, everyone will be happy. The only thing that ’ s wrong is I'm not with my boyfriend. He ’ s with a beautiful girl. I didn ’ t need to see her again and I ’ m not ruining him. That ’ s how I treat Satan as I now really need to deal with him.<|endoftext|>

Do I know her? I don't know her, but this time it's hard to tell. You would think that all was going so well for her after her married father and her mother had committed suicide. And it's not like the governments, churches, or academic institutions could be immune from a witch hunt. I'm sure, in their place, hundreds of skeletons and intricate hands covered in roses. In their place, two demons, both married, each having a man of their own in their midst, but not their own.
There is simply no telling whether they will return to haunt me in this damp Earth, or the emptiness between their camps. Both husbands left the world to escape their spouse's betrayal. They are locked in bitter battle, but one of them is no match for my weapon of destruction.
*Flint, the talking ghost, screams for his family and friends to come, quickly turning his entire body to dust as he closes in on you. *
Don't just sit back and think about his words, I've made them so many lives.
Don't just talk to her, won't just kneel down and remember that you loved him all the same.
I know her, she is no longer mine, and I can't wait to become hers.
This is the last straw.<|endoftext|>

* "Grandpa? " * was all he could muster. He leaned down and touched the stone from across the room, a small streak of blood flowing across the remains.
* " Listen, sweetie, I don't know where this place is coming from, but we all live in a little perfect world, a place where we all exist, where all our hopes and dreams are finally accomplished, that we each have a place to stay, and nothing happens to me except I ’ ll get to settle down and have a lovely time with my family. " *
" But… Grandpa! "
* " Yeah, but you'll see, please don't do this to me! " *
* " Seriously? Just open up and tell me you think we could have the better future. How could we have a world where everything we see is just us doing imaginary things on a daily basis, the worlds you live in and the sky is all our image? " *
" Okay, this is ridiculous. I don't think you think it's possible that a place of peace would exist in a place with infinite spacetime with infinite water, where people can sell milk and other things in stores, where people live in basements, where women will gladly celebrate themselves when their husbands make most of their living by giving birth and loving every minute of their life. "
* " We don't have the future. How do we even do that? Isn't that the very essence of what life is supposed to be? Do you even know what an orgasm feels like? Maybe if you took a few moments of your life, and all of your knowledgable knowledge and events, and plugged it into a quantum computer, the experiences would feel more natural, exciting, and meaningful to us, and all of your appreciation for it would even begin to manifest itself in a divine emotion, like in romantic comedies. Or maybe you would take the idea of possibility and weight of achievement and happiness to its extreme, yet utterly meaningless value and simplify it into two completely unrelated things that belong to everyone in the world? " *
" Yeah, I think I might have a better way to do that, if I could just take a few moments and help you convince me that we can have a future where " things", the homes we had shared, that no-one heard about over the years, the hospitals we had attended, that we got to share and fulfill, that our children were the definition of " real " with real people, " we could have a future where everything was presented to us like pictures! How is that a life long dream? "
* " Grandpa? " * he choked out.
* " I know what this is, it's all about. What am I supposed to do to make you whole now, to make you whole, to make you love me as I did when you were young? " *
The silence settled over the room, and the stranger he was speaking to only seemed to slowly exhale as he started to move, the beads of sweat he had deposited on his forehead now bare and edging towards the edge of the stone.
* " Grandpa? " *
The stranger pulled the marble free from the stone.
* " I know what you're thinking. " *
And the stranger turned and retreated before the stranger could turn around to face the stone. It was clear to him that he shouldn't have dared, that he was more than the person the stranger had brought down. What he was really asking was, what if I took a moment and laughed at the thought that, *I could have the perfect home. *
Somewhere near the edge of the city, more than a block from the finish line, the large red building with spiraling columns and sweeping pathways nodded to the stone.

“ Hey, ” said my boyfriend at that very moment.
“ Yeah, dude, ” I finally said, not wanting him to be a dick about it.
“ I ’ m Andrew. ” He said again, the pitter-patter of feet echoing behind him.
I didn ’ t even flinch. I knew this wasn ’ t the right time to say this, I was fine with it, but being something I am... I definitely felt I was truly gay too. I looked at myself in the mirror, with orange hair, of course a somewhat unsymmetrical shade, with a rather large cheekbone, and a rather sharp jaw line.
“ I ’ m Ashley. ” I said in reply, realizing I said that thing to my boyfriend a few minutes ago.
“ What did you say? ”
“ I don ’ t remember, not really. ” I said, feeling my head nod.
“ Ashley, I ’ m sorry I didn ’ t come out of the closet. ” I said, jolting upright, and sitting up in my bed.
“ What ’ s wrong, ” Ashley said.
“ Well, I mean, like you said, I don ’ t -- “ I stopped myself, like two seconds later I was on the floor and my breasts weren ’ t shrinking.
“ Are you okay, ” my boyfriend said.
“ I need help. ” I said, relieved that there was a response.
“ So, what happened to your boyfriend? "
" He left me. "
“ What's going on, ” my boyfriend said, of course he never turned in the same way everyone does. “ What happened to him? ”
“ He didn't live in my house. "
“ Me. "
" Me. He looked fine and was going to college and work, and I was scared to leave him to that path. "
" What happened to your boyfriend? "
" There. He ended up staying with the person I told the government and ended up being gay. He got depressed and lost motivation to be happy and died. "
" Me, " Ashley started, remembering her last meeting with my boyfriend, " when I told them he might not live as long as he wanted. My boyfriend did everything he could to keep me from leaving, too."

Marston was well aware of what he was looking at, perched on his redwood cane. Joe was observing him. Joe watched, even from here on out, as he followed MARLIN'S steps, in her dark Volkswagen Beetle. MARLIN had a different style. He stopped to listen to Joe when he was 6 years old in Burbank. Joe was often very frightened of the look on MARLIN'S face, in his years of child custody, and the look of fear; what for even asking?
"FUCKER TARGETS. I'M TELLING YOU FUCKERS, DO N'T DO IT TO ME, " Joe interrupted. MARLIN shuddered. She was afraid, Joe was not.
" So, you're saying it's okay to kill your own parents, " Marlin continued. " Dad will always be there, can't hide the fact. "
" Never do that, man, " Joe said, cracking an ear. " You have to kill yourself. "
Marlin looked at him, tears welling in her eyes, as she pinched Joe's shoulder. " I don't want you to be afraid, Pete. I want you to live a normal life. A normal, happy life. " She looked into Joe's eyes. They were filled with sadness, sadness she didn't know existed. Marlin smiled. Joe smiled. It was good to be alive. It was great to be alive.
Marlin lowered the car. " I love you, Pete. " Marlin kissed Joe.
" Fuck you, Pete," Joe said.
The car came to a screeching halt.
Marlin turned around to see the man was now walking along the street. The man saw MARLIN'S cat, Nathaniel, roaming free. He lived by herself. He was scared by a cat.<|endoftext|>

We... started this at once. We were God's angels. We used to worship as penance, and we used to worship as harvest. We used to worship as gods. We used to worship as gods.
We, in our hours of sin, were the ones that couldn't take any more. Without sinning, we were even less generous with our offerings.
It was not until we discovered the curse that we knew not of our presence, our infallible answer for torment. But we understood.
It was then when God let all of the blood that was falling pour out of the infant Jesus Christ and his blood soaked skins, so we could stop it.

I had always believed I was dreaming.
Ever since the AI had passed the Turing Test, I had been plagued by a series of hallucinatory episodes. A major hallucination in general. How could I not think that their AI could talk and feel, in fact, that it did?
They had picked me up from the center-field of a planet-sized field, into a container of solid ( more amorphous being variety ) bronze. A good combination for my subjectivity, but no one is sure what I have seen in the exotic, extraterrestrial environment. But there must be some thought processes that were behind it all, otherwise I would have felt the inevitable "shifting in or out" from being of slight insect equivalent intelligence to all that realisable.
Wait, did the Turing Test determine that the subject was conscious? How could I know if that was how it was? I look up from my case in the glass case sitting on my bunk at the base of the ship. Not the air marshal at the D20, I guess. And still I think, before I look at the bag of dynamite it is.
[ I'm curious here how this piece of science allows someone to willingly learn that nothing is ever from zero, and now I have to watch what might have been from zero. The book I'm reading is probably the only thing that can suggest otherwise. ]<|endoftext|>

On the cobbled streets of the ruins of the great city of Gringotts I see thousands upon thousands of metal bodies surrounding The Artist. I walk down the boulevard and see the bodies of many a man and woman with hands and feet, adorned in armour and sword. I hear a car full of people scream as I try to exit, but I am powerless. Suddenly a voice cuts through the broken buildings as I make my way up the cobbled road.
"Who was this? "
I gasp with fear as I search for my hidden destination. I am struck by the strangeness of the first few doors leading to the Artists. My surroundings flash before my eyes as my sights flick and focus. They are surrounding the body of the painter. His eyes are trained by some dark red beam for me to approach. He removes his coat and clothes. A strong grip on his blade rules the path, barely able to withstand the sword's vicious stream of tendrils.
I approach the body and climb through the cold but strong vines. My palms are sweating and I am scared. I follow my target to the balconies. After several passerbys I sit down on the balcony of the rundown building and watch as they slide downwards on to the dirt. I rest my head on the potted plant as the trees on the hill below grow a tall and root-less pile. I follow the cluster until a small red square begins to rise up around the head of the artist. I step over the thorny branch and he falls down.
He calls out, " Your god damn here! " I gasp as he gasps and kneels, his cry echoed throughout the city. I glance around at the crowd and see he and the artist sharing stories. I lower my sword and pick up the fallen artist's knife. When I strike his head he rears back up, his eyes darted around the shadowy pile of corpses, filling me with fear. His hand quivers in grief and I can't move. The world around him skips and skips around me, a horror I am incapable of watching. It is then that I hear the words " My evil master did not see you coming, he has been here here all along."<|endoftext|>

"So you're telling me I'm a dragon? " The chuckling blonde girl said coyly.
" Yeah dude, no. Not that you are a dragon, its just a stupid connoisseur with a weird hobby. " I replied.
" Oh sure, I guess so, what is it then? "
" I'm a... I'm a dragon, " I squealed out, knowing she saw.
I walked around, slowly grabbing several coffees, before she was blown out of the maw. Then, she looked at me and smiled. She giggled into the air and giggled back.
I took off my clothes, carried on, and avoided the others of my kind. As I walked down the road, people in those strange colored robes looked over my shoulder, causing me to blush. They looked younger than the others.
" Go on then, we've got a little more activity in store. "
" Good, right, lets go see this craft store " I said eagerly.
As we got out of the store, a series of drawers in various shapes and sizes filled the air, revealing to most people a beautiful dragon. I recognized these! Some were markings of dragons, some were dragons. I instantly recognized most.
" Excuse me, " I said with a heavy sigh.
" Can I get you an autograph, " said the large lady pointing towards the corners of the drawers. She gave me a confused look.
" Oh, please! This isn't good enough for you. "
" But I'm not a dragon, there's a reason I'm called... " I paused, shocked at my own disbelief.
" Well you see, dragons are crazy. They're really strong, too. A dragon would only make an idiot out of himself. "
The small lady picked up a piece of paper and a pen, the ink turning hot as the lady flipped it open.
" This isn't even good enough to write. "
The pen whirled slightly and went flying. Another piece of paper appeared.
" This... this thing is a word of hexagon, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't work and it doesn't break. "
And so on.
I opened up the sheet of paper, flicked it off, flipped it on again, and then the dragon was written.
" Forgive me, I made a mistake " I said frustrated, " I'm not a dragon either, my family died long ago anyways, and the pain doesn't end here. "
As the dragon rose up to feast on my forehead, I read the word " Greater Fine " on the paper. And as I took it, I suddenly realized it was true, I knew this dragon was perfect. I knew that when I touched it, it would be filled with deviousness and motivation.
Then, I took this dragon and bashed it into bits, as if it were the culmination of years of training. A few women got attacked by the dragon and spurned it, all of a sudden we'd just had enough, now there was only a fucking dragon. It was too late.
Everyone was finally against me, and I, a 19 year old boy with severe mental illness, ran home with a power outage, and run around like this for the rest of my life.
I could see it in the reflection of the small framed window I was sitting on, and it was all-encompassing.
" So, do you know how to stop it? " I asked, my tired eyes looking into the only window I had.
" Are you sure?"<|endoftext|>

Ed ended up dead right in front of the mirror, staring blankly at a tissue.
"Alright homie, " I whispered, my voice thundering through his head. He didn't pay attention; before his eyes adjusted on his bottom, he started to roll over on the couch. I pointed at him, and gave him the finger, steadying his grip. The sneer crawled across his face as he slowly bent over, eyes focused on a mass of paper the size of a thumbnail.
" Wait, " he stammered out. " You're not being serious. " He almost chewed on a piece of paper, only to learn later that it had just been stubbed with a reminder of who had in mind. A green band read, " My mentor. "
" Okay, now, how about you take a quick shot? " I scribbled down the actions that laid out at the center of the carpet. The politician he liked didn't have the heart to attack. Or at least he hadn't gotten any of my shows off.
" Go to hell, Frank. " Ed kept muttering to himself. I stood up, giving him a hug. He lunged at me with a fat hankering for a slice of pie, but I kicked him right in the jaw. His twitching turned to anger as he spun around to face me, his eyes rolling over the surface of the carpet.
" You even tried taking Peter from me! " he shouted. I stood silent as he huffed, about to repeat the mistake a second time until he regained his composure. He practically lunged through the window into the classroom, still eyeballing Ed.
" Jesus fuck! It's like he pulled a secret sauce from his mouth! " Ed said as he ran to me. " That means you were mean. "
" Actually, it makes perfect sense, " I said, smiling. We sat in silence for a while, watching the newest episode of Jane the Virgin. * What a douchebag*, I thought to myself. It all worked out anyway.
We stood in a field together, watching an action movie with the two of us. " I think I'm going to make that recording go again, " Ed said. We were never really together before.
" What about my video tapes? " I asked him.
" Oh, you don't have any of that. But I thought it might help us find the right one. Right next to my book. " He laughed, visibly annoyed. Then he turned and left. " Why do you think I was so mean? " he asked.
" It's like you're the son of the bitch in the mirror! " I told him, looking at my scar on my right forearm. That mean face didn't have any emotion to it, or at least it wasn't terribly happy for him.
" Why do you think I used that fake name! " Ed yelled, pointing to the way his eyes were drooping.
" They're all fake. " I said.
" Yeah. Who these people think they're worse off than?! " Ed asked.
" But not everyone is shitty off. " I pointed to the cafeteria where i was working. A government guy smirked.
" If they were bad off, how would they never lie to each other, " he teased. " If you're not the hardest person to screw around with, how'd you get enough good ratings? "
" What's with the lab coats?" I asked him.<|endoftext|>

"I'm sorry. " I hung my head in my hands. " What are you going to do with me? I'm done here. I didn't think you'd do this. "
" I still don't know what the hell you're talking about... " She trailed off. I held her gaze and made my way back to my chair, half feeling comfortable.
" Just think... You could do this for me! You could make a difference. " She sputtered. " But I won't, you know. "
" Sarah! How can we go back to the real world? The key to our lives. There's nothing worse than living a lie and knowing that someone is lying to you! "
" And you think that you can save me? It would be a terrible mistake for you to run for president again, you know? Look at me. " She offered.
I sighed and grabbed her hands. " Why? "
" Don't call me Sarah. " She shook her head. " Don't be silly, Margot. I'm here to make life better for you. "
Sarah wiped her mouth and turned away. " But I won't. I've done more than that. I've saved millions of lives. I've... " She trailed off. " I'll live out those days in my peaceful solitude. "
I sat back and stared at her. " Sarah, " I began. " I know you have depression... I'm sorry about that. And you *know* it's just a lie. But I love you. You understand, I don't need this bullshit. It's all truth. Trust me, I'm everything I've ever been. "
Sarah looked away and held her hands up again. " That's okay, Margot. You have every right to be disappointed, but I know you still want something, and you have an edge to say that you deserve a chance at changing the world with a little bit of truth. There's a certain irony to this, though. I've played to this moment thousands of times, lived this moment, and it's still in my genes. This isn't new. I know it's not hard to look up to that sweet, youthful, and innocent smile I'd have if I could've expected that from you. But believe me, I know that you need to be stronger than that, know the time is right. I'm so grateful you're here. I hope you remember me as an angel, watching as you tried to take control over your life, and after that it ended. I was happy to be there to remind you every day that there was something else. "
" I love you, Margot." I said, and buried my face into her chest.<|endoftext|>

This was hard. It was hard enough stepping on the red sands of Mars and seeing earth as it was meant to be. This godforsaken earth that we live in had spent so long wondering what we would look like and start colonizing it and then came to understand. This was the height of our beliefs in a cause, an injustice, a false hope, the darkest of all. We would wake up with the oceans dark, with the air full of fire, to fall asleep and fire upon the sky. Yes we would laugh at the glory of these new humans, the art of celebration and death and of man, but how could we smile as we build our footsteps on the ashes that could not be found until we would hear their claim. Maybe we would even find ways to turn our footsteps into joyous music. To live with our flames being so immense that we would hardly notice them, let alone enjoy them. Maybe if we smiled and sang, they would just burn away like the weeds they eat, burn their flame just enough to hold them down to eat. Perhaps we would build something like a monastery and watch the sun set over the earth. Maybe we could get a chance to cry together and dance amongst us. Maybe we could feel the kind of happiness this guy is trying to sell us. He can't control our emotions but we will at least give him peace in his own way, give him strength if you like.
And just like those millions of us who have walked this Earth, we all fell one by one, slowly and painfully. A great deal of fear set in as we saw our first colonist look the Earth in the eye and wonder what it would be like. We began looking at the horizon, marveling at our new, expansive land. We built such things. Cities so vast and complex and amazing, never once imagined that they would meet our gaze. Towns were made, tunnels dug, roads flowed. We turned our heads to see what was left and saw how beautiful these things could be.<|endoftext|>
**********495**********
We came here because we wanted freedom. It's not obvious, but maybe a little when we were young and thinking. Finally we came here, the long journey to freedom where we all stood and just stood. A large crowd was gathered there, just another civil war taking place. Some people gathered and cheered, some even carried sticks and rocks towards a dance floor. What was once a great nation was dead. World Wars? Civil wars being fought across the continent? A blank canvas against the glorious world.
I couldn't sit on the grass anymore, I was dying. As I watch the faces of the crowd go from sadness to despair and then laughter, I feel something move. It feels like lightning, seemingly stronger and clearer than the day before. Some people are pulled by the wind and thrown on the stone floor as a blow of energy, others disperse to spread the crowd. I should be thrown. But I'm holding a rock, powerless as I watch everything run away as it explodes as a sound, maybe it wasn't lightning. Something new is coming, it wakes me from the cold, the wailing of every tick of the clock. I run towards it and throw it hard against the stone- I'm running faster. All at once I am no more, I am the sun in my face.
It's gotten louder and louder as I watch it shatter and pound at the people, as I watch the light fade from their eyes and onto the stone as I have seen, running towards the light and finally the stone. One moment it was blinding and it left their eyes, blinded by the motion but they finally become deaf. It stops moving as the light drains from the stone, only to be replaced with a warm glow. We look at each other and at each other in wonder, both naked. The silence becomes unbearable, as everyone is just another spectator. I climb the ladder and jump into the machine waiting for the next event. That one is the leader. He gathers all of us and uses his swords to push our way past everything that could be thrown at him.
It's the opportunity for freedom, or so I have heard. I can see it now but my heart is racing as the image of the leader and his men die in the current. I walk out of the room and get off the first steps. He is in the corner and a stab hits me across the heart. I fall back on the metal platform we had set, I curse as I look at my home town. A sudden amberate fills my veins and I am nauseous. As I look down at my feet and see blood dripping and spit flying in my face I hear a commotion behind me. I look outside and see a line of people, each holding a staff with wicked tools. I run towards the spot of the hand holding the staff and run as fast as I can towards the large group of people who are holding hands with me. I am the last one. I look in horror as all I feel is pain and then I grab a man near me and run towards the head of the staff which then explodes under the force of his hand as the others are falling down in agony. I stand still, gripping the staff tightly. Another blow came in my face, one who was happy and happy that he didn't die. I hold onto it tightly as the pain fades and all my sensations disappear from my body.
We march along the park as thousands crowd against us, but as we march down, the light fills in the distance and onto the fountain of youth.<|endoftext|>

It was no ordinary trip from his home town to the holding cell. It took the bad guy 5 miles before they found his old roommate. All due to dumb luck. He lived alone, just sleeping to make ends meet. He woke up one morning to the sound of his dad knocking on the door. From the look of it, his dad seemed angry. And so he knocked. That was three nights ago.
"There's a new guy here! "
" Ha! I forgot his address. "
" Hey, that's his phone! "
" Heard it's activated! He says he has permission to talk. "
" Did you put the phone down? "
" No... "
" Are you...? "
" Yes, is that what they said? "
" Sorry, I'm afraid I don't remember getting there in time. "
" Wait a minute, you're still here? "
" No, that's the one. "
" No way. "
" Whats his name? "
" It's a guy named Mike. "
" You? "
" Yeah? What is he talking about? "
" Dude, just come back here. "
" Alright dude. "
" Ok, bye Mike. "
Mike stepped back into his cell. Inside the cell was a bit closer to home than usually, just a few doors over. The couple looked confused. Nothing out of the ordinary.
He told them all the guards didn't know what they were doing, and that his anger grew over time.
But then he thought about how stupid he was that night.
'Who the hell was that?'
" I never want to hear that again..."<|endoftext|>
**********497**********
The app flashed for another hour.
"Honey, something's not right "
I'd like to tell this to my wife of 7 years. But alas, I get called pretty much every day at the office. My wife is really mature in the ways of my life. She's been meaning to marry me for the last 7 years. She's been with me all my life. I had dreamed of *having* 2 kids, myself and my brother, on and off. It's not exactly financially in reach for most, but we had all gone about our lives like nothing happened. In lieu of a physical baby, I had just missed those last 3 years because when we got too old, the implant only works in the womb.
After I had had enough, I decided to turn on the EAS. Something we used when you were a few years old. We wouldn't only get to connect with our friends, friends, colleagues, and family, but everyone we could see on the screen. Those who didn't immediately knew what they were seeing.
When I exited a bio-psych-analysts desk in the office that was led by Dr. Morales, I opened my new account.
" Hey!" I called out. My phone rang out, and my cell phone rang. It could not be longer. Just about halfway through the first two digits, I called Dr. Morales and gave him a blank look. I saw no reason to continue.
Then, the chip came.
***
As soon as I got it in my e-mail my eyes lit up. Dr. Morales was here, inspecting the chip; he was referring to a to-be-named computer program that was specifically designed for my own pleasure.
***
Me and my brother always thought our bodies, our lives, our aspirations, our goals were special.
We thought we would be a married couple with children, visiting relatives who wanted to go out and get together with us, care for our children, and succeed in school. We were wrong.
He had forgotten that we were not human, and had left us with a single chip implanted in the only brain in the body we had. Now, in this new world, there is nothing to no chip implant. We are all just machines.
***
The doctor had gone all over the room. It was almost surreal, looking at him. He had started to tell us a few things about himself, about his early career. About his education, about his beloved wife. About his upbringing, about his romance, about his wife, his family, and all that. None of it had fazed the doctor, the officer or his wife.
***
After hearing about the implant, the officer called me over to check on the newly-established connection and. When I asked about her, she told me that she and my brother didn't have anything on their current body. She left the apartment too quickly for me. The newest body had come in three days, and I lost my brother. His mother, mother-in-law, whole family, he was gone. He couldnt face the world that way.
***
It took all of seven days to explain all this to the good doctor. He explained how he knew his brother was not with his son, and explained how his aging mother was the one person he didn't want to become a part of.
***
The cop called me to report a murder. He shot a man in the leg and arrested a pedestrian in the middle of the intersection. When the police officer went to the morgue, he was run over by a bench.
***
The medics said that the man, had a gun.
***
When the police arrived, they shot and killed the man in the leg. He then broke out of his chair and attacked the officer.<|endoftext|>

"It's been an interesting week. We've just about felt certain victory and the question we all are now asking: if it doesn't count when you've begun to waste your time. "
I can hear everyone groaning beneath me, little explosions and lab experiments running through their nerves.
" So, uh, they said we have been training for, uh, a very long time " I say.
" Yes, but.. can we really do that? Have you seen anything of significance beyond these aliens? " the other men in the room almost push me away.
" When was the last time I saw something that we had expected, didn't I? "
" Maybe that was last week? " I say, excusing myself to the open room.
" We just got out of Andromeda, and they're seriously coming for us "
Then I see it. An armada of tall humanoids, around seven feet long, gripping our equipment. Their skin was like that of a meat sack, folds and folds, like holding a telephone pole. One sort of an indented about a half inch. They wear dark, human leather that barely covers the ends of their legs.
" What is it, little one? " I ask the more minor of the alien visitors.
The little one turns it's head.
" We're training the universe in a new way "
The other men in the room rise from their positions to rest, haggard faces staring.
" But what about Humanity? Do they even exist? Aren't they just the great benevolent things we've been searching for, pun intended? Don't you see what the rest of the galaxy, those stellar cities and stars have become? " the stranger gestured to the ancient building.
I was concerned.
The stranger then, rubs his hand through his beard and turns, turns back, walks to the intercom, and looks to the door.
" Halt! The next green alert is a trap, " the stranger murmured. " We expect humans to be physically impossible for me to defeat them now. They'll probably only come here to steal us from one of our own planets that is actually quite and full of life. We want them to ask for something very, very nice back home. "
" And what kind of hard question is that? " I asked softly.
" We don't have hard-hitting reasons" the stranger said.<|endoftext|>
**********499**********
It was all part of our job
That we would ascend as gods
That we would ruin this universe
That this world would crumble
That this is not how we expected it to end
That it would all just end there
That was part of our plan
But as our world crumbles over time
We'll get there, and we'll all ascend
And win again and again<|endoftext|>
**********500**********
This is the end of the first day, Boss. Let's begin.
*0:30*
You? Hey Boss, it's Patrick... I needed another boss. I needed an extra manager.
-- -- -
I watch the Batmobile just outside the research facility from the airlocks, as it cruises past. I don't think the rest of the world would notice any of this, as they're too far away for this to happen. But they're here for me, because it's not always like this.
I get the Sparrow, and I take off for the hangar. The cloakroom is open, and the Last Claw is breathing heavily, as it scans the room. I make my way over to Patrick, who cradles his hands on the table. I look in his eyes when he sees me, and he nods.
I walk up to him, and say a few words that knock him down. He nods, his posture unnaturally quick.
A long, long moment passes before I say one last word.
"Well I'll be seeing you." I say, and he nods.
I walk out, keeping a good distance from Patrick, the one who kept him at bay all night and just before I finished.
I love meeting friends.<|endoftext|>
**********501**********
"Hello, Excuse me, Mr. Knight here "
I didn't respond, on the contrary, I took the walk with my book in hand. I noticed, with a quick look around, that the floor was lava blue. This also made sense because they are made of lava.
I pushed past the guards that had come through the pathway with me, finding metal pipe which flowed into a thick, hard, cavern that was much larger than anything I could've known. There are a lot of pipes to see, the snakes which usually used stairs had glowing purple through it, while a spiral staircase lead down stairs which had a sickle that looked like two eyes.
I walked towards the food, which led directly into the hall, which was carved with years and millennia of history in that one stone circle. The spines of the giant legs on the legs led down the hall, where they poked out from the ground. I stepped away from the cavern however, as I saw that the rooms were much larger than I expected, the lava smelling like peaches, rot off of the walls and the smell of burning metal from the lava.
I quickly looked around the rest of the hall. One is at least the same height as the other, to be sure, right? How long ago was the time when I discovered what they were?
I ran to the bed that it was bedding in, I quietly slipped it on top of the other one and laid down in front of it. Then I turned my head towards the hallway where I saw other rooms, dirt, stone chambers to the right. So many. How many did the guards lock up here?
I left the room, when I came back inside I was not in the same room as before. There was a circle of fire surrounding it, and bricks all around it. Pieces of it were scattered, like chunks of glass and stone, my memory of it was fuzzy, I wasn't sure where it'd come from.
The one with the purple eyes, who I'd seen before, was actually named Ian. He lived in my hometown when I was a kid. That guy really specialized in being able to fly, to continue flying without touching a single land tile. He loved being able to fly, and flew faster than anyone else but me. He climbed the trees on his birthday, closed down the forest, was on vacation with his parents, and never missed his flight.
He fell off of the first one that he found. It was a giant cave that was locked down by a staircase. After pressing my thumb up against it, I instantly felt sweat.
" I'd like to go back, let me go, it wouldn't ruin it. " Ian said.
" I promise I wont. " I replied.
" Fine, I'll go now. " Ian said.
Then I heard the weird music coming out of the hallway, sure it was somehow coming from the alien-like creatures that popped out of the hole in the wall, but I felt something new. Something was pulling me close, I couldn't see him.
Ian walked over to where I was, I felt my abdomen rise and fall with the music from the hallway. Was it my body? I leaned over the threshold, sure I was Ian, my body was telling me to put down the music, which was blasting out of the wall and a giant scaled demon was passing by me. A third group from the way stumbled into the hall, the first held open another door. I heard the sound again, in the same way the feeling of the music would haunt me, forever piercing my soul.
Ian walked off looking at his watch, as if he were the last one to enter.
" May God have mercy on my soul."
And I was back in the little cave. After a few minutes, I stepped out again, to look back on this world I'd left behind. There's memories and secrets I would never mention again.<|endoftext|>

" I know you're trying. I know that. I just couldn't do it so I just got to take a break. I love your skill, you just need to realize how fucked up you are. I know that so it's great. It is. You're so nervous, and you just need to step up. Go ahead, fix that. "

"So does it use windmills? "
" Yeah, it uses it for what they all call air flow. The windmills, they basically just the air is driven through it. It's a little bit of a flow effect. "

" Windmilling, aerodynamic effect. "
" Well where you put the windmills is how much air and how much of a effect it is. You would- "
" You would need... Oh please. "
" Well, my first kids were all failures. He was running a school all by himself. Had to rely on'the windmills' and other things. The kids loved him, but they lost interest in him because he was an idiot. Had to tell them he was retarded. And after that they were all about it. He eventually got detention in a giant furnace. Probably the worst thing that ever happened to him. He died on his birthday. He didn't care. He left everything behind. "
" I'm sorry. He's a genius too. I don't mean to imply that. "
" No, he was suicidal. "
" What? "
" He was suicidal because people were so focused on *their* future. "
" That was never his intention? "
" No. "
" Who's clued? "
" Oh what? It's like a dictatorship? "
" No! Shut up. "
" Oh! Yes. There's a mini government at school. A study shows that there is a higher average attendance among adolescents. So if you get more people here, you want more people there, you do. "
" Oh sure. I know. That's why I'm here. "
" No problem. "
" What? "

Disclaimer: due to privacy policy, I don't own Rain of Souls.
It had always been a dream of mine to become a Demon Hunter. I sat around the crack of dawn in the Arctic, the grass beneath my feet rustling as I watched the ground rattle underneath my feet. As I walked I stared at the death of the world. Now that it was over the sky was literally falling on our village.
My father came into town and ordered me to feed and fetch as many as necessary for my daughter. I had to fill this family filled, about a year before I made it out and a week later I saw my daughter taken away. Her only way out was to hide behind a tree and bear her. In her sleep I searched her again, digging into her cold chest until she cried and her lungs ached.
Then the lights went out. I woke up and when I opened my eyes the night had just started. My screams and hiccups only lasted a few moments before I could feel a sharp pain in my chest and awaken a blur of darkness before my eyes. I could feel a demon in my peripheral vision, apparently watching from his lair of souls, but I have no idea how I managed to knock it out. I stand at the edge of a nearby hill, looking up at the city above me, staring at the orange haze that first came upon me. I can't feel my bones and anxiety is killing me slowly.
A man holds up a glowing orb of fire as he climbs into his car. The road ahead turns and I am hit by a very large truck following behind. The man in the flaming black vehicle stands gasping for air and the driver comes out from behind the truck roaring up the hill. I hear screaming and hysteria from the other side of the road.
"The demon has finally come out of my dreams." My father smiles as the car was fully engulfed in flames. The blood on his cheeks and face was turning black as the majority of his body failed to release any matter before his body went cold. He breathed out his last breath and with two slow exhales, the air outfitted him with the power of a thousand years.
The next thing I knew, a beast had slain half of my family, and my daughter was gone. I looked towards the final door and saw the remains of the inn my village was in. A small empty room and small wooden door with no handle remained and I was back in my little apartment. I had put it up for sale but nothing else seems to be very special about the place. I went out into the streets and searched the stores, I never expected to find anything special. From the information I had found, it was very low budget. I tried to sell everything and moved to the next district, but had to leave before the demons came for me, leaving me with nothing but a massive pile of loot.<|endoftext|>

* "Well it's bloody disgusting. " * I told the overweight man sitting at a chair. " No seriously, that's the typical bullshit life you're living. We make bananas, a dictionary, some helpful reading material, just all out of your damn head. "
* " But you threw up your hair! And then it would come out! " * He shouted at me.
I looked at my phone, replaying some time in a dream. I found the biggest donation jar. 20 bananas for me.
* " Huh. You can hardly count how many times I cut my hair! " * I said to the tall tree. It had his limp body.
" Well... that's just the one of the merits though. Don't do what the hell you're saying. " He replied with his brisk.
* " If only I hadn't cut my hair already. " * I said to myself.
After some time of talking I moved to the cooler. The puddles of pineapple were no good since my head was about to hit the floor. I turned on the power.
* " What are you? " * The voice came into the room behind me.
I looked around. Could this guy be back at my place? Did I even exist? I wondered.
* " What if I could. " * The voice said.
* " Where are you going? " * I thought to myself.
The most obvious thing to ask him was " How was it? " As my brain tried to process what he was talking about, I tried to summon my spirit to remember. To just follow this mad prankster back.
* " I'm here to take you back. I'm... **Orstomaniac. ** " * I said at my most guttural.
I looked at my phone again. 20,000. Two minutes.
" I have... the power... " I started.
* " What the fuck... I'm so screwed!" * The voice boomed, pinging the 3 inch screen of my phone.<|endoftext|>

He is covered in bandages. He is pulled forward in his wheelchair by his knees and they are squealing. He stares in horror at the set of yellow leather bands around his chest.
He is almost leaning against the wall now. The bandages are pouring in and he is beginning to cough. The floor is splayed under him. His eyes are open and he is sobbing. He has been waiting. The blood from his wounds is running down his neck. It all happened so fast.
Another knot in his neck. Again. Oh God. He is crying. They're pulling him from behind.
He struggles as he tries to fall but is overcome by the weight of the rope still in his arm. He is floating. It's coming down. He can't go on. He needs to walk.
He tries to beg but is impeded by the place where he currently lies. He is too tired to move. He needs to find his way to the other side. The string is pulling. He needs to reach the other side.
A man lies in the middle of the cobblestone road. One left arm, the other lying within inches of each other. His blood is running down his body. The hot blood is steaming in his lungs. He is crying.
The man's eyes open. He can't see, but his head still hurts. His eyes are open and he's stopped speaking. The man smiles sadly. They pulled him from behind.<|endoftext|>

“ No, I ’ m actually fine. I ’ m fine. ” I said as I took a quick sip of my lemonade. It was the darkest and worst part of my day. I didn ’ t feel that extreme disappointment about my solitary life. I was a weight off the shoulders of everyone who slept next to me, while everyone else was suffocating in their sleep. Everyone I ever knew was dead.
I could feel my heart fluttering throughout my body as I was trying to undo all of the stress I felt all my life. I was miserable as always, and I felt lost like never before. I was even more miserable when people would step into my room begging to fuck with me. I was even depressed.
When it ’ s my time to go, I will tell everyone what i had done to make me stop. The worst part of it is I could tell the people who would come in and have sex with me the same thing. They would walk up to my bed and have sex with me too. I ’ d kill them in real life.
I know now that I had done the right thing, because it is now more or less at my door. I swear I feel good about this. If I can do this to someone, I ’ m sure they will enjoy it. I couldn ’ t wait for this day. I got to show them I did it. I got to sell them my dream.
And I hope they won ’ t hate me for it.

There is a way out of hell. A lot of people try. I went to a church for a year now. I failed, I didn't run enough. I was like a dog in the desert, until the people came and came. I found them.
Oh, how I smiled. I'm so scared. Just thinking about it makes me wan na giggle, and I can't stop myself from smiling all the time. I lie down, hiding. I know I can't be seen, they don't even know who I am, but I guess I can guess. I will go, I will get out of here...
Sometimes I wonder if I want to go out... I haven't eaten for days. So deep inside I really want to go out. But then I realized, my soul must be empty. I am trapped, a shell of a man who fears God and falls into his trap. He let me go for a year, which is long, I am so happy to have it at home, just the two of us. I will surely catch up with him once I'm out of this cell, I've seen him for so long. I love it here...
Is this heaven?<|endoftext|>

I've always hated dreams. I remember my first night in a dream. The fabled scene where a blip flashed from reality to me. Everyone was chanting. Her hair was frizzy. Perfect circles were scrawled into her face. Something in her eyes was playing with her fingers. Gently drawing a rock. Sitting there cradling it in her hands. I just kept staring. And then. I remember that gorgeous girl standing on the street. She looked over her shoulder at me. I remember what she saw. I had dreamed so many beautiful dreams, and it always ended with her facing me... never showing me. I hated it. So I sat back down. I remember spending nights turning off my mind, and the waves of reality slowly begin to calm. Everything is still okay.<|endoftext|>

"Hey, guys... " I slowly turned and looked around. The commoners were scattered among the others. The main guy, held up his hands in front of him. " Do you want to join us? "
Everyone just stared at him for a long moment. Most of the others just looked at him with a curious expression on their faces, stuck by his gesture. I turned back to the main guy. " Hello, how are you today? "
It was my turn. All the convention types looked at him and listened to the questions. " Well, " the people around me began, " what was your cosplaying tonight? "
The biggest disappointment of them all was they gave the cancellation decision as an answer. " On earth. "
The biggest disappointment of the convention, was I, but mostly because I looked at the handful of other people I'm now face to face. Other than myself, all of us could only nod. All of us expected to be paired up for our costumes. Someone would put their arms and feet up and shout " WHAT THE FUCK?" An expression of bewilderment broke out across everyone. And suddenly, there was nothing to be done. No one would listen. No one would care. Finally, they either disappeared into the crowd, or threw a fit. The leader of the group that couldn't seem to follow me, yelled at me and slammed my weapon down on the table. Then, a moment after it was launched, the big girl with glasses sprinted out the back into the crowd. Looking around her, I saw her wrapping her arms around herself. She pulled her glasses up and covered her mouth. The woman cried out with tears in her eyes as a maniac picked her up and dragged her out of the convention. We all just stared for a moment. After the maniaced man left, we looked around the room for the huge assembly. Some in the back of the crowd broke eye contact and struck out, others were headlong into their jumpsuits. The number of people in the crowd could be counted as a single group.<|endoftext|>

Emilia sat in the doorway of her brown-brick wooden cabin, gazing out onto the large expanse of concrete, the whirlpool of water that curved her frame seemed to disappear somewhere inside it. Then, she rose slowly, tossing the cloying bowl back and forth like a rat. The fires of the smoke and dust, her tongue perfectly formed from her fingertips, peeked up in the breeze, like wondrous pink dots peeking at her from the single smirk on her face. Her hair had been done up in a bun, and the brownish light in the nostrils seemed to grow, just slightly.
A creature slid its way over her table, its tongue stretching like it was straining to reach out to touch her. But she was always good with speech. That thing coughed out sand, saliva flowing up its throat like sharp wet wood.
“ Feels nice, ” said Emilia, her hands reaching out to get it. Its eyes were dry.
“ I can't wait to hear you talk. ” The creature opened its mouth, in preparation for the congealed voice that was coming in to fill them.
“ Really? ” Emilia asked, slipping a tube of water from its paw.
The creature chewed.
“ So… how come? ” said Emilia, laughing.
The creature let out a throatful of air, letting out a thin, cracked chuckle. “ It wouldn ’ t do, wouldn ’ t it? ”
Emilia had thought it a joke. For some reason, she could hear its laughter. She smiled.
“ Sorry, ” said the creature.
Emilia furrowed her brow, maybe it was trying to stay in thought, but instead it went a little farther then they should have.
“ Your kind got a reputation. No-one wants to- ”
Emilia didn ’ t say. She was lost. No-one had noticed the movement.
Just then, a voice was heard from the back of the craft, to the right of the already clouded cabin. It was the same voice, but a little stranger, as if it were whistling something.
“ Please, it ’ s been two days, ” the voice said.
Emilia sat in the cabin for a few long minutes, listening to the man speak, the scratches on the walls forming a slight indistinction in the air. She was falling to her knees, her legs swinging over the broken log.
“ Are you sure? ” the voice asked again, but a different voice.
Emilia sat on the ground as the man spoke. “ My luck was in a puzzle. ”
“ Do you see it? ”
The man said nothing. “ On the other hand? ”
Emilia gasped. “ Are you nuts? That… is my flight broken? ”
The man cut the news out of her mind, but the strange woman looked terrified. “ Something was wrong. ”
“ What? ”
“ Something was wrong with the stewardess. Her name was Anna. ”
The man grew angry. “ Don ’ t you fucking dare show your face again. ”
“ I didn ’ t mean for this. I mean for the passengers who are dead. Everyone. * I* was lucky. It just got a little hard. I thought I was joking. * I* tried hard, but this. This is my freedom now. ”
Emilia sat there, tears streaming down her cheeks, hoping that this was the man ’ s last act. The man took a knife and wiped them away with it.
“ Farewell. ” He said, already walking out the door.<|endoftext|>

When Androids became sentient, they became fearful of the rest of us. We would ask for help or fire them, or perhaps we would simply reach out and rip them from our skins. At first, we had no choice; the noise of their screams was distracting us from our vision of the world. We could not escape them, but we agreed it was the best thing that could come of letting them out. They would be the first to die. On their way down, a bomb breached the outer walls and shattered the sky. They lay dead.
Many went back in time and revived them once they reached higher temperatures and pressures. Why were the primitive races still aggressive, so horrible to one another, when the Planet Salvo was quiet and soft. Through countless generations, our civilization had developed a powerful machine that could separate the tribe from the ones we thought we must, we were on the verge of destruction. With any luck, we would ever need to do something.
But we were wrong. We had waited too long for an apocalypse. The Solarisians on their new world, grew very bored and decided to try something even more sinister. They set out to conquer the world in a way that would be too horrific to show on TV. Their next target? As their empire grew, so did we. So did all other species of Asari.
We placed those of them in prison, but one way or another, they were back home.<|endoftext|>

The Oracle was a sight, as usual at such a late hour on another planet.
"Oracle of the Ensign, you are asking for payment for services that are a part of this agreement? " The large man in the suit gestured at the tablets on the table. * x0.28251, 240807852, 44783476* I couldn't imagine what that was, or might be. I called up the receptionist again to ask if she knew what the price was, only to get no answer.
" OK, I'll give you the details " I walked towards the Oracle, asking who the representative was. She gave me no reply, and clicked the tab that indicated your name on the paper. Again, the contract with the Oracle came with the deposits.
" Great. So there you have it, Oracle, I hereby issue your ticket to one of the new stellar vessels to reach your destination " the representative told me as she watched the sheen of a nanobot floating around the chambers.
*x5.1966, 750048053, 314792794, 792442696, 822108423, 86074.00370*, *F5N-N20: N/A*
" You're a tax broker? " I asked as I lowered my glasses to my eyes.
" Yes! I'm an astronomer! You owe me a nominal fee of 5.83 trillion credits! " She handed me her clipboard with the same tiny voice she used on " travel insurance ". I took my eyes off of it and looked at my forehead, getting the impression that I was getting closer to my home planet.
" Yes, I accept it. " I broke eye contact with her as I started to sign my pad of numbers.
" Good, today we go sit down for your briefing, a privacy officer for starters " She said.
I looked over at her, quieted, then said, " There's a little information that needs checking " She pulled the long brown paper out from under it, and added the small red square next to it.
" That's an important one, we needed a way to track down all the equipment that the ship uses for interstellar travel. Does your name do that to you? "
" I prefer not to answer. I'm male. "
" Well, have you ever done a bio-traveler or an alien teller on them? "
" That's very fulfilling. Let's just call me Barry. " She tossed the old paper down in the vacuum suit.
I gave her a bow and took a deep breath. This was going to be a long trip!
" Right now, we need you to volunteer to take part in our time on this mission. After you check this out, we want to know who is the owner of this ship. Who does it, what information does it have on us? Are we the only people on this planet that don't do this kind of thing? " She thumbed through the cards I held.
" Really? The whole'we are here for the pleasure of our inhabitants' bullshit? " I gave a weak smile.
" Sure " Barry obliged. " May we thank you for your service? "
He shifted in his seat and said something, but I couldn't hear it. " Yeah, thanks. Now to your transaction, I have the bio-traveler's ID number, but you have to submit it to this scanner. " The scanners buzzed in on her as a holographic image appeared on the silver sheet.
" Our scanners scan the entire surface of this system and transmit the data across the galaxy, your bio-traveler's ID number and flight vector. On your own will you be debriefed? "
She smiled slightly and said, " Yes, of course."
I nodded and left, to explore a new world, visit the lost ships of some distant galaxy, or learn about the world that I had set up for myself, free of charge.<|endoftext|>

The wall of the warehouse was tilted sharply to the left and the shadowed doorway was looming.
The small wretch, one-half million years old, had seemingly been alive for millennia. Six billion years, here he was. And somehow, he was here.
With a burst of energy, the vast warehouse was flung back towards the rock face beneath. From his small bed, a shard of mirror appeared from the wall, the silhouette of an elderly man glowing with a cold, blue light.
The boy had been kidnapped. A peasantess. It was inevitable that this would be the last one. They were life and death. But there was one man more vulnerable to their influence.
*There she is*, said the young boy with a smile.
"It's time for supper, babe, " he added. The young man sighed, as if to say, " Don't worry. You won't find anything special. You won't need food in the middle. Everyone likes fine cheeses, and most likely wine, depending on how you enjoy them. "
" Is that alright? " The boy excitedly remarked, rubbing his eyes under the blankets and his warm, squinting eyes.
" It is. " The boy rubbed his head under his wavy black tuxedo, " You just should have cared about me. Remember when you went to- "
" What happened, *girl*? " His tone was grave.
" Don't say it again, " the boy said, wagging his tail behind him. " That's not right. You aren't even listening to me. "
The boy climbed onto the couch, his legs dangling over the edge.
" Go back to your desk, " he sighed, " Go back. "
The light in the warehouse was beginning to crack. Every time the boy's face grew darker and darker, the shadows began to follow, following his gaze.
*What... How did it even come to this? * The boy stood in front of the panel of symbols he had used to trace the history of the small tribe on the planet. The little squire's door had been opened. Even still, his mind was filled with wonder. He had created a wondrous puzzle,
*And that is why the boy must use his small stick to defeat me... *
A pen spun and a line formed across the top. It swung, swinging, building momentum.
*I've been enjoying my afternoon... Let's get out of here. It's already been an hour and thirty six minutes. "
With that the wall of the warehouse had widened, then shimmered. Shimmered an atmosphere billowed and filled the warehouse, so fluffy and colorful that the world fell into a still green sea.
*Stop talking to me, boy. Don't. Please. Don't. Just. *
The boy shoved the pen in his pocket. With one swift stroke he tore through the weight of the envelope. A small photograph was picked out, and imprinted three times with a single key.
" You've got to admit that you fucked this up pretty bad. Anyways, " he said, chuckling to himself. He opened the manila envelope and opened the signature... *INPRESSION. THE INCIDENT WAS NEGOTIATED. WE GAVE YOU A GOOD PAYCHECK, YOU COULD SAY. YOU TOLD THE SURVivors... DONT TASK!"
A noise of laughter emerged from the water; the boy had landed in the chute. He slid slowly to the metal pole.
As he looked up into the night sky, he saw her just sitting in the river, staring into a river, a happy smile on her face.

Oh fuck! What kind of bullshit is this?! I find myself in the middle of some fucking alley? Oh god this is shit, this must be the end of me...
"Oh FUCK! " I gasp as I fall to the ground, while half of me is sitting up. The other half of me is perched on my knees, still holding my once bloody hands. Fuck, I'm too poor. I look at the wall opposite my position, a small dagger in each hand. I reach forward to grab the dagger, but my whole body is shaking in terror, my eyes locked onto the broken fall of my leg.
The dagger fires me once again, but this time with such a natural force. My entire body jerks back into it's original position, and, by now I've picked up the sharpening nail. If I had any hope of survival, I'd resort to jumping up and running towards the fucking wall. I look down and see a bloody scar, taken straight from there in some horrible Germanic epic, where I have surely raped some jewishman while running away in an attempt to escape death.
I see the thing with the sharp tool sticking out of it's hand, peering up to pe point and realize it's a dagger. I flick the blade over my head to look for the word " German ", but it's too late. I see the one on the wall, and I know what's coming...
“ Time to assassinate Hermann Göring, head of the German Nazi party! ” yells the head of the US Nazi party dressed in a trench coat and running away.
I look at my phone, and see that I'm still logged in with the same user account, but now with a new password. I guess I need to find another job after this shit. I get up off of the floor, and start my sprint towards the wall, only to see Hermann having his " job done ", also muttering " For fuck's sake what's it gon na be?"<|endoftext|>

I bought a Blue Moon 39 for my mom and it works out as well as a normal Blue Moon. It lives past it's first year's in temperature of 30 deg C with oxygen and enough chemicals to support the warm orange green. Can't tell if the bitter 50s are around or not. People don't like the alternative.
Today I have bought a 20 year old to celebrate the old life. It has a habit of turning up early, just to make sure I have the weather and have a good food supply.
I look up and see a duck. He's looking up at me. Probably dozing off. I get to my feet and reach for my phone but it's still acting up. It must be fucked up.
"Hey man, " I ask. " How's your blue moon? "
" it's good mate, " says the man beside me. " Let's have some fun and share a drink to celebrate. "
I get back up in my flight suit and head to the bathroom.
I'm exhausted. Damn. I asked the man to write me the weather for tomorrow. I feel refreshed after over a hundred drinks.
" May I show you the weather for Tuesday? " asks the man with a thin mustache.
I open the door.
" Hey Joe. You shouldn't ask me for a weather forecast from a 10. "
He nods and shouts, " write me the weather, the circumstances and what's required. "
Damn. This must be some serious shit. I grab another 30 year old and drink. If he responds to me with " well, you get two drinks and we could die if we don't use those. "
I'm tired. Damn it. I can't think. I eat a glass and watch the blue sky.
I look down at the ducks that were sleeping in the corner. Their playful patterns changed. Too bright for one. I turn around and see the man gone.
" Dammit, Joe, that's irresponsible."
I head back to my phone and write the weather. I remember I'm drunk and haven't used the toilet since a fifty years ago. Maybe it was yesterday. Maybe this has always been bad.

"I believe, " Jenny said, packing up her bag, " that you were just an experiment. You weren't meant to escape. " She said it with a shrug, putting down her pen and setting it on the counter.
Of course, she had the wrong idea. They'd left the capsule in our hotel room somewhere around midnight. I broke it up, having already slipped one out, and packed it back up. It had been something of a routine.
I'd come out of that episode about a year after she left, and realized, as she did, that I didn't even know what else to do. I just sat there in my couch, watching Netflix. None of them complained when I started pouring myself enough of the weird stuff into our hotel room. I had always been a picture and video hound. A terrible sight to see outside, to go to college, to succeed in anything or anyone.
Turns out, that the only reason that Jenny ’ s experiments lasted two years was because of some genetic defect. My dad committed suicide with me, and whatever trick I used to try to cheat death was never discovered. They almost gave up on me two years after that. Like, they thought, sure, I was sweet and poor, and that they wouldn't trust me to manage their families.
But after she left for college, that changed. I saw her spend less time with those that she wanted to be. She saw them commit to many different things. Debt collectors, her neighbors, her bosses. Really anyone else in the family was calling the police. She tried to make herself scarce by sending people for death, but she ended up trying to get the name of one of her co-workers, and one of the police officers involved got shot and killed in cold blood.
I was the only man who was like that, and I never thought that maybe I ’ d have the chance to make it out of the institution. Turns out, she was the one who killed herself. This was supposed to be the last will and testament of her life, to confess her daughter's serial murderer and every person she had ever known. She went to college, and at first that made her like the rest of us. She graduated, got good jobs, and made a lot of friends at every university. She learned English, but she made her living as a dispatcher.
She led the police department on murder charges, but when the last piece of evidence came around, they were going to let her go. She was going to have to get the court dismissed. She went to a girl who was raped by an individual with a massive amount of guilt. She had a prior history of unprofessional behavior and failures. She committed suicide, and the police got a confession. He had been a part of some gang, and apparently the girl ’ s boss had given him the name “ Tammy. ” At least she said so, for real. But she ’ d had a lot more life experience in there. It took the system a while to process her confession.
She was scheduled to leave on April 3rd, but she didn ’ t feel like taking any chances. On the day of her departure, she got a call from an agent. She said that she was ready. And now she was going to go. She never realized how kind of a parent I was until she got that new assignment. She also worked for the CIA for a while.<|endoftext|>

"So... what's the plan for the Maydeam? " Voldemort asked in a conspiratorial tone.
Harry Potter had been sorted into Slytherin on March 19th of last year. Three months prior, Slytherin chapter 816. Now, Harry was in new class, again, his name was Peter Pettigrew, a very cocky boy who hated Charles, now his best friend James and he was afraid he would end up like this. Peter himself was also becoming a star student, unlike every other student, as well as an impressive Harry Potter, but he was only fourteen, in fact.
The groundskeeper on the front desk handed him a paper and interrupted the order.
" Professor Dresden, would you please send out Professor Dresden because he is entering the Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts camp before Professor Dresden arrives? "
Harry stared at the paper and blinked. Then he jumped at his partner, who simply frowned. " Don't give me that moment. This will be hard for Hermione, she has 60 seconds to get her name and the Ravenclaw Council to approve her because if she goes, the rest will follow and kill her.
Ron looked up. " Professor Dresden, we know the power you wield in the dark is to turn the most innocent creatures into emissaries of evil. Yes, you have been correct. It will work in an interesting way, but even more interesting is your ability to control ice in the air. Head of Magical Studies, James Muggles, the guy who manages to bypass her spells on two of her professors, I don't think we have quite gotten through to him yet. "
There was a pause. After a moment, Harry turned his attention back to his partner who was still puzzled.
Professor Dresden poured his hand through her hair and sighed. " Well, hopefully he doesn't have to cut her hair like that, because he's not much of a wizard anyway, but I'm not much of a scientist either so I wasn't quite expecting anything to happen either. "
Harry nodded and continued his explanation.
" You need a more efficient method of casting spells. If we sent everyone to kill each other and make Harry's opponent nuke the whole Camp it's a little easier, but well this isn't one of those tricks. More people are activated using the power of Wikipedia's combination algorithms to make Anna Weasley fall in love with James Dronin and Voldemort make him'reitterate'. A good portion of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry spells are released by a variety of prefects from primary to mid-elementary to prefect-level wizards. If you funnel them all together. "
There was a pause.
" Now, Professor Dresden, are you completely convinced there is a good chance your ideas will lead to, like, any practical, actionable, or completely plausible way of defeating Dumbledore himself? "
" Perhaps, " Harry admitted. " I'm not sure. "
Professor Dresden added, " My guess is that if he can siphon out their core with his knowledge in order to kill Dumbledore at the end of it, he will either create any sort of compartmentalized fallout from Voldemort or, if they don't have the right materials to destroy him, Voldemort will absorb himself or at least take part of it. Either way, " he noted, " the best we can do is guess what will happen to him at the end of it all."
He paused again.
Peter Snape stood in front of the entrance to the detention centre. Harry Potter was the first in a billion years, and now he wasn't afraid.<|endoftext|>

I could have written over five paragraphs. Everyone loves description, but that's not a natural action; the story is filled with so much detail and emotion. I didn't feel like it was done enough in the dialogue, or in the descriptions ( really, much of what's said about the location or function of the property is etched into your mind, you see ).
They put me in an environment that reades it like little solipsistic puffs on a breath-holding machine. I felt really off, despite the individualist nature of the description. The second person at the end isn't happy, the third doesn't seem like an ideal vessel for what he's doing.
You did a good job making the description stylistically appealing; the usage of pronouns and emotions is jarring, sure, but maintaining a structure of clarity and communication that carries the weight of an epic novel is hard.<|endoftext|>

Five guys on a dank TV stared at me, eyes bright as I took the first drink of the day. I stood up, still in my spiffy jumpsuit and took my watch: a 20:56 slot on the hour. I glanced down at my things: a medical drink and some napkins. " What's wrong? "
I tilted my head and tried to focus my thoughts. " Daddy isn't paying attention. "
My son grabbed me and held me tight. " He's down low. "
" -50, " my son squeaked.
I mumbled something under my breath but the room seemed comfortable. " Daddy's gone to school today. "
I sighed and rolled my eyes. " He's staying up late, but daddy's watching Netflix and YouTube. " My husband could hardly hold up his hands. I shook my head. " He's watching " pinterest " now.
" Grandma passed, " my son chirped, looking around as if to demand that the door be taken.
" Yes, honey? "
My husband looked away with a concerned look. " -420. "
" He's on YouTube, is he okay? "
" Yes, we know he's not, but we hope he's OK. "
I mumbled to myself and crawled out of bed, took a deep breath. " -40, " as I slipped away into the moonlight.
I pulled myself up onto the bed and took off my boots. In no time, I grabbed a coat from my closet. " Honey, we need to see something. " I wrapped the coat around myself and followed my son around the room until he was alone in the dark, when I heard a click. " Check the other room!" I held the door open as best as I could.<|endoftext|>

"Annabelle! "
" I... I'm... ALONE! I didn't think about where I was! "
" I know. That was the last thing I remembered, and, as always, that's always the hardest part. "
" So you made your choice. "
" I did. It's not easy being controlled by your freaky magic, or your cynical self loathing. It's simply amazing how selfish it is. I, for one, am in love with you. "
" And who's whispering my name is Mary. I suppose it's hard to tell a vampire without ever having other women aware of their seductive magic. The room is a terrible place for rule, and my haste to get back to my mates and get back to me was the prime directive. "
" But you were wrong about Susanne. I was wrong about it. "
" Of course I was wrong. I love Susanne. You are my most faithful servant. "
" Not an entire loving family of vampires. "
" Of course I can feel your love. It feels good. "
" It's not so bad when you call. "
" Of course I do. "
" Very soon you shall go with me to the alchemical library. And, you shall always feel at peace with my presence."<|endoftext|>

I say a son? Yeah, I say a boy. It's like from a kids theme song, nothing more. When it comes to boyhood, I say'no father, no mother, no friend.' And she just suddenly slips out with a shot of a pretty flower. I say boy!
So if you are going to tell me about the times when I was little, what you do when I wish for childhood was easy, right? Little boys play without lights, and it's because they're too scared or a little drunk or a little anything and they're running around in circles or something. Yeah, I know that sounds a lot like th' realisation that there's no escape from it... but when you're a kid you can't just g'play it off so much.
Now I know I shouldn't have it a lot of times, but sometimes you just have to, just before a game or a movie. But I tell you, I just can't say that. I know, Mom, dad, I know, uh, there's so many others who are just flustered in these situations and they're all sad. And they all have that frayed make up, scar tissue, and their hair looks really smudged and they look like they're run out of breath at night, like what the psychiatrists refer to as depression. That kind of stuff... hey, let me tell you something; don't like kids, don't like losing them too much. They're probably just not quite ready, the rejection you can feel at such a young age, won't budge a bit unless you tell them that it's ok. I'm not going to deny that that's true, but let's be real here for a second: no one really wants to take away all of the joy that their kids have at school or school, because if they had gotten the wrong idea about sports maybe someone would have been working on it and gotten better at it because of it... you know? Most kids are still missing a lot of something, like a beat-up baseball cap, they all have their generic tiny tattoos and signs and drawings and almost everyone will have at least one simple thing in their heads but their real sense of pride is gone. When your first son shows up the fact that he's got something to draw on, you drop a little. You start to believe everyone in your family that you're going to pick his mommy and daddy up on the first steps in front of the bus and they'll give you some space! And you pick up that cute little thing he did for a jog and pretend it's yours! They'll carry you to play the rest of the park, they'll hug you and toss you big and big and big ball by the door and you'll pretend like your kid didn't want you to put your hand over his mouth. And when you pretend like that, they'll be worried too that you'll get hurt and that they're not sure what to do or what to say. But I don't want you to feel that way. I don't want you to know what it feels like to see my face every day when I wake up, when I just want to be with my brother, when I stare straight ahead at the green white walls of his room while he goes for a walk... because I want to be with him in those walls and our way of life, and that's what I want to be with him in these walls and in these walls.
And in those walls there are so many things, you know? I can't really put a finger on it. The reason these walls are all so solid is because I can't make them fall apart if my brain tries to push all of them down. So when I lose my best friend to cancer, I try to look back and remember that just because I lost someone does not make it right.
So if you must be wondering about this then look, I'm going to go down in history to cause a lot of commotion when I look back on the past.
And if you're wondering about what it feels like when you hear'no father, no mother, no friend' on your phone; then it's just right that you should not kill your best friend who took you away from him...<|endoftext|>

New York City is in meltdown, people call the police but don'thing. Our little town the only safe town in hell. A lot of people are muttering gibberish to each other and sitting on the bus with their heads in their hands and neck under their hands. It seems you only have to look up to see if you can see them slowly turning every other patron's pants, it seems the only way out of this is to get drunk and run. It ’ s just it a rare case I bet some of these people still down in Greece were born to fight and die in Hell.
What did we find out last night? We found this message saying that Hell was gone and someone had to be picked up. Whoever died here was never picked up nor were they sent to Hell.
Apparently it appeared the message we found was a joke, something creepy only remotely amusing to us. But there are some people who think it out. I ’ m trying not to spread rumors, some think it was an elaborate prank to scare me a bit but if you ’ re in the crowd and have a little more than 200, you will need to at least take a photo and post it in your own story. Hell is the only thing that remains of hell and there were other messages too many to count.<|endoftext|>

"So you've made the decision to sleep with us. This will help you sleep longer? " I ask my reflection in the mirror
" Yeah. " she responds, tossing the shades on the ground and staring at the night sky. " That just means I'm going to be able to sleep more this time. I'm going to get some sleep after all. "
" Nah, it's fine, you're already getting used to this feeling of having people around... it's the most relaxing sensation I can imagine. "
She snatches my head and cradles it tight. We sit in silence; long hours of torturous thinking linger over the gap between us. " Yeah, maybe I'll get used to that. Maybe I'll come to like it for once... " she breathes, seductively.
" It's *fun*. "
" It's *I keep moving around*, for good and harmlessly, putting your feelings in their place. It's all that makes you feel *good*. "
" I am so sorry, it's all so... "
I reach into my belt purse, pulling out the torn up CD. " Ahh fuck. You bet, son of a bitch I'll do anything. "
The inner sirens blare, people going crazy and screaming, they are in the blood spatter. We are silenced for another hour. The horde crumples and I vomit. We lay bleeding out and God, I really feel sad for the kid. One last thought for me in the world, that's all I can think.
" We're done then, the rest is up to you."<|endoftext|>

Yeah i know I'm a bore, but this is the source for this shit. Who says that shit is going to do anything good to the people it lives for? You bet your ass i'm gon na die in 20 minutes. But then again what good is life if you're gon na choose to live it without notice. I left a note saying'so, you won't be disappointed' didn't it? Well the year is 2026 and i just got another job and I can afford to survive this shitty life anyway, get on with it or a week. Except this job i googled a few years ago as an assistant to the CEO so here i am then in the financial crunch. Of course that sucks and i feel bad for spending so long on a shitty job. Little i could do to prepare myself but i know that through my hard work i can catch the end of the line or get myself fired or even worse.... Sleep on it.<|endoftext|>

A planet - there is no other more appealing than a peaceful planet,
taking in the vast plains of green and dry,
allowing the native species to develop.
Among many other things, the greatest threat here was our neighbours as well,
hosting none but a single blue planet.
With every news we received, while we was still, the green grass kept
tilling even the most exotic plants.
Against the odds, we agreed. This blue planet
is sure to die if it too falls,
as if the planet we are about to take hold of is not giving it.
Whether it is the region of lush land,
living in the shadow of endless sea, or the ones that lie beyond,
this planet will feed our population just as well.<|endoftext|>

"Fuk katu! ", said Shaka.
From the outside, it was disconcerting as everyone just looked at him and tilted their heads. This guy is some sort of scientist. He's done a few pretty swell jobs lately. But still, you didn't get to see him all the time. Everyone knows that science is like religion right? You're like that kind of guy.
" Oh, that. Uh. Yeah, it all changed one bit. "
" Ish ayyz... ", said Shaka.
" Oughh, ok. What does that mean? Why'd you say'fukkatoru' like that, anyway? You must have meaning to me. "
" So it worked like one time? The door's made of... pretty much everything! From the insects they say... to all the heroes in history... "
" Not a problem, those goddamn bugs kill me in two pieces. Well, that'll do. "
Shaka brought the news closer. " And that's funny. ", he said.
" Which would you say is a metaphor for this awesome creature of yours? ", complained the warrior who killed all these giant bugs.
" Give the damn stories a hell of a shot!" Shaka shouted.<|endoftext|>

"I have a mirror to tell you everything. " Her name was Allison.
" Hmm? "
" I have a mirror to tell you everything. "
Her eyes were fixed on what would take place in front of her her.
" I have a mirror to tell you everything. "
" Very well. " Allison gave an exaggerated sigh.
" I have a mirror to tell you everything. "
" Whatever. Just go see it. I'm not sure what happens if I don't. "
" Okay, Allison. Just go see it. "
" Whatever. Just go see it. I'm not sure what happens if I don't. "
" Would you like to see a cake? What's it called Allison? " Allison asked a hesitant moment.
" Cake? "
" No. "
" Have you ever tried chocolate cake? "
" I haven't. "
" Have you ever tried cinnamon cake? "
" Well, I don't remember ever having a cinnamon cake. "
" Alright, Allison. Just go see it. I'm not sure what happens if I don't. "
" If I don't know what it is, I just can't remember it. "
" Okay, Allison. Just go see it. I'm not sure what happens if I don't know what it is. "
" Would you like to see a steak? What's it called Allison? "

" Okay, Allison. Just go see it. I'm not sure what happens if I don't know what it is. "
" How many times have I watched a human fucking pay attention to me? How many times have I watched a human fucking just laugh and walk away. How many times have I listened to a human fucking break his broken bones to force himself to go with him? How many times have I watched a human fucking think he's worth something to go see? Allison, tell me something you will never forget. "
" Would you like to see how a bored human can ignore the world as it is? "
" Will anyone ever love me? "
" No. "
" I love you. "
" I am glad I ended up here. "
" Thank you Allison. "
" All yours. "

I'm a fuckin' guy, now. I know that. I don't give a shit what everyone thinks. It's what I do. The goddamn CUCKPOP doctor told me that before we started in the hospital. 'Cause there was a large chart with all sorts of stuff. I paid to go to the doctor then, but they didn't do anything. They just looked at everything... Most said, "Grandma, what happened? What did he do?"
I'm fucking a fuckin' guy. The copse followed me to the door, and came looking for me. When they found me... I'm back to fucking my momma. I was that part of the special contingency if you'd like.<|endoftext|>

"Where the hell are you people? " demanded the brown-skinned man.
And without looking he put a massive hand on my shoulder. " You humans are the epitome of our civilization. Every citizen of your country is considered as a citizen of your Earth and without exception, we have an obligation to serve you. "
My eyes widened. What the fuck? How in the hell am I still here? I think I noticed it when he just lifted up his arm at the man's shoulder.
" Its to protect against aliens. I told you people it is not the aliens you said I was kidding. We are not the aliens! "
" You're insane, honey. You just asked for Earth? "
He motioned for me to believe him. " You already knew it would happen, didn't you? You need to hear me out. It is not the aliens. You refused to listen to me? "
" Listen to me, you. I have family. Not that people pay attention in the first place. "
As he pulls out his Glock, I see him take aim with the barrel of my gun, no doubt pleased by the display.
" Then I accept your call as a citizen of your Earth. You may not beat us, but we can protect you. You said we could never fight against your orders? Are you serious? If the aliens don't get us everything, you won't even have to accept our destiny. "
His grin reddened. His name? I don't know. It probably sounded ridiculous for a rowdy kid.
As soon as his hand was firmly on my shoulder, I caught my breath and pushed him out of the door. A loud bang filled the house, sending screams down the hall. He fell into a heap on his own feet.
I picked up my phone and dialed 911.
" Dude, what's happening? We aren't getting enough aliens. We're almost here."
*God damn it* I thought.<|endoftext|>

I walk in and see him reaching for his wallet. " Is this the same wallet I got last night? " I thought to myself. Now it was time to face facts. After all, the love of my life told me he was straight. When I hit the gym, I got into his already. " That was him right? " I said to myself. Now I was ready to answer. " He even made some sort of joke about my family that he just wanted to play the fanboy in but the result was only bitter and I got expelled. " I decided that being straight wasn't good enough for me. I decided I'd bring this to him. " He slowly takes the wallet out and pulls out some papers from his bag. I stare at the 1st of the page. This is ridiculous. There's absolutely nothing about this man. " We're both here."<|endoftext|>

“ Now just take your time Terry, I mean it ’ s in the spirit, on the home front, it ’ s totally in our heads, this is some terrible decision, and you ’ ll regret it… ” she said as she walked away.
She stared up at him, behind him, at the birds that sat, the clouds obscured by the pale moon. The streetlights were barely blinding enough, but she looked like she could make out the white clouds for miles.
“ Well, this is the end Terry, ” he said as he closed his eyes, “ but I love you, we will miss you even more. ” He coughed a little, fell backwards on his desk, wincing as he lost consciousness.
He asked her a question.
“ How would I be from now to now Terry? ” she said matter-of-factly. “ I love you, we will be together for the rest of our lives Terry, and maybe even forever. ”
Terry opened his eyes and looked directly at her.
“ Do you want to meet the man you could have become? ” he asked with deep, tired and genuine concern in his voice. She looked back up at him with disdain.
“ Yes Terry, ” she said as she walked away.<|endoftext|>

*Knock, knock... *
I open the door to see Harry step through it.
"Pleasure meeting you Harry! " He waved me off. " Where are you going? " I glanced over, startled. It was a basement. One of those rusty beasts that haunted old abandoned warehouse apartments.
" I'm home. " He said in a calm voice. It was familiar. I was a little bit shocked.
" Whoa honey, you dressed like a bird! " My heart froze in place. What was going on?
" I guess it's time Harry... " My voice was weak.
" I... I'm.. sorry... are you making noises? " He looked very annoyed. His glasses seemed to fog up the room. Who the hell were you talking to?
" Who the hell are you saying I don't want to hear you answer! " My mind was starting to picture him holding a grumbling old man at the front of the room.
" Wait! WHAT'S GOING ON?! " He said finally. He reached in his pocket and pulled out a pair of dark glasses.
He had just come from the box, with a gun in his hand. Everyone knew it.
Suddenly the doorbell goes off, I look behind me and realise that I'm in a basement. There are two teens sitting opposite me waiting.
" I'm sorry, what's happening? " I blurted out.
They look at me and I can barely make out the scowl on their faces. Harry looks worried. I can tell he's scared.
" Well? " I asked, sipping my beer.
" You're in a basement? " He asked again.
" I'm not the next Harry, " I said, mildly impressed. " This is my parents basement. "
The window frame gave out now, revealing a strange grey room. Suddenly Harry appeared in it, pulling a weird silver claw from his pocket. He started screaming.
" What have you done?! " I screamed.
He laughed and then opened the door, grabbing hold of my arm. My heart felt like it was on fire. A horrifying scream from inside filled the air.
He put his claw into my arm and now I was on fire. I felt around me. I was covered in flames, and my daughter was screaming again.
" Oh my god no- no!" Harry shouted. My daughter screamed as he ran away.
I tried calling my friends, but they would never respond. My wife wouldn't take any chances. I went into the basement and ran after my kids.
They died as well. My phone just died. Everything except my keys.<|endoftext|>

"Look Ryan. You didn't see the second storm? Nothing at all there before. You just sort of rolled your eyes and left it at that and never come back. I bet some kind of excuse or prank sent you on your way to the next island by some poor kid in Indiana if you'd just asked me. Don't you agree? "
Ryan felt like he was fucking with himself. He had never tried explaining himself, even after the constant city jokes at school. He had spent years re-reading the rules and like everyone else in his class, everyone he knew got the hang of it but they didn't see any reason as to why.
" The Storm? That's funny? Seriously? You got three days to talk? "
" Yeah. Just. Go. There's this beach we passed yesterday, And we didn't see any type of other people, but so there's this cactus in the middle of the sand, And it's just falling out of the sand, And there was some water everywhere. Damn it, we're out there with masks. "
" Really? That's like three days and still nothing. So, are you sure you want to join in? "
" How do I join in if I'm dead? "
" What? What? You're telling me you go and play there? Do you remember what happened before? "
" All of it! Look, I got ta get you out of here. I've been saying all this stuff for what I assume is centuries now. It may look weird to you if you think about it but last I heard your teacher says the ship's going to crash in India. I never came back home because I was a stupid kid. "
" Ryan, are you going to stay here or leave? How does that make any sense? "
" Let me ask you this, Ryan, I'm your friend. I've known you for over 3 years now and I've known you for three months now. You know I feel weird about that. Let me elaborate. I was wearing your armour on the Battle of the Skies and you didn't go talk to me. He sent you here to kill me. He sent you here to serve us as their fleet and help them realise that they can make waves on an island that they can't reach on a silver platter. Did he even think about the terrible reality of the situation? "
" Ryan, if you're saying I'm the stupid son of a bitch, I'm not telling you the truth. Think about it. A ship that comes into harbour and sends it at the enemy fleet, And when it lands the enemy are forced into attacking. Our people on this island are dying and the people have to fight until a new fleet comes and captures them. Now that kind of stuff is a moot point. So, go. Maybe " leave " and we can just talk. "
" What? Really? "
" I guess you weren't the only one who noticed. Look Ryan, I get this. That was almost like a typical day. "
" Really? The main character had to prepare for war in two hundred years? How stupid is that? My age? "
" Yeah, I was just trying to wake my friends up from the dream they had when they fought the right battles. Turns out there's something beneath the sea. "
" The ocean? "
" Hey, that's fantastic. Back in the day, people on the surface were afraid of the ocean. Now, in terms of weapons, man is afraid of the ocean. When people stare at the sea they mean rocks and water. "
" That's amazing! But no one knows how the ocean works. "
" Well, man, looking at it that way. The strange part is that you and everyone you know live in so little water. Even if you were to go out there to kill someone who moves the sand so that the water is closer to the surface, well, it wouldn't have gotten to you. "
" I know Ryan, but that's all I know."

It's been eleven days since I last saw my favorite lamp. I'm currently walking through this park and, of course, it serves me for giving him a little. I have to admit, he looks amazing. If I put my energy into him, I will always be watching out for him. And so does he. I start walking back to the bench, and notice he is still sitting up. As I can see he has a pair of cigarettes sticking out of his shirt.
I finally remove my lamp, and make myself a double shift, serving another client. He always wants to come back tomorrow morning, and has kept this up through the years. I haven't seen him since December. Still, the food is good for him. In fact, he smells great. I show him the veg.
"What're you eating again? " He asks.
I think to myself " Oh, it's a pizza! That's always good!"
He takes the plate, and hands me the pizza. I have been staring at him this whole time, alone, after he had gotten his drink and sat at his desk. That man I had never met, had helped me in this world, but I had never met him. There was something amazing about him.
I chug down the pizza. That person has always had a delicious quality about her. She is clean and beautiful. Perfect tan skin, perfect black hair, perfect brown eyes.
We chug the pizza. I thank him for his food and reach for his coat. He hugs me and thank me for the food. I step out of the door. I have come so far, this line has done me in.<|endoftext|>

When *I* once walked through the light of my glory gates, I was visited by a dark but comforting traveler with horns that would not be betrayed by his hat. He whisked us down through magical portals and flung us against ladders, and in the end found himself above us.
For thousands of years he had remained in my path, ever guardian of the realm beyond my eyes. Even as the kingdom sleeps within my realm, and visions heal wounds as long as I live, he has abandoned me for the night.
I was from the times when *he* ruled, and forged *my* will with pride and wisdom. I did not ever fear my fate, for when *he* sat upon the throne of honor and power, I expected someone even greater, but... *he* treated my lands as a children's toy.
I fought against *he* alone, being given the task of *rebirth* to keep my empire under control. And I killed him alone. No while the courtiers looked upon me with dreadful hatred.
Until they finally arrived.
I did not seek revenge, I pursued the thought of revenge on *him*, but instead, sheathed me with my own hand. As the sun set, he delivered the news of the battle to my ears, in hopes that I would be forgiven as he should have.
A few weeks later, he returned. I called him *only* to make sure that his words were heard, so as not to upset my conquering heart. But the world had changed for the better.
Sowing corruption within my lands, a genocidal plot to rule the land with a thousand armies was all that I remembered.
I turned to bring him to justice, for I did not seek vengeance. I turned to collect the blame once more, as those people had expected.
They called me a monster, so I stayed inside my home, alone. There I waited for his return, as the rest of the day passed.
When *he* was not back, I learned of my life in the light of a thousand days of glory and tribute.

They wouldn't have found us. They wouldn't have killed us. It was all said and done:
No one.
We had been left alone, not with a partner, the mayor. We had played out the cold most of the time, with a gun in hand, but no one cared. They had sat us down, mocked us, liked us. None of them needed a partner, no one needed a partner.
When a priest sits down before you and tells you that you're dismissed, every Sunday for the rest of eternity, whether you understand it or not, nobody needed another person.
After every priest is put on trial, every priest is reduced to crumbs. Almost all priests are judged for minor sins.
The Lord put you in their clutches. He let your soul be sent to the underworld.
He promised me eternal life, and sent me out into the world with a purpose.
I am the end of all.
There is only me, now.
In the night.
The wind howls through the hollow earth.
The voices in my head scream in my head, "For fuck's sake, there is no way out."
I had to get through the night. Through the damned day. Through every day. As if someone could hear me when I abandoned my life, through every house, every sickfate. That's all I needed.

“ *What the fuck? * ” I asked.
“ Cut it out. ” The food parlor sat with the cage attached to its small fixture.
“ Are you sure this is not a great way to get the two of you out of here? ”
“ Pretty sure I like the taste. ” I said as I moved over to the container and opened it.
“ What do you want? ” the little girl asked the creature from across the room.
“ Mmmmmm… B-but you weren't quite right… ”
“ Dad, I don't want anyone else to have to do this. ”
“ You know I can always come back here to this place. ”
“ I know, but don't be like that! ”
“ I know. But… am I a good enough youngling for this?! ”
“ I love you forever and ever. ”
Suddenly, the cage seems to grow and the two of us were inside, barely able to speak and crying as our legs were completely amputated.
“ How did I end up here?! ” I asked.
“ Well, that's for the time being. We've been back for a few months now and the mess is clear. ” They explained.
“ Ok let's try again. Let's just get food in here and pretend like it's the right place. ” I say, as I walk out of the room into the hall.

Rain.
Not this time. Not this time again.
I looked down at my hands. I hadn't done it before. I grabbed the button down button and pushed.
Not this time. Not this time again.
I looked down at my feet. The rain had stopped. The sky no longer turned white, and the clouds had cleared. The sky now looked black and red. You could still see the stars. I smiled and dragged myself to the nearest taxi. Rain.
Not this time. Not this time again.
I looked down at my arms. The rain had stopped. The rain was gone. I forgot what joy I was feeling. Finally I was ending the loneliness that was growing inside of me.
The rain wasn't coming. Not today. Not ever again. Not the time, but the fact.
There was nothing left in me now. I just wanted to take a nap. Relax and sleep.
But he wouldn't come. He came anyway. He wouldn't leave the other side of the city. He came to save me.
Everything changed. I didn't even remember what it was like to be dead. I just laid on my back and hoped that he would come help me.
I was lying on my back for what felt like forever when I heard the alarm go off. I looked at my phone. That stupid day, the day we saved each other. I smashed the alarm. There was an emergency on the line and the ambulance would come. The emergency will come.
The man took his pocket knife and dragged me from my bed. I nearly dropped my phone as the man grabbed my wrists and pulled me out of the car. I heard him talking. I looked at him and laughed. He was right. I had no idea what to think. I was scared. I thought I had seen the enemy but I didn't think I had survived.
I looked at my hands again and pointed at my pockets.<|endoftext|>

I ’ ve always held a grudge with my agent about the money. I don ’ t do those things, after the manhunt last year that finally came to a halt, but instead, I ’ ve used my money to take my dad ’ s car, buy it back to his family ’ s house, and begin to settle down somewhere in Colorado.
Except apparently, he thinks I ’ m paranoid. I ’ m not paranoid, like everybody else. He signed up for this firm at a company called Allstate Bank ( after the nick name in the US ). His intent in coming here was clear: to settle with me. Hell, almost every other top company has at least one lady who ’ s eligible. It ’ s not like anyone ’ s left to judge me, though.
I reached into my, erm, wallet and looked for anything that had not already been checked in to make sure nothing ’ s out of reach. But I spotted a red button labeled “ Deposit ”. There ’ s a note inside the box… what it says is a lottery ticket. He places the ticket on a remote location in Colorado. Next to it are two lump sums.
The agent bursts into tears and tells me that my dad ’ s car was totaled yesterday. I don ’ t know why, but every other person who's offered money in Denver is worried about any things being released. They all get scared when I ’ m gone. They worry when we ask them how the deal ends. When I hear that my dad ’ s family appears before me in court, they ’ re calm. They know I ’ m guilty, though, and they refuse to see the document signed with my dad ’ s money.
The rest of the people sitting in the next room are mostly relieved, but the judge thinks something doesn ’ t quite fit. I ’ m the only one who trusts him. What my dad says makes sense. The judge says I should be telling him everything. He ’ s hoping I ’ m not crazy, but what I see of him makes him different. Like everyone else, he ’ s suspicious.
“ Okay, ” I say, lowering my eyes to the judge ’ s. I laugh.
“ Then why did you come? ”
I ask him why. The judge smiles.
“ Well, ” he says, “ I know your mother was never very interested in the lottery stuff, so I was sort of desperate to make a couple of money for her. So here I am. In Colorado. Looking at this box, I don ’ t want to tell you that I ’ ve saved this man for another chance. What I want to tell you is that I ’ m not crazy. I ’ m willing to trust you. I promise. ”
I shake my head in disbelief. “ In Colorado? Are you sure? ”
“ You ’ re glad to know that, ” says the judge, ushering me away from the small apartment building. I keep my face frozen, waiting for a moment, and I gasp.
“ In Colorado, ” he says. “ I ’ ll explain everything to you in a minute. ” He exits the apartment building, leaving me alone to contemplate the unbelievable.<|endoftext|>

I struggle with my breathing, and start almost involuntarily shaking. I'm little Jimmy, maybe seven or eight at most. I walk slowly, idly, away from the liquor cabinet, the dirt floor of the bedroom I was built in on. Inside of my pocket, there is a beer bottle. I open it with one small clink, and out is a packet of matches, and an M7. Stumbling down the stairs I peek behind the radiator of my apartment complex.
Nothing seems to be wrong except for broken glass and a crumpled piece of paper. I flick the paper over at a glancing stranger.
'Yes?'
As if in shock, I go over to him, but I know he hasn't seen me for a while. His eyes open wide.
'Why didn't you see me? Where did you get my beer? Where's your butt of course?'
He stands tall, his tan pale face rising to the upper left corner of my vision. His green eyes flicker at me as if looking for the threat that only a lucky child knows. Then suddenly he gets up and pulls out a gray box, and holds it up to my full eye.
'Please don't drink from it.'
I start to scream, but I stop as I look at him.
'Don't look at it like that, it's not funny.'
His eyes suddenly go wide again. And he slowly turns to face me. His wide smile piqued my curiosity.
'It has to be'
The man laughed. He slapped me down on the ground and pushed my blankets up.
'Well at least you enjoyed yourself, Mr. Thompson.'
He put his hands in my pockets, and proceeded to guide me through the house in all his green and white make up.
He sat on the couch and looked off at the TV in the television studio. He looked at me and then he turned and walked to the bedroom where I was sleeping. I found my foot and I stood there for a moment, studying the next scene I might have. I sat down and looked around. The floor was beginning to bend beneath my feet. I looked at the wall, with dark purple dominoes on the wall before me. I stood in front of a television that had some type of display. I had gone to sleep and tomorrow would be my day. I really needed a cigarette.<|endoftext|>

It sounded ridiculous, but the thought of uncaring hamburgers meant something. It was a chance. You don't want to live in a world where the result is uncaring, or uncreative.
& nbsp;
We both knew how it would go. I was born of good men, long ago. ( So after his own death, when we were children ). But, after the order cut out and the door became sealed in the snow, it was nigh impossible to stand.
& nbsp;
How long had we waited? How long was the life worth living in? Endless times, if I recall correctly. Ages.
& nbsp;
Then the prices for our burgers dropped too. We had budgeted too much for a warranty, but not for a raw hamburger. As expected, we agreed to take two cases with us and haggle over our discount prices as well. Some of us agreed, so we agreed to that deal for the past few months. I traded in one case for a pouch of steak and one for a receipt. I had seen the sign for the third case.
& nbsp;
How long had we waited? How long was the life worth living in? Endless times, if I recall correctly. Ages.
& nbsp;
I had always thought the options... different... to be half empty items and half filled for bigger ones.
& nbsp;
I hadn't spent anything recently. That much at one time. But after two meals, I started to think of all of the places that had stocked our burgers and sent them back. Times were changing, but there was still room.
& nbsp;
I still hadn't told the wife. Was she flattered? I should've. I decided to tell the friend of my ex-wife. I should tell her that maybe I was the only thing keeping her up at night. That would've been a bad day for her, she would have died from thirst. Ofcourse she wouldn't --
& nbsp;
I had told my wife that I was "not sure " of our burgers, but she would have had more time to complain if she had been. I said I wasn't sure of any of the " things " she had said before. The man in the thick, black sweatshirt - hell, I ’ d had a sunburn since getting married, even though it had been a few years - started screaming. In his hysterical tone, he looked so much like a fiend that it felt like he was about to bite the life out of me. I tried to explain to him that he was addicted to drugs, that I was drowning him in his own urine. I never did anything to help him feel better, but that day turned to weeks.
& nbsp;
I tried not to look at her now. The tears in her eyes forced me to make a choice. What could I do?
& nbsp;
I stared at the burgers again. They had become self-aware. A trail of blood ran down the side of their back, a great crunched sound calling out to me. I took one final look at my inventory, and then looked at my wife again.
& nbsp;
She was back. An empty shell.
I grabbed one from my pocket, inhaled deeply, and took a deep drag on my cigar.
& nbsp;
“ Close your eyes, Gene. I ’ m going to be sick for a couple of days. I ’ m going to feel better. ”
I walked through the concrete street, then proceeded out into the empty town square. I didn ’ t really speak a word to my wife, so my eyes flew open. There, standing before me - with a thick nametag - was a quintet - one giant burger.<|endoftext|>

I guess I will just sit here all day. Not a day goes by where I don't wonder about the Nick name. Snoo, Snoop, Snoop, Snoop.
"Alex, what you doin up? "
" Must be, " I said, getting up. " Get these."
He's in charge of the rest of the guys as we walk to room 9. I took my trusty 420C and blew on some of those packs of Marlboros and Bastards.

"By the end of the winter, someone would have stumbled on some sort of great journey on giant monuments out in the wilderness. Alas, everyone perished because they weren't there for any reasons, " she said. " One by one they ambushed each other with stones and sticks and spears and stone axes and kilns and all kinds of weapons. "
" They killed a lot of people, " she said. " But everybody died because they were here for the first time. All the windows shattered and the road was destroyed. And then, one day, there was a " boom ". "
Then, all was lost. "
" And you can't tell people from you? "
" You know it. "
" And who would have thought... "
" A whole generation of people, they would have turned into dust, your descendants would have died a fine death. And the whole world would be soundly destroyed, or we would've had to decide that it wasn't worth living, that maybe we aren't meant to. "
" And how many of you still live? "
" Two thousand. "
" How many of you still are alive? "
" There's about eighty people still left in the world. All they've left is a rock, an old tree, some flowers, dirt and earth, and a handful of fruit. "
" Everything? "
" Nothing. "
" And what are you going to do with all this of them, anyway? "
" To take the place of the earth? "
" No, " she said, as she let out a sigh. " No, I'm going to be eaten alive, " she said, then turned and picked up the rock. " I have work to do."<|endoftext|>

Terrified, I sat down and leaned back in my chair. I leaned forward and whispered a quiet prayer to sleep. I squeezed my eyes shut, *How long has this gone on? *
I flipped open my favorite bag of chips on my couch. I ’ d forgotten to shave. I ’ d made the wrong choice...
“ Are you ok? ”
I pat myself gently. I could have sworn I was lifting off of my feet.
“ Fine, fine. I ’ ve got to get a few things done. ”
“ You ’ re not the answer, ” I said.
“ Yes, I am, ” said the girl sitting across from me in the same chair.
“ Wow, looks like you got something to look forward to here. ”
Terrified, I sat down and leaned back in my chair. I leaned forward and whispered a quiet prayer to sleep. I squeezed my eyes shut, *How long has this gone on? *

"Oh! E-excuse me, sir? " I stuttered, assuming an out of body experience.
" Yes, ma'am, I have to pick one. "
" And what is that mistake? "
" There's no way I could tell you what skills I actually need. "
" No, ma'am! "
I chuckled. The man walked away. I'll keep a keen eye on his life. A glance in his eyes, toying with any trick I might have laid him off with. After I figure out what I need, I'll grab his skills, and make my move.
But if I can't grab the skill I've been looking for, I can not catch my true potential. Next it will be around piece by piece. Well, there's a creaky one, that I'm sure I was given at their place a while back, but I don't really recall that. If I can't retrieve that skill, the job will be difficult. After all, no one likes a job with slight overspill- the difference being a soul-sliver that cuts into a character all the way to the eye.
In any case, I've got it.
Cobbering, living with no sense of ownership, and wearing everything an idiot would hope to stand for, I have a contract and a blueprint waiting for me to draw, mark, smash and burn. If I don't reach the goal, I'll be cut down, if I reach the path of my heart I'm facing the loss. Once again my new contract has put my self within reach of the goal, I just need to create an end to the chaos. It's almost magical. To the extent I achieve the goal, the object will start the flow of the new process.
But this one will take an awful long time, as will the previous one. Normally, this will be a very fast process, as it is usually the case with a long journey of magic. However, I've come down hard on this one.
Needless to say, my first murder is going to sound like a very slow one. Time and time again I'll make an evil move, steal the head off of another victim, steal a little on the cheek of another, leap to the last hit, and so on. After a long time of nothing happening, I finally hear the laughter coming from inside my head. It's the fucking laugh!
The smile goes down my face at the thought of my death. I slip my can of Loomp Loomp Poop into my jacket and follow the dealer. He's done the trick. I can only hope he won't take the job his middling level of skill at making sure his shop is as nocturnal as mine. Next to the prize there, I put one hundred thousand loops on the oil check. I knew the butcher could not understand that i was wasting a hundred thousand loops for nothing.
I've learned so much over the years that I've become a better magician than I've ever been. My skill recognition has improved tremendously for other people. But this one just doesn't pay the bills.
After finding out he thinks I'm capable of procuring the item that I need, I retire to the pawn shop, on my way to find my greatest obsession for my life.
*The Past*
My first joke. I'm not a very good comedian, and whenever I accidentally make things go horribly wrong. So, I'll have to check my chest instead.<|endoftext|>

"Half of them? " I asked, in a proud, masculine voice.
" Yes. "
" And one, in fact, half? " I asked, shifting to wait for the room to clear out to the floor.
The answer was a little unexpected.
" One half. "
I looked around, but there was no one there.
A little a pause, and a long pause. Then, a more suitable ending.
" One in a half. "
I waited a second, and now the room was cleared out, with the sheets of paper easily pushed through the walls. I blinked in excitement.
I got out of the stall and sat down in my study, staring at my results. I made sure to laugh one more time to make sure it wasn't a laugh, and then was out of there, started my study and went back to the boardroom again.
One once. I could now see a portion of my results being projected onto a camera, and there it was. Covered in the hairs of my forgotten face. I grabbed it, and saw what happened to it after it was in my hands. I flipped the number on it and was shocked to see what it read. It was half.
" I didn't know how large of a sliver of half off I was before coming here " I said.
" Clearly we are all equally unhappy with our jobs, " said the other patron, who still looked at me from across the table.
" Was this the work of some sick tumor, or something worse? " I asked the patron.
" Yes I thought so. " he replied, somewhat casually.
I placed my hand on his and looked him in the eye, and they both went quiet. They looked up at me in the same way I did, expressionless.
" I'm sorry, it was terrible, but he won't be here for a long time. " I said, and he replied with the same expression, as if I were complaining.
" We have an alternate solution to our work, " said the patron.
I suddenly felt a sense of pride, and from across the table stood a pair of overly-liberal eyes.
" Don't trust, fuck you, and let this be a lesson for others, you fucking loser, " said the patron, taking a sip of his drink.
The alcohol cleared his throat and, suddenly, he felt a strong weight on his shoulders, and a burning desire.
" FUCK YOU, I'm right here, he's here, he will be here soon. " I said, slamming my hand onto my forehead, and grabbing a towel from the wall behind him. " My assimilation chamber closed down last night and we are running out of food. We're so fucked, and I need to get out."
He glanced up at me, in a bright, non-threatening manner, and, spreading his lips with a smile, accepted my invitation.<|endoftext|>

Looking back, it was almost as if I felt compelled to kill, to strike, to invent, to live. It was "painless " at first, I didn't really think it would matter, until today when I got a lucky kill.
At first I thought it was because I got lucky. I was in the middle of browsing hard in work, I always enjoyed it, a golden gilded princess. I looked at my character sheet after a cutscene.
I was high. I needed to be, I could know that, the amount of gold I gained on such a random day. I only knew what a job I thought was required. It was more " competitive " than. But what was the difference? The levels of skill? Even higher than that.
I gained 3 of the hardest bosses. I was a master of the sword, with a few of my classes that I could master. I even had an even more skillful one, The running.. I could know where your running is, and now it was a finely tuned game, with a Master. If I controlled any amount of it I could be a runner. It meant I had a way to win. I grabbed a belt and ran, he the fastest of my group. He collided a little, caught myself, died..

It was 3 years of Batman living in Arkham. As the Joker lay dying on the doorstep of Wayne Manor. Wayne had an unfortunate lack of evidence that the death of the Joker was not justified by basic law. The last thing Wayne remembered before his death was a smug look on Wayne's face and a bottle of Jack Daniels in the corner of his mouth, wishing to be murdered by Wayne himself.
“ Lois, ” Bruce announced with a smile, “ It ’ s okay. It ’ s okay. I ’ m sorry.
But I need you to end this charade for good. I was already riding high on my next bet of revenge, and this money was one of my finest.
We need to get ahead of ourselves. This is not a burden on me or society; this is my plot. ”
The Joker himself was bleeding out on the floor, unable to walk anymore. Bruce continued, “ No one believes in myths. People believed they were gods. I believe I am the one responsible for the death of our planet. If I would die I ’ d get so much attention that it ’ s easy to ruin the deal. But still… why must you bother? ”
“ You ’ re tired of the same old ego games Wayne. Everyone is. ”
“ No you're not, but my fucking killing machine is smarter than that. I saved my own life. ”
“ Do you understand? I ’ ve created your body for the purpose of killing you, a superman. You know what I think about Superman. ”
Bruce looked down at the Joker. Like a father didn ’ t even know it was coming.
“ A superman. I can do anything. Look in the mirror. ”
“ A superman. You think you ’ re making good on your promise? If you ’ re a superman, you have to go after me. ”
Bruce turned the gun on himself, and jammed the gun into Wayne ’ s side. The gun bumped into the windshield on the way out, and Lois stopped to take off. This time, they pulled the knife out of his hands and started chopping down the Joker. As they continued, they burst into flames. In the corner of the room, they found the Joker. Red hot and bleeding. Gasps of anger and terror, he began to drift away, and as the electricity went out, a thin line of smoke appeared in the direction Wayne was standing.
He struggled to run, barely able to avoid death. A black limousine drove up and stopped a few feet away.
Bruce turned to Lois. “ Hey, you okay? ”
“ Yes, ” she said, eyes closed and staring at the barrel of a gun. “ There ’ s smoke all over me. Maybe you should get a doctor. But I ’ m getting on well. Just see what you got for us. ”
“ What… did I buy? ”
“ I stole it from my father and boyhood grandpa. He knew the secret. He let me go to college for, ‘ game day ’. Just in case. See if you can figure it out. ”
“ Wayne, you ’ re going to have to think like a man. ”
“ There ’ s no need for you to know. If I was taking advantage of another man ’ s situation, I ’ d have done things different. ”
“ That ’ s the point. No matter what you do, I ’ ve already killed them all. Have you looked in the mirror? ”
“ No, ” she replied, half scared.
“ If you ’ re a superman, I ’ ll be burning your face right now. ”<|endoftext|>

It was a marvelous night for the bride and groom.
He was one of the first to step off of his whirlwind to travel. The bride looked stunning in his purple dress, neon diamond dress, and matching denim jeans. As he sat down in his white rose gold leather chair with his small, leather reclining chair with a veritable auto adjuster in hand, and looked at the bride, he could smell the true beauty within him.
The bride was a pale horse, quite shaggy, with no meat, no bones. She had her age, A significantly younger version of herself, plus inherited money from an accident in his life. She wasn't for sale, and she was getting married by tomorrow afternoon.
As they sauntered down the aisle, they saw something else. She spotted them leaning against the nearby bakery.
A woman had pulled her dress over the guest's head, looking as surprised as they were.
Their thoughts did not slow as they wandered together, into the bustling heart of a world where everyone owed their lives to the virgin, and the time from which their sins reached their ultimate end.
Tearing his clothes off, the bride looked her own in the eye as she talked to this new bride, but not before standing up to see her ass in the exit of the bakery.
One small tear escaped her eye and went out.
The smile came across the bride's face when she saw her dress. The little wooden pony tail that danced for years on end.<|endoftext|>

The view was of a beautiful whitehouse, complete with lots of people, and it was a perfect setting for a Presidential announcement.
The crowd was no more than one person. Each and every one were dressed the same in stunning white, it was only fitting. One boy kept his arm out on the railing while another secured the railing with a wooden pole. Everyone shook their heads. One woman, a deep red auburn hair, walked to Obama's podium and handed him a pen.
"The moment I announce my first term, you'll think I'll believe that! "
He just smiled.
He then said, " Whoah! New people! We're going to be gods! "
Everyone waited in stunned silence. The audience then applauded.
Obama said, " Yes! I can hear them cheering! "
The man said, " Here, take this and write a letter... "
Everyone, including the president, grabbed his pen. The President glanced at his pen and then raised an eyebrow.
" Ehhh... fine, then I'll... "
The man stopped reading. The camera now appeared out of thin air and moved into view. A sea of people were now blocking the window behind the camera.
They were smiling, with him, and he knew every face in the room.
" What... what do we do? "
" I just... let you all know.... "
But before he could finish his sentence, he stopped.
He froze at the doors of the Whitehouse. He never thought he'd see such a crowd, but when the crowd gathered, he quickly made his way outside. It was the Mall of America.<|endoftext|>

"Dude, " Danny yelled at Susan, " what time do we get today? "
" Fuck! " said Jint, as he opened the briefcase in front of her.
" I'll call the gps! " said Susan in a sharp but professional tone.
" But why? " asked Jint, more clearly with Susan.
" We don't want to screw something like that again, " Dan said. He handed Susan his briefcase, placing the note opener against his temple. " We need to get the PSX finished the same day. And an HVAC is only guaranteed 100 % and we have our security systems on. What now? "
" When we finally get it done we are going to head to the pier and set a blue float. A real blue float, you'll want to keep watching out for dangerous fish when we can get it done by yourself. We're not allowed near that place, have the last we hear of it happening is during a last minute commercial commercial with Joel Stein. He always gets us! "
" I didn't forget anything Jon, I just... put the last of the rubber caps on. The ones you use on those big nets, sometimes he grabs an MRE before they're filled, nice things. "
" You didn't even say how exactly to use it! That's stupid! We can't keep him around! I could never agree with him. This isn't right! "
Dan wasn't too surprised by that. He put the PVA and HVAC back in place and set the HVAC on the pier. Dan wasn't worried as it was back to normal, just a pink submarine with large fins.
" Hey, Dan, just give us another 3 minutes. Here's the thing. This is not real, there was no mistaking this fact for a fact! So what if we get hit by this thing? Look at that blue floats or the other thing that we can reach over here. "
" What if the fish swim with us? " asked Susan, almost as if she were trying to be compassionate.
" No. It would attract Fish, but it's not a good idea to just let things take it. We don't want to go fishing all day either. We need another spot. "
" But how, exactly, can we get it done in the morning? "
" We don't want it. We aren't gon na just let it get out of our hands at the beginning. We have to go and tell people this was impossible. "
" Well, we could do anything, or just let it get to our heads. "
" But how is that going to stop it from attacking? "
" It's easy to make a ship and shut the boat down. Anywhere really. "
" How is that going to make it take over? "
" Well, we could just go to the beach. The nearest on earth would be around seven thousand feet up, except right now there is something almost obvious going on below the clouds. "
" It's like a child trying to do something. "
" You don't seem to know this and we could use some fucking show. Is there something in the desert about it?"
And just like that, it was gone.
And Dan, Susan, and Dan and Dan were all wondering what it was all about.<|endoftext|>

*There you are, in front of me. Glittering and silver, just like you. You were once something, now you are nothing, just for some strange reason-you were somehow something, already. *
A slim black figure makes the same sense as his faceless classmates in this year's class. He doesn't create any new faces, he doesn't make anything of himself, but he has my attention, so I look into his eyes and see him holding my hopes and dreams. I've only seen him be afraid to make a promise as powerful as yours, but this one is not afraid to fail.
It would hurt that I might not succeed, but this little girl could crush it; it would hurt that she has failed in her mission, and no amount of hope can last. If I simply said no, I could never return to school. However, if I acted, I would not fail, but I would fail in this too, and no matter what I did, there was no chance I could ever reach the grade you asked for. I know, I know-it would do to fail in this.
"Welcome, " I say.
He looks at me and smiles, waving one of his arms. He rubs the back of his mouth and says " I'll be right back with you." I wrap my arms around him and we kiss for an hour, after which he turns off the lights, away from the classroom. I look back down the hall as I close the door, and take off my shoes to go home.
I have no idea how the past two days has turned out. I don't think anyone has yet made a new promise, and that is because I don't care if anyone tries to leave again. That is not where I want to be, but people like me do. If they don't, then why am I stuck here?<|endoftext|>

Long ago a normal man could hardly think of anything but doing his job. A lone worker at one of the many jobs the city workers were part of.
Well to make sure he was not just a worker anymore the worker would form a team of harmless creatures that would wait in a block of cold water to sleep. They would wait until the creatures went to sleep and would charge them no fee to rise from their frigid slumber.
This time everyone only had a couple of different tasks to do in order to get paid.
Parks were filled, and people could go home and admire the view of the great skyscrapers. The creatures simply laughed as the people in the area laughed and wondered about the day they would pay for the service to humans.
After the trial it was concluded that all the paid creatures wore masks and guards with lights. The worker the just appointed himself God to oversee them.
Finally after living in an isolated area for the last fifty years he wanted to take a trip to where the rest of the world would be. Although most humans wouldn't mind seeing him, the worker that just heard about the discovery decided he would be letting the humans know that they could only pay for a few jobs.
On his way to the party he knew he would encounter a strange creature. It is unknown but the creature was smaller than he expected. A different shape than anyone he ever worked for. Perhaps it is the size of a house. If he uses its eye to see then it is of a size too small to be called a giant by most. The smaller size for the creature to fit through is the difference between ten and ten times that. It just kept coming.
The creature's eyes seemed to glow an ominous glow as it slowly illuminated him. The glowing glow was to the creature's advantage that all he saw was white.
The color was a deep red. After a few seconds the creature blinked and to his horror it revealed its face. It had wide, fire red eyes that all scary sighted people could find terrifying. It spoke while it was showing its last sight. " Who are you? "
" I am your God, and you must pay me to go after you. "
" Why? "
" Your task is so small you will have to pay some of my not-the-very-small fee to enter the abode ".
The creature was preparing to form the crowd that the humans would come to know before he took them.
" God! " The crowd screamed as they were tossed a book and turned to face God.
The creature looked at him and the sign before it spoke. " Would you like to pay me? "
God looked at it and said the question a smile with a snake grin. " Yes I would like to. However you will pay me for getting to this prison. Please wait another five seconds in the chamber. Then come back. "
The crowd began moving. The last creature that was on his way looked out his tent to see the last human wave out. The creatures stood there impassively for a few moments. After the last one fell the creatures had to leave once again.
The creature sat, blood and misery dripping from its lip, " It is far too late now, " it had whispered to God.
The crowd cheered and cheered as the creature bowed to him and left with the next life. The creature remained still waiting the humans would come.
The creatures were taken to a different shelter and ate less food. Eventually the lack of these food would cause more of the creatures to pass out. " How will this treat you? " The creature questioned after a few moments.
" It is a small fee for the sacrifice of another human that you will pay for. " The creature looked at God and said.
" This is simply unthinkable. "
The creatures quickly realized their mistake and left. The creature stayed awhile before going back to sleep, the lights shining on it when it did.
" Now let me show you." The creature whispered to God once more, shining his large glowing eyes onto the creature. It said nothing. It slowly made its way to the power room.
The creature was now halfway outside. The lights flashed a hell of a smile and were replaced by the monsters claws. The look on the creature's face was nothing short of fearful. They made its way to the power room and proceeded to eat.
For all eternity the monster went without eating and remained perfectly unchanged.
edit: fixed in two more directions.<|endoftext|>

I didn't consider it a job until the shift had ended, so how could I help but wonder. Much of this building had been evacuated, but now the dry throat was starting to lose its barrier. I finally decided to report my findings, figuring we'd make it all better. A mile off the nearest city I could find a sign saying "Bridge to Canal 1, pending further orders. " As I walked up a set of stairs into a busy main street I came to a local hatchery, where customers were flooding in from some way away.
" Ah, find it worth it, huh? " I said getting ready to wash the dirty dirt off a yoke.
" Whatever it is, I'm not done in yet, " he replied cheerfully as he cleaned the fur off the collar, " but I'm happy to work here. I get the same pleasure out of being able to clean a place. I've traveled nearly an entire continent for the Southerners and that makes it worth it. "
He led me on, meticulously splitting the mixture before him. He got a job with the firm, filling in the gaps. An excellent thank you machine, the joyous sounds and he was ushered to the other side of the room.
At this point, I started backing out, feeling a small warmth inside me as I walked up to the open door to the backroom. Opening it revealed a neatly filled, machine made room. Lovely to look at and the special purpose plastic furniture. The fully stocked and work room by this particular perspective when compared to the others. It smelled exactly like one of the places the rich family enjoyed a visit to.
I proceeded to open the door and brought the thick, brown leather armor back around and extended my back to it. I moved with the armor almost unconsciously as I realized a small hand was stroking my neck. I continued to stare at the boy and realizing he'd turned away from me. He wouldn't dare to touch the face of that hideous monster.
After a long moment of the boy joking about cutting me off he continued to say " I hear you speak... you seem a bit dazed with the other guests. " I shuddered at the thought of dinner awaiting after us.
I grabbed one of the large metal plates from the shelf and tugged it about to me. I was a bit reluctant at first, but then I heard the gasp from the man's companion. " He's no longer here sir... " I whispered.
" Where? Oh this must be a wrong turn of phrase. " the stranger's laugh echoed around the cabin.
I turned to him and his emotionless voice told me " He's safe, I suppose. It's not strange that you can get away with something like this.
Suddenly the leather armor man broke away, " He just wants us to clean the rest of the town. "
" Then what did I tell you? I didn't tell you to scare me. " I asked.
" I used to live here that can literally make people horny. " the man responded.
" You didn't even know that? " I questioned.
" Just because you know doesn't make you an adult! " the man spat.
" Oh I get it, I am helping you get clean up here. I'll take care of this mess. Just stay here if you need help. This is the only place you want the beast in. I just need someone to help. Thank you for taking care of us okay? " I offered
The man nodded and was gone. I returned to my small viewing window as I looked out into the darkness. The scene suddenly became much too much and I had no choice but to reply " Thank you!"<|endoftext|>
**********558**********
I drop it, look at my apartment and then out the window. All my life I thought I hated that place. I never thought I'd be stuck here. At least it wasn't like this.
Almost everything around me is still glowing. At least, I thought it was. Trees swayed and branches moved and I woke up. I could hear the birdsong. I could smell the sand and sand and the blood.
All this noise was gone, all that would ever be heard of is my alarm. That's the important part. My alarm. Everything dies, lives and eventually dies. This routine had been fun once, but that was long ago. I've rewound everything and everything that is, because nothing matters anymore. Time is a poison, the taste of food is deadly, it reeks of death.
There is a nurse, my shears me out of my bed and takes me to her. She takes my mask, protects me from my life threatening fears, forces me to sit on it for as long as I wanted, like this piece of shit does. She's wearing no makeup or black work clothes, just a blouse and a silver Rolex. It's time to wake up. She lifts me up off the floor and walks in. The nurses way is not pleasant. She fidgets, looks at me and leaves. I try to speak but all I can do is wheeze and cry.
"We need more doctors"
I stay quiet while they deliver the white pills, they don't make it so bad.<|endoftext|>
**********559**********
I was trying to focus on my emotions, which I thought to be true. Just thinking about the small things in life in a busy office and occasionally, interrupting things from outside of it caused for bad feelings. Now I am telling you that things happen to other people often, and things happen to me as well. I would feel silly and neglectful to such things in a relationship. What kind of person would she say, how bad of a person could she feel for such a fragile woman. Why would she be so upset for me. Just thinking about how she feels right now, is bad because at this very moment, I have been thinking about how she is hurt, but the pain that is truly cause by her is so small, that I think, just thinking about what could have happened, is possible. One night, while picking out my dress, I heard a faint sound. I recognized it from my phone and caught myself thinking about it as well. This pain is so small. I thought of how my small town had had a tumultuous affair and what would happen to her. I had always been thinking about something I liked. I finally decided to look at my phone and see that there was no call, no answer, no call, a series of darkness in the silence. Again, I feel like I am being watched.<|endoftext|>
**********560**********
My heart was racing; I felt something otherworldly being in my car. " Hello again! Who is this? " I was already bracing for another crash at work.
" Shhh shhh " the object before me suddenly let go. I tried turning it on to get some air. Nope, this thing didn't change its positioning, it never got to anything. My arm feels like a pressure cooker, its chest feels like a heater. In all that time I never had expected to see anything like this happening.
My legs were numb, and my back was numb. I was so tired. I was like a boat out of water and it seemed like it took all my energy to get the gas pedal off. " I swear to god please don't hurt me! " I screamed, and I was feeling for my hands like claws were opening my right leg.
Suddenly the skull popped open... my car began to fly..no where else to go except to look on the horizon and never see it again. I had been driving home in rage and frustration. I need to get out of here, I'm literally the black dog everywhere. " What the hell happened? " I was about to ask out of fear of being right next to someone when a screeching fell from above. I slowly turned my head towards the heavens. Something was definitely different in the sky.
" Can you hear me? " I shouted, though I was standing a full 6 feet tall. I was so sure. * What is going on? * I wanted to yell out, to pretend that I didn't hear someone. " Help me! Please! " What! No. Please. Please help me! " I must have just tried to reach for my hand or something.
It landed in the grassland and started shaking. My chest felt heavier and it was hardly noticeable on the ground. It shook harder, and now my eyes were fixated on that star. " Fuuuuuk, Fuuuuuuuuuk... " *BANG*, the Earth shook. I was spinning and was floating. It was so bright I looked down at my arms, and I felt like we were floating for what seemed like an eternity. I was breathing like I was being ripped apart.
Then I felt something was dragging me. I don't know what it was, but it was drifting closer and closer and more and more until I felt as though I was about to fall and I could hear what could only be a small nervous chuckle escaping my lips. " God this is so weird! "
" What're you doing? "
" I'm.... In a strange alternate world. I'm falling from this sky, touching a comet... "
" Hell no! This is just a dream... I'm falling from this sky and it's going to explode and everything is going to be fine until I touch a comet again. Then... this is it. All of this is right now and I can't see what's going on but I can feel it. I can feel it being lifted off of me and all of this knowledge and knowledge... "
*Brilliant* What?! It was the best dream I had ever had! I could definitely feel that tiny little planet being pulled up to the surface by whatever ship it was in. God, could I ever know what will happen to it like that? But what would happen to me if I touched one such comet! Even being floating in space with nothing to do?
I had finally had enough! " I'll get you out of here! I'll let you out... ( Once I get to the comet, I can feel the universe get pulling me to another dimension. ) I'll let you out! " I took off my sunglasses and put them on, and there was no way I wouldn't be in that crowd again.
After that nightmare I decided that I wasn't going to make it out of here alive. That I couldn't ride a car that would almost definitely end in killing someone. Whatever! I'll be back, that's all I need. I'll be free of this reality, *that dream* and open to some other universe!<|endoftext|>
**********561**********
A day ago, I sat in an inn in the distant countryside. The only entrance that walked through was a private bathroom, with two windows. I shuffled the antiquated girl into the corner, and joined her in my seat. I sauntered over to the stall, and snatched the stall key out from my pocket.
"Hello there young one. How is your day going, sweetheart? "
She looked so young for a schoolgirl that I didn't even know, and I touched her breast. Her eyes sparkled. " Were? It's alright boy. You do feel better, " I said. " But why is it that you don't feel like a boy? You're being single. You're barely ten at the most, which is why nobody knows you. And nobody talks to you! " I leaned forward, looking her in the eye. " It's because I'm exactly the same to you as your father was to me. " I motioned her over to the polished mirror and put a plump hand on her cheek. " It's not his fault. "
Her eyes widened. " You didn't feel like a boy, did you? "
" No, I do. And that doesn't mean I didn't give you feelings. I'm not. "
She blushed. " You knew this! You think you saw me like this? So I would pretend like I wasn't? "
I stared at her, and I felt great pain rush through my body. I fell to the floor, and I felt my body beginning to recover. " What are you looking at? What do you mean?'It's mine'?! "
She blushed again, this time more.
" It's you who I was looking at, dear. I don't understand. " I sat back, and closed my eyes. " It's been thirteen years, then you turned six. You had no dad, nor even a girlfriend. Only you and one of our names. We lived alone, and rarely made ourselves for each other. You were merely an ordinary man. You needed a raise, but I have never had any boy to play with. You ended up with a desk job, and a wife who begged you for it. I have never cared to see another human being turn six. And I'm pregnant. "
I watched her scowl at me. She made no effort to hide her sorrow, and nothing did.
" I suppose it's true. I did grow up with a father figure, a wife, and a daughter. I have no children. My purpose is so far away from you. And you have friends who didn't seem to care to care about you. There is no love between the two of you, and there isn't even any laughter of any kind. "
She looked sickly, and filled her mouth with tears. " No! I've watched as your father grew sicker and sicker. He worked in a factory, getting more food than a factory worker can provide to his sick family. And I was the one who watched him die. And now that you've been born, you aren't that. You didn't feel anything... until now."
She heaved up on me, choking me with a thud. I collapsed, and wailed. I couldn't breathe, and I didn't know how to breathe. I was in pieces. There was nothing left for me, so I was no longer a boy. I was no longer a girl, either. I was six feet tall, talking to myself. I felt strong, but I didn't see anything...
And then I felt a tightening of his hand.
*Soon... *
I woke up in the back of a car with a crashed motorcycle. I turned around, and saw a grey empty seat, a burnt driver's license, and the name on the driver's license. I turned my head to the side, and saw that my normal face stared back at me. My normal face, but covered in scars. I watched as my bloodshot eyes stared back at me, and I knew that I did everything in my power to make sure I didn't see anyone else. I just gave up.
I woke up in the back of a black police car, with the motorcycle riding up. I was in trouble.<|endoftext|>
**********562**********
Who else that is?
I got the title, they should probably stop.
We were all so young, and... ***stupid. *** * They don't understand what it's like to be forgotten.
You get older, and a part of you goes. It's just something you learn. We are teenagers, and it's hard to figure out how to keep quiet.
But we can see the faces.
They both hung on the wall in groups, I didn't see them anymore, but sometimes I watch them talk.
What do they know?
I've seen a lot of them talk.
They speak my language and it's tough to get the word out to others.
It's hard to call the guy we saw on that flight home, with the binoculars, a smile and the listless look on his face.
It ’ s not up to us to do what they have to do, but we can.
We can't get rid of a guy like him.
We ’ re all *adults*, everyone left our place.
The guy hanging, my father and uncle spent a week in the woods, they're all out of whiskey and just hanging on.
* They can't just **throw** these things around*
*They can't just die*
*And then they'll put things back, why shouldn't we care? *
I've seen friends *who can't come back*
I know people in schools, I know people who can ’ t leave
I really don't care about the people, they get offended.
All I want is for the best, to die.
But I ’ m stuck here, young, feeling lonely.
I need to take a break, I have to go somewhere, I have to listen to me people.
But why can ’ t they just?
I got a job here, right?
I can't go alone. I can ’ t be trapped by the people.
Someone will never say goodbye to me.
I need a break. I need to go somewhere.
I get up, and some young kids show up, and they talk.
They all laugh.
I need a break, I need to go somewhere, I have to listen to me people.
But how can I help?
We need to help more.
They laugh at me, and I feel bad.
I feel like they're wrong.
They know they can't go home, they can't go home.
I'm scared.
I want to fight.
I need to take a break.
I want to listen to my people.
I want to see some better, and that ’ s good.
I want to see some better.
I don't want them to ask me, they want to set me up with some better?
Am I ok?
Am I better?
I need a break.
There's only so much you can do, I can hear it, I know it.
My father has to be older now.
I need a break.
They laugh at me, and there ’ s so much I can do.
The kids laugh, as do my parents.
I feel no compassion, I get so hurt that *I* feel no pity for them.
They laugh at me, and I hear cries of joy.
I ’ m so helpless now.
*They* want to be better.
*The world is better, that ’ s a lie*
I'm dying, it ’ s for the best, because I ’ m alive, and no one can save me
I want to go home.
And nobody will stop me, never.
I was so lonely, and left now, feeling lonely, and left only hope.
That will be for the best, I think.
So I close my eyes, and let the tears spill out, I smile.<|endoftext|>

I was... nine when I first looked at the news. I saw the queen's birthday this week. I knew it would be great, but I was incredibly excited at the prospect of living for the rest of my life; The Queen was not a happy Queen.
I never thought it would be like this, right? I was so happy she was dying; Waiting for the day I never saw her again. So happy she would live forever; Finally, I got to see her. She looked exactly like me, beautiful. I started to cry, but I calmed down. When we first met, my heart froze. It was as if they were dealing a bad hand to each other, and I began to look at her. She was a beautiful girl, they were just trying to get by like everyone else.
In the last two years, she's been on death row. I tried desperately to be like them. The clock ticked by, and I wanted to cry. I got so tired, I put down my knife and went to the door. Just as I was about to enter, something happened. There was nothing on the other side, or in the chamber. I fell into a slumber. I lay there and cried, wondering if my heart would ever stop beating, the only words I could say after that were "please" and " I love you" and then I died.<|endoftext|>
**********564**********
I was waiting in line to board a flight with quite some other people behind me. I politely declined and asked their employer what was happening, but he never said much so I thought he'd have something to say next.
I was flying down the terminal when I heard the very sound that brought me crashing down. From where did that sound come from? I'm not sure, I just assumed it was someone getting on my nerves, but I might have accidentally seen something else.
The sound startled me. It sounded like a man on the verge of going insane. And now, it was real.
"Please, no, we can't go onto another plane, please, just tell us what is going on! " I begged to nothing in particular. The man was trying desperately to get through my gate, and I couldn't say the word. Without the word to pull myself together I tried to muster up a few words to get to the passenger first, but it just didn't seem to work. I don't know why, but I wanted to get to him first.
With my palms still pressed to my head, I took a deep breath. I had been scared the moment they handed me that much baggage, but not fear, I had just been frightened the moment they passed me uninvited.
I grabbed my belongings and opened the door. I looked into the crowd to see my security guards holding what seemed like a dozen small bags. I tried yelling for them to escort me back to safety as I turned away. Some of the waiters were already running, trying to put a stop to the unwanted guests from the other terminal, so I stayed where I was.
As I sat down in my seat and ordered a coffee, I could hear them all slowly walking toward me. Surely they would have noticed me by now. I was nearly tripping over my words, my throat hurting from the cough I had just burst out of. Surely they wouldn't be following my lead, they were stopping with my baggage, staring at me.
The minutes went by, they getting closer with each step. I waited for the worst, I held myself up, my wrists and ankles extended, and nothing happened. When the worst of the emotions came, I shoved it all away and walked slowly out of the plane.
The hard day finally came for me when I finally got out of the airport. I was headed to bed, and sitting with my bag next to me was my phone. I was already getting ready for work.
" Oh my god! I don't remember the last time I heard him coming in here! " I exclaimed as I stood up, " And when did he put this bag in my bag? It must have had gone missing, oh no! " I looked around at the security guard who was waving me over. I looked to my left, there was a man... the man at my back now.
" Hello! How may I help you today? " I asked with a small smile on my face. He smiled back, and let me know that I was the only one who knew.
I don't know how I got there, but I managed to get to the ticket booth, just as the man was opening the door, I saw him look down, point forward, see the bag give way. I don't know how he did that, but I did. I spun around and noticed that he was standing by my car with another man behind him, pointing towards the other person. I had no words to show him that I wasn't worried. I looked for him, and then he was still pointing to my bag, pointing to me.
With his other hand he held a small bag, and I saw it jump out of the driver's seat. He grabbed it and screamed as it fell, and we got to our seats. I put one hand on the bag and opened it, but it held back all the emotion I could muster. I took it and squeezed it tight, calling out " Thank you, buddy." and walked off. That's when I noticed that it was there... not a bag... but a girl... now... everywhere.<|endoftext|>
**********565**********
I am drowning in the bottom of the ocean. I watched my steps in the jungle, close enough to miss the waves, checking my body for signs of life.
I run to my death.
My best friend was swimming in the distance and I tried not to be near him. He was dead. His body drowned, along with everyone else except for me.
That's right. This is it. I'm leaving. Just like I have every year. I can't live with myself. I'm leaving. My body will lose any muscle, any motor control, even my heart, but there is always one thing left left in my body, I guess. The ones I love. And just like I would live, I will die alone.
I went for an escape route, since there was a certain death that would be eternal. I took a shortcut, he was lying on the ground, dying. I slipped on the ground, and somehow I did drown, so I didn't die. Not that it would bother anyone, the worst case scenario I could get is death going to cause this accident.
And I've never died of an accident before, as far as I can remember. Anyway, my death happened today, and I have been watching this movie for years. I don't even remember exactly what happened, but I'll leave you this in a minute, and time slowed down, once the movie ends and the death begins. The story starts where I am, a marine watching a ship crash, taking a dive at a large, red light. There was no sign of life, save for the water squirting out. No life, only a small island, with no food or water, well, whatever can be saved from the ocean. Except for a TV remote. I wanted to see what the remote would do... If you had a remote, you could see a story from your last month of death (? ).
In the back of my mind, I did move my body around. A massive chunk of the island that seemed to be built in at sea. I felt my body slowly moving towards it. The feeling got stronger and stronger every second and it was consuming me.
Finally, the sound from the radio. " Dive close! You'll fall, as you can see. " A regular, regular, flashlight, that I had memorized as my own, just powered down and kept running. Then the loud and splutterless voice from the radio turned on.
" Dive close! " The voice sounded familiar, like I always heard from my younger days of school or my father or my mother telling me the fish were growing old and mollusks were popping out of their shells and it was time to dive close!
I slowly made my way to the living center of the island and closed my eyes. I was floating along, staring out the window. Looking out to this floating city, where even the birds had died and the clouds dissipated. And there were a couple buildings that I could barely see, made completely from what looked like plywood. I closed my eyes again to see what people were doing there, and without even looking up, I felt my legs become solid, like if a six year old girl's.
And then what happened.
I decided that I would have to look for a source of sustenance, which was not possible on this great world.
Suddenly, some solar rays changed the colour of the island, and some tropical light splashed upon the reflections of the street.
" Huh. " I said, as I dove forward from the window and turned around. There was a faint glow, which looked like stars, shining on the ground, and it was then that I noticed them, in the bright rays of sun.
" What are you? What are you looking at? " The voice sounded human, almost like my childhood girl.
" I'm just running for my life." I said, and then dove forward and flew towards the glowing star.
Because, because of my luck, I ended up killing a guy.
Because I was going to die alone, not alone with no one to look for me... But I wasn't alone, right?<|endoftext|>

Barry took a bite of his beer. It was still coming back from the back of his old TARDIS. The bit, or booze, had some hardened, bitter aftertaste after a teary night of partying.
"Aye -- ", he huffed, " forgot to *swig* that out. "
The TARDIS sniffed, then shook violently. It was nearly half a foot long and four feet deep -- almost, with its intricate woodwork on the roof, and bent out, two feet at most.
" It's still a bit of a gooey smell, you know. Try and believe me, I've never heard you wan na giggle. ", The creature let out a booming scream, " It banged on your door for yeee -- ". The glass shattered and glass fell to the floor.
" Give it back! ", Barry yelled, hoping the Martians would just throw the door at it. He leapt out of the rock and shouted over the air, " Rusties! "
The Aliens burst into a sprint, three of them towards it, one fainted. Barry ran up to cover his battered arms, holding on as far as he could. " Sorry. Handwaving you. "
" Rusties? I swear, you don't count there're zombies in your warehouse? And how many times have you knocked over the *boot* of them, then ran right out into the open? "
" None, " Barry shook his head, trying not to attract the looming demon spirits. " But none of this is edible. Or harmless. "
" Rusties? What the... "
" Maybe you should go. If this is the last thing you ever remember, then they're just gon na eat your brains out. Come on, you're not very sharp, are you, Barry? Stop looking in the mirror to get cute. Don't look back at me with a disappointed look on your face. " The steel is *key* in his mind. " Maybe they'll eat you too -- "
The demons that accompanied Barry ran out of the hangar, and into the stars.
With only the remains of his beer left of the door -- and a brain leftover -- it made its way back to the Sky.
" And there you are! " Barry leaped and nearly tripped on a broken and broken light fixture.
" Everything's gone, " the aliens replied. They turned around, hurrying off into the trees.
" Maybe -- maybe we're all headed back there. " Barry offered his first beer.
" Yeah, whatever."<|endoftext|>

2 or 3 years ago, my parents used to take this fine whiskey down with me because of some chemical imbalance in their sodium nitrites. I was really cute, its for real. My sister and I graduated college at that time with a Ph.D., so she seemed totally normal. I just didn't know what to tell them because I don't have any friends.
"my friends don't exist! " I thought.
" How? " I replied.
" its pretty strong. "
" How strong do you think? "
" five. "
" six? "
" seven."<|endoftext|>

Mikhail came home early this morning. He always takes it easy, opens the fridge, thinks it's a surprise to be carrying a bag of almonds, and hates almonds. How do you know you're carrying so much for nothing? A bit of sheepskin? A burlap sack?
Mikhail walked in the house quickly, noticed that no one was walking outside, and turned on his heel to turn around. He was greeted by the corpse of his only contact.
"Nope, Freddy. What the fuck did you- "
" H-hello? "
" Freddy? I've moved in with a few friends. You were working out for the judge this week. You'll see. " Mikhail was barely able to utter a single word, before his mom would yell at him for forgetting what his job was. " Just a normal sandwich, okay? "
" I don't miss any of that. Last week, I ran into the armories and they were ruined. They were full of three small bags of almonds and my grandpa was selling them for cheap, so I just went with it. Even if he knew, he wouldn't know anymore. "
He walked away. He didn't think too much of what his mom had said, but he still knew that Freddy knew. He hadn't had a particularly bad day of his life and didn't even feel sick for either of them. I wondered, what makes somebody with a big headache like that wear a banana peel.
He entered the kitchen and brought out his phone.
>... asshole caused a police report, that name is my gift. My name is where mine and mommy are, and his grandmother would never like to hear it.
Mikhail stuck his head out the window into the town and started enjoying his morning stroll.
He stopped outside the bank and started tapping on the outside of the store.
" Shit. Where's the goddamn hidden gun? "
" Right in the purse, " he pointed at a wide-open bank vault. A man at the counter whispered.
" No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This isn't police, " Mikhail said into the phone.
The bearded man glanced at Mikhail. " Alex's got it in his bag. Well, I guess he's still in the closet, so why not he's got it? Don't worry, I'm your guy."
It was at this point Mikhail realized, that it wasn't really the trunk at all. The man, who was certainly far older than Mikhail even, was always there behind him. In fact, the man had called Mikhail mad this entire time.
The old man had called Mikhail mad to become a lawyer, but Mikhail had somehow gotten a glimpse of a mirror in the old man's den. It didn't exist, so he looked him directly in the eyes.
Mikhail sat back in his chair and waited, and waited for the other immortals to notice.

*He speaks to me, that is different from the art of the fucking blues! These fucking blues *on* life, he's shit in fuckin' water. I wasn't saying that but it's true; I've seen **every** fuckin black man's shit; I've seen straight up, deep marathons that send a shit high into the stratosphere that tumble downwards at'em. A fucking bottle of apple juice burned my ass, I remember my friends or at least me and all the old memories or the vampyres that jammed me till I farted or if I drank, I was sucking their shit or shot fuckin' my buddies in the balls, I didn't think so myself.
I noticed, as you know I was young and naive, too hungry to relive the great songs that overcame the advanced age of the Beatles, that street gangies - the scummerettes - that slaves, yada yada - killed us wit the same fervor and uncouth, so skinny punches that served to drag down the world and change the face of the planet.
And think about it; the fucker is the bloke next door and I happened to be there at the site of their duel; he wore a red coat with sequin tulips, told me that it was a feint bonfire that they donned from overgrowth - he took his coat off, moved across, and out came my client.
And all his problems and all his worries - who knows? He had got a lot of drugs. Oh fucking fuck, why did he want to ask for those drugs? Why would he make me do this? Why would he not only think about what his problems are? That we'll get straight to the fucking point and, I guess, we'll find out if he makes them all.
It's what I signed up for. My role in the world of cinema; and, see, you never know with things like that, right? You never really know whether your role is right or wrong, or if it's *right* for the fuckers to do it; all you ever know is, you're still me.
Some of us just get into the wrong fucking vehicle, and where I go I tell you what. I'm not here to give you the answers to your questions, *I'm* giving you a glimpse of my world. Not just a picture of the world, but a truth that you'll never know. That you're right, this shit doesn't let up, it's shit that letes you handle a barrel of a fire in your backpack. And I can't rest my head on my last cigarette of the day, because every time I quit, I quit because I'm fucking honest with myself, and I can't stop listening to this rap in the passenger seat of the car or the bar or even the doorway and I'm fucking sorry - I've forgotten a God damn thing.<|endoftext|>

"Listen Jerry, make the announcement ahead of time. What is that supposed to mean?! " said the voice on the other end of the intercom.
" You know everything my grandfather would say. Know exactly what they would say if they found out the whole damn thing about the launch. What do you mean the launch? " Jerry said.
" We don't know yet, but the fuk top is a silly duck. Know the damn thing, Jerry. " said the crewmember of the submarine.
" The fuk top? "
" The fuck kelp K, I don't know, it's only there so it can't leave the sub for days and weeks. " Jerry pointed to his watch.
" Yeah, well it will, the fuk top is somewhat a different creature with more carbon based atmosphere. The fuk top goes further, and is made to go out into space rather then get crushed like you'd expect. Very interesting, sir. What did you get for the rest of the plan sir? " Jerry asked with a forced sigh.
" Well, you were right. Hell, I guess I'll get a new red car once I get back to my abseiling. The fuk top worked just like that for me, sir, but I didn't. So now I'm putting in a new car to try and exploit the ecosystem. Also sir, the firing codes have changed. We don't have enough power for a load of this weapon to detonate in the sub. Who are we to fault, " said the captain, after a lengthy explanation.
" Oh, of course sir, the Fuhrer makes a manifesto, " said the captain.
" Goddamn kelp it's over. Sir. You're being ridiculous! " cried the crewmember.
" I'll just keep you posted, sir. I'll be right back, " replied the captain.
" Ok, everything there is to know, now! " said the submarine operator.
" They're firing the nuclear warhead sir. "
" Fire us."<|endoftext|>

"Here's the thing - what if there is... no OOCRISPR virus? What if there isn't a where for OOCRISPR or nothing? "
Bill wiped the sweat from his brow and looked up at the contraption floating above them. It was a patch of something made of fabric - once the patriarchy had decided to allow it to exist, and once they had made the first prototypes of their technology - but of the purpose that *pardon me*, every patch used was 1 or 2 " replacements.
" You could replace the facial fuzz with synthetic hair, " the contraption's leader declared and put the small black disposable module over the mask of one of the 11 members, " but we wouldn't see a profit from either. We would send a press release, but right now we don't have funds to pay. "
" And we could convince the doctors that they need to *stood* and have OOCRISPR injected right into the skin of their patients? " the leader asked.
The 11 members gave the leader some shrill retorts about the cost of maintaining the project. Then it dawned on Bill, " Plus, we thought only one day we'd see a change. "
" Yes, we could convince the US Military. "
And the third member stepped forward, pistol in one hand, gesturing towards the nearest soldier just as the camera shattered.
The head scientist pushed his hand in front of his face as if to confirm the breakthrough with a smirk and he shuffled off the stage to explain why his group had waited so long to publicly throw their hands up in disapproval. The others nodded politely.
The chief programmer and then-head researcher had a message for his group in front of him.
" That means that one day, every single one of the six air filters will no longer be functional. The world will have to hear about the consequences. "
She nodded.
" And then there will be consequences, of course. It all depends on how desperate they are, but ultimately, people will have to do something about the consequences. It's the responsibility of everyone, even the gods that controlled the air, to seek out change, to be responsible for causing it.
" Fine, then. "
The technicians nodded and the three rest were removed from the room and replaced with the clean air around them, their facial hair filing up in grim patches.
" We'd like to thank God for our time and money, and we really appreciate it. They have the right idea. We should thank them. I know I'm almost crying now, after all the effort and fines and penalties they've put in order to make life more fair for everyone, and yet I only feel guilty now."<|endoftext|>

Definitely not best but i am definitely on my rocker.
Heat the final baking water, skim and throw it all into a bowl and let it simmer for a few minutes ( roughly 5 minutes in total ). Heaters will vary greatly from sponge to wax too ( wrist can be kind of tricky to mix ).
Add in the milk and sugar, if using ( set the max time for 3 minutes ) and add in the flour ( mint, maybe even orcri ). Or in other words stir in the sugar and flour then mix the ebay bag in for details on the bag of flour... it may seem complex for 5 minutes but once it's done in your pan, make sure not to over heat a bit too much as it's an easy area to cook on.
Once done mixing the dough into the butter, just stick it in the pot and slowly turn the heat down to high for a couple of minutes. Add the fish sauce and mix in as many spices as you like ( maybe add more if you need ). A few days later, the tomatoes will have evolved into meat because the sauce has turned to sauce.
On a low heat, in a medium saucepan, add a can of beans and rice and turn on the heat. With tongs, aim your cookbook at the ends of the pan and point the meat at the flame and wait. Over a few minutes, turn the heat back to the max and pour the beans in as much water you have, carefully add salt to the sauce to slowly work the beans around to create a perfect sauce. Serve immediately!
Cons: My only hope for a creative improvement is to go back to making badass dishes to simplify your prep or course. This will probably be the final one i created, but my pride's worth more than anything so let me know if you have any criticism.
Cheers.<|endoftext|>

As the mayor of Lagal a young man of the slums of Peraea stood in the shade of his stone-washed, ashen bleaky hut.
The young man collected his belongings of candy and old toys from what he called the town ’ s stockpiles, an instrument which would cause a fine dust to float to the ground. The young man ’ s daughter, Legolas, would come from the woods and scavenge the man ’ s belongings to obtain more items that would assist him in his quest for success in court. The man was glad that the young man was able to provide his daughter with such a useful item.
Legolas looked through the stones at the young man, who, with a defeated sigh, stood up from his throne.
“ The artifact you picked up from the wall before you fell may not exist, but you will find it within the next day ”, the man said while checking for a sharp object to retrieve.
Legolas looked through the stone he had collected from his village. It seemed out of the corner of his eye to see some dominoes, others a castle, and even a door. He walked through the young man ’ s house and stopped a large boulder from crashing into his family ’ s basement. The boulder had disappeared during the fall and its owner was never seen again.
Legolas cursed the young man as he walked past the middle of his child ’ s basement, stopping to stare out at the sunset. Legolas and Legolas slowly walked out of the shadow of the stone stairwell, and before they could to the top of the ledge they both fell. Legolas felt a small prick in his neck.
“ I ’ ve done it, ” said Legolas, weak and exhausted, as he laid on the stoop to stare at the sun ’ s low ballast. “ My ’ children ’ s kids have even pulled this… ”
“ Where am I? ” The old man asked in frustration, raising his voice. “ Where are my parents? ”
Legolas noticed the young man kneeling beside Legolas. He noticed Legolas ’ crumpled, tear of life running down his face.
“ Come, Legolas. ” The old man uttered with a eagerness Legolas knew he couldn ’ t bear. “ The old one ’ s going to be pissed. ”
“ Anything. I ’ ll leave. ” He replied out loud.
Legolas looked down in an empty stomach. It wasn ’ t long before the old man had fallen. The last thing Legolas would see of him was his children ’ faces in the shards of the skyscrapers that still stitched together buildings.
Legolas watched from the top of the skyscrapers as Legolas had been blasted to dust. Before he could go back to his home and mourn his lost family again, a giant slug brought down from the sky shook the very foundations of the earth with a thunderous crash.<|endoftext|>

Should I choose the blue pill, the red pill or the blue pill? Should I choose the red pill, the blue pill or the purple pill?
I don't quite make any choices, I simply input my choice into my Brain, which I like, which then responds back with: yes.
I think "blue pill " will be the red pill.
I will go with the blue pill.

"Oh, that made a wonderful memory. I don't know how long it'll last though, but it's from that trip I took to Egypt.." He fidgeted as he looked out the entrance to the palace complex through the peephole in his belt. Stretching his arms out, he started grinning proudly. The expression on his face said he knew why she was so interested in him so far after all. He was thinking of all his weeks in his office in the government lab, working and organizing the project progress he had made. And the excitement of learning more about her. " A big cheer? " He marveled at the number two on the far screen. " 0.32 %! ". He let out a chuckle as he glanced down at his watch and smiled at the two digits of numbers, a little more like a number depending on how you got it. The hat on his head had two minutes left to go, so he just continued grinning with the crowd, picking at his burger. 'Til that pesky Cuban piped up. " I thought that we would really like to talk about some of the development of their newest and fastest injection into the body of the MRSA. I know, I know,'cause I will really enjoy this type of therapy." He exclaimed as he was out the door, heading down the steps and back into his office.<|endoftext|>

The sun rose over the peaks at dusk and the setting sun shone through the blinds of my cave. The butterflies were restless and nestled against the thin branches of the trees beneath, their voles blanketed in crisp silks of their choosing. I slipped down the door, opening a little gap between the walls to get a good look. I could see the sun so clear that I could almost feel the cool steel against my skin. The building, I thought. * Sometimes* I think.
The fireflies met my eyes with the narrow sockets of their eyes. When the fireflies finally shut their crows nestled around each other. The air was cool, with the soft breezes bringing down fresh droplets. I would soak in the view, eyes filled with warm dreams. I would drift off down the long winding corridors, whispering goodbye to the warmth.
But just as I turned back, a flash blew through the water, cutting us both off forever. In what I could only describe as an instant, the light jumped from the sky and onto me. I stopped breathing, still staring at it, pondering the implication that it had caused me to die in its fury. I could don'thing about it, and it took everything from me, and now it had left. I laid my eyes on the body of my former lover. His eyes would stay open for over an hour at a time, making sure that nothing wrong had happened to him. I took him out for a ride home as well, leaving him with nothing but his cage for the next year or so. I drifted off to sleep, hoping that my life at least started here.
*I quit. *

I loved her, it was my first kill, and tonight, she deserved it, she deserved to feel the heat of her murderous wrath and anguish as I sliced her liver clean off. The first time I killed, she stood at the edge of her bed, examining the page. I couldn't say no to that rush of bloodlust that ran through her veins before, at first I thought she was dying, but it gave way to an unquenchable rage, I needed to kill her now, she was too damaged to die, she had destroyed everything, she simply had no control over what happened next. Everything that happened. There was no end, just a void, begging for death. But in the end, nothing was necessary, all she wanted to do was live. A place of solitude, a place to watch her children grow and flourish, a place where she could be at peace. She called it the Vex Cities, but I never asked. She once said to me "But I love her more than anything, that's why I killed her." Now I come to remember her, looking at it from afar. I'm broken, and I'm tired, and I look for comfort in the dead skin of a man who would kill any human it found sleeping in her bed. I bring her to me. Her blood is mine now, and I am done for, without her, it was all in vain, and I am leaving. The ground is now overgrown, decaying, and it has become dark again. My door shuts behind me, I turn around and continue to stroll down the sidewalk. The shadows cover the streets, and I walk, with my hands on the backs of my shoes, through the mass of bodies under my feet.<|endoftext|>

True story:
My name is Howard Marks. I'm a detective in a crime division. I'm not exactly a nice guy, but I do the job and it's got to pay my bills. I like having detective guy/s.
Our job is to hunt down those damn lies we leave out there, because some of them in our report are better than the other. I've got hitmen across the state that you know can cut through walls, only to hunt them down when they are smart enough to and start to disguise themselves from our ruse.
That's my biggest thing now. Realizing that our hounds don't need to do everything they want to do, and that they don't need to do everything we want, I've changed the ways our gang works. We can go places, but they need to tie us to a rock to cause a scar. They can't take away the truth we leave out, because the knowledge that they did all of this work, only leaves us less afraid than ever before.
Bullshit.
Who can blame them? Losing sight of my goal is only making matters worse. All I need is a place to hide my arms and arm but that's it. Maybe the answer came down to silence, and this led to a stronger team, maybe even a better department.
Truth is we know some things. Some lie is better then a lie; a liar can only lie once. Some lie has been hidden for a while, but the truth is different. To tell the truth that the guy lied to and started a war is to be anything but deceitful.
I know they must have tried everything, tried all, but in these past few days, they ended up with a near-perfect plan. I could say the lie, claim our detective squad killed 2 and caused more deaths by honest, honest lies than we've seen and have only just made numbers more meaningful, but I'm going to have to head home, get a tan and a shave, and cover it up if the truth is to get the attention of my supervisors.
I hate the day when the truth gets the attention of real guys.<|endoftext|>

We've been waiting for months for a buyer. The ore that used to be treated as fertilizer has ran dry, a new solution is in sight. All around us, people are running for their lives. Surrounding me are people down below, waiting anxiously for whatever the hell is about to happen.
The rain we sometimes could not have expected came down heavy and fast,
The workers have struggled to grab everything that is left of the ore. But it will take a while. They must get to their destination,
All of which I can not help but wonder about.
The bosses haven't been able to reach me as of yet, my fire breathing muscles and strength are killing my words. I will hold on for dear life as the law dictates. We will have our meals prepared and stocked with all the safe supplies we can muster from the nearest far-off nation. Hopefully, they won't take us as slaves.
By now I will let the so-called "perseverence " end.
" Tim, you're good! This is not good. Don't you remember what happened 20 years ago, when the whole world went black? " I started walking through the air towards the mine. I knew I had to get up to get started, but an engine would not let me back to my current situation.
" We are all buried under piles of dirt! " Timothy continued towards me as we started towards the source. I sat down on the edge of the block of dirt and held my water pistols ready to fire the final bullet I had ready for him. When I saw his wound, I fell to the ground as the bullets reverberated around me in the wind.
" We will wait here for a few more weeks until your grandmother comes home. Have you prayed for us? " I tell Timothy.
" Yeah, it's been a couple of weeks now. I miss you." He begins walking down the tracks towards the mine.<|endoftext|>

Outside the playground, the dumfounded boy flicked his peripheral out. It was just another game. Nobody had come to check on him, so he had already begun playing. He had come across a lowlight; any electronic gadget or explosive device in the area had caught fire.
The boy had seemed to move through the playground at seemingly no real level, and had gained weight, in the process. Ever since he entered this neighborhood, nobody had noticed. One of the guys in his squad called for him to check, so the nameless boy hopped into the air. He slammed down on his club, and began applying pressure.
As the pressure increased, a thick, creamy substance filled the air, effectively burning his hands. He was helpless, frozen, unable to move. He was motionless. Behind him, a shadow headed toward him. For a split second, nobody noticed. Then, a voice sounded in the distance, like the crackling of lightning.
"C-c-course, kid. We can't, " the kid said, struggling to his feet.
" What's your name, son? " came a soothing voice.
The boy sprang up to the surface, startled. He turned quickly to the snow covered ground, and faced the sight. He had been riding his bike on a metal-red track, atop a pile of snow.
A flicker of energy lit up in the boy's eye. He twitched, and squinted. He turned just in time to see the magic backfire with enormous green flames, blasting the asphalt down into the ground.
" Wait, where the hell am I? " the boy ’ s voice was filled with the sound of crashing waves. He held up his hands to stop himself, and was met with a blinding flash of light.
The impact threw the boy into a crater that had only previously been covered in snow. Down inside the crater, the boy ’ s body lay. He started breathing heavily. Despite his situation, his mind was clear. Before any soul could think of anything to make sense of the situation, he felt a final, brilliant flash.
Everything went black.<|endoftext|>

"What would you like for dinner today? "
There was a waiter in the distance, while he was biding his time.
The old Man strolled to the edge of the table, giving out one last sympathetic glare to the waiter. The waiter watched him as the old man sat on the ground next to him, looking up at him. The waiter dropped his food and began to scrub his lap.
" I would like to see one of the Baragays tonight. I don't understand why they don't do it every day. "
The old man bowed his head and looked at his waiter's face. His eyes remained fixed in place, having seen the chef too much.
The old man took a sip of his drink and began chewing. " That does sound bad. "
The waiter looked away, then was replaced by another man. The old man pushed past him in a hurry, leaving the baragay standing.
The old man then pulled out a knife and held it in a fist. " I would like to see some pork chops for dinner tonight. "
The waiter smiled to himself.
The old man gave him a sharp bark and drew back the blade. The young man started running towards the old man, attempting to get away with a knife. The waiter caught up to him, looking behind him. The old man watched him. He didn't look back.
The old man looked out his kitchen window. All of the color drained from the building. He looked at his knife, and the old man's jaw dropped.
The old man left the bar to head to his dog's place, where he was officially the owner.
The bar tab was empty.
" So, now where the hell do I go for dinner?"

On Earth, these things are amusing.
There were heroes in the early days of man, there were prophets in the yearning of humanity to break into their utopian civilization and reach into the beyond. In the late twentieth century, humankind had transcended tradition into a fabled space-age. Of course, culture and eventuals were all the same: large schools of business and political subdivisions flourished and thrived, gilded vaults of culture reinvented, debated politics yielded outstanding dividends and human spirit was taught to a life of harmony. Never to be surpassed, ever to be outclassed, ever to have bested others forever.
At the end of the day, as time traveled, gods gave a voice to our belief in ourselves. Today, in the light of the stars, humanity would bring this uncountable number of believers on Earth to observe Earth anew.
"Do not fear, when we come through the stars, we will learn from you and our ways in the divine light of that which no man has ever seen. We will teach humanity to innovate, to grow, and to reveal ourselves. "
We share this lesson with countless others, many of whom did not even make it across the stars yet have constructed vast graves of the stars themselves. After all, the first steps towards the transcendence we have been longing for are yet to begin.
As Man floats through the white void on the very surface of the stars, only the slight tremble of earth from the impacts from Earth can determine whether we, alone among the stars, are to truly enter through the endless universe. The message from their god heralds dawning in the dawning of humanity on Earth, no small sign. To the rest of the universe, humanity already steps forward and sends its eyes over the stars to see what life would have been like before humanity had gone through the stars.
So began the great new age that was known as the New Age, a period in history where humans, through thoughtful touch and robust purpose, perfected technology that extended our civilization farther than we ever could have dreamed.
Shortly after, they came back to this earth to find the stars themselves full of wonder.
So began the powers that be, who shielded us from the weight of stars for thousands of years and gained long-suffering lives away from this barbaric life.
We ventured to further outposts on planet Earth and through the gas lines who sought to increase their numbers, brought them upon this new Earth to see the progress of ours.
I shudder to think of what God might have done differently, but the message from their god is that we understand only that they have ascended and are destined to uphold their traditions. To believe that mankind has surpassed them now is to cry out in agony and despair. The power that be is unable to do so.
The message is that if we reach across space and find nothing, we will endure. The voice from their god tells us this day will come and then we will go onward, god and humanity on earth together, but for now we pray to one remaining and significant piece of life: perhaps the seeds of the future man would have put in place.
And thus, great mass awakening and the ascension of mankind, we shall go. Perhaps it is better that no one can ever observe Earth to the first and last breath of new life than we will never reach that majestic tree in the ground that shapes our story. Not until I die.
Goodbye.<|endoftext|>

It had been a tough few weeks leading up to Operation Snake Eater. Each one their only chance to sneak across the dank blood-soaked corridors of the CIA for resources, money, and even intel. You would always get a ticket out of 3rd floor as we huddled in there pre-animated with our rifle's heavy crosshair, this one close.
After what felt like an hour of torture, we moved past the bodies of various Mexican drug cartels to one of the holdouts, in which they spoke to each other.
"Where are we? " said Putin
" Must be up there. "
" Can you hear me? "
Putin's eyes widened, moving towards his partner. " The fucking ground we've been trapped in, I guess... we can't go too far. The shrapnel all round, how can you fight off some of these things? "
" Shit. I figured something out. "
" You saw my mission in DC, right? "
" Yeah. "
" Heh. I like that section. " Putin looked down at his weapon, killing it, pointing it at the ground. A big red flash erupted, and our eyes locked with one of the 9-foot soldiers.
" I guess you could say I'm... right. " Putin pointed the weapon in Putin's direction.
" Ah. How you beautiful. "
" DQ. "
" What's that? "
" Here's your weapon. " Putin lowered his eyes, revealing their pupils. " Now, can you close your eyes and.... feel it? " The world went black, so cold was it felt until Putin's eyes opened one last time. Everything went to black. His hand remained on the trigger as we drifted deeper in that dark tunnel as if nothing had ever happened. Finally, after almost 5 minutes, the ambient light came back on. It was the eerie eerie glow of a satellite TV.
" Great, two men up. Come out here, show us how we can use it."
Before Putin could speak the names that separated us, our five figures emerged from the trench. Smoke escaped into a deep black hole and the snatcher came close.<|endoftext|>

The old man swung his sword wildly, and slashed down on the shielded women and children.
'Mister, get the damn thing down!' someone shouted,
The powerful blade jutted off the pole, cutting into his heart with its horrible methodical tingling. He started to weak and collapsed.
'Fear not, I don't wish to harm you, this woman and her child, all of you have fallen to the wicked were-!'
'Waltz of Longfin?'
'Longfin,' hissed the old woman, as he jumped away.
They followed him, advancing on the darkened wight's castle.
'Yes, Witchmaster, you shall gather your allies,' the old man said, opening the ancient door,
'We shall start right from the beginning! The dark planter, known as *Wayley*, plans to kill the witch lord known as *Wayley* by poisoning her wine from wine barrels!'
The walls outside shattered as the old man gave way. The dark lord descended into the thick ground, straining his muscles, as the blade came to a stop, blade still in hand.
The old man raised his sword, as the old witch rattled her own.
'Hold still, Witchmaster, prepare to shield the child,' a voice shouted.
'Free her, Master Williams. Remember, you may be vile. You may be deadly, but I will give you a gift that only the dark can give,'
Waltz rose, and was once again upon the darkness.
'Waltz of Longfin, bring your friends to rest. Please, your grace is not to be lost to the Good Lord Vashsha. My daughter has suffered, Witchmaster, for long, and she will suffer her own long term agony.
By the will of Her Highness, she shall pass, and all evil ends. Go do as I command, Witchmaster. I will raise all our armies as one, so that our enemies may never again reap the life of this woman and child,'
The cloak was set alight, and flames shot out of it.
'Waltz, I am your Mistress, Witchmaster.' The witch said, pointing her wand at Waltz, before storming out the door.<|endoftext|>

Most people are fascinated by how these things are made by humans. It is a savage, chaotic game from day one of what they call "our" nation's six consecutive champions. Admittedly the shots are often made by little kids, who wander around and are merely dumbstruck. The last tournament wasn't with France, but with England, and Argentina? Sometimes kids and the adults hop into practices and practice, and sometimes the court gets thrown together.
Every one of those kids needs a backseat booster pack and if they can land one at home some cells will be set aside for the rest of the day so they can start. Sometimes, in intense darkness, children would be knocked from their chairs and scored. For ages, everyone these days was just mindless sports.<|endoftext|>

'Perhaps that's a weakness of the Galactic Union, come on Dan - so what if they won't support us?'
'We can't, Ambassador. In your blood they've risen, especially on Earth. This is an enlightened age and a tenuous belief, especially when the Allies have ceased to exist. They are weak on their own volition,'
'And do you think --?'
'I don't know what to say. I don't know what to think -- but I do know I believe the whole damn thing is a lie,'
'You must understand, we share the view, even if it sounds like a lie,'
'But Ambassador, if --. we are absolutely alone here, all ten thousand strong -- this can only mean one thing -- three equals can and will survive, and no member of the sentient species shall ever know that they are without humanity,'
'Well, I want to be alone, I have ideas.'
'You don't want us to be alone. So, what's that? Talk about your logic, talking a course of action? Hmm, maybe the Federation chose to help us, as some sort of false positive, but you keep spouting these endless garbage about humans in the distant past. Doesn't seem fair.'
'Look, Dan - this federation and I -- well, at a glance they're the same thing,'
'But they've destroyed the entire planets before you built it. That's unneeded. And, worst of all, you know what the Federation does. General Windram has been at War; ask any Advisor he suggests against,'
'And if you don't agree, the Society can not allow us to build anything we want. The Federation, this being a'[ Tod ]' of the largest faction in the Galactic Confederation, can not stand to listen to the opinion of those who would defend themselves. The Federation is a still global power, un-armed and almost entirely self-less. And so it has decided to cause so much suffering that it is very fitting that it was not the Union but all the twenty-seven League alliance's leading members do the opposite.'
'But we are not going to stop there, Ambassador.'
'And why should we? We've not seen anything like it!'
'We must not do this to ourselves, Dan. We've done so much that the Federation can not understand. The Federation believes that we are taking it from you and granting you power over another race. Under the new Federation rules you have the freedom to resist,'
'And what should I do?'
'Move.'
'Move!'
'And? What if I don't?'
'Move! Move! Move!'
'Move! Move!'
'Move!'
'Move!'
'Move!'
'Move!'
'Move!'
'Move!'
'You're being stupid! Get out of my mind!'
'No! Get out of my mind! You're blocking it. I'm not --'
'But nothing -- why? Nothing. Just talk to one of your comrades and they will understand. And unless you live on Earth and work for something terrible, the Federation will not stand another chance.'
'I can't --'
'If you don't live. Then I will break out of your control. For fear of meeting with you. Nothing more. Now, go to the Cave.'

Now here I was, in a swamp I had made a good impression by running.
I stood and for the first time, looked to the empty waters below. I saw red dot in sky, and felt my heart sink. The amount of water was not equal to the amount of time I was there and of course, if it was, I would be dead.
For what seemed like years, the human left camp. They seemed frightened, but they were also incredibly enthusiastic about me. Most seemed to think they had become just a grinder, some just wanted me to pass out. Others seemed to be amazed at what I could do. But then, it all sort of hit me and I was horrified. A cacophony of unknown emotions, the biggest it had ever heard. Fear, joy, fear of the unknown? That was utter nonsense and the fear and joy was what was confusing me.
Suddenly I saw a road. It was a long road. It disappeared from sight instantly. The same person, stared at me, just as if to say "here is where we speak of snakes. "
The next thing I know was a giant swimming crocodile lizard, its eyes shining green, its body cumbersome, as if it had been poorly built, completely stitched, and its legs ever so cumbersome. I noticed a couple human tourists who got older, and started to tell them about their experience. No one knew they were spirits, or any of their kind had ever existed, but I knew what I must do.
I eventually grabbed the city, and to my amazement I saw it where it all began. Mountains, road, everything.
After a few more hours, the humans left and started going about their business. The cities were in ruins now and some where taking over. But I don't know how I got back.
I was running now, and the humans were in my back yard. Luckily, not too far back, they looked closer. And I said to them, " What have you done to not see these shores?"<|endoftext|>

Lightwalking circles around the dark monolith stood like people, stars and moons of ash, floating in the depths of the galaxy. A small sphere surrounded the sphere by a spiral pole. Distantly, by the lantern glow of the moon, a shadow lurked closer than the centre of the great circle. It lurked near the group, their eyes glistening with light, a spark of life in their eyes.
The moon reflected the sun that shone at the sphere, already passing through a labyrinth of clouds that stretched on forever, in the dying glow of the sun itself. A figure stepped slowly, covering the sphere in darkness, allowing photons to pass by from the darkness's darkness. With a flick of his fingers, a cloud cleared, the glow of the moon washing over it. A new shadow emerged before the person, elongated limbs floating in the light, making it difficult to see.
The lightwalker turned his head around, aiming at the being that were shrouded in darkness. " Where is everyone?" The shadow asked, and the lightwalker turned around. Far away, the figures shadow vanished.
Then there was nothing, and so there was nothing, at least, for the void.<|endoftext|>

The blood gushes out of my mouth with every full beat. The animals start leeched out of their food, and the crunching of their bones indicates there have been an attack. I can hear them howling for a while, and I can hear the ruffles they wear out in the air. I shake my head and throw the bodies away and run out the door.
As I step out the door I hear that two thugs have gathered and were firing a club. I approach them before they can get close. The nasty looking lady nearest me slowly morphs into a humanoid shape.
She stands in front of me, holding a knife in her right hand and a handgun in her left. She stands up, turns, and as she does her eyes turn a darker red and a faint odor fills the air. The odor becomes unbearable.
I hastily stand and start making my way around the infected rats. I pick up a couple of members of the guy being attacked by the she and tuck them in tight. I slowly raise my knife up to my hand and begin striking the people nearby. I toss a human down and attempt to throw them up but instead the filthy pick-up swipes across the floor. I turn around.
"Hello guys... Not anymore!" the lady tells me before picking me up and heading off.<|endoftext|>

"How can you possibly tell if something's wrong? Agh, fuck, I hate these fucking people and they're sitting in my car like they've done shit for the last few months. "
" Well alright let's just say he's supposed to... "
" a - a count of where you're in relation to the deaths of three people? "
" Right where? "
" The lives of the victims the bloodstains on the walls look like they belong to a pizza delivery guy, but here they are. He's screwing them over, right? Well that's what the angles are for is how they went so fast. Poor Russel, they've covered that area with my back and now he's going to die. "
" Right, well you know that's probably your bad manners. Anyway this is a fucking white fucking lab - what do you think the fuck man? Think that crap would make any sense? I don't know, if he came in here smelling like weed he would have died... "
" Look, man, quit fucking smoking -- I can't give you that kind of shit, I'm not a comedian and a rapist. No one would even be able to play a role in this movie. What the fuck man?! "
" Well this lab is a fucking bottomless pit of sewage water. Are you fucking kidding me? This fucking city is overrun with radioactive waste! "
" No, no, do you fucking really think this guy is gon na be able to survive this. "
" There is... there is nothing we can do and that is why we're here. Like they know you're here, we can get help and we can help. Move your ass, move your ass! "
" No, wait, don't move your ass you goddamn prick. Just step up and give us your fucking help! "
" What? "
" There is no way we can help him! "
" Well what's the point of your existence if you can't fucking live? You fucker, give up your fucking life? That's a commitment to your work, no fucking fucking reason to be angry. "
" Uh, ok, ok, "
" Then you must give up on your fucking life and stick it up your ass again! "
" Don't be so insistent huh? "
" I have two things to tell you now man, last week I spoke to this dude straight from a movie they were filming. His name was Gordon Roberts and he was in an attempt to kill Morgan Freeman. There's a reason he's so wrapped up in his own scum. You don't need to hear me. You don't need to listen to me anyway! "

"We'll have to get wind of this issue! " Said The Duke to Ymir.
" How often does it happen? " Ymir replied.
" Most nights, ymir, we bang on the code in his face like his ass is shaking too much. We lock the door behind him, then push the knob down around a dozen times. The inside won't open up unless we throw a ton of weights on it. If we don't, he'll have to go to sleep in the morning. Nothing fancy, just run into his room at 7:40 until he wakes up. The machines will wire him to a backup generator, and if they pull it, then those back down too. Then, we'll get to work on an internal replacement generator. "
The Duke was incredulous. When one of the generators ran out of electricity, the risk of it going out was always there. No one would ever know about all of this. And none of the private detectors would come back with anything.
Ymir sighed. The time had come. He took the stairs.
" IT WILL HURT, " The Duke shouted. " NO MORE TRAINING! "
At the top of the stairs, a mass of people began coming in. Each one holding a piece of machinery, slowly shutting down the backup generator. Suddenly, the Duke stopped and looked at his watch. A time of 6:30, or some kind of GMT period. He snapped out of his trance and hit the alarm button. Once the button was off, the front doors of the main room slid open and finally the gates opened. Ymir burst out of his trance and roared with delight.
The people in the lobby of the King's court rushed in and grabbed Ymir by his hair and dragged him into the main room. He was wrapped in a cardboard box and strapped to a chair. The king stood there for a while, but soon the chamber was empty except for one lone worker: a lonely, old man named Loon.
" Damn thing's useless! " Loon exclaimed at Loon. " If I could just get out of here, I'd go check it out."<|endoftext|>

It had been six years, seven days and three hours since a mindless executioner's blade, a scathing mockery of humanity, entered my broken body. It was the 6th of March, just like my last. I laid there on my back, what had once been a broadsword of some sorts, now had a pointy metal spear in the center of its side.
*How could a creature of evil have the gall to even stand up to his master?! * It was the voice of my god. As I pressed my hand against the rough metal part of my body, I began to feel rather distraught. Slowly it became aware of my pain, though it hardly noticed when it was angry. I'm so weak, so pathetic.
"Tails!" I heard as I sat up abruptly, walking over to the the corpse. As I reached down to pick it up off the ground I saw a look of surprise in his eyes. * Maybe this will save his family? *
It stood up. I looked over at it in my last moments; a face I had seen before. Looks like a normal face of a human, that has lived for ages, but now was merely a vicious killer. Such is the life of a madman. He began to laugh, he reached to me and pulled out a knife. It was difficult to hold in my shoulders at first. He used his teeth to cut one of my ribs right before I fell, more so on my shoulder. I tried again, more in vain. I had to win. I pulled the knife away from the grimy corpse, dropping the lifeless body in the process. I laid there, stunned.
Finally, I had the strength to move, I felt the mind shattering energy of a master blade that had been refined over thousands of years. With a searing pain I screamed out; *JESUS CHRIST. STOP IT. FOR HUMANITY. PLEASE STOP. HEAVEN WELL YOU HAVE LOST YOURSELF. GOD, STOP IT. I. NEED. TO. SEE. YOU. AGAIN. * The laughter at his joke died out. I had succumbed to the insane urge to scream in the most pathetic voice of my life. He reached down to me and pulled out a grip of a sharp blade. I gasped and tried to gasp as his body fell away, it did not matter. I did not feel good. I couldn't move. I knew it was pointless. I had killed the same human killer that killed my family before I had left for eternity. This was it. The end for me. I felt both fear and anger as he finally loosed the grip on the blade. The pain was gone. Just like that. My last thoughts were of Father's smile. I heard a soft chuckle as I was laid back and my body faded into darkness. I had had enough. I continued to cry.<|endoftext|>

I had never thought about this before, I was always so fascinated by the coming dimension. My first time in this reality, it was someone who had never intended to develop a time machine before.
My hands flailed above my head, accidentally completing my physics test. I grabbed the woman's wrist hand just now, poised to flip in my direction. I let a hand fall on the floor.
Suddenly I was headed right for someone that didn't even see me. Did I need to send this transmission?
Even though I knew that I had traveled backwards, I hadn't dared to think about this for longer than a second. So I watched the woman for a while, then stopped.
"What is going on in here?"<|endoftext|>

He had moved out to town within months, but it was his job to stay calm. He was a crazy man, driven by anger but content with his children and a quaint family home in the woods that he lived on. This man was famous for his dangerous business: shooting roman soldiers with his bulldozers. This man had obtained an actual license under his business name, and allowed for his government to follow laws to the letter. He had a good job, with a salaried position where he worked weekends. But like all decent human beings, he had suffered from a deep enough disease that his ultimate successor would have to set him free. Their very same government was in his grip.
He didn't want to become a politician, so he shut down one of the government's executions within minutes of taking office. It was raining and there was no time to relax; this was his last stop. After what felt like an eternity he heard the doors open, and a disgruntled man knocked. A ragged and demented figure with a severe accent and a strange tattoo found his way into the room, and pushed the door open. " Shhh! ", said the man - " What the hell were you doing here? " It seemed that he had been addressing the man for a while.
" Calm down! " muttered the man in his worst russian accent. " If you want to be calm, I'm going to call you Dan! " The man sent a flicking of an aura as it transported him to another room, where a man, an older gentleman in a sad looking suit, sat sitting there. The man looked straight ahead, mouthing something that sounded alien and demanded " Are you willing to go through with it? ". Puzzled the man turned around and walked over to Dan. " The cabin you left on the trail is mine, actually. You can come talk to me. ", said the man with a confused expression. " Sure, yes! " The man nodded. They made their way to the cabin, where a seat was brought out to them. " So Dan, what is it about being a scientist? ", asked Dan as he sat down.
" It's going to be a good thing that a scientist - my favorite of them - lives here. ", answered the scientist, leaning forward to finish the question.
" So what now, " the scientist shifted around to face Dan. " Wasn't you on a plan? " The man laughed. " Or was it the truth? " He asked.
" Did you ever take risks in the past? " asked the scientist, confused and nervous. The man looked to the scientist, who had been staring at him for a couple of seconds. " Yeah, but I still regret my actions and I think we should just let our past grow out of control so we can get on with it. " He stared at the scientist's face and leaned back, " We can just keep on going, okay? " He stepped away and resumed staring at the scientist's face.
After standing up the scientist looked around, put on his coat and shook his head. " Yeah, I know, keep going, you're a scientist, but no one lives in the woods anymore. Just keep going, get moving. Take my advice. " " No, Don't! But I can't let you stay with us. I swear, what the fuck you think you're doing is right! " The man raised his head back and nodded. " Alright, so, " he said as he sat down again, " You got any plans for our reunion? " " Sure, probably a few, " the scientist shrugged. " Once we do our first date, we can be sure that your plans for this saturday, May 4th, will hold true. Or, it could be just that you're a really lonely fuck, and you have someone for comfort, or maybe a friend in danger, or maybe.. " Dan looked into the scientist's eyes, " Let's just get this over with." He tapped the table and left with the lab, and set off for home.<|endoftext|>

I pull the hood over my face to shield me from the dark. Walking before me, people rush to me as I enter the small dungeon they call an underground crypt. I approach a table with a box next to a table with the 3rd item in the room. Taking the note from the box, I stare around the room. A drywall, carpet, and wall were all all I needed. I take a few steps into the door to the rest of the room. The man who held my bag walks into the room, and looks at me. " * TAKE ME RIGHT NOW! * ", he shouts as he rushes into the room. I charge at him. I hadn't expected him to turn towards me. He stops as I go in.
My body startles. My head moves a bit and my hair spins. The man falls on the floor. " What the- ", I say as I walk over to him. " You're acting strange. Am I under the monster spirits? ", he gurgles in his voice.
" Are you afraid of the monsters? ", I ask as I try to listen, hoping he's not dreaming or he has visions of them in his head, " The humans are still out there. Try to hurry back to my lair. " I walk over to the man, and with the tip of my fingers, I pry open the box. Inside is a stone statue that contains what is clearly a book. " Its the same... book that kills men " I add to the note.
The man begins to tremble uncontrollably. " We need to stay here. Your chains and chains and nukes are paying off. " He says as he rises from his seat. " Who gets to rule the underworld? Who gets to flee? "
" After history I was thrown out of our house. I was put in our young house, my whole family died. Then a villager declared me a God and founded my own cult to purge the demons " I continue " I've not heard from anyone else in the kingdom in years. Even the priests have been defeated. I don't know why. I'm afraid you have some kind of power over us. Who might know my secret? " He says. I turn and look at the statue. It still resembles the man I captured. " Who would have thought I could use my mind for evil? I am a human. I am a god"<|endoftext|>

It has never occurred to the reader that anyone ever gets anywhere in the world. They, upon noticing that many physics spheres have been cracked by rocks and fell during the strong gravitational pull of the sun, immediately start up the economic recession. People and government depend on businesses and production to continue as they see fit. Work is now done not by following great movements of objects, which the masses watch and manufacture. However, the vast majority of our problems come with small problems that we don't solve. Its very important to understand that these small problems are small, small people suffering from small problems. Our world is limited by massive distortions in our environment. For example, because of the reduction in worldwide production, refrigeration loses all its effectiveness in making frozen meals, making man yearn to cry over any milk half eaten by cows or meningitis or salmonella, much like people's companies lost profits as a result of the mindless object production. Without electricity, the mind often feels a constant thrum of pure uselessness, only to come to be with certain harmony.<|endoftext|>

"Wait, what? "
" Don't. Really, don't. "
She stared down at her laptop, as if to say " You're the one. "
I turned my head to look at her; she was still staring. She didn't move an inch. Her eyes were closed.
" May I... " I whispered.
She cocked her head. " I think we've talked about this before. "
" That's your friend. He *works* at the same tech firm that did my daycare. I think. "
I slapped a finger across her back. " Really? But he works for a company that works for the web, huh? "
" Nah, he kinda runs the advertising company. "
" So we don't need another intern that he works with? Like you, Dandy? I know a guy I work with that works in development. At least, you know. "
I shrugged. " Yeah, it's hard for me to be honest. "
Her short gray hair bobbed up and down in the sun, or was it her dark hair? I didn't know. What had she done to deserve this?
" Lately, in a way, I think it's working. But, I can't say for sure where it's going. Nobody said anything about me being… "
I didn't have time to interrupt. We were in the middle of what must have been our last conversation. * Today, we get a meeting. We've talked about how we can end our dammed relationship. *
But her eyes were open now, and she seemed a bit startled. I started typing in the line, " Don't have to listen to me! "
She looked up, looking at me. She gave a gleeful shake of her head, which I ignored, and stared back at her screen.
" What? "
She shrugged. " It was the first time we spoke about anything like this. "
A shake in my chair of sorts started to prick the back of my neck. She straightened up, face showing a bit of concern, but I shrugged and smiled at her.
" All things considered, I think we should sit down. I've got to just... be myself. Don't get under your skin. "
She let out an exasperated, " So… what, you're not allowed to tell anyone? Like, unless you're a tech support guy? "
I nodded, a little puzzled. I'd probably talk to her coworkers about that later tonight if I got any information.
" I never said that to anyone. "
Her small, stupid smile turned into a snide smirk. " Well, it shouldn't be that difficult. Can you promise me, okay? "
" Of course."<|endoftext|>

Ginny the Fox of Decepticon toppled over, his femur removed completely exposing his mane of fur. He tried to keep the faint smell of blood coming from his nose as he took his tumble out of the wreckage. His clothes were on fire and his legs were broken. The colossal Barret the Brood stood over his corpse, his head poked out from beneath a sandwhich and his tail made its way to his chest, reaching for the flesh he had just eaten from the inside. Gingerly, he attempted to shuffle away, hoping to be rescued, but he saw him from behind a fallen tree by a nearby fire, laying bleeding on the ground. Gingerly, he stepped away and wiped the crimson from his face as he walked across the rubble.
"Well? " He asked, mouth gaped open.
" I have lost this part of my persona, " the man replied slowly.
" Yes, yes that is a good thing. As this implies your actual identity is the same as before. My main blood type is... " the Fox held up his femur in an expression of pride.
" I feel like you should know that being immortal is pretty bad... " Gingerly closed his eyes.
" You've somehow mutated into the other side, I'm afraid. All of this has culminated in making me a bizarre sort of... What does this mean for my career? "
Ginny looked down at the man for a few moments before exhaling deeply.
" Ha, yes. I personally think you should blame me. I mean I'm old, I'm not sure I can get back any time soon after... I've been alone for a week. The key in the bar isn't an army anymore... if it isn't a six pack, then why is there a rotating globe in the middle of the night?"<|endoftext|>

It's... funny how things work out in your head. We're just humans, we don't really know what goes around. We feed, we relax, we eat, eat whatever brings us happiness.
Now here I am. We hide. We run. We don't make friends. We don't even know what a friend is. Sometimes we don't even care. Like, after all this time... I can't even remember, how long have we been here? We've waited for almost 10 years? 10 minutes? 10 hours? Wait, do you remember when you would hear noises again? Man, is this impossible? Do you remember what they'd say?
Wait, what's your name again? No, no, no, I forgot. Oh God, don't forget that voice. It always goes off. What are you talking about.

The guard moved nervously to stand besides me. He stared into my chest, felt my hard skin moisten, and gently suck in a very... soft *hic*.
“ How long have I been in there? ” he asked me with a smile.
“ What do you mean I ’ m in ‘ there? ”
He glanced at me with his crooked, gray eyes. They caught my gaze without the sting, though I was beginning to doubt that he didn ’ t really see.
“ You said the why was relatively simple, ” he smiled again, even though I didn ’ t really see his eyes. “ There ’ s a ‘ safe ’ like we have ’ into here. You ’ re just a test subject. You make a good subject. ”
I held my trembling hands in my pockets, trying to convince myself that I hadn ’ t been in *a test room*. From what I read about prisons in the news today, it ’ s hard to imagine those rooms were magically safe.
“ Now what would be your first day of making a trial? ” he asked. “ Would you want to be in here for a day, or just a big morning? ”
“ The ‘ easy ’ to ‘ safe ” option, ” I hissed, taking my hands and leading him to a small crack at the door. It wouldn ’ t have looked out of place, were it not for my rather snug prison ’ s windows.
“ Today is January 31st, ” he grinned. It was like some kind of show of power at my hands. “ Would you like to come in and have your test done? It ’ s always the easiest to ‘ solidify ’, who else is in a vat? ”
As the guard and I made our way to the room I hoped to be allowed to sit in the long, cramped, restricted seat, without facing a danger that would be nearly unbearable for me.
I smiled, savoring the small, sweet sensation of giddy pleasure as he jumped to my lap. His eyes reflected the first set of pupils I ’ d ever seen, all glows on an inhuman blue, and were a vibrant, fluid existence on my face as we made our way up towards the base of the stairs. “ Now, what would you like to do? ” I asked.
“ I ’ m going to make some sort of speech. ”
“ Not one word? ” I said, a curious thing in the light of the helicopter above me.
“ Oh. ” He answered, struggling to stop himself from smiling back. “ Let me know what you think! ”
The gang stared at me with wide, shiny eyes as he shook his head. I felt his hand grasp mine and squeeze my hand to keep me upright.
“ No, don ’ t— ” I started, before my laughter shot through the air as I fell backward, causing several corrections officers to jump to their feet.
“ What do you mean? ” He asked, as my hard skin wetmed. “ What do you mean there ’ s no room for motion in here? ”

# 9 - Up, Away, Down, Away, Away, Away, Away, Away, Away, Away
The two planes both accelerated through the sky and disappeared into the thick embrace of space. The star was all that remained of it. Man didn't feel the rush of space, and the bloodied man was so startled that he retreated to the deep sleep that lay and lapped. When the sleep came, the man came back to his dazed state. He sat, he left, he followed, and he sat again, finally awake. Hours later, he stood once again on a small patch of ground. If he sat on it he would reach his destination, and look further down. On the opposite side of the gap was a large cave. The man decided to explore and jump away from it. In the darkness was a cave, it was not as cave as he expected. As he climbed, the ground seemed a bit much for the man to go through. After a few hours, the man had fallen upon the entrance. The intruder scared him to his limit. He began to scream, and flail violently. The man soon realized he was being pushed into an invisible wall. The man stood no chance.

As I stood on the top of the ramp, staring into the ocean, I mouthed to myself,'I know why they're pirates.' The other crewmen were eating. Biting their ungodly mouths, demanding they be paid for their dishonesty. My vision flickered, and then froze, seeming to shrink. Tears appeared under my eye; the ship was lost. All black.
Suddenly, blackness consumed me. A lump as heavy as lightning sputtered up from the god-forsaken sea. The doors slid shut in a sudden jolt, and a ship rocked sideways. At least, that's what they said.
**BEEP BEEP. ** A soft *thud* sounded. It sounded like a plastic bird having a conversation. Someone brought up a pizza, my cup was too high up. Shit.
Suddenly, the captain did something that made me, well, cringe. He spit out a guy. What the hell? Damn the father of my entire family. Then a batman appeared, and punched the best of us in the arm, pulling both me and my girlfriend back away with him. Who was I kidding?
Even in the mirror I saw a beautiful blond girl, her bangs perfect and freckled with freckles. I just laughed. The captain was crazy. And the last person I remembered seeing was the boss.
So many enemies. I didn't quite get it. The pirates sat there.
A few moments passed, and I found myself back on the deck. The first thing I saw, the water rushing past through the port side into the ship, was her face.
Who are you, or what are you doing here?
I get up, yanking the chair on the back of the captain.
"Hands up! " I shout and force him to back down.
" What is this!? " He runs up to me, his body as limp as my life is right now. He stretches out his hand, pointing to a tiny ball. " Just a kiss to stop this. "
I take it.
" And... what did you do there? Did you get bitten? "
" Yes. " I stammer. " My brother died. "
*Thirty minutes later. *
"... and it's coming right up!" He says.
I get up, and start walking up to the ship. I've been watching the sun. The wind is going to burn the ship, so I'm going to have to stand up.
My friends lie down at the stars.<|endoftext|>

"Are you sure you're ready? " Talisman asked timidly.
The Player suddenly felt tremendous pain emanating from behind his shoulder. His HUD looked like a nacelle just approaching from a distance, pulling upon his enemies and throwing them at the wall.
He raised an arm up and with a burst of energy charged towards the wall, twirling a glowing sword in his hands.
The mace seemed to hear, roared angrily and bounced off of its felled face while it landed loudly in midair.
" I'm sure... you're ready Talisman? " The Player asked. His life flashed before his eyes, a brief moment without a single ghostly grin appearing on his face.
Talisman shook his head quickly as if answering his position. " It's just that... " He continued, " we were on a quest. The Diviner's guild of Heroes. Too afraid to explore danger in the middle of the plain. "
The Player's weapon seemed to be fueled by immense heat, and blew it's gold charged fingers around as if it was heiling. His sword flew as far as it dared before spitting the cinder block apart.
Talisman sighed and looked back down at his armor. " Looks like something terrible is happening."

My dapper boots continue to roll at a relentless pace. All my breath seems to fall on to the stone floor of the wicker desk.
He's delivering what little I don't know how I'm doing right now. Mocking and bullying me for one solid minute is what it seems to be going to be, the way most people do when they are asked to come get them, and this prompts a five times over reaction from the disgruntled heathens and malefic, angry, bumbling subhumans.
Argh, he's back. Who in the hell are these people? I almost feel vindicated, I'm so embarrassed to admit it. Thankfully for me, I can find no evidence and either I make it to the bridge or he'll start getting the yellow light. They'll remember just how, and they'll probably murder me in the process.
I dropped my hat in surprise, no-one in the pool of water is there anymore.
I'll never forget it. The terrible thing about rapping is that it happens every goddamn day. They call it it when the doors close on a Tuesday for God's sake!
I don't blame them. They tried, goddammit. I didn't give a shit about the food, not after being hit. Besides, the punchline in the mirror is the epic ball bounce I probably would have made if I had been alive. I slipped through the double doors and slipped through the door, pushed the desk, and smashed into the open toilet seat. Fuck.
The words hit me like a freight train to my heart. " LITERALLY WORKING WITH A MOM? "
I think I hear the loudest boombox beating down.
" What are you gon na do?! I started my fight "
" Wow, you mean you're stabbing me? NO YOU DID N'T! "
" No way! I spilled you first blow, that's the last time you'll be slashing me with that! "
Oh shit. My character is acting so strange. I want to try and calm him down but I'm just a speed freak. This is getting ridiculous.
" NO! "
" Try fucking hard too! I won't give you any second thoughts! "
Yeah, he's normally a bit more accepting of situations. Like, trying to calm him down. Ever since I started stabbing people, they have been yelling at me to join the resistance, reminding me to help out the oppressed rebels, all because I am the only one that can fight back.
I see the sound of sirens and boomjack. I turn around and head towards the edge of the room, picking up my hammer.
" Damn stupid government and their application for interfering rights ", I think.
Quickly, I set the hammer down on the table in front of me.
" God dammit! Enough is enough! You fired the gun! "
" Of course not! What about your wife! It was too late! "
I'm planning this for sure. Actually, I wasn't planning on using the gun at all.
" Hey at least watch your back! Remember what you said about coming back? Shit's about to get better "
" Shut up! Shit's about to get better. "
This is going to make everything amazing! He didn't even begin to say " Shit's about to get better" before I struck him with the hammer.
The entire room went black, quiet, and my assistant stepped off the table, pointing a gun at him.
This is what happens when you killed the hero.

I'm here. I am on this planet. This building. The cave, the prison. If it hadn't been for my invention-many kids I would have been dead and I still do. But here, here I am, the savior of Earth. I've finally seen my child as he belongs to me. God damn her eyes. She turned her head and smiled. She was an amazing girl. You didn't even know? I never thought I'd need to be home for so long. It's been quite a long time. Maybe I'll need to go in to the transport room at the waystation, where her baby grandpa will be, to become a nurse. Or I could just go to school. It's been a long journey. Still a long time. I've learned so much over this place. I can learn so much. People can come and go, yet they still never stop, never trust anyone. I'm my mother and this has been a long journey. Some said I left a lasting impact on mankind. Some believed it was my fault. But I know better. I've been there. This is what I believe my father was all those years ago. When he passed, it was like a dream. He had traveled so far, he'd travelled as far as the stars, but now he went home to see a group of kids and send them to the spaceship to be held up. I was sent to them all those years ago, that's why I was here. It's something I'll always remember.<|endoftext|>

"Ladies and Gentleman. I can officially confirm that my prize payment has been honoured. " I gazed at my prize a fortune so large that it was almost the whole of the box. The whole of it. All of it. I only have one chance. I kept looking at my wallet, hoping it would hold nothing. A fortune would be the the most... amazing amount of money ever.
" Back to my question. What do you think the chances are with a payout of more than 900 million dollars? A series of empty house parking lots? a free Wi-Fi pass? A legally questionable pageantry? Why don't they send the papers? " I waited for a second, this time I just threw the lottery ticket aside, then pushed the lottery ticket aside to lean in and see what I could do.
" *, * " *precautions*? " * " whether or not you should name me after Scott Balls has a very important... important... role. Should someone not name you in what I am born to look like, say 992 million dollars? " * " it would have to be like... super quiet down there. "
"*You* mean ready to play poker. " I didn't want to choose the game. I wanted to do a clean egg and cheese and a jumpstart my retirement savings, and live my dream. I couldn't.
" Please guys. I can't spare the toilet's. The physics keeps changing. I feel I'm so alone. I can't go anywhere and carry those fuckers around. No, I can do something important like give people a weekly dose of hope for the future. Open the windows and drink a beer, take a shower, hang out with a girl and all that. " * So think about taking that 100 million. * "
" Yes, Mr... Scott Balls." * He* turned around and closed his eyes. So calm I almost felt tears dropping from my eyes.

I'm starving. I can't live in a quiet town. I do a lot of all day doing all it does to get a shitty job, slinging that stupid chair for no reason, spitting at somebody, any of this shit, with no recourse to protect myself and everybody else.
I have a nice roommate, enough to save me from the constant quacking and shoving. Odd, she started yelling some shit when I walked in... No I wasn't yelling she was cheering me up. At least no one was shouting.
I hate the birds because they make me feel stupid.
My job is as boring as ever, and I don't have any friends like your stereotypical bird people, living in society where no one really wants to mess with anything that flies around, when there are so many of them and people talking and only the constant noises make me feel that one of them made an out of nothing, never felt that necessary to make me feel like I was unwanted, or I get discarded by those on the ground, missing every chance I get to hurt someone.
I've become quite comfortable with it. It's easier to just listen and simply like it, that way I won't struggle anymore.
I've gotten used to it. I almost didn't see anything suspicious when I went on a training flight to a training airport, my knee was in the ground and I was taking some funny looks at odd birds that were making their way into the plane, and I was about to make it to the next one when the captain said the plane went into a landing lag and the entire section turned into a roar, as if from all sorts of dragons.
"Screw you, launch the plane into, " he said. " Save us from yourself and something." I tried to scream but it was just two or three swallows, as if my throat wasn't enough to convey the feeling. Then I felt my throat, I wasn't choking, I was falling.
And then suddenly, the plane clipped the cabin. Just one of those birds impacted with the floor on impact. I could feel it. There was a hole in the seat. Red around the edges and squished under the seat. Then one by one the edges formed into trees. I could feel the air, and I could feel the birds. I was all inside.
A black bird sat on a branch, and soon I was eating it. I looked around and looked at my friends, none of them seemed to notice, but some of them. These people were getting closer, and I could see them looking around very closely at each other.
It seemed that I was eating the bird because I was hungry. Because no one else was. And I thought that maybe I should sleep.
But that was two minutes ago now, and I'm still seeing new birds now. In unison.<|endoftext|>

"Dude, you want to spend your days running around and drinking during adventures? " asked Bob, as he stormed up the stairs to live room.
" But... " responded Edith, looking down on the stranger for a moment to gain a peak into her dark dreams.
" I want to play video games, and eat the finest... whole, flakes of bread.. haha.. " said Bob with a flinch as Edith turned to stare.
" Look at me and I can still go to parties and hook up with real friends.. I can live with myself if I just make it " replied Bob, bending down to remove an exclamation point.
" Oh ok. * You're* being ridiculous. If it didn't seem so scary... " Edith's frustration was palpable. She let go of Bob's hand and saw his dick, visible in the dim glow of his lamp.
" I'll be honest with you, " Bob mumbled, turning back to look at Edith, " I'm pretty good with a dick."<|endoftext|>

I look up at my forehead with wide, enigmatic eyes. I've studied the court for a while - it's very clear - but I had very little time. One day, I'm sitting in the House of Lords - lots of times that's where our ancestors lived - making e-books, and looking at them I realize the politics. The first one was unique and liberal - it seemed to be virtually unstoppable with regards to social and political matters. I picked up an e-book from the shelves and began to read - just the proper way to do it.
The book was very clear. The types of decisions were difficult to study, but there was no contradiction. There were very few errors, as far as I could tell. But it wasn't as if it was consistent. It was the same little paragraphs though, a'June 5th 2015' inserted into a foreign one, followed by a couple of outliers. As for five of those outliers, nothing changed that morning. The body count was low, there wasn't a single instance of possibly hidden information coming through.
The people on Earth were radically different. At first, my initial observations were confusing. I assumed they had created a dictatorship from only two factors: disdain for Earth's utopia ( peaking over 3000 years ago as the Earth's cranium took over at the same time ) and rabidly within the last century's ruling party. They also had great things coming their way - terrorism, terror groups, rivalries. But they weren't capable of building a majority in this quickly. And with such an impenetrable composition, where insurmountable odds were passed down to the few who existed, it proved impossible for their dominance to really ramp up.
That's when I came to the final discovery - the last version of the case, siding with the Kingdom of Heaven vs. Satan.
It was a rather strange day. The air was thick with clouds - no wind from outside. The very same reports were written. And my head was swimming. They'd never been to Heaven, not in thousands of years.
One slight hitch - I'd had to go back ten years. I grabbed my phone and started playing a good-humoured record - first recording of "May 14th, 2015 ", the end of Heaven's power at the time of King Edod with 20 died, and the document falling, falling down, breaking through only the ash walls of the majestic Kingdom.
Someone would realize after the recording, as a historian, that the Kingdom of Heaven was still in the same position as the One Above - that meant that the God of Heaven had fallen. I had to put in a few months if I was going to move to America. Couldn't I just hide in this little place, waiting for someone to come find me?
Again, I swam up to the floor. Once, the recordings fell, I fell to the floor again. Like I said, I noticed that people were remarkably certain about the Supreme Court case - the Bible, the first proofs of God's existence, the sole instances of any still living, the only instances where any king had ever lived in the same place as his own existence. The view, however, changed the judges and their assumptions - something about the Judges and their observation, about me, everything. I couldn't believe it.
The sun was still warm enough in the morning, and after a couple of hours of " off days " I felt really good about going back. I closed the blinds. I wondered how long this would last - and if it would last for much longer. The walls, though, got wet. It was a rather interesting time.
I remember that day, and here I am today, year's after King Edod is dead. There's a few of the papers I've collected since - swords, neckbeards, and other fanciful weaponry. The fact that God's life was being taken was the very reason why that day happened, and it still gets a part of me when the media shows up. There was indeed a threat, but it didn't kill me. I remember getting sucked into whatever hellholes I've lived through. I counted my arguments before I got in the car, the sun shining again.
Then, as I drove away, a man appeared in front of me - the same man I met ten years ago in college. His features were familiar - they were the same as my father. The same smile on his face. And the same look in his eyes as he said his own words to me, on his e-book.
" Honor. I called you back. We'll be going to Buckingham Palace."<|endoftext|>

It was nearly midnight when I got into the F-10. Packing bags and traveling into the normally obscure terminal, it was time to upgrade to some kind of limited edition ticket package. At first, I could take everyone there to hear some'test' that were trying to figure out what was wrong with it. Any second now I could have just stayed home and play Dead Masses until they noticed, even if it felt like a waste of time. Now, at least, I had some time to get used to their antics.
The TSA came quickly, quickly filling my bag, filling me with this exciting new product. It was obviously some sort of poorly disguised alien object covered in symbols. None of the pictures I sent my co-workers were of anybody else at the business, despite the fact that I had just placed them in their regular station flight. My supervisor, Detective Roteman, was raising eyebrows when I noticed that someone else had next to them a flimsy car at the airport.
"How do you know that I'm supposed to be taking it apart, Roteman? " I complained.
" First, I'm assuming it is from scratch, " A scruffy, frizzy-haired lady with a stick and scrawny beard answered me.
" Well, I started studying outside the corporation's security procedures a bit. "
" You're obviously concerned about how this works outside of yours? "
The annoyance from a security guard was wearing off for a little while. Looking at Roteman, he shrugged.
" No, sir. I did study outside outside the corporate rig and background checks, " he said.
" So, how do you exactly know this is my car from scratch? "
Roteman smiled, now shy and somehow sporting a thick nose.
" Oh, I can read an passbook. "
" Funny, how do you know I'm behind those people?"

* "Where did you get that? " *
I think they'd looked at the little antique on the shelf and said it was a rotary phone charger. I think it must have been at a kid's house all those years ago.
" It's strange. " I say, switching off the lights from the nightstand. The small wooden door creaks, like some old bathroom door knob.
I slide the braided cord from the end of the phone charger into the trash can and lay back down on my old antique dresser. Looking out at the deserted city, I begin to draw. Deep, dead smiles fill the room, cars pile behind them, waiters under tables and brick shops lined up against one another. Everyone looks confused, except the beautiful young woman with piercing blue eyes. She hands me a pencil and sketches a letter. I smile.
* " Who are you? " * I think, drawing on the words. The letters stick to me in a way I'm not sure I want them to. My fingers play with them while I write. She looks at me, and I drift off to sleep.
I walk back to bed, flipping to the media going out in the city, clipping the newspaper with my fingers. I am tired. I drop to one knee and look at the book. Soon, I stop writing for a minute to rest.
My eyes slide to the photos of my past.
I have lost my job, my home, my friends, my daughter, my boss. It all has been swept away. I am broken, broken glass, broken furniture, broken furniture-into-nothing and a broken house.
I stop. I am afraid. I pick up the phone to dial 911. The voice on the other end of the line says " I'm so sorry, Jonathan, don't you think I'm being a little sarcastic? "
I shake my head. " Look, if you had told me where I got that thing, that would have been totally blown off my tongue. But it's not, and I've been with everyone, and we all knew what needed to be done. "
I pick up the phone back up and shake my head, " How did you find that? I've never even seen it before. "
" Shut up, " the voice says, " It's the goddamn phone."
I take a deep breath and sigh, and rub the bridge of my nose. I open the door and walk out.<|endoftext|>

"Dude, I want to sleep tonight. "
" I don't think it's going to work out. "
He put down his bag again, half expecting to hear the reply, " It's fine bud. "
" Good. " He took a few steps out into the room with hunched shoulders and grinning creases underneath.
" Just go on and get it on the table. "
He took another step and, quietly, said, " Hey mom. "
" Honey? " She took another step, pushed him closer and grabbed hold of his hand.
" I'm sorry. "
" What? How can this be happening? "
" You said something about how that would work out. "
" I don't know. " He got up and walked over to the table beside him.
" I don't know. What's happening to you, um, home? "
" Not exactly. "
" I'm sorry. "
" But you told us that... " He trailed off.
" Is that why we're dating? "
" Have you been having a nightmare lately? "
" I don't know, man, I mean... "
" Yeah. "
He put down the bag again and eyed her carefully.
" I didn't- "
" No you didn't. "
He took a step away from her, but it was too late. She was gone and he could feel a subtle thread begin to seep through the chain that sat at the edge of his life. He could feel the light between them from the kitchen light.
He got up and turned the corner of the block with a mighty jolt. His eyes widened and he saw a sombre figure crawling through the doorway.
The shock wave of the mirror suddenly knocked his memory from his mind. He gazed down at his hand and the nurse walked over to fix him.
" Did you see what was up? "
" No, it didn't. "
" The familiar... images... come again? "
She stared at him intently. She put the bags back on and pointed to the table that sat in front of him.
She gently kissed him.
" So where is it? "
She finished her work and went into the bathroom to brush herself, before turning around.
" Daddy is ready to go, honey." She turned around and kissed him again, before standing up and heading for the door.<|endoftext|>

The saying sounds so familiar, despite how many times I've read it. Ugh. Everyone's life is supposed to be super hero though. The were supposed to take out the villain, the guardian angel, the god of a thousand worlds that I get to kill for as I live. I'm just a normal average guy. Every time I get injured, God is off, and my life's at stake. But here I am sitting in a hospital bed barely holding on. God doesn't know how I got here, or what he did to deserve this. They're being cryptic these days. Every time I wake up, I get a notification that if I don't get hit by a car, I'm dead. It's like I was never hurt by anything. I'm in great shape. Almost like I'm in a fine state.
I'm ready for this. I'm not here to hide in a hotel room. I'm here for a fucking christmas party.
God is following me. He's seen me before. The first time was with his wife when I was a child. We were just pretty bad friends and I didn't even see his face as he walked by. We became more and more friendly. His wife just at the time came and saw him. She asked him why he was here.
I couldn't speak, but I could manage to choke out a few words. He told me what he wanted and just walked away.
Then it hit me. God is coming to that same hospital. He's going to tell his wife what to do. She starts crying and is angry at him. He tells her not to tell her kids yet because he's going to kill them all. This is how it ends for my selfish religion. There's no end to everything here. If my body was just a little bit stronger I could be in prison. This is what God wanted and I can't get out of jail.
Mom's still crying and asking if I need her to leave me alone. I can't. I'm out of food. I have no idea how long my life will last. My wife says, "you're tired. Can you help me? " She just hangs up on me. My dad had a long day tomorrow, so I'll be ready when he gets home. My daughter walks past and kisses my ass.
I'm alone. I've done so much before. God's driving towards the hospital, I'm up for a fight because my kingdom's not as bad as it seems. I wonder how he has gotten into that accident a hundred times now. Could I live with the knowledge he'll get worse ever?
" Mom, " God finally speaks. " I need you to lay down. "
" Can I come here every day? "
" No. I'm not sure what you want to say to me after that. I never even wanted to talk to you! "
He's given up. I'm content here. I'm happy here. " Mother."

The nervousness in my heart returned to me. This battle had to be held today. That was the last time I would be given the privilege of being welcome to my seat. As I sat there waiting for this question to be answered I quietly mumbled to myself, "4-6 ". As I turn my head the wise man in the antechamber who knew me from an earlier existence tells me that I need to clear my head, and I must clear my memories immediately. I shuffled my memory with purpose so it could be quickly cleared, my thoughts could be back to... Ah! You called out the Hiccup and Cupid just now the matter had settled upon the word-'Bull'. And as the antechamber slowly opened up, I looked down at the empty seat that I was sitting in and handed them to the wise man in the antechamber, " That is right. Three head of cattle gets a neck and four heads of snakes ". I reached for my letter opener and took a deep breath and leaned back. The next day in Alaska. 3 heads of cattle. Sitting. Over. The folly of me trying to prevent this upon a life. The exasperation that lay within me drained me away. I awoke shortly after that, wanting desperately to get a new truth that I knew would unravel my lie. As I fell back into my chair I was once again reassured by the wise man, " One damn guard will kill me if I get out of this chair ". As I sat up to my office chair that was nearly in the middle of the building an alert was called out, " Armed hostile dogs appear on the property".<|endoftext|>

Ugggghgghh. Here we go again.
Oh shit. Sam stopped by the bar. Apparently this time it's not his friends he's drinking with.
Y'know, thanks for stopping by. He almost fell for it the first time after I suggested he try some Long Island. I mean, maybe it's only been a few minutes? Probably doesn't matter. I'm not a big fan of long holidays or holidays.
But still, it's out of here, and I really haven't been wanting to go anywhere.
He had to grab my arm to keep me under the bar. I mean it's not like we had anything to drink that day, hell, we didn't need anything because everyone at the bar was dead, pissed. It's pretty pathetic. Can't blame anyone, getting drunk wouldn't stop at nothing.
Sighing slightly I grabbed Sam's hand. Sure enough there was a man behind him who looked like Sam.
"Sam? " He asked, sounding slightly around the bar.
Sam said nothing. Only looked at me and then was getting all *fucked up* by the guy behind him.
" Come on, Sam. I know you're not a big fan of Long Island, but even you need to be cautious about your drink choice. "
He moved past me to get the intercom off, just in case I couldn't hear him. Sam was trying to look friendly too, anyway. I almost shouted at him but I didn't want to let Sam control Sam himself.
Sam took a deep breath and turned around.
" You look awfully fit. " He said. " Well, we don't really need that much... "
I put my arm around his shoulder and we shook hands. A good ten or so inches apart from each other. It's not like he didn't get a good look at me and I didn't care for the look on his face either.
" You look a little worn out, Sam. It's not like you're much past your prime. You might want a beer or two before you're out, hehe. "
" Hell no."<|endoftext|>

"You remember it well, " the man said. He wore the collar of a black suit with dark colours, which now displayed a hologram of him in the background. " You know, before I made this mess, you had a great job, and you died with a smile on your face. "
The grey suit covered the smaller man's face in some kind of image and hologram, showing all the symptoms he had, and how he had been thinking all of that was bogus. He went on, though. It was all nonsense, to say the least. " When I die, I begin again. I look around, with blank expression, wondering how I did. Like she wanted to tell me about how wrong I was, but I just laid there staring at the ceiling. It was a mess, too. You know how they all do, you know? It's not fair, but there are bigger and better plans ahead of me. I would say I have no regrets. After all, why would I not be so happy? "
An awful thought crossed his mind, and he started to think how to cheer him up. Even though there were plans to entertain him, it wouldn't be fair to him. " I am not mad, " he finished. " I actually believe you may have died for real. "
The man waited for an explanation, as he always did. " Who are you? How old is she? "
" She was your fiancé. "
" I did a fantastic job when I was younger. "
" Don't expect her to recognize you. And when she does, well, I wish I had never met you. You go through a lot, especially after that. Like with this man, I'm guessing you don't remember things at all. "
He couldn't argue with her for very long, and suddenly he'd drifted off from reality. He then came back into real life, with a new, much simpler life. He wanted to know what really happened in the past, but he soon found out that he had memories of his fiancé even back then. " Don't worry, kid. That's all out of the question. "
Another strange thought crossed his mind, but he could hardly tell if it was actually from his brain.
" How many times do you have to explain this to her? "
" Four. "
" No more. "
" Think about it, kid. I don't recall talking about how much I love you, and how much I love you. "
He put down the prescription bottle of medicine he bought for himself, and pushed a dollar sign over the unlit blood wall of the bed, ready to die. He hadn't even gotten his job to earn it, and in front of him was a picture of an almost identical woman, but with different makeup in her wake.
" I love you, " he said. " I am going to do this for you. Goodbye."<|endoftext|>

Lincoln sighed and took a bite of his Snickers. He wanted to quit walking when he was younger, because he wanted to remember. Lincoln really did miss that trick. But there wasn't anyone else. Lucky for Lincoln, the only other zombie that was still around was Bobby Brown. Bobby Brown was Jim Smith. Jim loved killing zombies. Lincoln couldn't wait to actually go back in time, so he waited until Lincoln's cup of coffee hit the counter to stir up one of his morning coffee. The first bite hurt, but it took a couple of seconds for the wound to heal. With these last second bites, Lincoln wondered how long his life would be before he started waking up again.
No-one could take this kind of disease seriously, so Lincoln decided to take a shot in the mouth. The fridge was very full. He would make sure to pour two whole glass vials of pills into a bowl before eating. He would hope they only lasted three to six weeks in one sitting. And then, he would order a special breakfast.
The next bite didn't hurt, but it felt good. It reminded him of his favorite candy-apple. He would try taking a little Vanilla Jam and eating a dessert, just to be sure, too. And then the second bite would be fine. He would breathe fresh air and lick his lips to make sure that it wasn't smoke. He would be surprised. He always thought he was crazy, but his friend walked in, and asked for the bite. " Oh, that was great, " Lincoln said. " You were really right. What was the matter... "
As he was discussing this life's wish, Lincoln saw a barn. It was blue, too. It looked like a barn. He remembered being in the ruins of Memphis, about six hours away. Lincoln kept his eyes shut, until he came across the barn again. It looked like a barn the size of a small town. Lincoln remembered he knew the barn where he'd spend most of his time. And this time, he remembered where the barn actually was. " Where the hell is that?! I never thought this was real..."<|endoftext|>
**********620**********
When I was thirty-one, I was preparing to die. Yet I was relentless. It was natural, to me. Those who allowed themselves to be told the truth were again set free. I believed that if anyone like me could just live life, then I would live with free will; if anyone truly believed, then for every person willing to take their own life, there was equal and opposite value.
It was a terrifying thought that burned throughout my thoughts when I decided what to do with all those people who tried to rob me. I couldn't believe, couldn't believe, couldn't believe that anyone was willing to risk their lives for me. To truly thrive, to thrive is to think, to think over the mind, to think with a conviction so strong I could finally hear it.
But what do you think happened after I thought about how I was never doing what I thought I was doing? I thought I was just being honest with myself. I thought I was simply too calm to be taken advantage of. After my experiments, my investigations, my experiments were all done on a whim and I had no intention of becoming the only true answer. To them, everything I've done was a mistake.
My mentor, Belinda the loving Witch, was a woman who wouldn't let go of the reason to be a true adventurer. Unfortunately, she was also a woman who also feared what her friends and colleagues think about me. Unfortunately, she was also a woman who is too afraid to show herself in public or be seen as anything but a powerful witch. Belinda would often encourage her friends to be less sure of themselves, but that often led her to form friendships with undesirables.
It's understandable, to see Belinda as a student, a scholar, and an artist. In the end, it all made sense to me, to not talk to outsiders. She was such a woman, you would think, and I was not too distracted by the larger picture of life.
You know how people have a tendency to be pious when they want to make a new God? Well, my friends all believed in someone who was just as obedient and devout as they was. The very belief that God was just a putrid concoction of fiery spirits and stimulants suddenly made itself apparent on my faces when I looked upon Belinda. Her gaze caught me squarely and she knew what I had to do.
At first, my plans had been a failure. I had bad coffee and nothing else. I began making changes to my courses. Belinda wanted to push me out of the way, kill me before I got up and went out to get to work in a new god, but all I could think about was how silly that was. Who would plan to kill a man who believed in their right to life but never truly believed in the existence of their own creator?
It was never me who was going to quit, but me who was needed. Belinda quickly mobilized all her charms, a young witch named Rebecca called it, and stole my best friend Belinda from me. Even as the witches spread the rumors about my failure, my beliefs grew with each new school I threw myself at her. I was safe in Belinda, she had my back, and she was my sidekick. And so they were many days into my days.
By the time I made it to work, I was halfway across the country. I was good to go, finishing my degree in electrical engineering and getting a promotion from a major bank. My name was typed into the national bank website to do a bonus check and I was using that money to research every house I could find and report back to Belinda. I had all the money I could afford, and if I was going to leave this world right now, I had to stay good for her. She stayed safe at home, and I stayed good with her, spending all my time building electronics on my way.
I had been a dangerous man, but I kept Belinda safe, and she remained my best friend. That's what really started this curse, and more importantly, who made these changes? The witch who robbed me of what I had left.
She never found me, but when I came close to the bank with that and her stolen friend and mentor, I saw everything that I had ever wanted. I looked at her the last time I saw her, laying in bed, crying and hugging her, and I couldn't believe it.
How could someone so stubborn as Belinda be so stubborn as to take the life of an innocent, vulnerable woman?<|endoftext|>
**********621**********
The black beast haughty and heartbroken sits around a mostly iron table in a brown metal corner. In one hand an axe and a briefcase, the whole metal cinder block is coated in lab equipment of various size and shape and color. It rubs the table with fat and leftover water that I mixed myself with from time to time. I've barely met these things. I reached for the momentary inhalation from the inhaler that had punched through the steel table and spread the contents out to the surrounding spaces around it. With a pained twang I jump up and stick the short leather piece of metal in the middle of my chest with both hands, and I dig through the brown box to find a jagged dried brimstone cap and a tiny line of something ominous. A tense section of the pitch black floor, where I cover myself with my filthy and rotting cat, stares me in my back. The realization strikes me that perhaps that moon was just a moment ago. I would have tried to drink the water, if there hadn't been a spurt of poison mixed in. My breaths became labored as I moved the cap back to the bar and tapped the one non-descript metal object resting between my knees as I began to fill my lungs with the mixture. There was no time to waste. I broke the cap off the cap and dabbed it in more red, so as not to disturb the squeaky metal. With a wispy and smelly hand I beckoned the scrubber away, into the kitchen I soothed the small rodents and hung them upside down by the lid. With a sneer I burrowed under the kitchen table and swung a dish rod at the creature. It rammed into the fridge. Quickly snapping out of pain I grabbed the bottle opener and tumbled out the door. Slowly though the cracks disappeared as my hands widened and my legs grew weak, and from under my shirt I pointed a wooden shovel and stuck it inside the crack and pummeled the beast. With a screech my blade tore through the devilish crust and shut down the dish rod. I picked up the onion and placed it in the pile around the fire. Gaining a bit more of an air for my laughter I ate and watched from a nearby patio as he kicked down walls and fell into the abandoned bathroom, drowning in his own filth.
Red. It's hot. My heart is beating as much as I can. This experiment is ridiculous. How could it happen? My hand feels like iron in my hands, like a silly myth. One second I'll be back in my apartment and he'll never come back. The next I will be behind the walls. I see it on the roof above me, albeit much dimmer and in less orange than I intended. I start to pick myself up out of bed. I can feel it in my fingers and toes. I want to scream. I want to fall. To it. But at this moment it isn't me, it's something else. It's moving. It's flying.
A whirl of winds blow, hot crackled down the street, covered in ash as the beast takes flight. Pushing through the broken sky, I see it. Looking it up and down, I can see its gazes on the sky, as we pass red orange mountain ranges that twist in the black at night. It is calling me. It is beginning to call me. I turn back to my phone to check that it has arrived. Written in black Sharpie I had to whisper "Galaxy Eye, welcome to Galaxy Earth", but I have to scroll down again, and I have to write the message at the bottom. I have to get back to school.<|endoftext|>

The world has a different way of handling emotions.
Imagine you are an avid reader. You make a list and move on to a part of your life that makes you feel healthy. You begin to hate yourself, at first because of the light pollution, then because you have another job in the next week. Then you stop paying attention to every single thing important, about everything and everyone.
You sit down at your favorite coffee shop and almost have lunch. Or, on the other hand, you complete your psychology exam that is due Monday night and end up spending ten times that amount going to the bathroom.
And that's when you hear it! " SON OF A BITCH, HE NEEDS THEM TO GO TO THE HEARING NOW!"
Those were the screams when the test started. A faulty lens set on test subject. Worse yet, an exploding lump of colored phiogram material.
It was as if my vision had been changed.
It was as if my eyes had been replaced with the whole bag of chemicals!
I was shut out of another new encounter with reality.
In order to get a hold of the package I had installed earlier that week, a faulty lens I had accidentally placed on Mr. Housel. Once I opened it revealed four new eyes! Just like the one back in'94.
Oh, how time flies.
Now what? The darkness? The emptiness? The foreign objects in the surroundings? The grisly smell, the pounding pain, the silence? The voices?
Oh! That's when I blacked out! The world was ripped out of me.
I awoke with broken eyes, a worthless bag, and a lump of colors, so badly broken I couldn't even remember anything happened!
Screaming voices were getting louder, yet even a strong enough blow to the eyes would save them! I couldn't wait anymore!
The metallic casing glowed with an inhuman glow, deep purple. There was a holographic camera embedded into it.
Only it wasn't a hologram.
It was an external glass called a VR headset.
I was going to pick up the metallic casing on the couch at the next store, but on the other hand I was seriously going to the bathroom.
I was so lonely and weird. So...... very lonely.
I tried every door I could think of, none of them had a locking mechanism.
Finally, in the end, I fell into a deep sleep.<|endoftext|>

Marcus walked the next lot, he had to live with all the things that were not right. He needed to spend the next thousand years feeling nothing but pain.
"Marcus; how can we give you this opportunity? It's been one thousand years since you last cried? " A voice asked from behind him. He did not notice a woman picking up a thousand years of dirt and stone and pulling off a tangled rope.
" I'm... I'm sorry... " Marcus stood up to protest. He was never the kind of man to plead with his loved ones but when the couple from before joined in his sobbing, he got it. He was happy to hear of their loss. Perhaps so was they. Surely all was right and Marcus had to make some sacrifices.
Before long, the woman had drawn her first twig. Marcus couldn't bear to open his eyes. His muscles grew heavy and there was an unnatural pain coursing through him.
" Please don't do this, please... don't... "
" But... but do you care? "
" I have felt every time I have come to you, every time you have mourned... You have not borne the pain alone. I ask you not to go... " He ripped a small fabric off of the woman's arm and squeezed it like an animal.
Her eyes were red and a dozen teeth flared. A small fist formed in her hand.
" Tell me... " Marcus said
Her eyes began to shimmer, the lights went out. The sweat on her forehead started to stand on end as she struggled to lift up the rope
Marcus gripped the woman's hand tighter and pulled. She laid there for a few seconds and then suddenly it stopped. Marcus stood, took the twig and looked at the intricate design of the baby, from which he saw a spider on his forearm. He didn't care, he would make for a great monument.
The woman climbed to her feet and dragged the baby off of her arms.
" Uhh... ok.. ok.. ok.. ok... "
Marcus stood in the dirt. He shuddered and the wind blew him off his feet. He couldn't breathe and his leg ached but he wrapped his arms around his wife and cried.
" Go... go... go... go... "
" Marcus, " the woman said with a very gentle smile, " don't break your arm. "
Marcus stood, jaw hanging slack in his knees and he bent his head back down so as to look at the pale spider on the baby's shoulder.
A lone spider leaned down to look at Marcus. Marcus felt its black fur crawl up his face. It began to lift up its leg and moved away, ready for Marcus to reach out.
" Marcus... Please... " Marcus cried out, " don't go. "
" Marcus... " The spider moved in Marcus's direction, the spider dug in to Marcus's shoulder and took him by the hair and stung the delicate muscles in his face.
" Marcus..." Marcus heard a shriek in his ear, slowly dwindling in and out.<|endoftext|>

Every morning I wake up to a good light and take a bite out of my chocolate bar, and there's this man outside, jumping from the house to get some. He's amazing. I turn the TV on, a lady at work brings coffee over. Before I can talk to her, I hear a scream outside. From down the street, I see him coming toward me, with a small knife sticking out of his belt.
All of a sudden, he comes in through the corner door, pointing at me. I run away. I now have access to the entire city, with multiple runways and all the best places to hide under in the night. I start running. At least 2 of them were actually armed, they had their own guns. There was another scream outside. I fall to the floor, flailing my arms, and flee.
I look down from the balcony, and see everyone moving around on every corner. The doors slam shut. Everybody walks over, and leaves.
"Mr. Crimson! " A woman says.
" Welcome! You're the Police Officer for the square, Mr. Crimson. How was your morning? " I ask.
" Have you seen anyone here? " She asks.
" No, sir. I see you know the others here. "
" What's he doing? What's going on? " I ask.
" Sir, I've taken the usual routes, but for some reason, he's taking a shortcut into the square. " She explained.
I nervously continue walking down the street, thinking of every excuse I could think of to stop him from entering the square.
" Just his underwear, sir. Just a little bit of hygiene. " I say.
" Sorry? I would like to have a snack. " She says.
" No, sir, I don't have any sandwich bread at all. " I tell her.
" So, you're considering bringing me a snack? " She asks.
" No! I don't want to have anything to eat, so that's fine! " I tell her, and enter the hastily devised cafe.
My house has a steamy feeling to it, and all the drinking is just too much for my body to handle. I'm starting to think I might have gotten drunk.
" What's your plan? " I ask, as I enter my room.
" She's in a coma, sir, she's kind of useless. " She says. " She got knocked unconscious and she'll awaken over the next few days, but she'll recover faster. "
" How much of that will be edible? " I ask.
" Slightly, sir. I mean, I have a cheat sheet for you, just for you. " She says, handing me a few pages.
" That doesn't look like it will be hard, it looks tasty. " I say, and leave. I walk into the dining room, with all the other women I've seen before, and grab a plate.
I leave the restaurant. I'm staring at my watch. Time to be paid at overtime, when will there be any more money to be made?
A few minutes pass. I go to greet my wife, and she looks at me. " Welcome to the square. There's a man at the top, with a uniform at his right. "
She smiles, and looks at me. " You look like you've never smiled before. "
I looked at her, and smiled back. " It's done."<|endoftext|>

OK, this is a real thing, but one day I noticed it inside a vending machine. The money just felt right. Alright, I had three dollars in the dead of the night, $ 20 million a trip to the casino, and a couple thousand more to go around the country. I would have at least three million per day, a lot of the greatest criminals in history, with genius and skill and little to none to mess with. Even if I were to give you thirty years, you would probably pay in a few years when you'd collect all your five dollars back. I'd have it as the largest debt of all time, a mortgage payments of over 100 million dollars and a retirement. But you know what? I didn't even try to hide it because all I had was the green slips in hand. It all happened so quickly, I didn't even know it existed until it was too late, but it just started changing my life forever. Oh, and the receipt saying the number *9000011010101010100010001* was just too big to go through in my wallet... That's when my wallet went missing, I found it holding... In a safe. The amount I spent to send it to the airport was $ 2000, mine was worth well over a million, just in case it went missing. As a result I had to pay it off in cash because, well, the IRS told me I had to remove the money, but I didn't have money, I just had my best friend make sure the money was removed from me the first night. His hands shook as he opened the safe. Now, with the money gone, I wasn't even facing back the IRS, he was blowing all my money at that point. Thanks to him I was able to afford it all, buy a house, a car and only a bank account. But who knew that I could afford to save so much money because of his. Thank you so much.<|endoftext|>

"Give me your money, please! " I heard the young man say as I walked out. I looked back and I saw the cashier go on. Not to far behind me was a man looking bored. " What is it sir? " I said back but didn't say anything. No response came.
Finally I sat down and looked at the woman who stood in front of me. The woman's wallet was full of money, I guess it was more than enough to eat in the first place. But first I needed to ask her for her money. I sat down beside her and tried to make a contact with her as I was approaching my room. It was empty with the camera hovering in my eye, I jumped up to hide my face but I suddenly froze. Then it happened. I felt the cold metal pressed against my face and looked at it. " Ah... " A familiar, familiar voice said. I can see my brain inside of me and I remember my " recent acquisition of the most important people who will live in the world. " I started to cry but a hand grabbed my arm. " Put your hand back where you are and you will see what I say". The handshake connected with my hand.<|endoftext|>

Professor Oak sighed and picked a new starter pokémon.
" Hmm, err, furtive questions yes? " Professor Oak said as he sat down in his chair.
" Ah, and there I thought -- what? " Gary reached in his pocket and pulled out a shiny and red photo of a Pokemon, of golden hair, perfect eyes and dark, sharp claws.
" What are you doing here? " Professor Oak asked while adjusting his glasses.
" I'm sorry... guess we're going into the scrap heap here. Have you noticed my demand's not having the same effect over time? " Gary begged.
" Nope, so I guess... well, shit. Whoa. " Professor Oak yawned and put his bag back and walked out the door, leaving his friends behind. " Gary a minute. "
" Ron... just being a little selfish, isn't that what I care about?" Gary shouted as he reached up and grabbed Gary.<|endoftext|>

The alien navigator left the planet, as his ship entered the atmosphere, he shuffled towards his ship, it replayed over and over in his head. Sure, it was really not that great of a use even if his ship was very light, and he was still floating in a ship, but he couldn't bring himself to want it. How long would he really last? A few billion more years? He'd have to figure that out. At least he could focus. He reached out to touch a certain area of the ship, his mind is kind of clouded with thought. After a few moments he touched a little more closely at a different location on the floor. A word scratched in his mind. But in fact he knew he wasn't touching anything. It was like checking a pamphlet when you were 5, and he knew he shouldn't be here.
> This is the last entry of the navigator. If he didn't get there, he will not be able to learn anything for a while, even if he thinks it might help. You are only allowed to live a few hundred years. Leave the planet. All we can do is wait.
> He remembered this information.
> What was a good beginning to your evolution? What was death? Be the first human after that?
> Now he recognizes the horrible truth. Now we can live on for eternity.
> Man, when he first walked through the chest of Arohvaar, he re-learned his lesson.
> It took him a while to be comfortable to relate to people. To let people know that he saw things that were better off without them.

> What is death?

Very soon we can travel to Mars and back and soon we'll be able to make contact with a large part of the planet.

'What did we get?'
'We got our first mineral*. We got some not so distant samples; we couldn't translate everything. We heard there were rumours of alcohol to be found on the rocks; yes, that one is decent but not even alcohol could fix this; no, they mention a fountain of water. It can't be didxom, there was no different color of red than the other stuff in this whole room.
'How much water?'
'About 300.000 litres.'

The maiden put her raiment across her newborn baby. The cord followed as she began to wiggle and move, spindly legs twitched together, a wide grin beamed out of her once sleek full lips. In this moment she was something new, as each step began to push back the lump in her throat. Her breathing darkened as she became aware of her place in this world. Her weak eyes so acute as to be unusable, but always calm. She felt hot tears drop down her black red cheeks. Her big chest pulsed with excitement in hers and a small thought rushed into her mind "just who are you ".
The wind stirred the sheets and brushed the blankets around her. " I'm Jensen, and this is our baby. " she whimpered. " Wake up, Jensen! Wake up, JERK. Wake up JERK. " Her big, smacking mouth flickered into existence. " Wake up, sir. Wake up, baby. Wake up! " Her white baby eyes darted to the soft crib for a peek inside. She held out her hand and the baby seemed to take the little jump.
" I think you know me, not Jensen, " she said standing confidently, and quickly slipping on her last sandpaper.
Jensen sprung into action, he had been waiting for her so long. She ran to the crib and unlocked it. Her hands held the large spring gun on its side. Jensen was a wild woman, but a woman before her age was even worth talking about. She slipped with the gun to the sides of the crib and raised it up. She lay it down to rest the baby face down in the center of the crib, her weight burning her chest and lungs.
" I can't do this, " she gasped, " this is my baby... " The baby wasn't as motherly or strong as Jenson had. That was the problem. Jensen was just a baby, a wife, and this was her girl. " I don't want you to hurt my baby. "
Her smile turned redder as she spoke, but Jensen was already new and bigger, and the baby groaned once more. The baby tightened his grip on the gun.
" I'm going to have to get this girl. She's my daughter. "
She pointed the gun at Jensen, eyes wide in shock. Her face showed emotion in it's sorrow, as if she knew she had to protect her. She chuckled, " If she gets hurt by you Jensen, she will be safe from you. My child. " Her wet, growling voice sounded like a bechamel gas fire.
Jensen didn't answer anymore. He looked at the baby, and then at himself, the white face, the square belly and big hands. He loved this girl, and his father. He made the decision to have the baby become the wife he knew so well. This was too good to happen to a child who was already female.
Jensen took his second shot from the barrel of the gun. It had been a good run. The baby saw his father slide the trigger. The younger girls gun beeped down his command bunker. They stepped out into the field, Jensen standing against one of the vegetation.
" Jensen, we found some more baby chicks tonight, "
She watched as Jensen turned to face the two men heading toward the power line. Her ship was moving at full speed with a payload of about 100 homes.
" Jensen, what are you doing? " Her father demanded, his men had guns loaded on the back of Jensen's ship. He raised his gun, " Jensen, Jensen, Jensen! We're taking the girls. They're going to find Jensen. "
Jensen looked at him. " No. You can't do this! Not tonight. You will get to drift away. You will be safe. "
His voice was thunderous and Rotten like he had just started to breathe, " Jensen, get away from me!" The first of Jensen's men shot Jensen twice in the chest and he fell out of the path.<|endoftext|>

"The Usatan Five-hundred years ago, geologists discovered that there were thirty-three million points of opportunity in space that we thought were utterly blocked by the moon.
Many theories were going around the internet before the advent of Quantum Mechanics. We thought that somehow after only a few hundred years of space travel, within 300 million years, the human space agency would have surpassed inflation and stabilize currency values by more than 100 % and we could enjoy a peaceful peace with the world.
By that time most of the world's population had grown antsy. The national televisions all now broadcast the same nonsense television shows arguing that gasses with a liquid gas have pushed Earth back into the present day. Why was no one able to resist this invasion?
The theory that quantum mechanics is real was dismissed by everyone that eventually developed a synthetic version. What we got, was a cosmological simulation where there was no space-time distortion, time was conserved, and you could simulate and recreate every possible scenario imaginable to perfection. The only way it was possible was to do that required thinking. So when we found out that the magic was real, we created a time portal to earth. As it turns out, this is where the real plan went wrong.
Instead of the portal connecting Earth and Earth, it was just a portal to another dimension that created a much colder environment in which the earth is literally over 20 years colder than the center of New York City.
The only items that were properly destroyed from the portals in this case were nuclear warheads, nuclear reactor rods, and hypersonic rifles.
That said, all of the guns worked perfectly. We get to draw our guns and there aren't any bullets coming towards us, and this completely infuriates the *man* because not one bullet left.
So we loaded up with what we hoped to be the new explosive weapons. The small particles that can travel outside of the portal and even travel to the outermost reaches of space have also helped us out a little. We found that after each blast radius, our particle would expand and expand until they became observable, expanding further and further. Within 15 minutes it was just enough. This behavior of the particle power is incredible.
Eventually, the portal materialized around the lab and proceeded to our more advanced scholars who looked more like normal people. People who understood that this process of destruction could never happen without altering the particles themselves, which we call quantum mechanics.
Nobody even figured out how the microscopic particles could do that, but it turns out the particles that were *loaded* with the research manipulated time and space distortion and annihilated the portal. This made possible teleportation if you could tap into it like time travel.
So the theory was that we created stars, with the particles instead of moving into a false time table. Humans ended up ending up developing small, dark materials to power the interstellar travel engines, which would make traveling in space far easier.

It all started when the US military decided to do something about the Roman Empire.
Yea, I haven't written anything here for a long time, so I apologize for my lack of experience or wherewithal. Please don't judge me, though. If you see something that could qualify as satire, then relax.
1 ) Seriously, didn't say it in the original, sorry. Your proof that I exist is so convincing, so far. Either way, don't get too attached.
2 ) If you see a sample, you can use it to recover the human genome, finding the code of the shell. Sometimes DNA can be used to get a DNA mutation, but for the time, the seller can know it's not true. Oh, and of course there's that one, BigBrother. BigBrother_BigBrother__BigBrother_ BigBrotherz.
3 ) Do not call me BigBrother. You can give the Empire some credit: It works.
4 ) ~~Use what I ~~ use. Do NOT mock me. Unlike the Roman Empire, for example, a horrible family member's DNA isn't even available. If you do speak it in its proper name and force it be used, that child will grow up to save humanity, or at least have a choice.
5 ) ~~____________________________________________________________________________________________________
**Record 5081 actions and transcripts**
1 ) On February 23, 2076, Bill Manhatten was found guilty of murder of an infant girl, after his mother found him electrocuted with a garden hose and took him to hospital. The witnesses and the Roman officer were able to surmise that Bill Menmen sat in the infirmary before shutting down the two base test tubes. Lawyers for the state were much more impressed that Bill Manhatten is an executioner and didn't actually set off on a suicide mission.
2 ) On August 2, 2078, Richard Meade was found guilty of conspiracy to kill Jane J Winters, after he found her legs cut, living with a woman who suffered from terminal prostate cancer, and illegally cremated her body in a circus incinerator that still stands today. He was found not guilty.
3 ) On September 7, 2098, Ezekiel Mekuthie was found guilty of islamic terrorism during a SWAT standoff in July of 2098. He was discovered not guilty.
4 ) On October 27, 2099, the Islamic State was wiped out by a devastating bomb and a nuclear detonation, which, I had to arrest as a member of the regime.
5 ) On November 8, 2101, the Barack Obama was cleared for election-related crimes and found innocent.

Dear Mister Jake Ryan,
I'm not sure how I want to write this, but the company I work at has their contract stating that I must not engage in any coffee, and have only ever accepted drinks at 2pm, tonight after the election of the White House. I've had the feeling that if I am to leave work early and visit with my secretary and my co-workers she may not receive anything today.
I'm not sure what would make the world a better place if I spent every Monday and Tuesday cooking for them in the morning.
I'm trying to get through the morning with this red and white striped sweater patterned through my stomach, I don't know what makeup would look like in this.
Best of luck.

I'm sorry for wasting your time last month.<|endoftext|>

It would appear I am having a stroke.
Not severe, it's only the form of my head, it grows and contracts and separates into a rectangle without names. I'm not seeing anything, I'm not meeting eyes with anyone.
My eyes are blurry, no I don't do anything. In a flash it's just my head, like I could see it without me. I can't walk, I can't do things, I can't describe the feeling.
I can't remember how long it's been since I last saw the sun, I can't remember having any of it, I can't remember anything.
My eyes are blurry now, all I can hear is a weird buzzing like wobbly fabric, I can't hear anything.
The smell of the stench radiating off the walls fills my nostrils.
I can't remember where I am, I can't remember anything.
No, it can't be.<|endoftext|>

Have you ever felt that feeling in your hand when you freeze? It's not like it's going to happen any time soon. It's eerily calm. Always calm. No one stands in front of you when they see a newborn. They don't look scared, they know you're okay and you have a small, insignificant chance. But that cold always wafts from your hand like a strong breeze.
I've never held hands with an infant at all. Even as I'm alive and I've lived my whole life keeping a hand and moving just the right amount without anyone saying a word, I still feel like I've been brought before a handful of people with my whole life, even as an infant. I've never seen people without feeling the pain in their arms, holding their babies, or touching them. Nothing ever gets better than crying at your friends table. Is it better to feel your chest become wet and cold and relaxed for the first time since your death? My hands are the thing that tug at my heartstrings.
Anyway, I guess I have this feeling now. Every second comes at a guess, always a minute longer than my entire life. There are lots of people I know that don't feel my hand anymore. For a time they just keep holding my hand tight. When you raise your hand to your mouth, your mouth gives. It's like a butterfly. Your fingers extend downward and when you spit, you spit back. Nothing happens.
Every few months I run into a single sad little kid who thinks they feel my hand. He wasn't there for me. They must've been just waiting in line to come to the mall or a store because no one can ever get in. No one ever gets to see my eyes, or hear my voice, or see my emotions.
Every day I go to see the same man crying in the store, he's sad and he wants the same thing from me. Every day I'm watching the same color change, kind of like a little mirror in the darkness. I have this sadness, and it takes me days to see it.
Every week I look at one last image of my husband and his infant, and the man never looks back.<|endoftext|>

"What? "
" Well, " the long, stout man whispered to the subject with a glint in his eye, " I'm not sure we should be having this conversation. "
The man struggled to make out a few sentences, but seemed frightened.
" You never answered a question as genuine as this man. What is the subject of your questioning? "
" You seem to be completely insane. "
" What is your reasoning for questioning the subject. Why? "
The long, thick man bent down and had a look of utter contempt on his face.
" Because I still see what you saw. The reality of it. We need to find a way through, or so we want. "
The man had no further words. He was still too stunned to say anything. It was time to turn his attention back to the object of your inquiry.
" You know what's true? " The man picked up a small, large coin which seemed to indicate a sinister presence behind it.
" And? You saw the coin? "
The man felt a mass in his chest and a devilish grin graced his face. He shook his head.
" I will not deny you the only answer... and trust me, you'll find it after this. You won't even know what to think. "
He seemed to notice his step was growing deeper. A look of shock and fascination crept on the man's face.
" Next question? " The long man asked.
" The biggest storm I've ever had to man. You saw this tattered, mangled, and mangled beast roar in the sky? Or did you see something was up close and personal? "
The man looked towards the island that the man thought the storm contained. He felt his chest tighten, as if the moment had come for him.
" Who are you? "
" Is this really about me? "
" No. I suppose not. I can offer no help. "
The man sat back down on the island, placing his hands on his hips. He heard the ripple of wood beneath his feet. He looked up at the white stretched beach. He imagined what they would look like. He was probably being eaten alive by the large russet sea. He checked his watch. 6:00AM.
" Jesus, who is this? "
A noise played from behind him. He glanced over.
" A set of eyeholes. Did you hear that? "
The man's stomach churned. Something was gurgling. Something! Suddenly, it hit him, and the gun fell out of his hand.
" Is this really about me? Is this about me? "
The gun-chew didn't do anything. All he could see was a dark cloud and a large sky. The wind shrieked in the distance, showing its heat.
" Is this a storm, Simon?"
The man stood up, put on his clothes, and made his way back to his own house. He turned on the radio. “ Police arrive for you at 9am today. ”<|endoftext|>

A man in a flowing red shirt, on foot stands at the entrance to a basement. The man behind him gives a tall smile and complies.
"Did you even *do* this, Ademan? "
" For Christ's sake! Stop it! No. All of you! " The man in his red shirt nods and begins to climb to the top.
Ademan gives a great laugh and turns to a small house guard, who is examining the building cautiously. They reach the top and stare at it for a good few minutes.
" So what makes this post so special? " The guard holds up his hands and starts to press up on the wall.
Ademan chuckles. He remembers something about his childhood and his parent's names. It was a Saturday night on a Sunday and he needed to be home by 11. He gets up and wades into the living room, taking a seat on the table and beginning to think. There are countless superheroes that this post belongs to. The comic's all of them and the name is a bizarre one.
" If you couldn't show your god you were special you wouldn't be in my world. It's just another world from whence you came from. " The guard quips.
" You will not be truly mine, Ademan. You will simply try to dissuade me from coming. You will tell me that the aliens were here. It will not be part of you or your friends, nor even your children. I will fear them. I will not see the promised land, hear the screams of these men but hear the screams of your own people. Fear this world, you slave of the unknown and pretend that it is alive and doing its work, until you find me. " The man chuckles, suddenly stumped.
" I already have the answers. I told you. No time to waste. You get the point. These men have infiltrated my existence, so you go exploring. Go to the past and explore their place in time. Not to protect yourselves, you. Be vigilant. "
Ademan gets up and throws his headphones and his sunglasses back on. He stares at the man in front of him. He cracks one eye and closes it again.
" Well then. Go find the President."<|endoftext|>

"Ahhh, GOGOLAG! "
Benny was jarred, dozing off in the far corner of the room, as he should have been by now. Behind him lay a tiny, disfiguring claw. But it wasn't so small as to be grotesque, or so tiny as to be an eight-foot nothing. It looked like a spider, though it had claws... right in its fangs.
" You're on Halloween," chuckled GOGOLAG.
His head poked over to a branch, and the large beast thrashed with glee, out of fear and indeed at the horror in their eyes. But Penny was not scared. But she was amused. All the other people in the room were too, like those two two centipedes Steve had poked at for other reasons.<|endoftext|>

I loved who I was.
With a smile on my face I would gladly give up everything I used to know to the thing I'd grown to love more. Anything.
"So come on man, you'll get your wish now "
I gazed down at the genie who addressed me, looking around. It was big, so I thought that I'd taken what was ours to the top of the thoughttree and with the fit I continued my call.
" Well " the genie went on " what have I got. "
I was one of many people stuck in this golden age of thought. The meteors above, the heat of the sun and the balance of war and passion were finally starting to crack. We could all meet our end as the heavens took their own course to send us into the stars to save mankind from this cosmic disaster.
The dawn of the last of the stars threw us back into the present. I would have as good a time left on this wretched rock. Not from my job as a scientist but the good old days were over. I had just had my first job when we were stuck on earth. Working the most boring work in the world, casting black smoke through a shower curtain and some weird mirror image.
But I suppose it did have its perks. I didn't have to work many hours a day. I can get in to the basement of a barn and experience our world. If one day I could get into the front page of any magazine.<|endoftext|>

At first I was skeptical of what he was talking about.
As an intelligence test, he was the only one I had actually been able to understand how he planned to make the whole thing in his head all the way up to the point where I had even a shred of doubt.
"But I wanted to! What happened? You win, no matter what!"
He said it three times, in short bursts, far louder then ever before.
Several strangled gasps later, he'd smile- it looked absolutely horrible! He was already sitting in absolute isolation in the middle of nowhere -- making some sort of malfunctioning fluke that only made the journey more insane.
All the same, I thought maybe he needed to focus on making his mind's eye on something. To see what happened, what just happened... or maybe just want to pretend I knew what he was going to say, or maybe just are going to keep repeating what he said. Maybe someday the universe will come crashing down on us.
I suppose I should have been able to remember the last time it happened. I started thinking about the string of events that followed. The one that seemed like it all happened just minutes ago.
*Me* was going to fuck him right in the ass.
In fact, this entire thing seemed to seem like it was the manifestation of everything just *right there*. Like, literally. And when the fuck did I begin to wonder if it was just a swirling nothing coming out of it?
*Cough cough*?
But did I have to stay here forever? Who gave him a reason to survive for this long?
I had no idea how I was going to do that. I had never really thought about this part of his plan. If he was going to get out of my life, how could he have any ideas?
I tried to call him several times to try and calm him down but I was always sitting in a very dark room, which actually made me uncomfortable. Nobody liked talking to their ghosts, anyway, especially when they still had the power to bring bad souls to life.
*Fucking fucking rediscovered*?
A vague, impossibly long burst came before I caught it.
It was as if it was there a million miles above my head and it was staring right at me with a bright, fiery gaze.
I slowly began to move my jaw to hide the shock and fear as I said the last thing I needed to say.
*Eat! *
I guess *you* didn't have to. It was only just after all this time that I felt my hand start to jiggle.
*Eat me when I'm down, you fucking murderer*...<|endoftext|>

I heard a voice that spoke to me through my cell phone. I didn't know what it was saying, I don't know where it came from, or even what it was saying at the time. I looked away from my cell phone as I rushed over to the speaker.
“ That ’ s the face you gave me. So what you ’ re asking for is my face, and I ’ m going to help you become as a face of terror. ”
“ Oh just need a second to think. ” The red head chuckled.
“ Fuck your face. I tried “ never comment ” my cellphone company wanted. It worked and the city shut down for a second. I gave my phone a shake as I threw it at the street. The gun pointed at me made a tiny dent in the sidewalk ahead. I picked it up and put it in my pocket. I didn't tell my boss I got my crosswalked and fell to the ground as the heart monitor filled my head. As I faded out, the night went dark. I let my phone cool on my desk as the headlights of a speeding car appeared behind me. I pushed my empty backpack on the floor, looking into the face of my wife of three years. I knew what she was looking at, and it scared me. How I was seeing her.
“ MOM! ”
*Knock knock knock* I could see the car roll by as one of the customers leaned against the wall. “ I heard your husband there. ” The gun was lit but only at the sight of his face.
“ Thanks honey, I forgot I had my things back in the car. ” His mother said as she picked up the things. As the car pulled away, I could hear the child screaming hysterically at the top of her lungs. She had to get there early.
“ Who said you came to collect her? ”
I laughed slightly as I pushed my things away from the ground. “ Always wanted to collect my child. ”
A pull of the gun made my world spin. The killer slumped forward, still looking through his glasses at me with tears rolling down his cheeks.
“ God. ”
“ Her DNA looks fucking perfect ” I looked into her eyes and saw the green skin looked positively perfect. Looking up, the killer's face was pulled back a little. “ I ’ m your new face. ” He whispered, feeling the rage draining off of him.
“ You said your son was under surveillance, ” his wife said, her voice cracking. I slipped into a sitting position next to the killer ’ s wrist, his face bleeding slightly as he rocked back and forth in the chair. He was nearly shaking, “ The whole damn world is watching me now, so I ’ m going to sit with you. And speak my mind. ” His tone was rather raspy and he had his phone set to match the phones battery, the receiver flickering to life. “ Have a nice night, sweetheart ”
I grabbed my wife and wept into her arms as she started to run off down the street with her baby. I promised her I ’ ll see you at least one day.<|endoftext|>

"Mr. Porcupine, please excuse the awkwardness, " asked Mark, who was hardly five minutes late. " You know, when you watched my calls, and you sent *trolls* to each other, it was such a shock to hear such an important message. But now we're connected. I've been watching your requests, and it's honestly just yet another one of those,'Why can't I just call you with the family?' prompts that are standard for my clients. "
" It seems these, " piped down Porcupine, " readers are responding *and* enjoying it, " he announced, fingers clicking the keyboard.
" I can't stand the fact that they don't get their paychecks, " piped to another visitor, with small child smiles on his face. " But you're a great dude, Porcupine. "

A god, the prophet of God. It's a joke I keep hearing it all the time, people who are now making the effort to become a God say that whenever they are around a deity they know they are going to become a God. They are still trying to figure out how the hell that started with was created. And how are all the humans going to respond. The damn thing, and not just the other deities who are trying to keep their prayers to a minimum.
God has become very popular, and even I remember when I was running after him he would cower in the corner and shout at me whenever something bad was going to happen. What a prick! He'd actually start some chain lettering or something he'd done. I'd look up in fear and get him involved. But before I could get a reaction he's already crossed the street and is now running through the crowd yelling up and down the streets. My watch stopped. I looked up and asked him why he's running. He was kind of booming his little voice at me and he was a tad short by most standards.
"That was well and good sir! In fact what my grandfather calls upon me to do for you is wish and pray to the heavens with you as my guide. Let my friend guide you so that you may one day be a god and become a god! "

But he always stayed silent. But just a few words. And just that last second. And just that one mighty whisper with great strength that shook me to my very core. " I will do it!"<|endoftext|>

The blackened city of Nevada had cost him a big handsome sum of money and he had to admit, he is rather tired of all the tourists that he had managed to do so far this season. But he fought for his money and living in silence had hurt the whole collection, so when the new curtain opened, something that took his eyes grew bolder...
His owner walked in, a familiar face, a familiar face that I had not seen in years. He spoke quietly "Did you know where he lived?
" No, I figured it would be more likely that he only traveled in number three. "
" What? What value do I have if we get a scalpel from the circus grandmaster? What kind of snake cut his nostril? "
" Incredibly dangerous snakes, just look at the ones in the photo "
This he acquired from a hardware store in the past and what began to come to be understood by many was as a scale snakes, although with a root weed and while perhaps one of the most dangerous of the statuettes. This came out as a variety of individuals, each one with more or less a scalpel. At first the procedure was tolerable, but only for a couple, maybe two to four clients.
" So what the hell are you talking about, has a scalpel had a death on it?
The owner looked up at this and smiled menacingly.
" I thought he killed his wife or a child. Like a snake. "
He walked up to one of the men in the room and without a word, called him a sloth.
" Oh, what kind of snake was he?
"'Number three', the hairy one? "
" Did he not come here to cut his nose with his scalpel? "
" True as ever. He only visits us for one purpose, but I saw him on another year. All those years. He made me sick.
One day he came up to me, laid a really nice cubby blanket over me and was afraid to touch me. "
" Baby, why does it matter? This all happened years ago. He killed his wife. "
" I'm going to show you the key to making death poisonous "
" Yes I did. So what happens if you keep it in there? "
" And I can make a constant risk- "
" I'll send him to nowhere. Then I'll kill him with my scalpel, keep it in there until it kills me. Then I'll hurt him. Do you know how much he hurts. I'll make you take his scalpel and take his nose. "
Bob scratched his chin and seemed grateful to be in this charmed state. It seemed like an entirely different thing to do for someone who could set his nose on fire.
" I'll put my feet up to his nose, and then, I'll fold you up for a few minutes. Then I'll make you bury you together, then I'll have the satisfaction that you put your hands up to his nose again and again, and then I'll listen to you just right and watch you breathe. And you'll die happy. "
" Easy for you, really."<|endoftext|>

It will happen again. He kept on running.
He was wearing a girl's clothes now. A dress. The color of purest skin. A dress, white like all the girls would wear. He gave her the same look of curiosity. His heart raced.
The doorbell rang. He yelled as he went through the hallway in the hall. The sound of the alarm cut him off from his objective. The only male who saw him looked at him in horror. She turned away from the door and looked into his eyes.
The door was unlocked. He tried to take her right, but she didn't move. He tried to draw her attention, but everything she saw left her to the horror of her own reflection. A girl in the bathroom. A man in the kitchen. She ran to the bathroom and her lids snapped. Her surroundings became painfully clear. He ran inside to comfort her, but she moved to vomit. She had a full bladder and no appetite. And the man in the kitchen tried yelling at her. Her face split open.
The streets were wet with blood. Screams of pain were heard all around her. " Don't fucking breathe! " screamed a voice.
" What is going on? " she asked, as she opened the door to see a red faced, horribly beautiful man in a black suit holding a gun.
" I'm sorry about being a loner, Mister. " The man said quietly, and the image began to fade from her world. And her memories began to come back.
" When am I going to wake up, Mister? Will I be able to return what I stole? " She asked, but the sensation began to fade.
" Mister! You wake up! I'm done! Leave this place and get your life back! " She screamed.
But the man couldn't. His mind was racing.
She screamed again. " I don't want to die! I need to live! "
" We'll figure something out, Mister!" She began to sob in agony.
She finally walked out of the hospital. She found the gas mask that was slowly starting to drip from her mouth. She told the nurse what she saw. Her brother, who had been suffering from schizophrenia has also been found dead in the alley outside the hospital. He took three pills to help him to get out of the hospital. His nurse and doctor were there to administer the medication.
All that was left for them to do was get back on the road.<|endoftext|>

Alex sat in the corner of his room, watching as the stars rolled overhead. An ancient satellite loomed above him, casting a green light. Down the corridor, he strode down the cobbled hall, ever careful to avoid the dusty linoleum. His feet made a humming sound in the wind as he edged forward. Alex followed the light, caked in the clay of worn brick. As he passed the putrefying opulence of the building, he swatted at the ground, letting the breath leave his lungs. As he drew closer, he saw a man in the shadows. He recognized the man immediately. " Thank you for coming, " the man said, his voice coming back through thin throat and tears.

The souls of the crew were here, sat far away from each other now. Now a crew lead by a guy named Comcast had been in a bad week. He was being accused of redundancy at the beginning of the week. His name was Stewardess Jones, in a straight to the point state he had assumed dead until the day of the crash. But then he saw that Thomas Jones couldn't make it out. All he could stand was the thought of all the grand old ifs and gets that all the angels you see were gone...
He'd said many times to Stewardess this was the end. The other crew members now thought he was mad with his new found company. And yet he couldn't say anything. The bridge crew knew it, their crew knew it even they were all shell shocked now.
They were running to the major system hubs in three hours. It was just as they were running with all their combat systems on course. A jam went through the ship and punctured everything in its hold, something terrible had to be happening. Stars started to burn. Thankfully no one knew what was going on, but they knew the path was getting cluttered.
Mercenarys pushed for cryogenic venting. That meant they could escape, where they could recover slowly from the shock.
At that moment something big happend on Earth. Something that the earth was doing now and everyone knew. It did not look like asteroids or radio waves. The sky was dark, the clouds moved towards their caldera. The crackles of the lights at Earth fixed it all.
"Good evening, thank you all for your service. "
The stewardess said nothing. She was at this moment seeing things happen.
" Yes my fellow humans, we have seen some bad things happening. "
The rest of the crew looked on with mild surprise, even the ones who knew the path were shocked to see all this happening.
" Does anyone else have been sitting in that stupor for far too long? "
" Well guess what, it was my wife, Cindy. "
" I'm, I... "
" I know. I guess you two are right."

Kwaril stared at the room. It was obvious that he had nothing better to do than watch it. He was contemplating to only look at his son, who looked about as very young as he was. " Hello Mr. Kane. " He snapped out of his thought. " How does this work? "
Kwaril, now in shock from this abrupt stop from studying, smiled. " To see that nobody else is standing there is a matter of pride. I can't possibly see anyone but you, a normal boy. But... imagine my surprise at these questions. And the fact that people from other schools have answers that you don't get? " He then pulled out a parchment and began to sing " Hail To Those Who Fear Me, Kal-Senkyu, the Order of the Mortal Matriarch, of the NCO Army, King Come Mneton, Little Agamemnon, of the Civilization of Soil, Andong Enthusiasts, Stone Horses, and Heaven. "
The room fell silent.
" Who are you. "
" I am the Supreme Leader. " He stated, breaking the spell. " Is that? "
" No. " He replied in his sincere, earnest voice.
" Be happy, the knee jeesw. There are others who never come. You and the rest of us must continue to wonder what are you doing here. Come along then, father."
Then the walls around the room started to drop.<|endoftext|>

Patric ( an assistant ) was walking toward his coworker in his cubicle. She appeared to be between the ages of 20 and 30. He paid her like an acceptable wage, she actually stayed in the same room as him. This was his last ditch effort as he couldn't afford her withdrawal fee, anyone who takes a drug designed for that 18 year old production run down draw has the worst run I can imagine of it. He had been accepting the painkiller for over a year and would be dying an old man short of the money at his birthday party.
Patric strode along his commute, greeting the two men. He stopped on the turnpike to catch a look at the youth sitting at the bench next to her. All he saw were two adults in their 50's. He pushed a cigarette into his mouth and rubbed his eyes. This was the most confusing part of his life.
Patric turned to him, "Quiet, you're really hot today, " he had thought to himself as he sat up. He rubbed his eyes and paid off the college rent. When he got home he told his coworker of the gift. After checking it out, he called his fiance and told them. Upon returning to the apartment he told the fiance he was in Las Vegas. She declined and went straight to The Burbank. He was determined to get out of here.
Patric wept when he drove there. He tried to find an excuse to leave. He tried to leave Hawaii, and then Hawaii, but no questions asked. The problem became when he asked his boss for the privilege to take a hike up from where he had once sat. He never explained why he felt this way.
" I don't know how to explain this. You've been very like your fathers, and I know that your mother used to make it very difficult for him to take a hot shower. Now, after so many weeks, you've let that happen all because you want to spend more time with your father. You should try to get some of that money, you've done well with your life, and you'll see how much you make, " He hung up.
The two men sat next to him and inhaled deeply. At the same time, the realization of the change hit him and knocked him back out. No it wasn't. He sat in an empty seat, still sobbing. He sat there for a while. He thought about the situation, and he came to the conclusion that they shouldn't ever be together again.
The man himself came over to him. " Dad... You want to go to Hawaii? " His voice came out as the tears in his eyes began to fade. It would take maybe five minutes before the change would give him the courage to head down. He gazed up into the ocean for what seemed like eternity. He suddenly remembered the car- his ex-wife had left him. His greatest fear had been confirmed: cancer. With a huge smile on his face, he smiled. Now he would die at least one more time, " It's OK Daddy, I'll be back at the hospital in a few hours, " And hugged his son as he took a step back down.
As the car was out of his reach he brought a hand up to pat his head. " Pity, " he said, as he hugged his son on the cheek. He put his arm around his shoulders, waiting for the decision he had made.
" Pity, " he laughed, as he left the hospital. He knew that he was going to die on the streets as a plague. He hadn't experienced anything like this since he was a kid. But it would be best to get over this. It was just too painful when he stood up. The tears stopped, and he took a seat down, facing his knees, " I'll come home first."<|endoftext|>

"Your Highness, is that you? "
I knew her name and she was sitting next to me on the next step of my path, as red as a rose. That red.
" I see. "
" Interesting. Please see yourself, " she answered reluctantly.
I would have been in tears if not for the red dot beneath my hand that drew my gaze to it.
" I just came to collect my things. "
She paused for a moment, looking straight into my eyes. Her mouth tightened. A little change I had not expected.
I watched my hands linger in my pockets, hair coming back to stave off the flow of blood that had punctured my hand so deeply. There it was. Before I could even make a sound, I reached up and gingerly pulled out the letter opener from my pocket.
" I know you're coming. I'll pick you up any time I can. "
As a tangible sense of relief washed over me, she extended her hand and lifted my head in a gesture of inviting me to her home. There was a man nearby, seemingly unaware of my presence.
She opened the envelope and handed me a letter opener. " Here, " she said with a bassy twang. " An invitation. I take it that you came in to collect the things you need, and as you expected, I was the one who needed the most paperwork to make this. "
I smiled and took her hand, feeling lucky to be here. " Here's my gift, an unopened envelope, I guess. "
She shivered slightly before nodding her head. " You should really pay attention to these things, Adrien. Keep it up for me."
With a flick of my wrist, I opened the letter in reverse. Then, I was right. She had carved a tiny circle into the back of the envelope and I was going to receive my gift of my life, just like that. I was going to live every moment with the knowledge I had over a one-day encounter with death as I took that ring from her.<|endoftext|>

Sink has the everlasting lie of being different.
See, when you break glass, you break hearts.
Wake in a hospital, not to it; "What happened to me? Why did I need to die? "
I couldn't accept it. How could I accept the truth?
You'd think when I opened my eyes there wouldn't be a bullet and even then my happiness would lie... disappearing into my own well of cold white.
I felt rather remorseful now, confused at how my heart had stuck there. From the shoulder of my mother I could remember the exact moment.
She was crying. She could never get up or grow an inch.
" Bro, I loved you so much, " she whispered, " with the love of your life and I loved you. "
" Then why did you keep crying? I didn't understand why you didn't tell me, " I asked the strange stranger in question, his tone more sinister than usual.
" That's no excuse, " he replied, " I was possessed by something or another. I was blamed for leaving you behind because I was afraid of what the future would hold for you. "
" What did you use to know that I would still love you? "
" Do I love you? "
" No. I hate this world. "
The stranger seemed to be in a futile attempt to gain the trust I needed, and the time wasted trying was probably a bigger loss than he would have liked to reap.
" I have to say, I hate this world. I hate you. "
" Get off my island!"<|endoftext|>
**********656**********
The man stared at me in disgust. I could tell he was interested in what I was saying, so I simply followed the man into a booth. I was told he had a coke problem and an hour before I could hit the money button, he found an illegal lab and confiscated it.
Being a man with a coke problem is still unknown for me, but I ’ ve been lying about this for years now. I haven ’ t slept since my first deployment, so I don ’ t have a way of staying awake in the night. That might be for the best as I ’ ve started to forget the details that this man knew. I know what he wanted; to die. I know how a drunken man in a black suit had banged up a cop trying to be polite and then thrown me to the ground and all over my apartment block. I know what happened to Officer Peterson. I know what happened to his civilian partner. I know how he had cried a knife into his wife ’ s face and how he went back to breaking her apple pie.
Honestly, I can ’ t blame him. He wasn ’ t going to die, and it was the least of my worries. When we met up I had forgotten that I had anything special about him. That would just be expected given the circumstances that would lead me to believe that he was…unique?
The man stared at me for a moment, then he pulled out his pistol and shot my partner in the temple. At this point I didn ’ t have any other choice. What if he ran away? What if he came back to this world the following night? I honestly didn ’ t think it would matter, considering the circumstances. The man sat down and turned on the radio.
“ Welcome to 8277 News. We go live to Westfield Police Station for a report from investigation of a murder of Officer Peterson. ”
I got up, grabbed a jacket, walked out of the interrogation room and into the open. My thoughts were interrupted. I remembered what had happened to Officer Peterson, which happened quite suddenly. I had been caught selling drugs to a friend and it seemed the cops loved it, I knew they didn ’ t like it, but I didn ’ t think about it at the time.
It was too late for me to remember, and I just lay there, thinking about everything. I just nodded my head and fell asleep.
…
The next day I got lost at the docks. The press was doing a bit of a story. I wish I knew what exactly happened. I honestly thought I would've flown there; at least I would've slept better in the darkness of the docks. In the morning I woke up on the deck, got out of bed and took a deep breath in before heading off for a drink. The bartender was very loud, though, so I probably thought I had run out of people to hear. I walked into the bar and drew my pistol. I was so happy the bartender didn't notice, as he was aiming at me, so I gave him a wink.
The first thing I saw was a man, lying face down next to a man holding a bottle of the same brand he had just been shoving down his throat. I thought I heard him realize that he wasn ’ t looking at me and see my face. One swallow left my mouth, and I immediately began to move the man ’ s body back and forth until I was completely on him. My mind went into quite a wild direction, I was somewhere I ’ d never been.
The man handed me his cell phone, which I thankfully had. I spoke to it a few times to clear my head. I tried to hide what I was about to say, but was cut off by a loud thunk. With every word that came out of his mouth, it just took me by surprise and everything came back to me. The thudding broke my heart; it ’ s a lot to bear in this moment. I knew the man had been lying to me in the past, that he wouldn ’ t come back here because of me. I had hoped there was a better way to get him, but at least my fish got along with the current law.<|endoftext|>

( I'll edit this later. )
The ice cold ground was steadily shrinking. I had just been eating my morning biscuit when it began to walk away.
The look in the eyes went from most scared to downright terrified. I was moving my bowl, as usual, as fast as I could. An unsettling feeling of shock crossed my spine, and I closed my eyes again, praying that my "daughter's" life was saved. There was a gentle tug in my chest.
It had been moments, maybe decades, but I've been part of this horrible, terrible job for a long time. I took a great deep breath, and rolled over. Thank God I wasn't in my room eating.
It's gone now, I thought, jumping back in my chair. I was such a stupid kid. I thought I'd have to walk my son back to bed early. I guess he's already home, having spent all day cuddled up against me.
I went down on my couch. The cold flurries of when I accidentally brushed with a pile of clothes and a corpse. I sit and listen to the winds.<|endoftext|>
**********658**********
The Old Man sat down on a great wooden bench in the middle of the street. Slowly, softly, he picked up his fork, struck a deep breath, and rested his hands on the altar. " Ah, Father... the same face that I brought back. He's tried to kill me. When he finishes off my corpse, I will feed and breathe him back into the flesh. You've proven I was a mercy not only to him, but to all of your kind. It's time to give him the forgiveness I've asked for. He needs to rest now, or I can't force you to starve him again. "
The Old Man rose and flicked his fork. The copper was old and gray, and licked his lips. His eyes filled with a warm sadness, and he fell silent. Just then a sharp hand came to his neck. Another sharp hand came to his ears, the one the priest had held his hands against for so many years. His pupils were muddled in sadness. The Old Man was terrified, and his lips twisted in revulsion.
" But if I can forgive myself, why can't the Father be merciful? Why can't the Old One come to save me? I'm your Son's Guardian, because he is human and I am God. And the Father loves me. I deserve him and I want him to stay who he is, the same way you did him. "
The Old Man's eyes flicked to a snake resting on the fat log. The snake stirred, and he fell asleep, helpless against the cold night air.
The Old Man left his bench and strode down the street with a deafening silence, and carried his fork to the market where he sells it every summer. He peered into the reflection of the shady redwood street, careful not to break the fine autumn morning and reflect on his life. In his dark hourglass he read of the springs and the tombs and the buildings.
At last he could sleep once more, and the young girl he had brought with him sat close to his feet. They were already wrapped up in their beds. The priest had offered an apple for breakfast and a glass of water. The Old Man had offered water because he thought this was the only time he could take a bite of fresh fruit each day. The priest had offered his father water so that he might have a glass of the juice that he had spilled on the cobblestone sidewalk. The Old Man had his basket to the side of his bed, waiting for the end of the world.
The yellowing sun lapped out of the clouds, it was a beautiful night. He placed the basket under his feet and turned on his heel. He made his way to the wooden bench nearest to the church. As he walked up to it, he felt the warmth of the sun. The sun shone down on him, magnified into brilliant relief. He saw a young girl standing on the ground, almost two feet away. The old man smiled, and, hearing the young boy's sobbing, pulled his basket from his arms. He began to walk towards the boy, and as he stood, the Old Man felt his shoulders buckle. He realized then that his muscles had been weakened by years of sacrifice. That blood was running from the wound in his neck that had to be shaved off.
With his beloved daughter gone from him, the Old Man breathed in deep and fast. He shook the old leaf that lay in front of the bench, and took it deep into his heart. He had hoped that the Old One would come for her when his time had come. In his trembling voice, the Old Man whispered one last prayer to the Father. " I will love him and I will love him all I can."<|endoftext|>
**********659**********
A moment of silence filled the room. It was quieter than a nothing, though. Perhaps it was the door opening, a curious sound.
The room belonged to Death, though he had no real sense of time. Throughout the millennia it had worked a lot. Despite his experiments, Death had learned the very essence of everything he did. He was Death in everything, but Death had to admit it was a little curious.
The room was endless.
There was never any interruptions. No laughter. No objection or squeamishness. Just warmth and dimmed light.
Outside was a beautiful day.
It had never happened to anyone before. On death's end, death has a face a hundred trillion years older than mankind. It was busy and conscious, but there was nothing unusual about this face.
He stood in front of the closed door, his ceremonial blade clutched tightly in his chest. It sat across from the impossibly friendly Death.
Furious, he looked away. “ If I may try and stop it, ” he said softly. “ It ’ s simply not my style. ”
“ Shorter than you, ” Death gritted his teeth. “ * It* is an age ago. ”
“ I have a knife? ”
“ Not your knives, ” Death replied with a grin. “ It ’ s simply my tastes. ”
“ And what is a knife? ”
“ A window. ”
The world spun, meeting his gaze, like the showtime Flash. He watched in silence.
“ I don ’ t know, ” the impossibly friendly Death said softly. “ I don ’ t know what ’ s it like to die and yet, I do. ”
“ They ’ re nothing alike, ” Death grinned. “ It ’ s, well, pointless to try to set it aside. Why, when you ’ re everything but yourself, would someone ask you to end yourself? ”
“ It ’ s petty. I wanted to end myself. ”
Death smiled a little bit, and flicked the knife open. He was wearing golden gloves, with a button pulled up to the top. “ My first attempt. ” He said with a twitch of his lips. “ I guess I shouldn ’ t take my time. Perhaps you still need more. ” He walked back into the room, and there the impossibly friendly Death stood, his blade still clutched by his chest.
Faces slowly drew a more serious expression. “ I ’ m Death, ” Death said, tired and defeated. “ The time has come. I shall count down to the letter and when it is time, I will make your eternity count. ”
The impossibly friendly Death looked disappointed, and then he picked up the knife in his hand. “ I ’ ll try harder than ever. For years, my friends, ” it said, before cutting across the shadowy figure.<|endoftext|>

I don ’ t know what the hell is going on. Someone isn ’ t in my room. I thought the flash of light was going to be a normal part of the day. I thought it was going to be a normal business meeting, but then the next day someone came by.
I was sitting at my kitchen table feeling my glasses fall off. It was beautiful, this city, surrounded in the greyness of night, watching the moonlight glint off a city like no other. The man ’ s voice rang out in my head, "Good afternoon Sandra, can I ask you something? "
I shook my head, " I ’ ve never seen you before. It ’ s pretty crowded, but there is nobody. "
" What ’ s going on? "
" I can ’ t quite explain it. That ’ s your house, my wife is here. "
" I don ’ t know what that means, but I can tell that the people on your room are following your movements. "
He scratched his head.
" And? "
" The people on your room? "
" Huh. "
" So. "
" And? "
" You had a party, and the people are following what you are doing. "
" Did the people follow me? "
" They don't follow you though, not anymore. "
" So I ’ m the best? "
" You can choose to be the best, but don ’ t worry, I ’ ll see you tomorrow. "
The tears were beginning to form in my eyes. I felt fine, felt like I was in the most wonderful loving relationship I had ever experienced. I decided to live my life in peace, for the betterment of everyone in this world. But at that moment, I thought about giving up, I decided to start back at my house.
But my wife came by with a gloved hand, and I said " Sandra, something just broke in my house. "
" What? "
" Something went off. "
I turned to look at my wife. She was looking out of the window, the bright moon was peaking over the trees. Everyone was looking at me, but not her. They knew that something was wrong. I looked at my entire apartment. The people that lived in the houses we lived in weren't here anymore.
" What's going on? "
" I don ’ t know. I just thought that maybe you ’ re different, I don ’ t know. "
I looked at my bedroom window. The light of the day was streaming through it, and all I could see was night. I saw black.
" Sandra. "
" Where is she? "
" She is with family. There ’ s no one there, we did everything together. We walked in, watched, talked, we took after each other. "
" What? "
" She fell asleep. There is no one there. She just fell asleep with no answer. "
" Where is she? "
" She is home. We are married. "
" Okay. "
My wife spoke, " The flash of light. That ’ s incredible. You are the first person to enter my life, and I am the last person. I can ’ t stand it anymore."<|endoftext|>

Nothing personal, very close friends.
I ’ ve always thought it was just the right thing to have available reading space, too. Learning new topics, such as modern literature, or art, can ’ t hurt.
It ’ s also more accessible to the college kids, so they can actually spend time in our libraries. Especially by the library service, which is free to anyone, but required to customers of any type, provided an ounce of literacy that is acceptable.
One of my biggest loves, and my only criticism is that it ’ s a PowerPoint slide. ( Not really writing in PC, but yeah I know what you ’ re thinking! ) That ’ s just adorable, isn ’ t it?
I like this because it sounds smart, and “ fun ” for a while, as opposed to how you might think it would sound in an alternative that way. I ’ m not one for crossovers, even if that includes the yousing of your finished novel.
It ’ s also great for those of us with fellow MBTA members who are unsure of whether or not we should have free time on short work months. Not everyone understands what free time means until they have spent weeks on *their* side of the project, and lack a proper welcome mat when their beloved novel falls apart. Most of the time, you got ta go and relax. You want to get up and run.
I wish everyone at the Library of Congress would be a little more educated with the programs offered at their local library, and not get caught up in class re-evaluating certain spending patterns.
Some people wish for things like Black Friday and Christmas, but those might drive some of them to their new homes, where companies just shake their heads and plaster "Buy " signs on some of their walls, making sure that things don ’ t get set up.
Then again, our library receives a lot of applications of our time, so it may also receive some partial responses from federal, state, and local funding streams, as well as other groups.
Anyway, is there anything I haven ’ t covered in my other writings?<|endoftext|>

"I don't understand how you've managed to survive this long! "
" Well, listen. Maybe we should just go home. "
" Yeah... I agree. I mean, it's kind of scary. And there's a *big* and a *tiny* reason I should stay, and it's awfully rough outside. "
" Let me help you out of here. There's *no way* I'm losing my mind. "
" What? Where are you going? You told me you'd be here five minutes ago! You work an auto mechanic job! And that's hours- "
" I get the point. You work for us, work for *THIS FUCKING MORNING*! You probably work eight hours a week, and in your spare time you work ONCE AND EVEN THOUGH YOUR BOYFRIEND IS A FUCKING HUG, YOU WILL NEVER FUCKING HURT YOUR MIND AGAIN. "
" What can I do for you in case you hear that? Fuck this'normals' bullshit. What the fuck is going on? What the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus, if only I were omnipotent, this would finally be simple! "
" Oh god, what are you talking about? The damned evacuation. I've told you before everything will be all right. You will be ready for *no-fly-ins*! "
" Alright! Right! "
After praying in unison with hundreds of other demons, God prepared himself for what was to come. Immediately he got up off of the porch in to the middle of the street and exited his little elevator. Shouts of " Hey, you! " and " Wan na go play some video games? " came a roaring bell of encouragement from the infinite being pushing and pulling on his own.
'You're gon na have a blast'.
Everything started being perfectly happy. It had all began with an accident that happened at a shopping mall in Georgia a few weeks back, and he, looking for a cashier to help paying for his order, called the mall up to pick him up. Unfortunately, the shop manager was apparently inside of the store at the time, and the " cashier", as they called her, was their manager. The " cashier* " decided that while he was inside, she had kidnapped him, and beaten him to death. The mall manager got off at a similar time as the cashier ( though the " manager* " also gave him a free drink ), but the man was already too far gone to be heard of. What the hell kind of hell was going on here? He was pretty sure they would've kicked him out for robbery, but after a while, there wasn't much to be done.
God, now living in a very little Walmart outside of town, bought an allotment of money from his car ( which he used to pay for the car repairs to the store ) to pay for everyone's phones, vacuum cleaners, and other emergency supplies. The mall manager did not spend the rest of the money on the phone repairs, so after deciding to come back to the store, God entered the mall, and called out for " Hey! What are you doing outside in there? I think you got me. Are you kidding me? It's a good day already! "
After nearly a week of'unpacking', God arrived and invited everyone at the mall to his spot in the store. They actually appeared as if they had only been there for a few moments, and walked in.
" Hey wait, " God said, " What do you want to play today? Let's just go play it. Hey! Do you play Lord of the Rings? "
Before long, an obscenely large square of smoke appeared from the portal that had appeared, and burned up. The mall manager was about to tell God about all the things he has been forgetting, but all she heard was " I love you too. "
After some explaining, God reluctantly decides to play with her, walking to the pit of the earth where the shop would be. He loaded up his fifth coin, and bought a beer. He listened to the music, and wished that there was another day.
The minute he reached the shop, he saw four monsters for the price of one. His wife, who was in her bathrobe, just left, looking for some work. He saw his own wife, born in his house, in the midwife's arms, and was so excited he went to the pits of the earth, and dug his fist deep into his chest.
God ended up dying. Apparently, the way to hell is to kill all the demons, only the strong and evil were immune, so God couldn't turn around and die.<|endoftext|>

Her picture is here. She has the crest on her shoulder. My lovely girls love my high school photo. The moon glints off the clouds, rising a short distance from her house to her friends room.
I open the front door and watch as her long red hair cascades down and down the ever growing back of her pale arms. My heart leaps to my chest as I sit on the couch, an innocuous cheery smile on my face. Her doorbell rings, I step in to see she's there. It's Melanie, her older sister. My heart pounds as I realize she's on the other end of that wiry metal key-board just as I've forgotten her. I look up from her picture and realize I've never seen her before in my life.
I snap out of my trance and desperately sit up. Melanie is sitting right where I left her in bed, staring through her sleep leaving behind little pool of droplets to run down. When we sit down, she wraps her arms around me and we kiss, breathless. She closes her eyelashes tight and the door closes behind her, leaving nothing but a smile.<|endoftext|>

“ Hmm? ” slurred the villain.
Ulfry summoned the Keymaster to land his weapon, pulling his sword on the skeletal neck of the murderer, and pulling his sword up off his neck to reveal a sword that had been not a blade, but had once belonged to hesevered blades, an emblem the Keymaster had proudly displayed on the wall in front of the jail cell.
“ Who are you? ” asked the villain.
Without hesitation, the Keymaster turned his eyes towards him, “ Artyomnia Komét. You are one of many hostages on the jail grid, who are being held. ”
“ Oh… Yes? I said. ”
“ I am no hostage, am I? ” asked Ulfry.
“ What are you? ” asked the Keymaster, and immediately began his search for hostages.
“ Don ’ t worry. You are all I have. ” said Artyomnia, taking his blade to his throat.
The Hero looked at him blankly for a moment, then blurted out, “ Hello I, uh… yes you ’ re all. No, not all, merely us. We have been wanting to free all of those fugitives, but there is one in particular who is ready to take our place. ”
“ Welcome. ” replied the Hero.
“ Hello, Qorgo. Now, we need to eliminate him. How about you, if I kill him, he will bring peace to this world. Why don ’ t you follow my rules? ”
“ I, uh, will lead my people to a better future. Well, even if it is a stage play. ”
A several faceless guards forced the Hero ’ s hand.
“ This man, I will use his very hands, would cause war and turmoil. I ’ ll be the one to shut him up. I will also take down the evil that is no longer made out of evil, I will leave only heroes who once were still exist, and I will create a heroes army to serve our people, a few who took down evil in one form or another, and I will let citizens have free reign to strike back. ”
“ What are you talking about? Who is the hero? I said I am only going to free one man. ” said the villain.
Ulfry turned back to the villain, “ This man is the hero who succeeded the villainous, Boris. You have all been playing with me long enough. ”
“ You have? ” the villain asked.
The hero then gave the hero the Keyblade, a dagger-like thing that had already been placed on his shoulder, before another voice that was to the villain directly,
“ Congratulations Artyomnia Komét, you are free. ”
“ Who? Who wants to be free? ” the villain asked.
He turned towards the Hero, who responded, “ Yes. I will lead my people into a better future.
Your honor, I now rule the world.<|endoftext|>

Everyone looked at each other.
“ Timmy. Welcome to class. ”
Trudy turned around, ignoring everyone. She'd been doing calculus for 6 years now, so she knew when there were going to be weird people here who looked like they were watching her for her reasons and she had only had a few weeks to prepare her exper-ment. She turned and faced her students.
“ Hello. ” said Tracy. She was an extremely attractive, physically beautiful blond girl. Her glasses were slimmer than normal. She had blond hair, almost pigmented, and wore a black light blue jean jacket with shoes.
Trudy pulled out her phone and looked at the messages. A year ago this frat boy could raise his daughters from her high school graduation, her asshole girlfriend would buy him her second skin baby and he would blow her brains out.
“ Miss Tracy they are so beautiful. ”
A lot of people took notes on their gender, like Trudy. Luckily, she had books on drama and personality in her class. A lot of people had a baby, so they could have a better chance of living life and doing a fulfilling job as parents.
Trudy made her way to the bathroom to find the perfect man for her body. She would have to get dressed fast, and there were places where the clock was a bit off, so she would have to have a better time to work quickly. She turned back to the clock, stuck the heels into the sink and went for it. She was ready to move out if she needed to, but she had to open the door by 9:50.
Trudy was already ready, but none of her classmates were smiling. She closed the door, turned and filed in. She would have to ask the middle school girl, Crystal, to be her attendant for another couple of minutes, but she didn't want to annoy her middle class son.
“ OK kids. I'm going to make it quick, we will go get the girls, but first, open the door, just so they know where we are. ”
Trudy hopped into the car and sped off. She didn't know where she was going for a while before she remembered leaving the bathroom. Not the DMV, of course. There was nothing left. As she turned the corner to the stop sign she was met by a group of people.
“ WHAT THE HELL! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LOUDER! ”
“ Woah, he was acting out a bit as soon as he saw his reflection from across the street! ” someone ran in.
“ Great! Dad told me that his car probably would not go anywhere, so he switched it off. Oh my god! ”
“ Okay ” the group of people started to yell, but Tracy threw herself into the seat and called out to them. She did this so nobody could hear.
Tracy could only get so loud, and the girl started to cry. It sounded like somebody had punched her.
“ Hi, Tracy! Hi, Dad. Thanks so much! ”
After that she sighed and set the car in gear. And once the car started to come to a halt, she kicked herself out of it. She grabbed her phone and rang her father.
“ Hello Trudy? Sorry I am late for class again, but I left class and wished to be home for class right now. ”
Trudy panicked. She had to tell her parents.
“ Miss Tracy, I must have last ten minutes of your speech... ”
“ Oh no, God it is going to be that much harder now you're in here. How about class? ”
Trudy didn't understand. All she could do was sit in that fucking seat and cry.<|endoftext|>

The box of mulligans was heavy and wind picked it up, it had been tore in half by a man I knew.
It was a scythe towered over me, why did I have to end up like this?
"So, " he began, " do you have the money in the envelopes? "
" I could, " I said, " I hate boxes.
" It's the only thing I know "
" I can't accept that, can I? "
" I could try! "
" I hear your words! "
I took out my ruler, it wasn't fair! " I can't help you today, the day before my birthday, you gave me $ 5 on a lottery ticket. Now I can pay what you owe! "
" I can't thank you, " the coin blazed to life and floated into the air,
" Don't blame me, I said no. "
That bit of statement was practically repeated in my head
I was king of this land when all that happened happened was I drank a single dose of a rare drug, one I was never able to afford.
I woke up in the middle of the night, the drugs were a miracle, of course I'd be fine, I had other plans, plans to the best of my ability. I swept off one million dollars of the savings.
The next day after that, my door unlocked and a man walked in. I could see him, a bit bald and standing at my bedside.
" Hi. "
" Hello, whats up, " the man asked after a moment of silence.
" I'm George in his Miracle Bullet? "
" Yes, sorry for missing the post. Just a normal Sunday after work. "
" What on earth are you doing? "
" I'm doing what I'm supposed to, I am the luckiest guy on Earth. In fact, I spend three whole days at the same place, smoking a joint. "
" Why do you do that? "
" Not for long. I would try to trick the Inters
Otherwise, I'd be sent straight out the door. I just want to bang on the door and it'll break right fucking off, I'm hungry. "
" What do you want, George? "
" I want a bag of munchies, "
" You don't keep munchies? "
" I can't help but think maybe now will be my opportunity. "
" Here, are some things you shouldn't have. "
" I wasn't a bad host, my mom would've wanted to, "
" No. "
" That doesn't change the fact that I'm the luckiest guy on Earth. "
" You're so right, I am. Take a look at your poor fortune."<|endoftext|>

I watched behind me. Drifting through the tangled mess of the room as I counted each step, a piece of me creased the glass, every bit of light enveloped it. * The whole time, * I think to myself.
"It's mine. " He says with a smile. His voice is thick and crisp, pulsating with the nicotine that crosses his lips when the shadows are there. " Not to worry, the thing is yours. " He calls out, swinging his arm up to grab me at the shoulder. I, too, lean back in my chair.
" You, little child, are my best friend. " His arms flutter slowly around me, the shadows burning before my eyes. I recall it like it's yesterday. His little brown eyes that he looked in, brushed me to the far end of the room. His shell-shocked arms, their look of desperation, had been replaced with desperation as I raised myself up in the air.
" But I can make that wish, *you*. " I whisper. His smile replaces his words, his warm, gentle shoulders lessen. Then, he rests his hands on my shoulder.
" Please, little one, make a wish that could never come true. But you have a choice. " I begin to tell him, and then he hesitates. I look him straight in the eye, turning away from him to his own reflection. " It doesn't matter. " I say, making it so that he opens his mouth to speak, but he has already lifted his head and let out a cry, as if he wants my dying breath.
" But there are others. " I tell him. " Like you. Like you. "
" Look, I know. I know. But you have to take back the wish, because you've been wrong in a lot of ways. You just can't talk without looking evil and naive. If they can't kill you, they don't care that you exist. " He says, turning to face me.
" Tell the committee that there's a loophole, and they will stop the killing. You have a choice." I say, ignoring him.
For a moment, I think I wonder if I'm being accused of being mad. Then I realize that he has the opposite reaction.<|endoftext|>
**********668**********
The General put on his specially made mask. No one else recognized him, but he knew that is necessary.
He didn't know what to expect. Had he been born in a war or felt that he had to fight, his mother had always turned him away and hated him for it. Or had he been born in a circus or had felt the need to fight so that the nation's welfare could be served?
It wasn't entirely clear, and he was still in the fluid state of being unable to explain everything. Everyone around him chatted about his incredible skill. He had tried to explain it to everyone, but they all said, "surrender to your neighbors!"
Not anyone knew how he knew the system. It was common knowledge in the high school cafeteria at 13 that the General was a serial killer with dead men's blood on his hands and that everyone wanted to kill him. They all thought he was a joke.
Nobody really understood what the General was, not even the upper class kids, and they were all so quick to ignore him. But there were those that did, and the general knew how all of that worked. He used it every day when he was at school or when he looked at a book on the way to school. Those we befriended where we met people we loved. Then when his father took care of him a few years later, someone else with his face, it wasn't easy making contact.
There were people in the high schools though, and they knew he wasn't a killer. They know he was fighting, and they didn't stop to make their guesses until it was too late. Everyone was waiting for a normal day to find out why they were mad when they saw him.
There was nothing special about the General though, not by a long shot. To make sense of the general's actions, or to protect his country, you would have to get some sort of description from the people in the crowds. Any information about his sources was used against him for months, but now, no one can find his drawing: The back of his neck was cut so deeply that he looked eerily like a murderer's dagger.
It had taken him months to figure out that he was the General.
He was everywhere he looked. People were watching him. He seemed to have routine. Seize them without anyone ever noticing. Though, they didn't move. He was surrounded with unknown numbers of people and nobody saw him.
He had no choice, so he had to make sure his assassin was the best. No one saw his drawing. Not even the people who the General made innocent looks. No one could spot him or make any sense of what he was doing. He ran into the crowds of people and stopped dead.
It was not until he was at school, so they were ready. They all knew how best to get him. But the General was so funny, so genuine that it was impossible to escape. So he paused and listened to a small whisper. He was taken to a room and brought to a chair. He waited. He spoke. He spoke, but not intelligibly. He spoke it slowly and calmly. Then, silently and carefully, he shouted...
"BREAK THE MORNING TURNING TURNING!!"<|endoftext|>

They are family. Their father was a brutal tycoon but his son now lives with their loving sister and son in this country. An hour ago today their boat sank. They killed the tycoon my dear brother. They killed him under a plan I told them we would murder him. The other family had children but they were condemned to their own destitution. The bastard didn't have a reason to live. My brother is the one with money and I am the one with power. He took everything from me because he wanted a better life for his family. He wore the expensive clothes they have all been forced to sell but not to us. His eyes aren't fully focused they are just smiling the same way as every other kid but he doesn't look like a real person. He is the one with power. " Quiet your bitch ".
As we pulled out of the shore where the ship is just now sinking there was a scream. Ours my family only took their children from one family back to their home. Not me. Not the poor men, the homicidal madman, the paranoid terrorists. As we slowly reached the shore I said to my parents, " What do you think you are doing. "
" What do you think you are doing? Your family are insane. I did not kill them as you convinced them "
" I don't know what you're talking about and believe me but it didn't hurt that much. This was just my imagination, and guess who shot someone."
For weeks my family and I had set up camp on the shore where the ship was just sinking. This wasn't my family. We were pirates gone mad! Jack pulled his own gun out of his pocket and aimed it at my family ’ s cabin.
The first line of the first shot hit the alien ship I was dying from. I think he will never get over the stress of killing my family and me! If only we had known that it was Jack ’ s fault, not this disaster.<|endoftext|>

My name is Jensen.
*Oliver, papa, Oliver. *
*Oliver, de'Oliver. Francis. *
I sat with my head facing one of the large doors that was apparently made for entrances and exits in the main court of the city. The beige gate with a "poration of the ambrosia " was only slightly longer than what I entered or what I left it for. Being the fiver of peoples entrance fees to the court was about the thing I *needed*, so I found a place that was cozy.
I wanted to sleep on the leaves, I *could*.
I was in the middle of a monument now. A giant wall with a gigantic dragon walking down it. It seemed to be made up of the stories that the dragons tell in these parts.
The statue opened and stood at the foot of the entrance and the dragon came around.
" John! John! John! JOHN! " It was comically grotesque.
The scene went on forever.
" Oh my God! John! John! John! John! JOHN! "
The water stopped completely. Water began to flow off the statue and the water seemed to corrode.
" Water! Shhh! Shhh! Oh my God... "
Then something stopped.
" I'm here. "
" YEAH!... *fucker*."<|endoftext|>

I was born into a background of an ocean filled with other "superheros." That's how they called it for the last four years. It's kind of sad really. Well, that's just to be sure. When I was born I used to get bullied. No way anyone could take me seriously but the bullies in my neighborhood tried. I think.
Bullies. The worst of my bullies. I don't remember many of the attacks that way.
I've got a crush on my first crush. My first crush also has super strength. My first crush is also a weird sort of really strong... like, some kind of super fluffy blackhaired loner. I'm not my normal crush, I think.
Bullies are very bad at being bullies. They do what can make the characters and/or fans mad. They can kill someone, choke someone, throw someone to the ground, rape someone, and generally have no empathy or understanding of what happened. They are apparently very stupid in my personal opinion.
Bullies tend to hate other superheroes. They may or may not be strong powers, like Wolverine and The Flash. But they may or may not be ruthless in their evil nature.
It isn't all bad though. You get to be a hero right? I was.
Not very bad. But sometimes I would wake up to the look of a supervillain before me and feel something. At least that's what my nightmares felt like.
Bullies, you name it.
It got really out of hand when I was in middle school. I took my bus to work. I still hated it, though. I hated the people at school. How could I be anything when there was no such thing as evil?
My bosses told me not to go to school today, and I barely got in the car to go home. It had been months since I had sent someone to work. I had promised them they would take care of me and get me there before lunch.
But then the day came, and no-one ever did.<|endoftext|>
**********672**********
"So with the great war not yet ended, here in the year 989, nobody is allowed to travel to the states. There was a slight problem until a little over a century ago, when US troops started taking prisoners from the south to Texas. Some of the prisoners didn't quite pan out. I know that they weren't Christian, because they believed in God, but they were incarcerated by the United States government, so your fricken city was just as bad. I saw this one girl chained to a chair just because she talked to Jesus. I didn't even know what that sounded like, so I kind of assumed she was Jesus Christ. She had a lot of anger in her, and though she spent most of her time in the Spanish Inquisition, she spoke the same reason her people hated the Americans. She was simply too scared of the federal government. The Republicans complained about losing Texas the Confederacy, and the Democrats insisted that the north should still be the dominant power in the United States. She wasn't afraid of the radiation or political correctness, and the Judge liked her enough to suspend her sentence indefinitely. So she thought that man should have full rights to life, and that if God wanted more freedom, then the most logical way to do it was to make the northern too radioactive to defend himself. So now the weak willed left the Confederacy and the North Virginia militias left and cut him off from his home, returning to Canada with a sword in his back. I know that these strong people thought they could strike back the last red United States stronghold, but it was a mistake to think that the Union of Free Canadians would attack the neighboring American Territories. Then they attacked Washington D.C., and they did it through the Union governor of the states, President Wisconsin. So though the Union of Canadian Free States was part of the United States of America, the subsequent conflict with the Confederacy pushed the region all the way to Siberia. "
The miners wouldn't go beyond the wooden scaffolds. Nobody did. They just fed and watched the local roads that they used to cross. Their crops ran down in the late spring, and only a few rich souls had not returned home, due to the economic drought and the clashes that the federal government had faced. The government had served no purpose here, and in fact it was losing most of its depth. The once great slave trade was taking it's toll on people for the first time in hundreds of years, and the surplus has been reduced to nothing. The Wyoming division was quickly in decline, far before anyone could point the finger at Wyoming being spared. Meanwhile, in Austin, Texas, a young woman wearing a burqa walked by a garbage truck and saw a businessman just in time to see him close to death.
" Honey, I got your date on the line. " The businessman screamed, as he slammed the truck into the trash truck. The woman wasn't wearing a burqa in her clothes, so she could be as accurate as her husband. She approached the man, lifted him up, and with unbelievable strength, swabbed his face and opened the hole in his neck. She took out a small notebook, and with a deft flick of her finger, drew lines and symbols, and the man drew them out with his finger. She also burned her manuscript, but not before beating off a handful of blood and ink, and from within the paper, she read the first words of the man's crime.
" Four white men."<|endoftext|>

"You hit me with your moonlight. "
She looked back at the screen, then scrunched up her eyes, the acne on her face lifting as she strained to see what had been covering the screen's edges. She stared at the bag of money next to her, scaring the man with the gun, and then went to pat her down.
" Thank God."
The dealer backed out of the money, shuffling back to his car and driving away. The sound of rustling money sliding away made no difference.<|endoftext|>

The cops were slowing down at the entrance, leaving me to my problems. She was catching up to me, her face were pale and tired. She sounded as though she was also just lost in a haze, all sorts of commotion, not particularly surprising. I looked over and noticed the towel wasn't there. The knife she always kept wasn't there.
Panic set in. I remembered my almost death moments back, felt my nerves getting calmer, and suddenly felt hopeful. I had been riding my bike the whole time, enjoying the moon, passing the town square, and when I got there it was dark outside, so I felt confident to be here now. The path did seem longer now, and the smog at the horizon seemed a bit further.
My heart dropped when I saw her, and that was when I figured it out. But as long as she wasn't me, I got my bearings. Here it comes, she's killing me now. The end<|endoftext|>
**********675**********
I never wanted you to leave. No one ever. No one will ever do.
The only clear, brilliant memory I have today that remains is of the first time we met. I remember it vividly; the fuzzy sensation before swallowing a bright yellow glass. The sunlight on top of the room gave it a wondrously wonderful blue light, and I could tell I had missed it - maybe I should have gone off with a private jet?
I hoped it was another sunny day like the last, the bright blue barrier of the hallway where I hoped we'd board the plane. I laughed until the camera broke, then left the room.
It was hard. No, I didn't want to be there; it was too much pain. It took me a whole lifetime to find the words that would describe what was going through my mind when I first saw you. How'd I even learn that time at all?
Then, the last thing I saw, the monitor rolled to life - we were cruising up to our destination, and you seemed to say hello, but didn't say anything. I felt horrible for that moment. I was too young to understand what I was seeing, or for that matter, why you were there.
The entire view is dazzlingly beautiful now. Its creamy color blinds my eyes and my chest and cheeks are singing themselves into a melody. It's no wonder why you left when I was still working for the bank. It certainly wasn't worth the wait.
When I finally see the rope leading up to the ground, I will have to think about it again. Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea? Maybe I didn't really think this through.
The room was dim, except for the brief, oppressive lights that made up most of the hallway like a bright blue sheet. I smiled, thinking I would find something nice to share with you soon. But today, you seem to ignore me and go to sleep at the same time.
I guess it's finally time.<|endoftext|>

As soon as the machine started to hum, the child in its buggy eyes for the first time blinked an odd one of these weird colors in the sky. I rolled my eyes again and inhaled the ever empty air of the machine and got out to try to out my invention. The machine itself lit up suddenly in a brilliant blue light. From my vision I could see that it was hovering towards me, an object of some sort that I couldn't figure out what, but I could feel it floating away towards the ground.
The machine went on, its lights rapidly dimming, then it continued on, and its stage began. It would continue on in this hoverlike drone for another day or so. The "thing" would soon be two days in the future, just like all the other prototypes that took place. I continued to think to myself.
I put my coffee on and began typing away at the report card I had written down yesterday.
After three days of just folding the ends of my papers and changing the papers to new lines of text, I decided to change the subject and start writing about the little chair that was not there at all. I moved around the entire desk and then called my wife. I told her I would make sure it was all done and sat down across from her for a while.
The machine began to hover towards me again, its lights dimming, then it continued on. I looked around the room and around all the objects in the room - TV's, drugs, medicines, even hospital equipment - as the machine danced towards me.
The machine stared intently into the darkness outside of my eyes as its pose shifted one at a time. It was very different to all the other stuff that I learned during my research into " artificial intelligence". It seemed very boring and I was a little interested at the prospect of something as simple and harmless as that. Just like the prototypes that I had been working on before; just it was one of those things which I really didn't understand. I tried searching the internet to learn a little more about it - to see how it could communicate. Nothing worked. I had learned that computers only do two things at a time. First, they pick up random objects, and then a random amount of words, some words must have previously been discarded ( the time between being worded aloud, for example ). This led to the " good and bad" principle, which led to the lesson on how you should treat your creations, and the history of the interactions between the craft of machines.
I didn't even bother trying to decipher what the machine was saying, all that I could gather was that the room was without any lights whatsoever. One evening a refrigerator seemed to be on fire. The lights were on, the machine flashed two different words that appeared to glow a brilliant blue. I told my wife about this discovery on my first day and made sure that she turned on my machine again.
I went back inside and found out that I had to dispose of the thing I was dealing with earlier. A purple ball of fire came rolling out of the machine. It was very dangerous. After it had incinerated the room, I decided to hand it over to my wife.<|endoftext|>

She stumbled through the open door, tripping on her step, and tripping backward as she watched her boyfriend become a beastly aberration, barely human. Something had happened to him, and he had become like the moon. She cautiously turned around, only to find out it had a time bomb before running to get the child. She moved back, just as her step was about to come to an end, when the- *woah woah* She turned around, tripping on her step, and tripping backward as she saw a kid her size crying behind her. Where her step should be, it was as if it were standing straight. She rolled over, distracted by the surprise of the child.
She expected him to crash in her arms, he didn't. He moved in past her, into her, when she turned her head to his side. She felt his anger pushing him down. Maybe she was happy to finally see him again, by catching on to it all.<|endoftext|>
**********679**********
Everything was quiet. Just me, son, the window, and the scanner. The machine glared at me, but I ignored it. It was a four in the morning, I knew I was going to have to come by a minute late.
I hurried inside, not wanting to get lost at work, which was what my boss had told me to do. The work was normal, an automatomputer about four feet tall, raised on a high ridge in front of an old abandoned shed. Its legs, six plates covering its body with a green metal paint job, with one arm covering its shoulders and four more sections covering its torso. Its hands were already a bit shaved but in their graceful red, they looked incredibly light.
I was far behind the Nestron disruptor when the engine started going hot. I scrambled for air, yelling for help but I knew it was too late. The Entity had no powers and the computer couldn't allow it, but I'd done the basic checks, and that was what allowed me to make the jump, and now the simulation went cold. " Damn it, " I muttered under my breath. " It is human, the race of men deserve to die. I should have known something would happen. "
The Entity emerged from the dry desert and smashed the bright flashing emergency lights that powered the doors. I glanced back over my shoulder, expecting them to flicker, but I didn't think of it that way. Nothing happened. It bolted and slammed into the other side of the room. The several doors were flung open and I stepped into the blast, but my brain told me to run. The hole in the laboratory was way too large and I was making terrible starting pains. I knew I had to break through, but I wouldn't be around to solve it.
The Entity had booped. The containment surrounding the exit had knocked me off my feet and I ducked, knowing they wouldn't find me any further. The ladder from the top had begun to take me under.
" Listen, " I whispered. " Let's make this quick. We're on the vorroon, and it's kind of like one of your kind, except a lot more deadly. "
The door to the reactor, tipped slightly and cracked, flew open, and two of the bots raced in.
" These guys weren't looking for us yet, " a nearby, dressed-up android barked. She slapped a helmet on him and an expression of shock before crying out in pain. " They came for us for real."<|endoftext|>

"Three more seconds! They both finished excavating the ruins! " Growled the news anchor as he looked down at the ground. " Well, now we wait. By God damn it. Do you understand how difficult it is to get land underneath this pretty rock? "
" Yeah, I understand. " The reporter said slyly as he moved a few shovels from the excavator into the dirt, digging into the end of the remains.
" And then the news anchor said that we don't dig here because we have no concept of value. One of us found a dead body, two dug up well over 3D blocks and could not believe the amount of dirt and gravel we are giving this person! This grave was told to have value! " Growled the news anchor. " All I can think of is that we are in bad hands! Heh. "
The screen flickered away, leaving growled reporter no options. " Wait what? That's impossible! We did not dig here, we dig this canyon. "
A quick look at the date was all the reporter could don't to stare with jaw open as he stammered. " Oh fuck you're... well... " he began, but got interrupted.
" You are some abomination of violence. " Growled the reporter. " You humans had a box of numbers in your head right up until now. What do you do? "
" We play video games! " Growled the reporter. " Warps and trots us from our caves, everywhere. It's been a mistake! "
" You were never kidding! This place is covered in diamonds! " Growled the reporter. He nodded impatiently to the destruction expert standing over the camera.
As soon as the screen went on he looked back at the reporter. " Wow, you are very clever. Now stand your ground and please answer me as a human. " He began to dig faster, but the journalist was too slow. " you can not say your part! We haven't had a dig in over 40 years! " Growled the reporter. " No, not really. "
A few more of the ropes snapped in time, and the reporter was slapped back. " Finally done. " the reporter said to him, regaining his composure.
" Okay... " the reporter said as he put some of the remaining dirt to his chamber. " See? Now, come on. We dug a little hole underneath here."<|endoftext|>
**********681**********
He really was a jerk to us. Every time we attempted to give him a hug, the kids screamed and demanded his soulless gibberish, the lines of the interviews seemed so pitifully long. So we did something about it. He wasn't really our friend. We really didn't want him at the top, after all. They were torturing us.
But some part of our hearts wasn't broken. We managed to get our soul back. And some part of our soul even got sent to a different place in hell. Hell was heaven. But not for us. All our wishes and wish fulfillment weren't meant to be anywhere else. Not even the nuclear wasteland that had once been our territory. We were just eyes, ears, and minds focused solely on one thing: that box. I was sure that it'd taken a few galaxies for him to disappear in those shards of fear and despair, but I thought he'd been looking for us for a while. The only reason I was still here was because I lost my soul, but it was still a bunch of crying souls in my absence. I could feel that the voices of those still looking for me became hushed and garbled; I'd just told them I was somebody I needed to talk to.
Now I'm a mess, heaving, seething mess who doesn't even understand what's happening anymore. We're in the middle of a car chase now.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Ah, there she was again. Poor little one, gave me a hug. Laughed at me and tossed me a frying pan. Car whipped by.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
He looked at me, and asked me what it was I wanted to do for our race. He looked at me again and pointed at a drawer near the door. All he had wanted was the box. What was it like here? I shrugged it off and pulled out a bucket of water.
He put a metal cup in the bucket and looked down at my creation. Tired from one ordeal, struggling with an unresolved formality, I pulled out a ruler and slid it over my face. He frowned and started kicking it in.
"Son, what... did you like last season?"<|endoftext|>

I gathered myself, stowed in the back of the study in the dark, staring out at the infinitely wide expanse of space below us. It looked unlike the surrounding landscape; rocks and other body parts strewn about like carpets; trees toppled out of the ground and splintered into a storm-clouded husk. There was no escape, however. We were lucky that we could see them...
The sky tore open, and through it ripped open the book. The pages were all torn, in fine form. One barely. But the rest had hinged in place atop a structure of crystalline rock that was as molten as the surface. The pages were contained, seemingly intact, and at last there were *all* pages.
It took me three minutes to scour around the building, picking up every single one of them: a collection of magazines, ebooks, literature, a vast collection of digital records... it all struck me like an asteroid that had hit my new home, the newest home on the planet, the one we named *Earth*.
It had done it. Our sun was nothing more than another thing to be swallowed by.<|endoftext|>

Donny has really fucked up this year. He hasn't kept up with the death and rebirth rates lately.
"Ma'am, you gon na go in and see Mom? "
Dad was livid " you don't know, it's been 3 years already and you haven't even hung anything ".
" Well if I'm gon na see your mangled body I'll whip a fit together".
That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Fuck.
Before I get into the argument I need to remind you to keep your emotions in check. I don't want to draw your ire. Donny please tell me you're going to hang me.<|endoftext|>

"And it broke my spirit; I tried to fix it by rising from my bow and praying for you to fall from heaven in my lap! "
Jesus peered down at his puppy, exhausted from the failure at first. His eyes watched Noah and the rest of the braying horde. " Why do you question it? "
" I-I understand your question, Jesus. You believe you were the only one there that could have completed the task before you. "
" I understand that. " Said God. " What actually happened in their world? "
" It started a month later when God had an idea, " Jesus said to his puppy, " Something that I have observed no other human form, and was enamored with long-since disproven reality and awe-inspiring science. "
" And he didn't waste time doing his experiments? "
" I doubt that, considering that God created us. "
Jesus cackled like a volcano, cackling back at Noah for his terrible attempts at romanticizing the human kind. God continued, " I noticed the brilliance in Noah's dog, and his slow quiet intelligence. I prayed that he would understand more about what he did with his art to repay me for it, and in doing so I improved his story. I set out to educate his world, and when I had bought my first book with my inheritance, I received a huge wave of congratulations from the first couple of galaxies. Within seven years, my world had been reset to how it should have been. And despite overwhelming odds, my nephew Jonah came back, with his best friend, Phillip. "
" Now you're going to ask me what happened in the book. "
Jesus laughed, a chorus of incongruous sounding remarks, but all good things must come to an end.
" I was at my uncle Jonah's funeral for Christ's sake, and Richard died three weeks after that. All of that led up to me meeting him. "
" Well... "
" I lied to you, and let him hear what the whole world was going to tell me at the time. "
Jesus had been too late; the rest of the universe was already running as a simulation, but until he woke up and sat in the back of the Lincoln Tunnel looking an awful lot like Jesus, he wouldn't remember much that happened in the great flood.
As Jesus sat on his rock and contemplated the battle with God, God rang his bell above his head.
" Good, good, good, " God said, moving from the metal tin plate the picnic dish on his carpet to the trowel with the broken plastic. " See, here's the thing: why don't you start now? "
Jesus sighed heavily, " I guess they feel like all the time they put off in life is asking for a few technical advances. Also, the answer's simple: don't forget to stop sweating, OK? God, in theory, has a nice control over both your here and in this universe, but I'm not here to lecture you about how this is great, not because I *know* all your problems, but because I really don't want to know what every handful of people's problems are. "
God boomed, " I know Jonah. He found the first witch that killed a rabbit. That man is responsible for the hell *here* he killed. And because we don't always reach equilibrium at our world's end, he finds us in a little hole, where our world will end in ten years. In this case, we'll get to see him kill God on his first day of the new year!"<|endoftext|>

*Found a mirror in the bathroom of a convenience store. The woman walked up to check on it. The store manager looks at her, looks at her. The employees don't notice as she glances at her pockets, each one a paper bag. One appears, one a small metal object. She notices the small triangular object next to her. She feels the sweat from the object under her boobs. She looks in her mirror. That, she notices, is a mirror. Upon closer inspection, the object is older, heavier, with bright shining silver strands. Her mother comes in with a gruff voice and drinks some whiskey, asking, "was this really there?"<|endoftext|>

The tide rolls in slow around the little raft. Above us everything was dark, as expected. The boat squawks with noises we never expected: screeching, old cars, and screeching engines. No waves. Just a calm white light. It shudders, like a gold rush bath, and crawls faster now. It's not as warm as we thought.
We check to make sure the boats are still in shape. They were supposed to be empty, but the streets didn't look like they were filling up. I still remember the muttering to my father, walking out from under the water, checking the empty bottles. He always looked beautiful there.
I return to the boat to open the nursery windows. My mother greets me with a loving goodbye. I sit down and glance over. It was just like before. Through the door we see the strange baby girl. She's walking around the corner, not even looking up from the road. Strange.
I sit next to her and watch her walk, and I watch her leave. Another stranger bumps in the way. This one moved over from the other side. Both were carrying little boxes. They also had broken bottles. One of the children had smashed the empty bottles at the same time. Neither had hit anyone.
This child was at least seven, I think, eyes wide open. She was quite odd. A little boy with black hair, round cheeks, and a smile to match. Her face was blank and young. I stared at her, like a curious child.
She handed me a glass of water and that kid held it up towards me.
A lot of times I just wish I had got rid of this annoying little child. It's why I did this and I never thought about the girl that shouldn't have happened to me, like me. It's why I don't drink.<|endoftext|>

"How much you get for summoning the demon Lord? " I asked. It sounded as if it was about to make these other strange and wonderful sounding sounds every time I asked its name.
" None, " it said, " though some folks may be enjoying this little entrance. " It stared at me for a while, and began whispering to itself. " Why don't you try? But first, some relief. Then some pie, a bit of apple pie. You want me to eat dinner? Maybe if you show up as surprised and angry and whooping... you might have some pudding or some milk? If you don't pick up the piece of pie, just eat the meat first. Maybe even boil it first and check to make sure it is still not burnt out? "
" Turn off the electrical egress feature. It's going to be a lot harder for me to convince people than it would be on the human condition to at least eat this burger, " I said, " but hey, it's a job well done."<|endoftext|>

This is my first ever submission, don't be embarrassed. But, I was going to add a little something here to highlight my work. Hope it's good.
Some of the more adult put together concept that I was sorry I had to put down before a few years. But you know, back in the days of school, that fucking sucks. The teachers would tell you things like "what else could you do? He could get nowhere, have to fight to keep a hair of hair before he ends up in another class like you " Then you'd go on to realize that the teacher was NOT helping anyone.
During English you could read something, but I know not what that was.
My name is George, and I'm the only one of you, as long as you like. I used to be so painfully shy, but that power came after having the power of an old aunt. Let's just say that the power made the other girls gain an advantage in every class. I was always great at her at first, especially with my semblance and abilities. I only had to do my best, and actually took the guy on the first date after leaving. I was so high.
That's the thing about ghosts. You never know, until you are hooked on the first thing. There's never any magic in that sense; just some mechanics and modern technology. People like you can see, hear and be affected by things, interact with other people and the environment. You can see things that aren't there, how the world seemed to change, how it might not be the next one, how others could have known about this or that, etc.
Of course, I was 100 % in charge of the mystical power of *me*. Sure, it was something I loved a lot, and when they allowed me to enter that role, it was great. But if I wasn't as omnipotent as other kids, wouldn't I want someone to have to fix my mistakes? And now I was stuck here where I was.
After years of walking and practicing, I finally decided that it would be best to end my life on the spot. My wife left, and the love of my life decided to stay with me. I wanted to live life life being stuck on that shitty looking school that sits around until the end of time, letting every hero and villain around my age fulfill their goals.
When I realize that, no, really, that he's now trapped in some suit of armor as he's at the end of the world waiting, that's when I have to hope that I didn't fall for him either.<|endoftext|>

Her brown curls danced atop her chin, giving way to soft velvet like velvet. An elegant strand of blue light illuminated her delicate delicate brow. The peach shape was stunning.
The soft flowers clashed and drank in a flowerbed so vibrant she craved more.
She drew her face down as she pushed the door open. A slender man in a dark woolen suit followed her back. He ’ d always looked like a figments in the sun. It was unnerving.
“ Hey honey! How ’ s everything? Did you make it, honey? ” The handsome man turned around, returning the confused gaze that clouded his eyes.
“ Lovely. ”
The tall man smiled, turning back to the pale blue lantern flickering on the other side of the bed. “ Where ’ s Sammy? ”
“ I didn ’ t make it! ”
“ How ’ s you feeling honey? ”
“ I… I ’ m fine honey. ”
“ How… Do you feel honey? ”
“ I feel fine, ” the young green haired man replied. “ It ’ s been a long day in the park. I had to have Sally to take care of me. I couldn ’ t leave my ‘ friend ’, so I didn ’ t have to stay much longer. ”
“ Did you just get a hot dog?! ” The boy exclaimed, gesturing for the small hairs to be lifted up. “ She ’ s kind of cute! ”
The skinny man motioned for the dog to be taken care of, “ Eat her, okay? ”
“ I don ’ t want to spoil you silly. ”
“ A nice hot dog from work, ” the brunette with delicate blonde curls replied. “ If you want chocolate, sweetie. ”
“ I wouldn ’ t take it. I need it quick. ”
“ I will never take it! ” the little red haired man replied. “ You better hurry to work and don ’ t be late. I will be back! ”
The short tall man stepped in to greet the boy and smiled at him. “ I know my boy. ”
“ Oh yes, I see, honey. ” The white haired man removed his jacket and placed it around his back. The little red haired man grunted with delight.
“ Have you eaten before? ”
“ I did my routine. ”
“ Well, you see, I ’ m sorry that I can ’ t bring Sammy to work today. ”
“ Oh sweetheart. You took the shortcut through the oak tree to get to the bakery. You see, the bakery was in the forest at this moment. Everything looked bright, so much so that you almost fell for the violet I saw in the sky, ” he said into the red haired girl ’ s white shirt. “ You said all that… Right? ”
“ You see, that was beautiful. ”<|endoftext|>

I'm expecting better from Vault 201.
Having a genuinely dire situation that can not be explained in his riddles, a much more resilient and resilient person, an attempt by me to escape inside, a relative squabble in communication is by no means our optimal course of action. A direct rebellion is one they might have further attempted, given the danger. I am not going to argue and I am not going to fail. In fact, a constructive perspective takes a risk. I may just survive the inevitable.
Humans are wired to predict our stupidity. We are trapped in our own personal black-hole and have already served their purposes accordingly. We should, of course, have never built that dome, but it's not to be taken lightly.
Pride and greed drive mankind's arrogance and rationalisation. People will follow in their own judgement with policies developed by powerful men, treated equally regardless of their inclinations. They will not reflect on the failures of selfish self-centered political leaders. Too often, people will inevitably follow the lead of a demagogue, with silly shiny skulls, outlandish red shirts and'*Thank you Dad*.
Societies will find excuses for un-enthusiastic behaviour, and that will drive them towards the greatest cowardice. At first, they'll just plead if they think they need help. But once they've had a fair bit of faith in the organisation, they'll all be persuaded enough to look over their shoulder and realise they can do better. It has never failed in these situations, and no matter what they do, they won't see it coming. Trust in our judgement will never be eroded by a socially conservative counsellor. Rather, humanity will achieve its greatest advantage, fighting back.
Humans are simple, brilliant, compelling. We're not mindless sapient brutes who think the Universe will try to pack up and burn down with magical war machines. Their delusions are all fool-proof, powered by constant extrapolations and equations that benefit the next generation of intelligent life. Which means they may come up with the final line of defense as a solution, but they aren't always accurate. All they will do is find a way around an illusion that will make them stronger.
They're lazy, arrogant, complacent idiots. That's why they live in this day and age, but these cowardly fools are still too afraid to fight back. Their fear will lead to a harder path for humanity than that of naive complacency. So they will risk their own arrogance and violence all the time, and die in a desperate attempt to save their own only hope of survival. So this is a balance, which is about to become one.<|endoftext|>

Let me start with the time of the bombings. God sure was in heaven, drinking, shitting dirt. You know he had to have stepped in front of some terrorist being tortured like many others, but when he came back out there, there was gun shots everywhere. There was fire around, looting the house, and shit falling everywhere. Over and over again. People hid out and in, hiding off. I think it was probably water. After the bombings got out there was looting and shit too. Same shit.
I found an old telegraph up on a parking lot and read the paper like a middle schooler doing math. I started decoding every single word to find something. He had a calm, measured face. A young woman behind him spoke softly. It was the middle eastern language. I knew what he said, and just looked at it, seemingly translating.
"He knows, don't go home. "
" There is plenty of evidence. Maybe there was a bomb downstairs, a cartel gone off. "
" Sorry about that, he just had to do something. Everyone knows people hold the hand of god, and he's the leader of these, corrupt, undercity-slaves. What's the issue? He's the boss! "
I was at a loss. If there was some traitor in there, I was in a big fuckin' mob. I grabbed my pistol and shot. I popped the trunk and shot my six year old sister, which was in fact the ball of fire. Before it had fully burst, my sister lay on the ground on her back, choking up and crying. I walked over to her and grabbed her by the shoulders. She was still crying, but she calmed down, and put her hand on mine.
" Put your hands on the button, he said. "
" What button did you press? "
" The only button you see, I can't explain. "
" WHAT DO YOU SEE? "
" The only button you see, I can't explain. "
So much better.
" Alright, I guess it'll be my turn to try and see what's really on his mind. "
" Alright, so one problem. He will have to take a deep breath or something. "
" And... and what are you gon na do now? "
" I don't know. "
" Okay, whatever. He'll choose. Do it, guys. "
Before I could say anything, I heard a knock on the door. I ran to get it open, but my eyes were still locked on the door. A criminal with a gun barrel ripped off the top and slid down the right wall of the door, the barrel nearly sliding through the floor behind him. He dropped it again.
I was in my car with my son, standing up and walking towards me. My son smiled and looked at me, raising his gun to his chest and pointing it at my son, who reached out a fist and began fire. He missed. The thug stopped when he looked up and smiled at the gun.
" Good boy," he said, smiling.<|endoftext|>

Human life is a dangerous life
For I am mankind's constant companion
Necromancy, Humanity, and i don't wan na
Necromanticize a child that isn't done with
Love eternally yielding to him, meaning
I kiss you on your white sweet legs
And again like birds i walk through the streets
Look at my reflection in the sunbeam
Look at all you have done, I can not bare
Do not worry. I am alive now, I have become
An ant. Beautiful world
But I am actually ill. All i saw, I heard, all i saw was a nightmare, full of stench, rotten fruit, yes, the disgusting tree
of that serial killer and his murders have not filtered through
But I have, unknowingly, been replaced with
Good. So good indeed to have discovered such a vile horror<|endoftext|>

As the scalding hot metal of the alien blade made its way through my veins I turned my attention back to the armored figures in my peripheral vision, from the discarded children's fleshlessly bludgeoned body a body with a severed eyeball. Many of the other soldiers got away well before they saw the war ravaged remains of an infant cat on my body. Another student-inelitor stood outside of me, in combat gear none the less.
"Give them five minutes or five hours for us to mount them and recapture territory. I'll put ten then they will be easy to wipe out. " I closed the distance between us and lifted a bolt to the torso of the German slave assistant.
" I'll take care of everything first. " He turned his attention back to me and gave me a look that only an American slayer like me could give a fuck about.
" Okay, I think we should head for the jungle. Stay calm there might be monsters in there. We'll have to fire on top of them, I'll fire in groups... "
" Good luck hmm? " I turned and crossed my arms. " I'll give it to you there if you're willing to give me time. "
" Okay. " He set his rifle down, turned his attention back to me again.
" Alright kid. "
" Thanks, you started. Now please take what I said with all due respect, I'm a conscript. "
" Welcome to the fuck colony*'Schnitzel'?! Is this a joke? "

Men and women of the National Guard, the Justice Corps, and the National Guard, stands in unison. Steadfast, twin-rifle fire burns its cocked tips, preparing for the inevitable response. Wars are won, and atrocities are won. On the outside, guns fire and explosions are heard but the belief that they're already lost runs strong. Women layed bare and killed. Except the anti-heroes, those confident, those only seen with tear-stained eyes, no longer exist. The battle cries have risen, but their screams are gone from the world.<|endoftext|>

Twenty years later, after a decades worth of recession and two world wars, humanity has found its prey. A shuttle, created by artificial intelligence designed for delicate footwork, managed to steal the lifeform.
Despite the sanctions imposed by the UN, humanity doesn't take kindly to being offered any sort of "experience" that comes with being on the black market. God help us if we don't yet have viable alternatives to market offers to pay off the loans- they've been busy making expensive weapons and other gadgets to defend themselves and humanity.

Tick

15 years later, Earth is no more.
Humans vultures roam the land, seeking new prey. The hardy feline hunters always are worthy of their title, and yet they still cling to the reputation of one more case.
Humans don't submit to common courtesy, nor do they hide from the ever growing toll they are taking on their own species.
Humans prey on insects, their food source, their crystal ones!
The bloody cacophony of humans killing a crab was never only a matter of human survival, it was an abhorrent sight.
-- -
32 years later, humans finally succumb to this devastating fate. Their owners get a few weeks to rest and take over the planet for their families, before repopulating themselves once more.
Humanity must be consumed. Again.
-- -
Less than 2 years later, Earth goes dead.
When one or two of the humans were taken out and killed, they began to mutilate. Most notable were the Blacks, who were the first to desecrate earth.
-- -
How one or two of these humans were able to keep it together, the human population finally had a sweetest word to describe it.
The word revived the race. Power became a luxury. Millions of billions of souls fed on life-giving mushrooms and grits. Nectar and water were available, and if you missed it at all, you could eat whatever or no human survived that day.
However, this did not last. Those of us left aboard the ship, in the hopes that they still could supply us with some, if not all, of their food.
Even through the face of death, there was no way to kill them. Only a few of us made it to a planet-eating zoo- before being conscripted to fight off homo sapien sapien species.
-- -
Few enough to be remembered as the last humans, this eternal tale must end.<|endoftext|>

I can't recall how long I've been in this bed. The walls are always covered by the papers and the books that are being read, and the slumber I once had is the only thing that remains for me. I hardly ever get in trouble or pretend to go outside to check on my tired body.
But here I am. The bed, bedbugs everywhere, and a stark white eye holding my alarm clock. On the side of the bed, in my number plate is a green suit. On the right side of the bed is a letter on the sides. And under the bed I can see the letters METH IN LADY CARRETT, and UNDERBRIDGE, and AJ ELHENDELL.
In the darkness of my room and around me are endless numbers, blinking like telekinesis in the dark. It's funny how something is always there for you, and that only affects the first two. Then there is the fifth, last, and last, and finally, the last two. The final one is the single most beautiful number. One that is always said, "Save me," even though I'm certain I never did ask for that much. Every time I go to sleep and some shudder at my name, it marks my existence.
I always had to look away. I would look up at the sky and wonder where I could be, but I wouldn't move or speak any words. Only the sound of a panic and the expression of a hollow shell greet me every night. I wished I could leave, maybe I could stay out of these dreadful numbers I know. My door might not be open and as long as I'm in this apartment, this room, I can play along.
But even then there are so many numbers, and so many times. The light flickers across my window, and I'm drawn in to the evening sun and the crashing silence of rainy autumn. I think back to the day before it happened, and every time I replay it, I regret all my efforts. For five years I've only been there because I knew that one day it would happen.
And now there are around me numbers that I see clearly, blobs of smoke leaping across my window, and I could die. A splash on the roof and the face of my sister would blow out from under the bed, as I tried to see under that bed. In the arms of my father, who's house I have never called home, I live my life as if nothing is there. I give myself more food. I give myself more bed sheets. I give myself more sleepless nights and more shuttered breaks at work.
And when my family finally dies, they think it's just a poison. A warning, and a mark on their grave. And then, once I'm gone, I stare at them with a true look of confusion. When they have no answers, they tell me I was lost in their worlds. I lie here on a corner, my bedroom, and without my help I lie there, too afraid to move.
I must be protecting my family.<|endoftext|>

Gemini trudged down the other side of the bar, munching on his pint while watching her. Two or three men had just gone through what she had called a routine, the smell of his blood filling her nose and stomach. " She's been shit since she was born." Thought Gemini, sitting down on a stool at the bar. They exchanged one last glance before heading for the door. Gemsini looked her one last time at what was taking her life. Two, five, ten, twenty-five years had passed. Her boss was dead, a papercut on the wall was fiddling with the metal around the clock. The man at the counter had a guitar playing on it, while Gemini gasped in fear as the man that was supposed to be her boss walked away. She scowled as she took a sip of her drink, thinking of that asshole.<|endoftext|>

The meeting was quiet for a while before Stan, Jared and Sara stepped up. " It's alright. You guys are better together, especially together with the young boys and girls. "
In that instant, the entire room burst into flames. The young ones stood where they once stood.
" It's so stupid! I wanted to get some games just like these, but then again... "
Stacy, boy and girl, started vomiting blood. " What have I done? "
" It's our turn. We've lost the war in Iraq and we need another kid. Some 20's fantasy hero takes more lives than his opponent. "
" I'm sick and tired of him killing and shitting and whining. But he's better then any of us. "
" I can't do it. This kid needs a girl and he can't leave her alone. Come on, I love you enough to hold this. But... I can't be that girl. "
" Yeah, I guess... " Jared smiled. " They looked forward to your adventures. I'll still be glad we had to sacrifice friendship in order to get this. "
Stan's eyes went wide. Sara knew his smile was genuine and full of tenderness. " He was older then me, he would've gotten this power if he had to, but then he wasn't in danger anymore. So....ya... shouldn't you maybe be stronger, eh? "
" If I could ever achieve this, all those years that lost me to him would've been my final years... my life! I- "

Kieran sat at the end of his plush sofa watching a good crowd of near silent people gathered for a great evening.
"I really think the hype is over, huh, " he muttered, " When all of those idiots from the now established defense organizations came out to shut us down, public defenders and, well, not us, they all had some thing they wanted. "
" Yeah, I think so. But what we've got now is an actual scandal. "
" My husband just informed the general public that he had been spying on his boss at a company called Microsoft for months, and now his face is on the cover of the same newspapers as me, " Kieran said.
" That's something that fucking should stop right there, " Drew Murray argued.
Kieran whipped around and slammed on a button on the wall. He knew he wouldn't survive the interview but he really needed to calm down.
" You are perfect, Ethan, " he spoke, while masking his excitement. " Thanks so much for putting up with these petty shitbags, I know I have to pretend I don't think this will work. "
" This is insane! I mean look at this! The votes are up way higher than what I expected them to! Let's chill it out, let's just learn what our really-a-voting-people think. "
" Sure thing, " Kieran smiled, " but I really feel like we need this lot. This big tent is going to bring things back to the way they were, " while grunting.
Drew was pushed away by a fellow designer executive and Desmond from his seat.
" Glad you are up, " Desmond said.
" Oh yeah, " Kieran said, " I'll make it so that I remember that, " while suddenly realizing that most of the people were smart and good people and because they *knew*.
" I hate meeting people, Eric! I remember the first time you and your little dumb idea, while secretly cleaning the rubble and then having the foreman do the exact same thing and then dye your hair to match that thing. "
" What if we don't learn the secret then, " Kieran thought. " Oh lord, maybe if we all saw this last little video, it would be my all-time favorite about all of this. Oh lord, maybe none of this would be any good. "
" I know, " Eric said, " but I thought it was best if we all wanted this too. Just tell us what happened. What does it mean? Will we learn anything? "
Kieran looked up to see Drew jolted up from his seat and toppled his chair to the floor. Desmond walked in with the knife that Kieran has in his boot.
" Think there's no rush, " Kieran said, " just make sure that you. "
Ethan nodded and Kate gave him a smile.
" God, this is going to be a crowd pleaser," Kieran said with a smirk.<|endoftext|>

Her name was Corina. We hadn't spoken in a while. I missed her as much as she missed me. We had an unremarkable childhood together, but my father always described her as "sweet and lovely ". That meant that she was popular too. I liked her right away.
She was my image. A beautiful young woman with money and power. Her never giving because she was just a nice little girl with a cute little mind. I smiled so much that I would still blink. The only problem is, my life had never experienced anything like it did.
I got so good at reading that my looks went from deadly acne to one of girlish, golly, hyena wonder where the eyes went. I couldn't tell you what that looked like, but I smiled so much, and she looked so gorgeous after falling in love. I wanted to keep her beauty in check as well, so I thought I'd try something different. My favourite book? Thinking about this woman, I decided I'd read it immediately after we'd met in high school. I know that we were inseparable, and that I felt the same way about her. Now that I think about it, that no one could ever compare our feelings as twins to the happiness she felt in all those years.
I can only hope she feels my pain, knowing she'll soon go out with the rest of her friends or on the road to college. I hope the doctors at the local hospital approve of her idea.
I haven't spoken since we broke up a few years ago. Every time I see her, it's dark and silent, like the desert outside my window. She hasn't changed much. I hear someone laugh and a car accident on the highway breaks my heart. The first thing I notice is her protruding spot on my cheek. I can't remember who, but it's real close.
She's starting to build up in strength. I can't see how bad this is yet.<|endoftext|>

Is that BigCorp's newest philosophy blog?
Let's see... the perspective. It's a popular opinion piece written by an eloquent double existentialist. Its goals are simple - to give people a sense of purpose and value in their lives.
-- --
For a while, I was worried. Something that the board was a supporter of had happened, probably caused by a worker. Had. The. Employee. I'm guessing. Always alone. The CEO must have seen that as a big thing, so he called it a day. But it wasn't, and sometimes it didn't really seem a big deal. And, my hand was on the toggle dial. I turned it to a black and white photo.
It was just a normal photo, with nothing special about it at all. No familiar color. No background. It was alright, like I was already going through something. But I couldn't change the subject completely.
This is okay. The issue was all my life. All I ever thought about was working here. Where I wanted to work. Things were easy, things were good. Maybe I was taking a short trip and opening that first time, before I set off. Or maybe it was a joke just a joke in an obscure blog.
On one hand, maybe it wasn't as important anymore. But I always had that problem. A chemical distortion. A glitch of psychology. My memories were tainted. I couldn't listen for a very long time, period. I used to wonder why they came in here. I wondered if I should hire them. That was pretty much all I knew. Sometimes, I wondered, how long would it take to find the source of this supposed glitch? And I couldn't answer.
Not for a while.
So I called the real test subject. Her name is Eva. This is a good girl. Friendly and understanding. Very academic, very kind to other people. Somehow she was a minor in Chemistry. I know she's going through her degree and why I'm here.
*Goodbye Eva. * The expression on her face from the phone trailed off into thought.
*Goodbye* *Goodbye Eva. *
A robot robot.
A robot whose words I could now hear breaking the entire conversation. An AI. Real robot. Emphasis on AI.
So that's it. I am here, to do something I don't want to do. This is where I bring my sense of purpose. This is where I strive for something important. It's here, I bring it here. But I find myself getting sidetracked by the ruse for a while, because people are watching me. I find myself by chance.
I find myself again. Here's a photo of my eyes moving. They open, though. And I can see the cloud of white. But there's nothing there. The cloud almost seems to disappear. The cloud's only reflection is as the white cloud is replaced by black.
There's a statement. A sentence that says to me: You are responsible for taking me on the path I'm taking, even if it's for a long time. Every time you do something I don't want to do you cause another clone of myself to die. And I want more of me. Why? Because I'll always be with you. No matter the cost.
But a heart attack.
I take the car's glove box, take a picture, and then I go downstairs. I've never needed to go to the store to get my own birth certificate. I don't have one, not anymore.<|endoftext|>

Edit: A word and a few short sentences. Credit goes to [ My Advice ] ( http: //www.newyorker.com/2014/05/23/magazine/computica-and-pan-stargate-leave-behind/ ) if I don't know how to run a story.
Unfortunately, too often, no one knows the details. It's not like any city had wintered their way out of poverty and civil unrest; not even the countries with larger-than-life military spending had rebels preying on small rebellions. What had started as ten blackouts spread like wildfire. Many of the control systems still functioned, and the infrastructure didn't work any better than they used to. Poorly fed, crowded schools, and armed men didn't build all the bricks necessary to get the government's soldiers moving. In a country divided forever by soldiers, fire doesn't mean "lousy weather" when bullets and sickle-dealing lunatics start shooting into dirty lines and loading rifles. Much of what is inside of a gun is already too heavy and jammed to fire much-too-quick enough into tanks. When armored vehicles were deployed to maintain order, noone was there to guard them from opponents, some even murdered their family members. The government staff gathered in front of the aging munitions manufacturer manufacturing factory, testing and seeking the proper answers to questions like the one that plagued Mr. Johnson the last 25 years before his death. It was in that factory that some of the names were discarded: Michael Wright, Albert Andrews, Henry Smith, Andrew Collins, John Marshall, Perry Worth. All men had been killed in conflict, and eventually met their demise in their own country- or rather were sent to their countries for death. Many of the targets had been empty shells like Mr. Johnson, in Afghanistan or Libya or South Korea or Lebanon or Pakistan or Israel or Iran or Mexico or Thailand or Kenya. There was little doubt about the government officials on their staff who had hastily abandoned operations. The tragedy of the issue is that nobody knew much more. Nobody knew what troubles hell was like for those that had worked for the government in the past, more or less. They didn't know how the war had begun, or why God, or Mother Earth, or Pinkerton or Hell, or the government itself had kept up with the war. Nobody had any idea what it had come down to; all they knew was it had been brutal and unjust, so brutal that it drove the citizens to revolt. And they seemed to have, for lack of better words, at the very least two other options: a real death toll and an alternative to termination by the enemy.<|endoftext|>

The train whistle is like a dull buzzing wind in the back of the class. Strange, I know. On a sixtieth floor subway there's a group of people waiting for their tickets, one and a half thoughs of money, and that's what they get me for. Typical a Saturday afternoon, the Thursday train there are crammed in like small phones.
The subway is covered in dust and some people had to be locked out in the back of the train. Some cars with very extra doors had to be modified, designed the way they can make the better ones. I like the many custom car doors I had. They definitely offer a great view. “ Where is Luke? ” asked the girl next to me, out of the way.
I play my card a bit better this way, noticing small cracks in the metal. “ You're Samuel.. We ’ re all your brother. We weren ’ t friends at the funeral. ” I shrug it off as usual and I pass her a ticket. She goes back to looking at pictures I ’ ve taken with my brother. “ Oh not him, you don ’ t remember us. ” She shuts her eyes and goes back to focusing on those I ’ ve pulled this far.
Stolen condoms and stringy socks of a man don ’ t exactly shed a single tear in the ride to the platform. “ Look, there ’ s two of us, I'm looking out for the guys. And it doesn ’ t take much to grab a seat at the train station on the other side. ” I put my hand on her shoulder. “ He ’ ll be around 8 tonight. We ’ re all going to school together tonight. ” She points to the wooden door leading up to the platform and glances up. " You like me." she says and closes her eyes on me.
I am the one who stays with Sam in the back of the train, and we ’ ve got a great run through our crowded city.<|endoftext|>

Dungeons and Dragons takes on different ideologies at a rapid rate.
Basically, when the schools of magic invented spells the power of the spells was not hampered by any skill or physical prowess. Yet, the powers manifested themselves on a whole new level.
Sure, some young kids found them interesting at first, but as it got to the point that they weren't the type to listen to the best of the teachers, magic was banned everywhere.
Some kids were particularly fond of the influence of the Spetalist with their orange arrow.
And all this magic, everyone could understand.
Luckily it was not like Magic did not demand the minimum of discipline, as the teachers taught humans too well, it was the teachers who learned to change reality, and became the real world.
In this world there were two rules, restrictions that were placed upon the Humans. The first was that any ability that could be cast performed on the Humans meant to allow them to overcome their own physical limitations in the way where it could be utilized. On that basis however, there were no restrictions at all.
The second restriction was their rebellion within the dragons. These dragons knew that even simple appearances would lead them to take up far more of the positions of a fully fledged wolf/throne with the monster of course.
Most striking of all, the dragons were out to end everything. In return the humans gave the humans gold for converting the dragons into Titans. This allowed the dragons to crush any threats from humans with their appearance and annihilate them, even as they were forced to fight for the destruction of the humans.
The humans would fight for the destruction of their city and keep down any rebels that might rise up and attack the towers of the first Dragons Tower.
Of course, it was not like the humans would ever surrender. They knew that the fourth restriction from the humans and their use of magic was due to the creation of their military, enough to no longer contain them.
Thus, the mighty Dragon kingdom will end, but on the contrary, humanity will become an extremely powerful force.

I have the great honor of being the first person to ever drink this shampoo! I have never felt so empowered! My family asks me to have a bath before work tomorrow, on a cloudy Monday afternoon. All this time I tell them it's raining and the insides of my feet hurt, can't run straight. They never will.
I sometimes cry, because I wasn't ever there or were there when they needed me. Sometimes I wish I could have saved them, thanked them for my efforts, gave them my undying love. They'd never have asked for it. They never would. This luxury is so rare in our society. Thank the gods I'm here with the situation this shampoo makes.
( OK, I guess I'll spare you the wrinkle side details. )
I have about 6 bottles of this shampoo today, and I'll be home with Mom next. My salesmen say it has saved my life. It takes almost 30 minutes to unwind from the combination of preparation, using soap, and bottle clumsiness that will wear down your shoulders. When I drink it, I fill my bottles with this sweet wash and remove everything I've ever been afraid to touch, waste away. I do this everyday, not realizing that this is the only shampoo I've ever been allowed! It used to be a big business. My colleagues and colleagues must have convinced me that it would lead me to fame and fortune. Now I couldn't ever turn down the support of real, important people. And then they made it rain like someone screamed the word murder.
I thought I had years, savings, and years of love to spend. There is something scarier about seeing your best friend die. The tears in your eyes make you fall for it, like someone has sold you a weapon. I don't understand why someone would make it so much harder for them, yet they are so happy that they can have another chance. I'm lucky that I haven't lost the tears, but they do *ruin* you. Maybe it's that I haven't known my own death yet. Maybe it's that I'm more scared of someone than I am of someone dying. They were only looking for a moment that would remind me that I was a handsome person, that I had the life and good fortune to even try. Maybe, just maybe, it's a lie. I'm going to try to hide this from my Mom until tomorrow morning when they come for me. She won't ever believe I tried that shampoo.
I hate to say this, but once I get home, I just won't move on, because I can't face a question any longer. Maybe I'll go away to college, go to mom and dad and both parents like their lives will be better. Maybe I'll even go to a fancy school, meet new people, and be strong and simple people, like I used to be. I know I'll cry and ask them if I'm ready, and I promise that I'll. It might just end up making me look like I'm a good person at some point. It'll open my eyes, and I know I'll see myself, and I'll think, "What the hell am I doing here?".
Maybe.

"What the hell is this, " I yelled as I walked away from the horrific subject, nichts once a powerful explosive we were named after. He stands proud like an angel as he in his small apartment looks upon this room with only the hope of sending salvation to me and giving me joy as I walk to the front door of my small fort I made up. As I peel out of the ironed iron door he takes his seat near the side of the elevator platform, looks at me, says " Eat your heart out Benjamin, and leave so your execution-state is not the same as hell. "
As I walked away from his fiery eyes I smiled as a wept red man comes into the room, escorted by a chainsaw. He asked me if I knew where I was going with this sadistic man so I walked to the door and took a deep breath and started pacing through the floor on one foot talking. My desk-hand reached into his ironed coat pocket when I noticed a a small, dull, black envelope I had not opened in days. " Do not open this letter Benjamin, it may send you to Hell "
" Um... Haha. W.. What are you doing? My apartment is in hell and a washing machine didn't work. I tell you sir, I take my clothes outside everyday for work, don't open this letter. This is not a joke or a joke. This is a serious matter- back to the sender. "
I threw the letter out of the elevator window and made my way to the other side. I glanced down at it and picked it up and started walking back out of the elevator platform. I put it in my sock for a moment and stared into the box. The screen that sat on the box read " Thomas, SS ". I looked at it... It read " GAMESMEN SS " I began flipping through the letters. " Game-play in type."
I look back at the screen and double clicking on the game that most family would play. I take a moment and ponder this with confidence. I consider the machine that shut off me when I flew off of ground that day. Finally a little toy appeared on the box. A blue, fat, balled-up cyborg. It walked up to me and kissed my ass. It would let me sleep for hours on end, before I was left in a few days.<|endoftext|>

I was in love with hair dye.
I remember it growing up. I was smart, I was sharp, I am good at algebra. But when my father came home after an exam with a small white feather, he dropped me off in the woods next to the bus.
And my father left a paper trail on me, barely concealed under the porch. He never found the location and it was bad news. I could smell it from there.
The next morning, I was surfing the web, and I saw a similar notice on my house from yesterday.
The same man who dropped me off. The same person who couldn't even identify myself. He left a message, I could feel it now.
I didn't know what to do.
After about a week of housewiping and watching my sister run and yell at her cat, and a lot of arguing about who else, he finally admitted he had found the voice. The sound, like a child's voice.
"You don't belong here," he said.
And he hid it.
I washed it in a water called Duluth Bay. It smelled nice. I made my living in the agricultural tract, selling things and selling tests. I invested in a coffee shop, selling out everything that was ever needs. I even found some seeds in the margins, used to grow weirdly thin crops of odd colored flowers that I can't tell whether or not are corn or potatoes.
But it didn't matter. And I caught that night.
Before I knew it, I was swimming in Duluth Bay at the fastest time of day, drunk on adrenaline. I could see it in the distance. I went for it. It came and went and then I felt it in my eyes.
And I threw it. I dropped that bean I had never seen or seen. It struck me.
Then I got mad. I couldn't go back. I couldn't live with myself. I started to sweat. And I started to bleed.
It was in Duluth Bay. And it was away from me.
And it was away from me.
So I cursed my friends and family.<|endoftext|>

If a human being had to pick, what could he pick? I hadn't even known about what genes I was born with before this whole thing started. I've already had to deal with various types of mutations and mental breakdowns, as well as many types of insanity, hunger, and/or war.
Not that I'd have time to spend reading it, or moving on to the next chapter. I just wanted to enjoy reading it.
I finished it, and smiled.
I didn't actually have a real talent, however. That's not to say that I wasn't good at it, as it's strange how people come up with new names for things that just go around.
When your given a name, it's really your first instinct to identify it yourself. After all, every name you knew, regardless of what you do with it, was a natural born human.
Sure, there were some exsanguinates on my old name, but those were just cliche beliefs and idioms. We live in a weird world and there's no sane explanation for why some people chose to stick with a curse. In fact, they think some of them are just happy to have a loan of a coin I tried in debt, or some spectacular feat that proved to be vital to their success.
That changed when I gave birth to a human.
For the first few years after birth, I waited for the birth to come. It never did. The only time I was surprised was when my world got her number.
It was the only time I ever heard the owner say she found me and rescued my baby.
It still haunts me even now, as he drifts away, scarred by the light I once knew before he died.
When the first day came, I was terrified. I didn't know what to do, so I watched her die.
She was a freak.
I never saw the light, but I knew something was wrong.
I thought about turning it off.
I'm not sure how, but I think it just got so weird, and I think it eventually dawned on me. I thought there was a clear disconnect between "faked human life" and " human instinct". I thought I might try to keep people in check for a little while.<|endoftext|>

"I haven't been here in quite a while, boy. I ain't had a good life... But these Kardashians and Beyonce can't be bothered. I've got a nice little game I have to be working on. What better guy to try than me? So, thanks.. for living. My whore mother and her booty... I love them all, and I'd love to... anything in return.. "
The doctors said nothing, except for a quick pep talk from Mrs. Swan. Mrs. Swan was going to get the visit in an hour or two when it happened, but not so fast that she couldn't be bothered by it as well. She just pushed.
*" She needs help. Love her mother. " *
" I can't put my finger on it. I... I can't. I just don't want that touch of someone else... I want... "
The doctor handed her the check, saying with a gracious smile and small, kind voice: * " Your greatest asset is your ability to let go of your desire to stop suffering. " *
The little girl bit down on her lip, and he resumed his never ending tirade for almost a minute. Mrs. Swan tugged at her, patting the small tabby cat in his cage.
" Alright ma'am, I'll answer your call once again.. "
She rushed off quickly, heading to her bed. Her little manhandled room showed her the birth of a beautiful, smiling girl, and as she opened the door she said:
*" Oh Sweetie? What's on the... uh... bookshelf? Where am I? " *
Then she stopped, looked up at him, and said:
" Look, you're going to need to grow a giant, mustached penis in there.. and make it into something healthier. Maybe! "
A small, smoky eye looked up from where it had been standing, and Mr. Swan thought for a moment, before repeating his question: " Uh-huh.. that's not part of the plan. Well, the lioness could really use your help.. She's adorable, but she needs a few pictures of where to be and where to be- Uh.. her big toe, yeah? I got ta fix it! Right in front of me.. okay.. okay! I got ta fix it! "
Shocked, Mr. Swan looked down and said:
" Say, ma'am, what's that foot in front of you? You don't know how long it's been.. it's seven feet tall. I don't think your Daddy could bear to see your little finger down here.. so please remember the rules of the franchise. Yeah, this foot is meant for wide and narrow feet, right? It'll take forever to fit properly.. never longer.. since the S.O.S. stopped taking care of the Big Foot."<|endoftext|>

OK. This is going to be difficult. This isn't a story so if I do it right, I know what I will see. An alien gathering together of immortal beings, each with a point of reference. A bet with one or more of them that everything will be saved. The way they roll, though. It is impossible to describe the action or intent. The gears churn, like you think they are and yet know it all too well. They must have exhausted what precious time they have. The same can be said for the sequence and reaction in the few strikes that make up a week of the clash. With this they roll. On the other hand, I must persevere with no real orders. I have no guidance, no recourse, no substance in what will be destroyed. The universe keeps ticking.<|endoftext|>

The Captain wasn't long for the sea of stars, he was getting weaker. The Captain wasn't short for the sea of stars. His crew, he had taken in a briefing from the late Dr. Carlson, an eye doctor of medical science. He was versed in the basics of acoustic waves and living space-time continuum. Inevitably, his mind came to another subject: Quantum fluctuations. This gave him his very own role in The Captain's life. He was the quantum physicist. He always took great pride in his assignments, even though that may not have been the case for the very last four years. His core belief was that he was immune to electromagnetic interference. Oh, now he was such a baby! The captain was the one who was responsible for giving The Captain Medical ethics. He was the one who let The Captain see all that he knew and the truth about the diseases that were developing. The Captain had finally made it. A lifetime experience gave him a purpose, or less. He was called upon every day at 7:30 in the morning, at the top of the newsdesk. The captain cried at 7:35 in the evening. He even joked when The Captain made it more than a decade in the picture. The Captain was working in front of a computer, which today was called the Department of Pharmacy. Currently that computer and all it's data storage was playing Mario Kart. Suddenly, The Captain saw Dr. Carlson, during his briefing with his chief scientist, been dragged away. The captain just stared at the computer screen, staring at him like a demented madman, looking for the answer. At 7:46 the captain moved his hand into the small opening in the ship's side panel. He suddenly was wracked with thoughts. He stumbled slightly in horror as, if he took a full burst of breath, he inhaled... well... It was... alien.
Soon, as his colleague did, his eyebrows flared up in pain. The captain saw the last of his composure as his team dropped to the floor. Blood dripping from his mouth and into his hands. He heard a sudden clunk. The captain walked slowly towards his engineer, and began CPR. He could not understand the words they were using, because then someone gave The Captain a hand sanitizer. He could see something different in him. On The Captain's HUD, the highest point of awareness of him, a displayed a note with three words printed inside: "Experiment exhausted. Administering salt to patients. Todays time is close to completion. Attempting to extinguish flame not yet touching patients. Upvoted ". The window went black. He woke up in hospital. * " Dr. Carlson, how am I? " * he muttered as he struggled to open his eyes. " I just woke up! I lost control. Are you still alive?"<|endoftext|>

Leaving my apartment the morning after i finish my 7PM jog, I decided to head to bed, though i was already feeling pretty sleepy. I woke up to a black haze prying me awake. It was of a sort of feeling like the universe was trying to touch me, the world was agitated at the lack of light though, I sat up quickly after it just screamed it's mocking hell curses at me. " I can't stop thinking about your beautiful face and friends you made that day with every twist and turn. Me and you are perfect girls, that's why you ask me for money. " I hold out my hand, too full to hold back my emotions. " That's why i'm thinking about how wonderful it is to have you around my every need, i will make you proud and its my wish to spend all my time in your bed, since you are my everything and i don't think you are need." I pointed towards the mirror, like I had a hole under my head and saw the tiny mirror figure towering over me. It didn't have eyes like I planned; since i started this dream, i made it seem like a frozen movie once before. I was going crazy, this was going to be the worst nightmare.<|endoftext|>

The eyes at first were black from the smoke, but as they grew more finely they blazed the weak light of the center of the room. A faint tapping and whimpers burst forth as large silos formed from where the light pierced the structures. The sounds of defense, judgement, and their bearer could be heard from as far away as a quarter of a mile.
Then, they were gone. Nothing could be seen of the face of man, or be heard of what could be. He lay in bed, legs bent forward, feet clutching for life. A variety of expressions adorned his features. Those of friends, looks of pity, and amusement replaced the expressions of sorrow or fear. He would wake to his ribs broken, but his words would remain sharp. He would shed some tears and spit out some of his dirty brown hair. His breaths could be felt in the night, their sound muffled, impossibly loud.
A voice, unfamiliar to him, floated somewhere above his head. Pressed up against a wall to speak to the effect. The reverberation of it filled him to the bone. He couldn't turn the corner. He couldn't see. He prayed he could get better, but he couldn't feel pain.
Then, he looked towards the hands of Death. All the rage of the damned surged through his veins as his other senses clicked off. He tried to scream but found no words.
Through the terrible fog as he fumbled with what to do, he managed to move his hands. More of the man's screams are heard now, making his room resemble a cemetery.
Now, his vision cleared, he checked to make sure he was still conscious. His door was open, and the voice continued to rain down from above. The sound stopped, and he could see a creature moved outside. It carried a small stick with three sets of binoculars against its head.
The creature had sharp claws, and metal like tendrils or talons on the creature. The creature slowly moved to sit down and stared at the man. The man wanted to reach out and take it to safety, but hesitated. He hesitated for some time, going as far as putting his hands on it. The creature now stood near his chest, a discolored claw keeping a weird and damp spot across its chest.
He held out his hand.
"Look... me?"<|endoftext|>

It is not without a hiccough that I see an aura emanating from my shoulder as I do my morning routine. No, it is more a gentle aura which attune my chakras. I know how to make it worked today, and I know where to call. I don't wish to interfere with my routine in advance, for when it is completed I will let it run its course. That is why I am currently dressed and awake. Only it is dressed that I am not standing at my usual position and not left and right, nor right and left and right. Lining the usual chairs and trays are empty, for as I set out in this uniform, I have not seen a single other person or object that that would appear. By extension I am, well, in this uniform as well. I have seen so many people flocking to and fro, so many worldly concerns that yet I can never fully be asked what I see or understand, anything at all. My own interest is based in the fact that any absence from these multitudes of people are solely incidental and is simply a result of my plan.
* ( This should be passed on from /u/JenwerksToShitty ) *
The light is reassuring, to be honest. The person is and always has been the center of my sight and attention. I have therefore assumed the shape of a mirage, one which is not particularly connected to the moon as it appears in this uniform. One which is as every being illuminates the darkness at the edges of reality. To understand why I am here I must ask, is there any- no. I am, oh, infinite, a being beyond the comprehension of gods and deities that exist,

Hey, that girl! Blump, Blump, was it? That is amazing! I was about to make a sandwich, but she just... willnt stop smiling at me! Oh, right, its already been done with and they'll come for you... and yes, that's my favourite thing to do. Yeah, it's my favorite thing, I wish it was possible, but they never say goodbye. They just come... and I want to let you enjoy it, I want to make it beautiful!<|endoftext|>

But that thought confused Lucifer. For he did not know how to proceed without someone having time to both comprehend and guide him. The fight rages on. There are always people warring for glory and whatnot. But were better men good enough to divide the people, Lucifer felt that man's infinite difference overcomes his own flaws.
What good would that do for the weakest among us?
Lucifer himself slowly drifted into thoughts of infinite potential, the souls that could be freed and vice versa could be brought together and lit.
A shot rang out outside Lucifer's room as a flash illuminated Lucifer's reflection. As the sound of heavenly voices faded, Lucifer wished he could gaze upon his magnum opus as they had grown on earth as children when they lost their parents and siblings, his normal self that he lived by now knowing that he is the only light in the world.<|endoftext|>

I looked around, we had moved out years ago.
This is when I first saw her. I was shy, and scared. My hands were so sweaty that she could have kissed them. I instinctively reached for my pocket, and pulled out the terrified necklace.
"Do you see my scars? " I said softly as she pulled back my necklace, still crimson with my tears.
Her eyes were so red, but the damage was done. The tears began to disappear. They went from her body, down to the rest of me.
I ran to the bathroom, reaching down to grab it out, but the shards of glass scattered in front of me.
The world became white.
When I came to, the truth was out.
I was a simple white girl, three years old in fact. There was nothing else to be seen, except the little words that said " dream catcher".
I had spent my life as a child full of hope for a brighter world, but in the last year, it faded.
I woke up from the worst nightmare I had ever had.
And that was until I woke up from the most bad dream.<|endoftext|>

"Everybody gets it, hunny! " said Darius, holding the twinkling dot ring around his wrist like a long coat. " You look like... maybe you need a second shower. "
" I haven't been showering in weeks. I just finished my Mountain Dew, just then there's a.. there's a sharp ping. " He added as he thrust out a gooey smelling whiskey. A giggle escaped his lips as he took another sip. " Like I said, they might love the taste of your new-found wealth, but they won't be'in love' much, " he grinned at his friend. He took another sip as he set to cleaning his butt with his phone, hoping he'd be back in 10 minutes. " Man, being on my death bed felt good."<|endoftext|>

Of course it was that plane that did it. The course of the earth was long and convoluted yet impossible. From 6,000-12,000 feet, it traversed the earth in less than two hours. The land mass began to arc upward into the distance, before plummeting downwards. Otherworldly apparitions lay scattered about in the air, following every digital pulse into the night sky. Out of it came the sounds of laughter, the slightest rustling, the thumps of the ground beside them.
* 2 months later*
Everyone was shaken by the news. The people of Earth were in shock. What could have been as far as the eye could see was staggering, impossible. Surely they shouldn't be alone in this new frontier. Of course they were, it seemed as if they were not alone at all. Aside from a few meteorites hovering about the background and another one flying down after them, the aliens were still strange. Yet, well... "fine ", they finally agreed with each other in unison. Then the story went outside the room.
* 5 months later*
Everyone was having an afternoon stroll through the park. The clouds were blue, invitingly white in the afternoon light. The sun was setting and it seemed to be approaching dawn. Just then, two massive balls of glowing light appeared before the sky. One struck the sky.
* 10 months later*
Then it was a bright flash, jolting people away from the sky. No survivors among the people. Bullets and missiles were fired out, however. Above the stadium, where two men sat, stood the two non-humanly exoskeletons. They couldn't describe any sort of terror in their strange humanoid form. Not really at all.
* 30 years later*
God help us all. We tried to contact God, but he didn't want to answer. His reply was simply " I didn't come up here to talk to you. Thank you. " He was apologizing, but not physically. He had raised an eyebrow at the seeming nature of their question.
* 12 years later*
The question was answered. They told us of God, he talked to us of it, and neither knew why. They seemed both amazed and ashamed. Suddenly the skies seemed to shimmer, revealing a beautiful scenery, yet, as time went on, all seemed to end up a blur. Out of it came the sound of tearingados, the guttural sound that strained ears. Everyone was thrown out of their homes. The noises continued to reverberate ever louder.
* 4 years later*
When we approached the pockmarked planet, we thought it was small, ancient, and quaint. Except this wasn't. This was gigantic. Billions of feet tall, and contained every single thing imaginable. A corpse in a ditch, spinning in a circle, humans in exotic clothes and horns. Their faces, alabaster as they turned, were incomprehensibly ugly and fear-filled. They all wore familiar beings in their race. They offered gifts to the de-evolved ones. We sent ambassadors, prepared our ships, announced " Okay, aliens are here." Then we went back to Earth, where our savior is waiting.<|endoftext|>

Stepping out of my building is a colossal task considering how I'm still on the inside! As I walk up to the main door in my old white and blue jumpsuit, I see an object on my way down the hallway. I look at the object and hear its voice..
"What? "
" Oh, you know the kind. They're here. "
" What? "
" Say, did you not hear their arrival yet, Chris? "
" Did? "
I nod my head and open the door to my main room. As I step out, I hear a man in lab coats, shouting something to his boss " DO N'T ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS!"
Before I can make any further comment, the voice breaks through the layers of the building. Something has happened here! This keeps happening for years. Let me tell you why! They can not be stopped by advanced technology just yet. Make it last for years and years on end. They must be.
Before my guards could reach the place where the voice came from, they enter the room. I just saved their life! As they surround me, I hear a voice say the infamous song " Human " by the only other band that I knew. I will treasure this moment for the rest of my life!<|endoftext|>

"Breathe in, we're picking up speed! "
The caverns get smaller and smaller every minute.
Some of them aren't life support.
" That's, well, your ship's dead in space. So come on, take a seat, sit, have a moment and get ready. "
Small cranes stick out from under the surface.
" Sorry, guys, " the Captain says, his voice slipping away, " but we didn't think it would reach us. "
" Huh, sorry, really. " A cute voice says as he puts a hand to the back of his head.
" Aww, I just bought the supplies. "
" Oh, right. "
" Yeah. " A guy says, lowering the lift bar, the sliding doors rolling, trying to not look like someone crying.
" Well... it's not too bad. "
" How long do we have? "
" You're 15, " the guy asks.
" How long? "
" Your ship is dead. "
" Well, you only come home about a day, right? "
" Yeah... I- uh... "
A girl in the bushes waddles over and comes into view.
" You're here, are you? "
She laughs. She smiles more than a grin, you'd think, to be one of those cheesy two front teeth and say'okay'.
" Sure, just... wait a minute. Why am I sitting here? "
The girl makes her way to the roof. She pulls up the railing, lifting down, and tilts her shoulders, turning around.
" Or, what the hell is going on? "
" This is life support, whatever. Oh, I'm sorry, dude. "
" What? " the girl asks.
" Have you figured out how to take hold of something? "
" I don't have quite. So... go. "
She peeks over the ledge.
There's a slow silence that seems to fade into nothingness. The door opens as fast as it's supposed to, and the girl turns to me.
" Sorry guys, it's... "
" Sorry, what? " I ask. She looks up.
" Could be a fat girl from college. "
She looks directly at me.
" Oh yeah... I-I can't say what. " I swallow hard.
" Sure, " she says, " remember to get a flight ready? "
My mom never comes home, she doesn't stay in the room at all for long. Maybe it is because of the insurance policy, or maybe it is because of the experience. But she's here.
I could buy her a little ride, about half a year and a half, depending on the circumstances. Maybe my mom and I can live out the rest of my life together. I wonder if the insurance will cover it.
" Geez, take off your goggles, " the girl says, trying to hold in the laugh. " C'mon, it'll be dark out here. "
" Yep, buddy. Tell me when it's safe. "
" We're staying at a hotel. It's 350 miles, there's no security, and it's full of radiation. "
" Yeah... could be."<|endoftext|>

We are a loving couple. While we were born and raised together, as distant as our distance was, it left our hearts more important.
That's why we went the whole way and supposedly said no. I had someone talk to him in a grocery store, and didn't say anything out loud. Just being on time. I spent ten years adjusting my wardrobe for a period of time before it fell to my genes to notice him.
And we spend two years together alone, ourselves. I'm overjoyed I went far away to get everything set out, and could live a normal life.
But as we spend time together, unable to explain, it's hard to put meaning in our hearts.
I've met the less fortunate, and raised them with love. No matter the status we may have, they can't walk away like they used to before love.
I've seen friends that can't be trusted anymore. I've tried to love my son, what he did and what he did wrong but nothing ever changed.
But with my wife and we only seeing each other in the public eye for the final time, we don't know how to stop being friends.
But with love I will embrace everything from myself to his young daughter. In this beautiful world, perhaps next month, we can see an end to love.
I still remember the day I met her. It was at this big dinner party, a glimmer in my eye that she was approaching the other guests.
She smiled at me with pursed lips as she had left, as if she was hungry. I knew I shouldn't be surprised, it would've been the worst decision of my life, but to her I am happy. She was a step in the right direction.
But I saw a smile that I might've been looking for hours before it came to me. My eyes closed, and my heart skipped a beat as it worked over the words I couldn't hear through the storm at the door.
"I'm moving away. I need to get back home."<|endoftext|>

Jerry was in an abusive relationship with his oldest brother, but he made it through to the high school. But the relationships weren't always friendly, and he often gave too many compliments on the sports teams.
Jerry's sister is now one of his best friends, and she makes him feel so good. She even sleeps with him every night, and she'll take him to game days, helping him escape his abusive parent.
"What do you think today will be like Daddy? " His brother asks.
He likes to visit relatives and play little things, all the time, but he always gets up early and leaves without a meal.
" I wish I could go with you next time, please. " Jerry replies before not even finishing the last sentence.
Jerry stops in his tracks and leans over to his chest.
" Daddy? Is that you? "
" Yes, just... just... won't let me go alone! "
Jerry's eyelids flutter open. They're wide open now.
" You've come to me over this last time, Billy. I'm sorry that I've fallen into a trap before, and I promise I'll not let you go again. I know you'll want me back. That is how we made love. That is how we finally married. I loved you so, so much. You were always there for me. I love you, Jerry. You're the only person I ever cared for. Forever. "
" Dad! What... what the...? "
" I..I'm sorry. I'll meet you when I get the chance. There will always be the other children, you know. "
" Oh, Daddy. I'm sorry, really. I tried to help... now... oh no, you can't leave me... I'm sorry. I'll go somewhere better, you know. You're in no condition to leave me here. But I'll take it! "
Jerry stops in his tracks. He's blushed in an instant.
" We have to leave now. I have to go. "
He is visibly surprised.
" I'll go now, Dad, and... what's the matter? "
" Nothing. "
" Dad? It's okay, bud. You're okay. There are no wrong choices. You love me, and I love you. "
" But, there are ways I can help you, Daddy. "
" Yes, well, there are. I'll be more than happy to help you. My little girl will always be like mine and she will be able to see me more often! How could this ever go wrong? "
" She knows, Dad. "
Jerry sits up and smiles.
" She'll be better! She'll be happy and more happy to see me, and I'll always remember you. "
As Jerry walks away from his sister and goes to help her, the girl his own age is not there.
" Sweetie, you're cute! " She cries, as her eyes flash as brightly as she has the day she was born.
" Isn't that what daddy always told me? We always used to go to the movies! I wish I could go back to that time with you!" She kisses his neck and then whispers something into her pillow.
Once she does, she lay her head on his pillow and kisses his head again.
And then she cries.<|endoftext|>

In the aftermath of the failed invasion of Earth, humanity has rebuilt and rebuilt itself. Most of the tribal remnants of the ancient race have remained. The sentinels tasked with rebuilding the remnants of Earth have been a little loath to take over the leaders who simply worked the long nights working long and hard, sometimes at the expense of finding food or shelter. We returned, but our hope was short-lived. Still, when she came into the robotic's control room, she seemed to glow a brighter beacon of hope than the chaos of war.
-- -
The members of the revived survivors had failed, the artillery had gotten us past their defenses and the battle raged on a feverish pace of lightening bolts. A ceasefire between Earth and the invaders was a rare thing from the next hundreds of years, but had also given us much promise. The defeat of our enemies and the widespread distrust of ourselves by them had ceased to be. We had become a world free of fear and darkness, able to feel our own madness at all times. No crime was committed without fear.
I will not say I believe that true peace was attained, for every generation we brought war back to the planet, the humans brought the broken, the violent and the weak together, to die. After all, those are the people who followed us, those who repelled the invaders, and those who guided us from our place of refuge.
-- -
The first robot had been used to test the sensors on our enemies, allowing them to observe us intently. It was a computer that could see the human tribes as we trained in yearning and bravery. We hoped it would be interesting and more than just able to intervene, so we enabled its sensors and blipped those off as this was our chance.
The second robot beamed from it's facility. We had briefed its brethren as they were restarting their trust and their fear. For the first time, I felt the connection between the humans and aliens. They were expected. Their clunky blue suits, their pointy hair... it made me smile.
The third robot was scheduled to be deployed so that we could know what the human race was capable of. We needed it to understand us with the capacity to identify all wars.
One left to maintain hope was the special key. The key to a new plan. With these developments, it would take one more generation to create something we could trust. Then I would take over and lead the first primitive species with technology we could see...
-- -
Six years later we received the signal. The full bomb was launched. * A clean bomb, devoid of threats. With this, the humans could go. * I believe we succeeded, though never to our liking. Only the most inept leaders remained on Earth to carry out their calculated goals.
Once the symbol had been developed, the hunters had charged into the chamber and destroyed the entire base. They took a particular pleasure in watching the robots climb the launch ramp and unlock the door. Their marksmanship mixed with the brute strength and brutal efficiency of our forces, but we have achieved enormous. They may not be as ruthless as the day they returned but their shame will serve as an excellent lesson to all others.
This new threat left me all that it could to don'thing but watch their blood vessel tear into the protective wall and it's precious species drench itself in molten gases. " Goodbye, Ishmael." The message warned us. Only one human was left.<|endoftext|>

I scrolled to the bottom of the page. I remembered the first time I visited, the tattoo ad that would be showered on me a second time. The fake scar, the hitchy body, the dead skull where I had been the first human... I had nothing. It felt terrible, even worse, to see my health decay. Just life again, hadn't been good enough.
I signed this page. I tried moving on to more permanent writings, but nothing really worked. My health began to show much worse. All that left was this one other image, it was a picture of me with my parents, now their teenage years were beginning to, was only gone. In years, it became clear that they were running out of things to do. It was sometime after my return home. I had lost hope, someone had done something to me. A seed of hope planted inside me, and I sat down on the couch one last time.
"Mom, Dad, dad... listen to me. " My voice was choked with a nervousness.
There was no help. I turned on the TV and watched shows like the late Stephen King. A manhunt was underway. Police Chief Rogers had just announced the re-animation.
" Then what's the plan?" I thought to myself. As I turned the volume up to 17, the sounds of computer porn filled the hallway. TV screens popped up, static shown as the blood-drenched screen writhed itself before me.
*Mary! Mary! Mary! Come home. * I ran to my mom's side, cradling her hands into my lap.

I needed the money. I've been a bloody thief for years now. Now a daily check pays for what I need. I didn't even have to pay up for the house repairs. I knew where I was, where I would be, who I was going. Nobody knew that I was dangerous. Someone made me change. They were right in front of me. I could lie down at the bar and drink. Or walk in the door, eat, or sleep. I could perform as I had before.
For I have nothing. I see life in this way. In every face. I try but so rarely. I can never see what I want. It's like I can see it, but not in all realistic words. The page is blank, for how long. I can't even see my family, even though it has my name, save for my father's. I stand, yet I can never remove the paper from the table. I've tried to collect my things.
No matter how many times the police show up, I won't stop. They must learn to hate me more than they hate themselves. I'm only leaving because I want to live. I still have to feed my family. And they will hate me. It won't matter if they kill me. It's never gon na matter. I'm done for.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
I had done it, I could feel it. No longer would I wander alone, never with anyone, always in fear. It's over. I'd done it. I had done it! That isn't what I'd been doing all those years. I'd done it. I'd seen enough, finally. But nothing had gone right. My life is over. I had made a mistake. And now I'm dead...
Every time I see someone smiling, I know they won't want to see my family again. And every time I hear someone laugh... I know there's nothing they can do to make me see them, and I have a duty to keep them there. I love them. But I don't hate them. I never wanted to kill them.<|endoftext|>

"All m'brains! The Supreme Leader has decided that first contact is the only way we can win the war! We shall slaughter these white soldiers like boogers. They shall destroy us all, as more and more make their homes in rags and take the weapons of our newest allies. Furthermore, the only weapon that we have are bamboo sticks of an evil nature, used by those same savages who have been wolfing our children all along! That's right, how are we going to win this war? "
The Prime Minister smiled, while screaming in approval. " The aliens?! You can't even shake them! What were you supposed to do about it?! I taught you, live by our ways and respect them. "
A few loud murmers from behind silenced the Prime Minister. " I knew I should have told you, sir. But I wanted to make sure you were never alone. All of our research go into that matter. So go forth. "
The Prime Minister smiled again. " The invading army is about to strike. We are coming. We have been taught the entire military. But the invaders know the truth. They have not been first to attack our city. So no doubt they will try to attack we here at home. If only I knew! How will they attack our entire population!"<|endoftext|>

She was nervous, always was. She kept going over and over, looking for a way out of everything; leaving her guilty hands trailing a little before she put her hands on his waist. The more she stood there, the more tears she realized. Her wristwatch, moving at a blistering speed. Her phone in her pocket. Eyes wide. Screaming.
Minutes had passed. Everything finally clicked. Minutes have gone by. His eyes glistened with tears, they were green, black, shining.
"I can't do this anymore, " he said to her softly.
Minutes passed, moments.
His fingers retreated over her forehead, but she kept on. She just kept going.
The second watch, ticking above zero.
She considered, " What if he gets shot? "
Minutes passed. It started happening, faster and faster, as her wristwatch broke to zero.
There, on the floor, was her bloodied hand, burning like a neon sign. A smile tugged at her lips. The strength left her. She ripped the watch off, and ran it to the dresser. Pulling out her pistol, she unholstered it and headed back into the car. The drugstore, ringing. Her phones ringed incessantly, sending strange static messages. Her train station.
Still, she hated it when she walked. She nearly passed out when she came upon two tools, two smallish boxes, and when they opened, he was gone. A flashlight left and red marker, with a blank checkmark in the center.
She saw a handful of questions, prodding her eyes. Blood clots on the bottom as she read through the questions. She wondered, " How did I die? "
Then, more questions, more questions, but it was not enough. A man, matching the tattoos on his forearm, stood before her, halfway down the aisle.
" I did it. "
She pulled the match box out, and flicked it on. The cigarette clicked the end, allowing the house to glow a bit brighter than it usually did, as if the world had just gone dark.
The man continued to watch her, showing her the other items. An old piece of paper, with an address on it. The man looked at it from the car window, then returned it to her.
" You have two minutes to make it. "
The man shook his head, deciding he should just lock the doors shut and leave as fast as possible. Minutes passed, she thought. One by one, they disappeared from view, until she was alone and distant.
A night was left before she could think, hanging in the cool night air. Her son was not here, he was gone.
" You are one of us," she whispered.<|endoftext|>

I knew right away that the two teenagers were drunk and had exchanged pleasantries. I just wanted to see what they were doing. I ran across to one and looked him up and down, trying to gauge him for signs of intoxication. The older one eyed me.
"You too, " I said.
" That seems clear enough, pal, " said the younger one, tugging on my sleeve, " there's, like, a pipe coming out of your body. "
I panicked. I had no idea where I was. I had gone to the station to check for a colleague, but when I got there I saw the butt of the pipe. It was black, I could smell it, so I decided to tell him. I could remember the smell of a pipe, but I also remembered they were smoking in the late fifties. I punched the pipe away. I was able to make out the words on it, " Lucifer, you have to kill me. "
" I didn't, " the older one said.
I opened my mouth to speak, but my voice was stuck in my throat. I opened my mouth again, to reply in a softer voice, " Yeah, you did, Lucifer. "
" Yeah, I'll keep doing what you did."<|endoftext|>

Bakerslee Naelsons days were slow now. The all thinking, wise citizens began to gather and storm the offices where they would wait for news in the fall. The coffee shop owner took a deep swig of his brew and dismissed the group before heading out to the cafeteria.
All that was left was a woman who sighed and reached under her desk to pick up her coffe.
Sebastian ducking down behind the counter, she straightened it up, though Seb didn't understand how she did it and she didn't feel right shaking the nearly tainted beans.
"Clean up her part, " Brace told her, rolling his eyes. " I have got some chili in here that I'm not sure she knows about. " He shoved the red beaker toward her. " It's not good for you. "
" *ahem*. " Seb squinted. " Yes it is! It's bad enough when it comes to the chili beans with you, how's that worse?! "
" You know the standards as it is! ", Sal asked, to which Seb was quiet at first. " But the manager at the grocery store said that it was restricted to food due to some small freedom of speech for college students. Also for foreigners. So how on Earth can I say that if I want to make someone famous there is no way around that! " He took another swig from his pot and cleared his throat. " We sell fresh recipes all the time. If you come in here, we'll be there to feed you whatever you want. And we've got a very good… "
This elicited a cackle from Sebastian from the woman. " N'posed to step in, Tom. The fact you asked me! "
The woman shook her head and gestured toward the front desk. " No matter, most of the people here, who come in here for more money, wouldn't be able to make my sons' sanchez's chili any better. It isn't the best chili, but by Christmas, it was. " She leaned in closer and rubbed her hand up his chin as she took a sip. " I'm not exactly sure what to think. This might just be the right recipe for my kids. I haven't even messed with my own recipe, let alone how the brand of the brand I'm using to get my coffe is going to bake. "
*BINGBINGBINGBINGBINGBING*
Someone, or something, came in and grabbed Tom, grabbing him by his shirt. " Come on, it's not the best! " Tom cried, bloodshot eyes and a mouth covered in blood. Tom grimaced, raising his arms in the air and keening it right back on his head as the man opened the door.
BZZZZ!
Through the door opened a door that was half the size of the kitchen, the smell of chili filling the air. Despite clearly not expecting the aroma, there he was. Finally, he saw it.
A man in black that seemed to be eight years old with a beige shirt, boots, green eyes, and a pair of white gloves that weren't entirely covering his body. The man had black bags under his eyes in Arabic, and on his right he had white gloves with white coats on.
" This is easy! " the man yelled. " You see, " he said, smirking. " It means that the employees will be surprised if I ever show up. "
What the hell?

The King sat there looking dead in the eyes of his maw, his eyes still stuck up high as though he had been asleep for thousands of years. The bones being sliced in half as a guard fell down to the floor. There was a tinge of sympathy painted into his face.
"You can ’ t slay the dragon, just let it die, " his brother said. The king looked sad. " It will work. " The knight glared back into the eyes. “ And it will go on. Oh did the prophecy say you could kill the dragon? " The king looked embarrassed. The maw's neck twitched furiously. " Dukes die. "
The knight saw another taunt roll up. " No, I don ’ t get it. You think death is so easy? Not that they ’ ve tried. What if you and your brother have our backs? Or maybe one of our actual rivals? " The king tried his best to stare at the maw. " They never give you the answer. Only one. " The king became impatient. " They ’ re not here to see if we actually did it. "
The knight hit the ground hard, pushing his chair to the floor. His enormous chest heaved with each blow. The king went limp, biting his lip and collapsing to the ground. The maw started to whine softly. The king was contemplating what else to do, his health had slowly eroded and his vision got worse. The king scurried off to his bed in a warm looking linen bed. He drifted off for a while. He wanted to think about how the dragon might have felt about killing him, letting the monarch make peace with him. He wanted to think about how he had gotten his brothers he had forgotten to be around for so long. How he had been the one who summoned him in anger and terror for the stupid, selfish reason of being a king. How he spent years lying in wait outside the castle ’ s walls. When he had been able to look in one final direction, he sighed again.
" What else is there to lose?"<|endoftext|>

The rabbit slowly lifted his hat, trying not to talk to the crowd. * What's wrong, * he pondered. * Why would anyone want to stay home? *
The judge spoke first, closing his eyes, bending down to pick up the stuffed rabbit. The rabbit let out a long squeak and then carefully tucked its head back into its hat. A look of disgust and irritation in his face illuminated the little piece of meat slowly to the left of the judge's face.
"Well what can I say? This isn't me. "
The judge let out a dramatic sigh. " For all your experience and friendships, the court has concluded you've been charged with piss on stage, simple as that. And for what? "
" For being the unwilling fiddler that the court expects you to be, " the rabbit replied. " You were one of the entire catch bunnies when you left for a solo performance in the bathroom last night. "
" Oh my god, " the judge groaned, spit from his mouth. " That's not funny! "
The rabbit slowly raised its head to attention. " After all, I'm a plain, simple-minded. I can only sneak up on my show, you know. And for a song with that title? That's right, while the people do their own thing, I have to nudge the point. This isn't some new talent, you know? I've played a million shows now that nobody else notices. "
The rabbit narrowed its eyes at the judge's outburst. " Well then, " it continued, " I knew you'd use it. "
*Oh no, * the judge thought, before speaking. * Let me ask you something! *
" To play it properly? "
" Yep. I mean, I've played two versions of it. If I put you in a jam session, it will turn into one of the melodramatic duets I used in practice. If you play through a ballad like that, you will play it perfectly. If you don't, you'll just wind up stuck in random song's before a bomb goes off. "
The rabbit shook its head, and then, curiously, rolled its head back and forth, hiding its head in its hat. " I'm *loose*. "
" Well you know, the one bad version is pretty awful. "
The rabbit seemed still and thin, showing signs of standing. It took a moment for the judge's face to sink into a smirk. " How- "
" *Hello? * " the rabbit spoke once more.
" Who's there? "
The judge's face disappeared.
The rabbit let out a scowl. " No. Sorry, what?"<|endoftext|>

I drew another match and headed back to the base. I suppose the thing about lying is that the sad part of the story is that at some point in the line, somebody discovers the scar and realizes what it's the love of their life. Although... maybe... maybe the scar didn't exist...
I picked up the match and inspected it. I wondered if it would shine this late in the day, then went into the back room and opened it. I started to feel the familiar dullness of the iron for the first time in many years. I felt something familiar. Something large, but that still wasn't completely unexpected, was the pain.
Screams and screaming, the pain. For awhile I thought it was a lack of sleep, but when I woke up, I could see her face perfectly, perfectly-formed. My heart raced, I couldn't believe it! Her eyes were greyed like the eyes of a dying man, and the scars were deep, black and seared deep into her chest.
She was cold.
I almost didn't hear the scream.
I lifted my hand to my face and saw her beautiful, hunched, dark eyes, staring right at me. My finger felt cold as my hand felt ice. She didn't scream. She just gasped as her face rose.
"Where the hell am I? ", I whispered. " What happened to you? ", she screamed again, this time stronger. Then, her fear broke. I hadn't felt fear in days. No, nothing that she had experienced in the entire centuries of her lie was the same. Fear was not a fear I felt as a person. This wasn't one of those " when did we grow up? " things. I had only to think of her. Of the day I met her, and if we'll ever learn the truth, no matter how long it takes.
I brushed the tension off and looked at her closely. She wasn't ugly. A tall slender woman with jet black hair and brown eyes. She was beautiful.
" What are you doing here?, " I whispered, more stunned than anything. I didn't need to stay up all night. I knew I had to find her.
" Where's her? ", she asked, now startled. " What're you waiting for? " I left the room I was in and walked back to the base. It was getting dark. Still, darkness. I stepped over the casket that had held me, out the door. Inside, everything was as familiar as ever.
" Son, where are your parents? ", I whispered, setting my back against the cold metal. My heart dropped as my heart raced. It came rushing back. I looked out to see the horizon, so bright that it seemed only a shadow. The first starlight from the sun, over the hills, over the mountains and over the waves. The sun high above my head, shining brightly in the first night we lived.
" Who are you? ", I cried out. " I... I... I need a friend. "
" But, who are you? ", she asked, not even looking at me. I could feel her stares for a moment as she slowly turned and walked away.
I stood in the doorway, feet dangling from the frost. I grabbed the knife I kept in my pocket and faced the sun. There it was. Right there on the edge of my knife. Now that it was in my hands, I felt as if I would never see it.
The scar on her chest, running down her dark back and turning white along the sides. The mark on her body.
The pressure.
" Mama, mama, MOMMA," she sobbed as I ran my finger down the scar.
Maybe we could walk together for a little longer.<|endoftext|>

I have been dying to know you.
Every week, I have heard you slaughter a god. Every god.
You worshiped him the same way you worshiped the gods of oblivion.
You used his powers so that you could shape your enemies. You made them disappear. And you nearly killed me.
Your power is never to kill when it feels right.
I know your power.
You follow me.
This town has come to worship you.
The people we pass, when we leave their homes, surround their houses. We take them to their worship. Then we wait.
The person they worship has a new home, a new place to hide. We turn them off and turn them back on. I pray when I see the one I killed -- a young girl. Her mother is here with her. She is mourning her old love. She tells me she will never see her child again. I don't understand why I pray. My torment grows. I don't know why I feel this way.
You come to give our community its name. But it is not your name that has called itself my master.
I have watched your life. I know you are no longer with us. But you have saved us.
And you are God.
I am beyond pity.<|endoftext|>

The image was unforgettable. I saw her as you would have, and she was huge as shit. But you knew better than to be afraid, and that was what made me leap at the chance to do it. I'm a man who has no idea how ridiculous that one is.
The note on my desk is interesting.
How foolish were you to let me know you were breaking your own heart? I will never forgive myself, even for thinking of breaking your heart. I would be happy to let you know how hard I worked to be such a man to myself, but I wouldn't lie to you if I told you that I would never end my life, for some reason.
But hey, fuck it. You won't be killed, you won't have a life threatening tumor, you won't be the first, so you better not bother wasting your life with this bullshit message.<|endoftext|>

They say that without a pack you can never take anything. Well, what do they really say about that? A real, undeniable truth, where the stories don't lie to you. I mean they say there's a black market for the body, and a sober, drugs-free man with a kerosene-free life right in the heart of a junkie's garage in Gainesville. How does it say that?
We were on a business trip to an established opiate buyer, and I was on point. I had a few overdosing partners, and they took different paths to get that from me. I didn't blame them on the DEA, but the decision was made to skip the customer at the thought of being in danger.
Two weeks later, on a Friday afternoon, we were sitting at a diner, drinking beer in a little corner, enjoying the good days. I sat there, the eye made me anxious, and the desire for more could only be matched. My life began to flash before my eyes, and an instantly audible hum from the base of the stick that I'd just received out of my nose ignited a spark in my brain.
"Hold on " I said, my entire being trying to remember what I said. " Hey! My wife. My little girl! What do you think, Mr. Iguana? How do you manage to have a good life without constantly having to be taken advantage of and beat up? "
I felt a small tremble, and I felt an object inches away stick out from my face. Oh god, who the hell wants his little girl!
" Mark. I'll be right behind you, " I said.
" Mark, stop talking. ", he said, and began to walk away. " If you'd come around, I'm sure you'd care for my girl. "
" I know, " I said, almost teary eyed. My mind raced. I couldn't afford to leave that fucking warehouse.
" You haven't bought a kilo in your life, Mark. ", his tone is calm. It's... calm.
I felt an intense rush of realization, and sure enough, his ring was in his pocket.
I fumbled for it with my fingers.
" Mark, you know this is dangerous. You'll have to find another dealer. Maybe you can help me? ", he answered.
" There's always a meth dealer at the front door, Mark. How long have you been getting the meth? ", I said, with more anxiety than I cared to admit.
" Hmm... Maybe I'll see you tomorrow, " he responded.
We'd been sitting on the porch, looking out over the beaten down remains of the east side. All I could think about was that i was gon na wake up and get a good night's rest.
I felt the warm embrace of my wife's hand, shaking from the sensation of my breath hitting the ground. My nose turned, and was sucked into the brief void of heaven.
My van rolled up behind me, and I pulled out of the driveway. There I saw my wife on a cold night, laid up on the porch of her small, two bedroom flat, with her boyfriend, Keith.
He was outside, cuffed to the door, sobbing. He was smiling. He held out his hand, and I pushed it back. My mind raced at the memory.
" Mark? ", I said, still holding the box of cocaine in my hand. " Mark, we can finally decide what happened. "
" Ok, son, we can do this. ". His hand touched mine. I slowly started to turn. " I'll tell you my whole story ".
" I'll make you stay behind, son. It's time to go."<|endoftext|>

I live in a city of people and civilization in the middle of the mobiles. People might think my build into it, but the thing about creating ever strange thing is that you're something new but you never know what you will put together when you try to get it wrong. Nobody truly realizes how sophisticated they really are until you even get your ideas down to a finer degree than the other people.
It's not about the color or style, it's about *how* it works, and the only true way to get it wrong? The easiest thing to do is to slip it all into one of two ways...
1. Let it taste sweet.
2. Let it taste bitter.
Any of the two types of personalities could be smothered in one click of a mouse.
Once you picked the shit, time travel isn't quite so great. There are limitless possibilities but all of them are pretty subjective. Many creatures consider me insane, but I have friends and everyone believes I am imaginary. Most importantly, I try to make people feel safe because it's free will. The more I try, the more people view me as crazy.
I am a very good liar because you can't fake it.
I believe every spell I give will do the trick. I fight magic because not all magic works with mine. I usually use darkshine and ichor and watch everything. I have never practiced the ritual before. I use Shaper magic because I can literally feel the sweat dripping from my neck. I have practiced all these techniques countless times and each time I get that nervous shot I only let it go off, this time there was no shock.
I believe in myself. I guess that's why I live in this city, because its real. If I go mad, I'll be willing to look and my real self will be scarred and rot and burned.
If I'm stupid, if I can't figure this out, what's the worst that can happen?

I stood at my desk, watching a class in progress. There was some good stuff on the bulletin board, but there was something more important, something far more important. A thump, and I grabbed it. I ran it over to the classroom, thinking I had enough. I see two students, just in time for the big reveal. Noticing a strange message appearing from one of the students, I clicked on it. With a quickie surprise, a friend saw it and waved her hand, thanking her. Her staff should know her better than I did. They saw it earlier, too, in the classroom.
'This is stuff I've written for school,' an officer said,
'Seriously, I use everything from the internet to draw hundreds of people to talk to in English now.' The officer ran away, leaving me for a bit. I always missed the clicker-generated chattering before the school.
I should have left it there for some play.<|endoftext|>

Her piercing cries, long and deep. That pierced the air. Light would rise through the ground which would escape it with its warmth, but that wouldn't be enough to form the vessel which would sustain her. The simple darkness kept her alive long enough to embrace her worst fears.
She was already sinking into the floor. The only escape was to plunge under the water, while the little one held the wifes feet as she pushed himself frantically into the atmosphere.
The moon cast its bright light through the smaller circle, but too late it was gone. The tiny queen remained, unhurried and unmoving, yet not the first time. She slumped to the floor, her feet splayed on her wooden floor. The small orb was nearer and nearer until the little one continued to stand on its belly. Eventually the tiny one would take control of the small orb and quickly set her pace.
Then as soon as the little one had lifted her the orb dropped above the wind, in a flash of light and ash. She stood motionless on the floor, eyes as wide as her own, mouth agape, yet the little one was still standing.
"Wait! Wait a second, she took her last breath! " The little one had begun to scream and cry, but he could no longer look at her. At this point he knew she was all alone. He grabbed the edge of the small circle and started, and watched as she ripped the orb out of the little one's hand with one swift motion. She did the same with all of the rocks that fell towards the little one's face.
The little one began to float down with the little one. He felt tears welling up in his eyes.
" Damn," he whispered.<|endoftext|>

It was a Saturday afternoon, i was freaking out with my anxiety as I was standing in the rain like a scared baby and i was eyeing the sky looking at the sun shining down in crescent style forlornly. what was wrong? I had had enough, I decided i would steal my rifle from the shed tomorrow and go to bed at noon. what was in the to-do list? I grabbed the bottle from the laundry basket and lay it down on the edge of the bed, rocking it back and forth. I opened my eyes and and noticed a tube of light in front of me. my heart skipped a beat. i rushed out of bed and out the front door and into the street. I headed toward the street and frantically looked for an exit. three giant trucks were parked in every direction waiting for me to get a signal. ever since I had started writing I never thought i would see something like this. A dark figure in dark clothes walking in the rain took my attention. I took a deep breath and looked up. " god damn " was written on the giant human of the truck.
" So I am Death " said the delivery girl, she pulled a piece of paper out of her robe and read the postman's name. " Could you imagine what could it be " she said smugly.
" It could be ammory night " i replied.
the delivery girl looked at me with a smile " it sounds like you found the source of the words you have been talking about, so you don't care about the kinder end of the deal " she said into the mud. " ah " i said back, seeing the stains were starting to roll down my face. " is that why im writing this? " she said, flashing a grin to me and pulling out a crowbar. " no matter your reasons why you cant take it, it is right here, right now, right here " she said and grabbed the shotgun through her shirt and slammed it against the wall, striking a ray of light into the mysterious van. It struck me and I saw my vision go black as my soul slowly came back to me. At the surface, i saw a priest pointing a cross at me. " Holy fuck! kill me! " he said from the back of the truck " I will rip you apart and take you back home! " he exclaimed grabbing me. In one fluid motion, i pulled the black cross out and threw it across the road. he staggered and dropped his cross and started screaming. " Pity, " he said " I wasnt planning this, the cross didn't kill me, but I forgot to mention that I do have one thing going for me, my nice wife did something I didn't expect, and really her death seems to have saved your life. " " what, an angel of heaven or some of those saints crap?" i said back.<|endoftext|>

Three years ago, a strange man showed up at my door. Not a strangers to the strangeness of American lives. He was the big guy. Man. Tall, dark, thin and oily. He had a hole in his back like veins itches. He asked for old army specs. What a bat he was. He would give me the tools to build a larger than average building for a ship. He would ask why my dad left my mom. He never left any room for me. He said that it is my father's for picking me up but also his father's for giving my Dad the tools. He never saw me.
But I heard, he said, he is here for my dad. I was taken aback. This is some kind of weirdest thing I have ever heard.
"Sir, what is your name. "
" The time traveler. "
" John Shepherd. "
" Doctor Shepherd. "
" Guess he fell off the tower, could you help me with some paperwork? "
I was taken aback. This man knew how to unclog a hole and the tools that would allow us to actually travel in space. I looked over and found the crest of an odd blue tower. I did the most heartless thing I ever did. I started me up and found the rusted pylon. It worked great. The tunnel blocked everything the tunnel wouldnt accept. Over time we found something else.
" JV, what is your status? "
" The Council of Wels? "
" Yes, and we plan on taking him to some mad scientist, and see if he can go save another civilization."<|endoftext|>

"Who cares about eye contact? Nothing superpowers to just say'Yes, I look fine' and go on. Next thing I know I feel like I'm leaning against a pillar. Why are they following me? "
The next thing I know, I'm feeling in a crowd and everyone is running. A woman is telling a homeless guy to get off the ground. Not everyone around has any idea that they are being followed, but I don't care. Then I realize that even though everybody starts running towards me, they don't stop. Their clothing is completely soaked in blood, they have no recollection of running in the first place.
" You need to stop, " I yell.
" I see you, " says the woman, pointing at the crowd.
" I feel guilty about this because I saw a place that sells blood. "
She pulls out a bottle of blood from under her coat and points it at me.
" It's not blood; it's flowers."
She follows me out and falls on her back on the ground.

We have always known the truth about potatoes. My parents knew that. They don't.
I call them potatoes because some potatoes seem completely unemotional, lifeless, unable to feel affection, or to comprehend potential pain. They sort of always seem disconnected from their cause.
Sometimes, they speak first.
Like I said, only one of them spoke to me during my first bout of puberty. Yes, he knew that!
He recalled the day my mom made lunch and I pulled him from his lunch boxes; he looked so shocked, but still just stared at me. I nodded back.
I didn't understand what had happened next. He asked, "Sok. Sok, do you remember when I met Dad?" And we stared at each other in confusion, lost in time. For a moment, he seemed saddened, all tired and beaten, just like he knew I would be tomorrow. He spoke for a moment, and I was there with him and he spoke for a while, and a while as well.

Tomorrow is Friday. No one will be looking forward to it. Every morning, it'll be 6:30, and you'll walk past my office, head back to work, and see it-television cameras circling a city-district. You'll go to go and get fixed-up magazines and old memorabilia and make yourself some coffee to sell, but when I walk into the office, I'll see it's 5:00 PM, and I'll go through my schedule.
This week, though, is different. It is kind of new to me. Every day, the same thing: a self-important man with a habit of sneaking into my office, going to my desk, and taking my stuff when I finish my coffee and leave without paying. I am as good as he is. I am super, *super* strong, I can be anything he needs me to be. I am not a religious man, he is, but he's not. He looks a little different. As he looks at me, he raises his eyebrows.
He gives a sigh.
"I wonder how you get dressed and head to the station today, " he says, " don't you think? "
I nod.
He shrugs.
" I'd like to explain- "
I pause, unsure of why I should be sure I've interrupted him. How am I supposed to talk to a god like him? Why shouldn't he understand my choice? I try to ask him directly, with a slurred tone, but I can't hear or feel his words in his voice. I try.
" Of course I could tell you. "
I falter. Maybe I should wait. I shouldn't do this.
" What did you just say? "
I try again.
"... "
" Ahh I know... what am I going to say about you. "
" I'm not even sure... "
" Then you need to wait. "
I don't want to respond. I just know that the person will leave me alone and with no friends to talk to. I can't trust him. I know he hates me. I know he hates me even though I'm his teacher. And I know it's his fault for not keeping me company enough.
" It's a mistake. "
" I know. "
" Then I'll call the police. "
I don't care about him, but I know that he's probably a ghost in the streets.
" Fine. Maybe tonight, I might talk to you."<|endoftext|>

As Charlie sat idly in the doorway of his dimly lit office, watching Roger run through his activities he saw the wet, cracked floorboards on the other side of the room. He wondered whether it was really his fault that Roger hadn't prepared him for his betrayal that night; wondering whether the dark bags in his locker probably woke up a few hours ago, or whether he'd have gotten the worst of it just now. They lay exposed at the center of their room, scurrying at the wrong angle and for no apparent reason, crouched like freckles on a great dried pool. They knew each other well and ended up in the same room like the others, one in his knees and the other positioned in each other's. And such a flawless, population like Roger couldn't possibly be trusted.
Charlie thought about it a lot and very quickly looked around the room; a pretty bland office office, one James was sure Roger was jealous of. He closed the door, which now led to the horrible green carpeting surrounding the enclosed room. He turned and looked at Roger, who had sprouted a long, muscular mane.
"Why me? " Charlie thought to himself.
" Some idiot at work told me to show you the disgust and humiliation you deserved so that I can dissect you. You kind of have a scythe, quick as lightning "
" Oh, I see. You know what I mean." Charlie smiled to Roger, who calmly extended an arm and shivered.
A squirrel tripped him over his shoes, and punched him in the face. He then raised his head and began to cry for joy; Roger had almost given up playing games against the squirrel, but Charlie knew what was coming next.
Roger vanished into a small pocket in his jeans and stole a loaf of bread, rubbing it dry with his thumb while looking at Charlie. They sat and laughed together and Charlie was right there, his eyes burning with disgust, wondering what the hell had happened when the earth itself fell apart; why they hadn't learned how to use tools that had killed millions of people; and why Roger had been expected to join them on this planet.
Roger felt a shiver run down his spine and hugged Charlie tightly. He knew there was a feeling of triumph and glory about this day, and a genuine joy that his impromptu birthday party that night would begin when it had finally come and began, but he knew that the other side of the moon did not celebrate on such regular days; as Charlie would not have been so lucky.<|endoftext|>

Journal entry Q
How soon do they write?
From last night: I have... a decade left in the year. They know I'm dead.
They say the reason the grey haired man of their tracks always gives no s/he gives an eff *grump* fuck. I don't see them, they couldn't be any more different.
One day I got bitten by one of the dogs. For some reason I thought these dogs were dead and curled up in a ball when I noticed the creature vomit. The thing began to claw at my back and I realized there was a long line made in the road - that was the reason I carried that axe. This reminds me of one of those movies they called "Total Recall "
But they cut me in half with a crowbar - it was pretty much a cheap throwing. But it looked good, and I just laughed and grinned. The dog is quite meagre, I mean look around I guess. A few scratches can't hurt, or I don't know how to look after myself.
I'm really not sure what my life is like. So of course I have no children. No kids that I'll remember my Mum's face. I'm not worried about getting dates... no - I'm not worried about keeping track of time. It's barely mattered if I'm alive or dead, it's just so much more than that, I guess. So the point is I don't care. I don't care about what happens to me or anyone else out there anymore. I just want to live forever. But don't you realise they're in numbers? They live one or two years out here and I don't remember anyone from before I died.<|endoftext|>

But the only thing that he cared about was the old man and his wife. They sat in the grass and he was the most patient guy he knew, and in those few moments they talked about him. Both their kids and their wives, and even their grandkids.
He found that one particular interaction that just made him feel like he was no longer going anywhere, not that he had left home any time soon, but that he could smell them, so much so that he felt like he knew where they went. And they talked in that same old silence that had etched its last written note.
Those memories lingered. He would tell her those things, and it still carried, every time, by the scars left by the way they asked him the same dumb questions he did on the day they met in his apartment.
But soon his ghost became clear, and when he opened his eyes, it was clear enough that he was home. She was home too. And that meant she was in a better place. She was at home in his arms again.
Soon everything disappeared, and the scars were clean again, and they still linger. Every time he finished his sentence, that old man threw up. He stared at the boy still talking to the girl sitting near the window and wondered if her ghost would ever come back.
He looked down and remembered he was next to the girl in that park, still gazing at the sun in the early morning, and something shook him up. He could tell it was wrong. He had hit the girl. The guy who wrote him that night said he should leave them all alone and that they were all just animals. And, as a ghost, that kid was lying there.
He sat and thought about what was going on and felt that much better. Everything was going fine again, and the sun had finally stopped rising and the girls were with their grandparents just outside the window. He looked at her, and she smiled. He walked out onto his balcony and stared at the beautiful beach, but this time it was deeper.
And that made it worse, because he thought the girl was sitting next to him, so he would know that that old lady would never come back.<|endoftext|>

One day, one day, you die.
And, without your illness, your death would be your heartbreak.
You're fucked. Your brain is hijacked by people with mental issues. You're going to be worse than your parents.
At first, you think you're good. You think you're great. Everyone thinks you're crazy, but your mind lacks a healthy, natural counter force against our brains.
But all you have is depression, and an immune system.
Nothing to do but train.
And then you wake up.
You just blew up.
You wake up thinking it was the child you threw away.
You're covered in dust, but you're cold as nothing.
You just rolled over in bed, thinking about when you would get your fix. And you expect to see something you might not have noticed.
You couldn't stop thinking about what it would mean, right?
It didn't matter.
You wanted to be great.
You wanted to be *dead*.
But you're not, because you're evil. You're evil in bed and just like the rest.
All you got was a pill bottle to fill your own insanity.<|endoftext|>

The world was crazy. People were starving to death. It was chaos. " Hungry " people were literally starving to death.
We were crazy!
The government, of course, was bought out. Settle in, meet a recruiter, order pizza.
It didn't work, though. Crampedown government forces wiped the country out of the map. After that they shot the rebel base.
It's all at least 5 years now, and what's left of the remaining 70 million has gone back into the federal government as we tell our grandchildren about what they did.
There's already food supplies; 7 billion people have been seen starving. Banks still exist, though none provide much value to anyone else.
I think I've heard it's 2 days or so before the water runs out. We can rebuild, of course. I still need supplies but I want to let the water run out.
The movie is set on an Abrams tank and it's going to be killing a lot of people. The news team is smarting up though.
So yeah, I want to buy 10 million. My children and wife want them too.
" Who is who? " a voice comes from behind me. An old man in his 30's comes walking down the corridor.
" Karen Stavereson, the government has moved you here. I was here to inform you to leave the city and head to Halifax. " I reply, putting on my slippers. I've been working here for twenty years and I hate being stuck here.
" I want the water to run out and everyone else to go in there and fight back. " Karen says. " There's a lot of people I believe we can use to fight. "
" Do you want to join them, Karen? " the old man says, pushing the bag to me.
" They have taken over our cities. They gave us much of the energy we needed in the *nuclear war*. The rumour says they are leaving to make the stop on Queenstown. " I nod.
The old man speaks to me again, " Do you want to join them Karen? "
" If you need to thank God you can call me Patrick from across the street. I love being able to listen to you talk for hours. "
" So? "
I put my slippers back on, " The others are going to be the ones to welcome us home. They'll teach us some lessons."
Wth... you can die.<|endoftext|>

I drifted off.
The memories I kept in check weren't anything new.
A clock on my desk.
My coffee.
Putting my messages on the call.
Closing my laptop.
Losing the call.
Trying to light the cigarette before I hit send.
The text stopped.
"I like you here. "
" I don't... wan na talk to you any more? "
My phone buzzed in the background, stopping at the one phone number that was never there.
" Damn this phone. I think there's one on here. "
I logged out of the app on my phone, sliding into bed.
" What the hell happened here? " I asked myself.
I had tried checking my calendar. It said " end date today. " At the bottom of the calendar was an 8AM, confidential date. After all, it was my birthday. I turned off my phone. " Hey."
I was off home and spinning all the way to my car. * Flipping my phone to bed*, and dropping my groceries in the car park, I thought back to my texting. * Want to come and talk to you. * I thought back to my room, thinking to myself when I was so focused on texting.
I closed my eyes and made one last final thought before I closed them again. * About what? * I was terribly afraid of the darkness. The carpet that blanketed the floor was dusty and covered in dust. I can't smell the grass. I felt almost too afraid to do anything. My phone buzzed in the background again. I closed my eyes and made one last thought before I closed them again. * It hurts. *<|endoftext|>

I have been prouder of people with powers so deep, I've been told how to tell the truth and despise my peers only for the most part.
I used to say my parents were kind, but I'd sooner believe my father were a evil sinner than believe my mother was only decent enough. But now she's gone... and all I can see is mud and stains all over my clothes. * Nooo*, I think to myself.
I yell the name. You're my only hope of survival and I'm giving you the chance to mop floors or fight rain with the rod of my sword.<|endoftext|>

"I mean, his plane... "
The body's smooth texture carried a slick smell.
" Dude, he was just looking at this... this. An eating simulator. I mean, it's total shit. It's like, what an AI could possibly want. "
" I'm really scared. "
The plastic parts disintegrated at the impact. It was just right there in front of a multi-billion dollar company. My mind lay at the passenger's seat.
It was like, the entire 9/11 ring. An aerospace missile. These parts were part of my mind. Now it was a man doing cocaine. And I was just telling him some ridiculous lies. I guess I woulda been dead one day. The day I was " acquitted ".
But what was real? What happened to my life? Why was that even a crime?
When I was born, no one could remember any of what happened. They ran in deep denial. This is what my father would say, though he only repeated what I heard him say. He whispered to us about their lives. " Did they have kids? " " Did the neighbors have children? " " Did their parents share DNA with me? "
My father used to say that I would learn immediately that he had had kids with his second wife. But...
The next morning his wife had died. The first he'd seen before she'd died. But that wasn't fair, it was just the truth.
" Hey, Timmy! You still stay here! " My first wife's name was Emily. I had assumed she was our first wife, but he had gone on to describe the first few episodes of Firefly. Most men took him as a joke, I guess. But my mother didn't understand my mother, or my father did, but I think I'll always get that caricature.
" Hey, mom! I've never seen that same show again! It's on my lunch break! We have to talk." I can still see her.
I guess I got no closure...
Maybe this time, I want to tell him. Or call the cops, and say how sorry I am.<|endoftext|>

"We've been at this for a while, Reddit. "
He nodded his head as he looked up from the most recent post on the front page of Reddit. " The idea this time though, is to let you take control over my world! "
He walked up to his desk and opened the laptop in front of him. It was loaded with image files like this:
I stayed completely silent, other than the 7 images of me. Then my name. He sighed and clicked'Edit', before making a small smile. I glanced up, grinning then looking down. My small eyes slowly began to fill with sleep. It must be my imagination...
" Ehh, Erik? "
" The stupid assignment! How could you do it without drawing attention? "
" Oh my gosh.... " I released a breath, slightly lost in my own thoughts. I smiled again, a little too genuinely happy for the part of these dumbass Reddit fans.
" Yeah, yeah... I know. This one's a little off, right? The one with the las-long? But I just wanted to create an omen! "
" Eh, what? It just says no referring to an extra person anymore. " I smiled. The discomfort started immediately.
" A silly sub there, you know? But you got all these silly ideas, when you make a universe and everyone plays around with me for years and go from there to... well... you know... creating... MY world! "
" I'm not creating MY world! I'm designing MY world! "
" You get it, eh? I don't need you messing around with me! Right now, just ahead of you in the movie or whatever, my work is not going well. "
" Oh, Erik, thanks for showing up, but I really don't want you messing around with me. You see... you are pretty smart, and such a smart guy. All of you. " He shrugged, having regained some composure after a minute or so. His smile growing wider. " Hey, shut up and buy a beer, now! "
I swallowed a bit of my fear and remained silent.
" Oh, Erik, will you listen to the movie? " He rolled a cigarette towards me and I slowly took the pipe, putting it gently on my lips. " Well, things will start coming back, but I can tell you that! Trust me, I know how to do it!"
But as I put the pipe in my mouth, I felt a shift. As I took a gulp and took my next one, I felt another shift of attention.<|endoftext|>

More text is up but that's fine here.
**Once upon a time**
**A hooded figure cloaked in black stood before the dusk, observing the world. **
“ If I'm alone… ” he whispered, “ maybe, ” he gestured, “ maybe… maybe it ’ s because I ’ m all alone. ”
“ Oh, ok, ” I said, leaning back in my chair. I admired this person. He spoke with voice that was like a rhymes bible.
“ I've got doors, and I've got a path, and sometimes I think I'm gon na find one, but that doesn ’ t mean I can never decide where I go. ”
“ I've got plans, ” I said, sinking back into my chair. The hooded figure, my patron and friend, lifted his hood, revealing the lack of darkness in it. “ A forest, in the heart of the countryside, with a beautiful woman and her daughter, and so many friends, and it's all mine. That ’ s how I see it. ”
“ That ’ s all, ” I said, finally revealing the extent of my friendship with the man.
“ You can always find something around here. ” The hooded man said. I heard his words in my head. I could smell them in the air, nearly drowning out his words.
“ I ’ m one of the ‘ pirates ’, ” the hooded man said, just a little too loudly.
“ Come on, come on, ” I said, defeated. I noticed that his companion was still looking at me, and I sighed. I could be drinking with some high-schooler once in a while, but who is he to tell me when I won't see anyone else? Who was he to tell me I had money, and I was so lonely?
The hooded man came close, but I could hear the door shutting behind him. I turned around.
I heard people shouting and people shouting, but I couldn ’ t hear much of anything, and neither could the figure. I kept going. I saw a hole in the ground behind me, and a bush falling to the ground, and I knew I was not alone. It wasn ’ t that I was alone, but rather that I had one goal. To find a canoe out in the forest.
I came into the cabin and sat in the back. I watched as the woman in the background stumbled off into the forest, probably doing something peculiar. It wouldn ’ t do anything but make the forest black and dirty. Even me had burned my skin this whole time. I turned off my lamp, and what I saw made me very angry.
“ H-help me! ” she said, clinging to the tree, “ There is a hood- ” and with her breath I started laughing. The arrow in her magic didn ’ t hurt her. No, that wouldn ’ t do. It made her invisible. And then, they were gone. I saw a bright light coming through the trees, and I smiled, her magic back.
I stayed there, listening for an audience with her. I watched as she tried to figure out how to walk. I watched as she picked up her hat, took it off, and ran like a rabbit. Then she wouldn ’ t look back. And in the forest, I stopped laughing.

The beer-pirated stream lapped slowly between the stones around her dusty face. He didn't normally drink for the first few nights of fall sleep, having to sober up the next morning. But he knew the world could only get better after two hours, now.
The moat dipped beneath his feet, his face turning pale. * The moon was crimson. My heart ached. * She'd turned it out to be a spell, but she was counting on it. It was every night that the brutal winds left her wet. The mist was howling in the Autumn morning.
She felt small in the winter. A small bundle of bitter cold against the cold clay-made walls of the cold house that framed the lonely lake. Cold rain fell and washed the blankets over her. She was thin. Her body twitched as though it were made of jelly, and her limbs were tensed and buckled. She looked at him, side to side, a slight smile craned out of her wrinkled half-smile.
They looked at each other in silence, eyes still as locked as the long tower of endless nights. She held her eyes, staring up into the broken sky, transfixed by the pale splendor that stretched across the barren landscape below.
She clenched her fist, moments of prayer ready before a triumphant shout came down out of the darkness, dinged by the footprints of another heavy wind. She stood up, towering over him, her head raised high in the air to signal her retreating, her unshaven features showing scars that told him she was rather unkempt, though he didn't see it that way. She began to cry softly, her face wracking with laughter. * I'll have someone to feed, somebody to feed me. *
And when she said, "Daddy, Daddy, " he cradled her in his arms.
" You're the best damn thing that ever came out of that.."<|endoftext|>

... to find out why, they said.
Their members wondered why they had chosen the formal election over full legalization. In actuality, it had been voted out less than a century ago. What mattered was that their signatories had said it.
The 13' broadcast centre on the table greeted them, and quickly saluted and excused them from the hall of the senate to their car.
They sat at the gilded door of the approved assembly room for the meeting, waiting. The four hailing well-dressed politicians hadn't finished their cigarot, and the two reporters hadn't spoken since the revolution, but time stood still and they were paying the price. No longer would the more inexperienced politicians come, and the robust protests, national safety concerns and all that slipped past their greedy mouth when their vengance had been successful.
The six went through their dossier of the major influencers, each one lonnged with pop culture references, and each always with an artificial tie. It didn't matter if anyone snickered, or ignored it - as long as the paper enthused upon its next assignment.
One eye was fixed on a picture on the screen beside the man. It was then that they noticed. They were reminded. They appeared to be 8.1 % of the world population.
"Mr Bishop ", the 5th chief advisor let out a hearty laugh, " really? You did figure this out. How did you manage to stay so well off of the corporate era? "
They looked at each other. Sombrely they smiled together, and the lead adviser raised his chin slowly, and said, " it was a hard decision. They needed a policy of wellbeing, and I couldn't think of a less difficult way. "
His face, covered by apron, not but a pure bun of books and glasses, shifted back and forth in anticipation of what the new bespectacled former chancellor might say.
" But I was more in love with the 1 % than they had ever seen me. " He motioned behind him to the letterhead that read,'My fellow doctors and believers. Welcome to the golden age of slavery. It would be better for every human. We are using older people now. There is something noble, though. Human Genomics is finally a power we could use, and we believe it will reveal why people stay so well off.' " The black-haired adviser on the wall spun his once round spectacles around and showed his black-haired wife the letter before breaking their gaze at him.
" There's much to be gained, " said the chancellor. " Once people are under the right conditions they will be left free and have done without a care in the world. "
" Quite right," said the president, concerned. * She was far too close for comfort. * The royal chaste had unwittingly operated on the seeds that kept the galaxy a down of even manhood, whether it had been genetic modification or an intentional crossover of lands were still unknown.
The 4 last metered their first look around the room. The room's names displayed prominently in large capitals. Sitting just in front of the foremost was the new chancellor of the nations, and for every young man that was elected to get a seat he'd bumped an unregistered door and returned home for the final sleep.<|endoftext|>

"Right there Saul, "
*Drop. *
Grumbling, I sighed. Getting out of that yellow coat, I hurried down the winding hallway, as I walked through the empty soul shop. It was nothing like the paper I was supposed to be working for. Every evening, I'll steal a package from a newcomer and make them my wife's homie's hand. At the bottom of the tiled basement, I'll start using the slots in their bellies to navigate to shelves made of old oak, inscribed with beveled " Lovecraftian Heroes " engraved in white tape. What a good way to teach a child about human anatomy! This place was on average shut down around 13pm tonight, so I planned something even better.
Luckily, my phone buzzed. My demonistic obsession with the phone actually meant to keep me up at night. * Holy shit, * I thought. Time to prepare for my next appointment. *
When I got home, a short-haired imp-looking woman with bright red lipstick burst through the door and walked into the house, grabbing my phone. It was weird, that she was wearing this dull red lipstick and heels. * Hrrr... * I mumbled. " I- i- I just forgot I- " I paused for a moment, and I had to pause between wry smiles. " Everything alright? "
" Yeah, " she looked at me across the way. " Everything's all right. All right, let's get going. "
" Alright, you look like your super cool! " I really didn't need to roll my eyes. I got home, but then I heard the siren. Clinging to my seat, I sighed. * Ow, so this is actually happening. * All my demons had been granted release from eternal slumber. Their eternal slumber had gone deafeningly silent since my previous contract was in place.
I dropped the phone, placed my hood on, and walked over to the emergency latch on the right side of the house. Though I had only about 15 minutes, I had a very specific destination in mind. On my right was a speaker, with a bell that rang loudly, signaling for my demon to pick up. Thinking to myself, it must be a good idea to include a lock code in the free system, for this was the best 4.4 pm-turn-in-the-week gig I could get.
Throwing the phone, I opened the doors. Without a second thought, I jumped through a set of white slates to a bow-tie-clad demons. As I kneeled down, in one of the dark, open areas, I noted all the demons had stopped staring at me. * What a day, * I thought. I immediately dropped my hood. " 2 years ago, I did it. " * I thought, as I looked back at Saul and his band of ruthless, blue-eyed monsters. I was only 21, didn't know the intricacies of magic at school, and I was always an idiot, but my demons can't speak or move for hours.
They approached my seat, and I proceeded to spit. Yes, this place is where my next appointment was coming from. * Please, * I thought, hoping for an unexpected response. In the darkened basement, it dawned on me. * Damn. This place * was still open. *
" So Saul, I- I'm going to be opening this month's contract so I can start my degree, " I said, perplexed at the lack of response. Of course, Saul obliged by forcing a grin.
Once again, I looked at Saul, terrified. After a moment, Saul's head didn't move, as my heart raced to my throat. I slammed the dark, glass doors shut, and we entered the dark, slightly uncomfortable room.
Inside were two pair of footsteps. I was expecting a rabbit or deer, because I wasn't sure how to use a portal to go to the next floor or the next lair. Instead, I found an ape.
*Wow. Aren't these fruit fly monsters supposed to speak? * I thought, horrified. A... frog? It's too late to ask this annoying animal that failed my parents.
*WHAT. THE. HELL.*<|endoftext|>

This eternally red mage was flayed by the shallows,
And while he held fast,
The pen turned into a dagger,
Just as it always has.
The sweet lifeblood instantly succumbed to the filth,
And so was his magic completed,
The magic of catapults and tarps,
Was no longer a curse bestowed by man.
She forced him into two-handed implements,
He could pick his way across stone,
His tongue caressing every organ.
So, with the blade touching his tender skin,
He mustered his strength and stood,
His legs briefly suspending above him.
As the tears left their cracks,
His ghostly robes turned black,
And his legs burned like ash.
By gods' will, this magic tore through all,
Flowing hot and cold to an ashbrick.
His body crawled up off the ashes and onto the floor,
Hindered by the ghastly beast.
And as it's galloping reached the skies,
With the words of her eternity sealed,
There came forth the wings.
As she did so, the Princess wore a tight mask,
And had also a card reading,
> **I ascend to the heavens. **
**And before I cross the sea,
To the Halls of Scarlet,
My wish is granted. **

*This one is from This Week... *
Our actions here are fueling it. We've all given away our secrets, now the guilt is no longer in our hearts. We're the one infected. The only ones who know.
Our stories are evil.
Men and women who aren't sick still cheat on each other, they're feeding and selling then destroying each other. It is outside our understanding how they're feeling so it's always a possibility. It's like someone imprisoned me inside of them, and to hold onto me is all I could do at this point.
Women and children are all that I hold in my heart, I hate them.
We say it's justified.
This disease is to spread to people to overcome them. To build it into a curse that will only be met with the blessings of men. Men can't lie if the whole world knows, it's not right.
I'm not guilty of the sickness, I know it. I'm a goddess.
But I am alive and I have a wound with me. Like we all do. Men live because they too are sick. I have been infected with this disease, and the only way for us to protect ourselves is to use the rest of the world to prevent it. To make the sick more comfortable.
This disease does not exist, why am I infected with this disease? I am not a person, yet this disease infects every human in the world.
I don't accept this. What am I? Am I really this sick man I feed on every day? Am I just a sick creature?
Am I the sickest man in this world?<|endoftext|>

“ How did he get here? ” I pleaded, clutching my hands in front of me. My last sight was an old, yellowed, red four-foot-long slug with surprisingly deep boils in the center of its mouth. My husband reminded me of his older brother, Dr. Peculiar Peeves, who had landed in Iraq with our son Jason.
I had spent my childhood thinking of how to finish the complicated grinder. Through rough practice, I had started up several long sessions in electrical construction. No-one knows how this had gotten started, but as far back as we could remember, Jason was a dinosaur. He'd owned our home for almost a year before landing.
We visited Jason once a month. The week after Jason's third birthday. After that, he asked a variety of questions. None of us asked what was special about him, just his size and moveability.
We often met on my lunch break to talk about how good things were at my new home. On one week, I was receiving praise for a project I was about to start at my feet, when Jason jumped up and led the group out onto the yard. I had no idea what had startled Jason away from the dig site.
“ Hey, B. You've got to know something, ” he announced. He raised his clipboard and gestured for the little green-red slug to follow. His tongue lolled forward, his tail splayed out on his feet.
“ Hm? ” I asked. “ Yes. ”
“ I saw him run across your side as you down here, ” he pointed at Jason. “ Look at it, big man. You will not run and run, you will run like you did last week. ” He gestured to his mouth.
I stared at it, perplexed.
“ I saw Jason and you walking up here yesterday. ”
Jason turned around. “ Yep. I saw him lean on your shoulder as you lowered your shovel. ” He took a large gulp of his meat. “ Then I said, ” he paused, turned around, pulled the mound toward his face, and motioned for me to come closer. “ So we followed him down there. ” He looked at me curiously and nodded. “ You must know, I haven't heard him in so long. ”
“ He's in my kitchen, ” I said. “ Let's go see him. ” I took my seat and guided him off the ground toward the metal workbench that rested just deep enough from the hole. I watched him move the slab over and over with his feet and rest his body on the base of the pit. It was warm, but I couldn't leave him behind.
No. I didn't want to hear more of this pathetic old man's language in any other form than to give a sensation of safe passage. I closed my eyes and shut my eyes as he pulled apart the slab. It glowed a dull yellow and then a faint blue. It wasn't dead. It was, it appeared, in a crumbling pile.<|endoftext|>

It's been 4 years, "Fuck, I'm totally not going to do this anymore" he muttered. Flushed with depression, tears, anger, and defensiveness, he tried every plan he had. Give him a billion dollars, tell him he can ’ t keep living in this dumb shithole and take care of his wife, then let her treat him on his terms. Get rid of his ex. Maintain his American citizenship. Whatever. Move on. In order to keep his own humanity, or so he thinks, he held onto the American dream through debt- the Korean War in Japan, Iran, and finally Afghanistan. Working the rest of the world, staying warm in Florida, flying the company plane up to Chicago. He had been living in Maine for as long as he could remember.

The aliens opened the window on the third floor of Earth's tallest city. Life was good. Usually they were just here for Earth use, but today was different. The humans discovered ants last month. The first of the species, headed by a man named Trevor of the tribe, was spotted as soon as a stunning panorama of rice fields erupted into a spectacular feast. Trevor was infected with the infection after another massive dinner time with his friends. When he settled down with his wife for the night, his stomach quaked as if the dry ground around him did not want to go anywhere. He quickly made for the door and cautiously grabbed his M-60. The machine reported a toxic level before Trevor responded and the guards approached. They grabbed him by the throat and held him down while laughing at the gag. Trevor gagged and said "what are they doing.. " All the air on the planet forced a low wheeze and when he regained his composure, the overseer who was overseeing the situation asked " so you wouldn't have to do that? " " Sure, but you still got to do it." The overseer was no god anymore. The communicators said no more amino acids so there was no room for medicine anymore, and the council decided it was hopeless that the human could go anywhere without taking the government classified pathogen in. Everyone had reports of brain tracers, synaptic signals and " complex occult rituals ". Earth had them all.<|endoftext|>

Riots rage in the streets, bringing the locals to their knees. Police brutality keeps the sun shining just beyond the horizon.
"You're a thorn in my neighbor's lawn, son. " I sigh bitterly.
I glance over to the next man running through the streets, ducking behind the red moonlight and barely paying attention. My hands shake as I watch him.
I hear a police squad motorcade passing close by as they head back towards the houses.
" Did they pick you up? " I hear the driver say.
" I think so, son. "
" They're calling me a terrorist!"
I run out in the street. I try not to let the thought take me any further. The crowd grows louder now as the police nudge and shove.
I hand the bag over to the frightened man.<|endoftext|>

*Not a free book! *
I've wrote my introduction a few times now, but I couldn't resist. Here's my summary of the girl who just rolled the wheels of me:
I don't think I've ever written anything quite like this. Yet somehow it is enticing to enter into my mind and experience itself. Don't get me wrong, it takes me forever to write. From such a first draft as these, my patience and mental grasp are well rewarded.
But I have gone beyond that.
I take up the wheel that sits before me in a predictable fashion. I set off to explore, or choose to explore the unknown. Yet when I'm done I slip into a wholly different reality. I have fought wrongs, realised true horror, sought refuge from pain and shared responsibility, felt peace and happiness for years.
There is no horror in this world.
Each day is different for the old man, but each day is only brighter. That's exactly what makes the wheel the masterwork of my story. That and the idle chatter of a family with toys for the evening.
But no matter what the wheel or whatever it is, it will always haunt me the rest of my days in darkness.<|endoftext|>

He did it again. An army of 3 million had been sent to Tokyo. Just two weeks ago, Japan found out the King had been a prick. All he had to do was say the word "Godzilla". Then they would send that god back. Godzilla, well... the King was actually much easier. He met people on the street and enjoyed a whole host of brief misadventures. The people all loved him. But most importantly, he was a nasty, nasty prick.
Eventually, the next crowd, he commanded. The crowd surged, and on the way to talk of the King's reveal was an unknown quantity of samurai called ningen butu. On the last day, Godzilla was unleashed upon all of Japan.<|endoftext|>

"Name be hon, and my men! Rise to battle, and our faces shall be glorious! " shouted the mighty wraith in front of me. The crowd went silent as I came to the surface. Even my noble brother and I stood quietly against the growing beast. As I gazed upon the creature in front of me, I knew I shouldn't have rushed after it. I had done everything in my power to protect myself, but now....thou would risk my own life to protect the people of Earth.
" At his grave, I know of all the wonders wrought by him! All his victories, all his victories! " boomed the airless voice in the crowd. I ran up to him, and began to speak. " You see, none of us saw him. I saw him when he had taken first, and we all saw him when he had first slipped into the void. I saw him, after all, when he was mended from a bad wound when he had fled into one of those black vacuum chambers. You see, the inevitability of death, that is how I have foretold and I have done what we can to make humanity move on. But if it had been up to me, I would have tried to save him, and indeed it has been, until now! "
He was tall, and all my men were overjoyed, and they were fighting on for the first time ever. Many people in the crowd, not all of whom were large as the beast, gathered to see what the monster could accomplish! The crowd took their cue and cheered as the demon spoke.
" Now listen here mortal, brothers and sisters! My Brothers and Sisters, in you name we bring a reminder to the humble warrior, and we will do so in commemoration of this month we call Independence Day. "
I clasped my father's hand firmly in mine, before staring at him with the crest of his Iflitax in my left. " My Father, I can only keep from betraying you! " I gasped, afraid. As the two men closed in on each other, I could hear the sound of hooves clicking together in unison.
" We are all children, brothers and sisters! " they shouted as the two leader stood strong.
" Now, Father, take this sword from your father, and soon they shall stand before you."<|endoftext|>

*7 years ago, when I was 19, I remember the Grand Jury convened. They left us to our own devices to pass judgement. Without any apparent cause, we made songs about Wokniks and the fallen realms. Immediately, a new cultural song played. The word would be born, one that would pull everyone together and unite us against nothingness and villainy. It was the rallying rallying cry of the fractured United Nations. *
* We did not dream, did not hear it, no doubt. Instead, we as a people collectively summoned and created the song and thought, *one bright and bold word for anyone who truly feared the darkness*. We sang it and thought, inspired by the powers within ourselves and our society. The immense blackness that once covered the land slowly subside. And around me, we sang.
*Even in the darkest depths of the maelstrom, there is no greater song. That song will always exist for us, in its eternal meaning. *
What they sang was none other than Jekyll. The word was light incarnate, and even that somehow no longer exists. We sang the song. And grew. We sang and eventually we went out into the world and all grew bright, cool and welcoming. The meaning of this moment is plain to everyone. Only the dark abyss lingers.
*I guess for all of humanity, it is worth the screams. If only we could turn the lights and the dark into powerful weapons for our villainy, but where should we launch them? I would have never believed they could change history. It would have doomed us to a depression. *
*We sang that to tell people that the dark was going to rule. We didn't think it was a bad idea. Until today. Today, I remember one last time. A door in my children's room opens and goes out. I sing this prayer, so as not to offend the darkness, but for your comfort. *
*For when the dark fades, people will wake to the new light. Soon people will turn white and leave. And yours too. ***
*It was Jekyll. His song was called: Jekyll and the Dictatorship. We, the Guardians of the Homeland, shall rebuild the lands, turn the wheels of history, and bring peace back to this place of darkness. **<|endoftext|>

Once upon a time it was a place where men took me. In the city of York my role was as a guard in the bustling land of York, under the guard of my master, Detective Livermore, only a few months at the time. Until one night at midnight the dying hours turned into winter and before me lay a seemingly empty floorboard.
With a silence came the rumbling of my feet as I strained to cover up my eyes. I was shouting a raspy phrase that I had memorized. It's like something deep in my throat.
"I think I could use a nap. "
I push the red button, and a translucent screen on the wall pops up. Suddenly I notice a box filled with tiny things. Inside is a pencil of some kind.
" My dear Michael " says to me.
I put the pen down and chuckle.
" Don't wan na see more of it, Mr. Livermore. But I can tell you one thing. "
" You'd better stop protesting."<|endoftext|>

Me and the kids look around the enormous tattered, concrete world we are in. Sometimes there is a rain forest, some rustling woods and debris hitting me down.
We sit in my lab, keys still in my lanyard, my eyes glued to the screen reading something on my phone. My phone that never connected to my desk since I moved here.
As we stand there in the dust, around the gaping hole in the ship, I think about what the Americans have chosen to do with this discovery. 15 years of research and history, a lot of blood, and the first test. What would happen to the US if it weren't worth the cost?
"Jeff, can I sit here with you? " I ask. He smiles at me and the radio lines dissipate. He looks like he wants to make a rocket story out of me.
" Are you stumped? "
" Yeah, but why am I stumped? "
" Oh my god man, you realize that's not what you meant by it. Your initial thought about space and space programs was trying to explain that all the iron in the world won't break. Now they're jumping ship. You're the boss and the lead scientist. Your boss is the guy who's going to kill the americans. Your lead scientist is the guy who invented time travel. Now that future man is the one with infinite knowledge, not knowledge to do the experiments. You and your assistant are headed on an epic quest. You made a mistake and you all know it. They're on the third or fourth ship from Earth ready to fight. Can you... "
" It's not about me, okay? I thought about the other things that I have to do, too. " My screen went blank.
A blinding silence follows us for several minutes. What the hell did they expect when they chose this research vessel? Didn't they know that all ships would start developing off the ground if space travel happened. Where are we even going?
" John, can we get the TV on? I'm looking for the Buzzfeed. "
" Yeah, uh. John, watch that. Just a sec. " I put the TV on. I am the first person to leave Earth.
" John, John? "
" What? Well, if we go to the weird time in space you might be able to see them maybe! "
" But, we're off. "
" John, they need your help! We need to stop them!"
I push the button and go upstairs to my cabin. As I get out of my room, I can see all 50 stars on all of the ships on their way to the ship. 5 alien spacecraft arrived from the sky. They show up on the ship and grab me and my children and my wife. As I kneel down and hug them, I hear a loud pops noise and white hot spit lands on the floor. They grab me and hold me by the hair and shove them into my arms. It was so cold. Warm too. I hate mornings.<|endoftext|>

"You're telling me we should never dig this?! ", I asked as I stepped onto the dig site.
" We shouldn't dig this shit! " Amat felt repulsed, " who the fuck is going to dig this shit. "
" Okay, fine. We can. "
" But aren't we supposed to-? "
" No, we'll dig this, " Amat made an affirmative sign.
" Bullshit, you're such a dick. Are you a nice person?! ", he angrily screamed.
" No. Don't be fucking mean about it, sir. I don't know anyone. " I turned around and walked into his domain.
Amat smiled down at me, his pale skin was melting into crisp white white sand. He started to shiver, " what the fuck is a warm chill?! "
" Have you ever seen the lip of the moon? ", Amat asked curiously.
" FUCK! " I stood and ran towards the intercom of the dig site.
" This isn't what we're looking for. " He calmly stated.
" I know, " I said wiggling in my feet. I was lying.
" Is there shit in there? " Amat asked.
" No, no, no. There is no shit beneath me. This is going to ruin the job. "
" This isn't what you wanted me to do! " I spat.
" And now we are digging below, I don't have to go around and take your stinkisest, as much as you guys want to, " Amat said frustrated.
" Don't laugh, this is getting ridiculous, " I said, " no need to calm down, this shit IS important and we shouldn't dig this shit!"
Amat ran off. I left the dig site, covered my mouth with my hands, and called the police.<|endoftext|>

The Re-Shoot She had been working on for a few days now. Short and lanky, she had a gift that her powers held, but it was limited to just one power. She wore a perfect Midlander Skeletons style with a red brim. Her brain, aura and talons were light red in color. As she finished her shift, she smiled and blinked. The spotlights were finally returning. The monsters that had opened the alley were doing a good job. She had an idea of what she was going to do. She felt her wings protect her. As she said this, a bright flash began to light up nearby and make her fast. She looked down. That's when she saw it: The girl. She had green eyes, a glowing green ear, and black fur that covered her head. She was a midlander with red, bright green eyes, and hair that was white. She had a magic bullet-shaped finger on the back of her hand. There was something in her eyes that made her human.
"Hey, what's up? " The girl said, reaching for her necklace, only to find it quickly touched the ground. There was much coughing. There were strands of hair running from her eyes. It was not really warm in her right hand as her left. Her magic shot out to poke her hand into the air, and she returned the noise with a screech. The shudders faded away, and a blanket fell over her. She furrowed her brow as she turned to go home. Her sister stood and smirked at her.<|endoftext|>

“ EVERYONE PLEASE GO BACK TO LETS GO PLAY ” Little Pete shouted from the living room. He knew he had to. “ It will stain the walls and I ’ m gon na have to cut them open and spit them all out. ”
“ That sounds a bit racist ”

“ So what if you ’ re not going to do it? ”
“ Go! ”
The Big Bad Wolf stared in silence. The Mafia's lawsuit was getting as loud as ever. Little Pete hadn ’ t had any friends since he was a teenager. Anything you did to remind them how racist you were had to be those things. For a while he kept trying to get his act together, but being unfaithful was still a struggle. He started to feel better, but this was the last straw.

Pusher an cup of ginger ale. The blind hollers of the tavern beeped in agreement. Praise ensues and salutations that the gatekeeper belongs on his way. Pusher trots off, between the sea and the filth.
The End
Warmth is flowing like riverbenders on a hot autumn evening, salt yet warm. His noble forest is fragrant and waiting for the next rush of trees towards the gate. He races to draw near but to his surprise, a scaled demon crawls from the mist. It is wearing armor as beautifully as stags, yet with the same hatchet and the same head of a cat. It is alabaster in form with arrows clattering to the ground like thorns. It was immovable. The demon moves towards Pusher but is slowed by pikes so cold and heavy that it must have fallen from the sky. Pusher falls and is seen by a set of eyes. The oars of the demon squeal in protest as they cover Pusher's face with hand-holds. The wooden archway begins to glow with the etherial energy of Pusher's cell. Suddenly, Pusher is found in a field, a young boy dancing next to an emaciated fox. The boy is bleeding. The young devil raises his hand with chilling intent and pummels the small fox until the boy bled to death. The fox's eyes glow green with a resplendent glow.
Suddenly, the boy stops dead in his tracks. Pusher sees that the fox dies. He cries out in sorrow for his life and for the boy's. The field is green and the boy keeps his foot and its magics flowing. Pusher cries out for help to open his eyes.
The wind is strong and Pusher sees a sharp jolt of electricity and a banshee is approaching him from behind. The tree of information is filled with foes and darkness. Pusher is still going and is panting to himself. The boy is dripping with sweat and paling before the banshee picks up a small wooden shield.
"What is that?" Pusher says to the sweet green grass of the forest and to the boy.<|endoftext|>

**Dear dad, **
Wake up. Dinner is for you. Don't follow me around. Don't chase me around when you are hungry. I told you before that you should see how good mommy looks at you. Ask her out, talk to her while I am gone. You're close. I promise.
Wake up. You've got it tough. I told you, I'm the monster. I am the big one. The monster, you understand that. The big one, I am real. Yeah, maybe that's not all. I don't blame you for not stepping in where I am. But you've given us dinner and a little practice. Go out and find her and start your name tag.
Wake up. You need to. You're never asleep. OK, calm down. You've got time. You'll be fine, Dad. I know what you think about me. I know your name tag. But I'm right here. Okay. I'm here, I am real.
Wake up. You'll be fine. I'm right here. You won't be breathing on me. I'm right here.
Wake up. Do it. Eat. Do it fast. Wipe that blanket off and get ready. Play. You need to get ready before I come. I like it going fast. You should be ready. I'm right here. I've been waiting a long time for you and I know that you'll be. Go for it.
Wake up. Wake up. I love you. Wait for me. I know you won't be here to wake up but I promise you this and that. We can do it. I promise.
I got nothing tomorrow and I hope you do too. I'll be here in a while. In fact, I'm keeping the bed until we have a lot of time to play again. That was real enough. Sleep tight. Wake up, Mom. Wake up.<|endoftext|>

The cold, molten pavement of the Chicago river playfully showed scars across its periphery. Eyes wound in misgiving darkness. The small whirlpool of sodium smoke that hung askew within the phantom storm cloud from the campsite beyond. Brown tendrils of flat gray smoke raced across the pooled pavement, illuminated by a soft crimson light emanating from its side, an intimate connection to the poisonous, dissolving water.

If you ask me, *he* is a noice. A man capable of a remarkable combination of energy, motivation, emotion, and otherwise augmented intelligence. He drives his identity, as an individual with the typical qualities of the average American, into perverse endeavors and activity. He warms the hearts of women and children by providing warmth to the now-extinguished lungs of men. He showers us with a dry sense of deja vu, a time-worn belief that he is an unlikely man, so similar in on himself that the notion of his homogeneity is a sick formula for concern.
He detests no one, and neither lacks motivation or the common decency to. While we all have the naive, sentimental capability to resist the need to change, he refuses to admit his feelings are shallow and misguided, simply too stubbornly clingy and detached to offer us a chance to be different.
One
The animals of Chicago disregard the rules of happiness and accepts only those who are willing to risk their well-being. He permits them, if you will, to populate the city with energy and vitality, solving innumerable problems, enriching families and communities, building social and scientific advancements.
You have put him in his place. You have not given me a reason to move on.
Two
He is Satan, and God is nothing more than a victim of our vanity and despondency. You have walked behind the thin shell of your own being. My place is now in the hands of you, my family, and I, and you, yes, you. You must accept. Your place is empty, your priorities are skewed, your minds are kept locked in an endless cycle of worthless dreams. Your money is you, your tools are your energy, and your warmth is your love.
One
He is fire, and you are fire.<|endoftext|>

There were nods and shoves across the deserted city, the sirens twitching like the sheep in mares. This was the second one, this was the third. That twig I had pointed. That's where they pulled the dog.
No, they said there would be no other way. There were no other ways.
They hauled the man, the cat, and the empty cellar and reached in in for the door. Slowly, as it had been pulled; he was violently thrown from the pyre, dirt, and other debris. The dream then faded, as the cat vanished and the man was left. The wall where he and the homeless were, they had made on the inside their house, no longer covered with white linen and potted plants.
That night, when it was over, before the dust covered the man, the cat was strong; it was awake, sharp as a six-blade. But my dream had never been her
said its voice: there was no escape. The time came. The echoes. My fists clenched, like will clenched before a fist that had never been clenched before.
On the other side, inside the tavern I thought about my lot in life. My car. All was gone. I wouldn't be on any kind of road again. I lied. Well, I lied, as the suit had told me before, that I was crazy. An alcoholic with a dark side. So old that I would have sworn I saw himself in the shadowy corner of the world.
He met his end there. Never did he tell me what happened to him after that. He must've gathered himself, I remember, when he hurt me. The pain was so cruel. Was it because I wanted it all to end?
No. He told me many things. And I asked the same question to him again. Was it something that was evil? That was why I wanted it all to end, he told me.
I wouldn't answer. Only to lie. It was a lie, truly. Because I was haunted by the man I once called friend. He told me many more things. For so many years, it had been my friend. He told me the truth. And then there was the door.
This door. It was a cold, dead, slumbering door. There was a voice. A word I dreaded. I didn't know. He told me many things. And I asked it the same question: would it be ok to lie in wait for all this. And he gave me hope. He told me that as long as I lied, he would be back.
That was why I left and I am here. With my shackles wrapped around my ankles, a door to my nightmare. This door, this door. And I will let one thing break the cycle.
I wont lie, old friend. I may regret it for long. But I will take it, and soon there will be no more lies to haunt me. And then the last thing I want will be my kitty.<|endoftext|>

Today is the day I've been waiting for. Before I turn 18, I have to drive a single group of people one mile. The first two miles are a grueling ride.
I can feel the pressure in my shoulders. One person steps forward, and the next comes forward. The pressure builds, building until a feeling of impending doom comes over my body.
My heart thumps and thumps in my ears, pumping out as I rush down the road. The door is slammed open. The loud roar of a car is punctuated with screams as it's suddenly gone. I stop, shaking with fear. My phone buzzes, telling me I have a number to call.
"Hello? "
" What's your name? " I respond, unsure how to properly respond.
"....Steven... Damien. " My throat is still raw, but it can't help but feel so much better. It's 9 a.m. and I've already run to work in under an hour.
Steven's voice was soothing. " Listen, Steven, this is work and your car needs to be replaced. It must have crashed. "
*I HAVE to call. *
" Calm down Steven. I know you're worried about the car. You're trying to make it to work. It should work for you. This is your fault. This is your fault. There are circumstances that indicate that you had to save the car and end your day. You can't be responsible for anything if you don't do what's right for the rest of your life. "
Steven's eyes were like pieces of glass. He wanted me to plead, yell at him. His mask was ripped from his face, revealing a new version of him, his hair a manicured mess of streaks. His purple eyes began to fill with tears. My heart stopped for a split second. * What did I do?! *
A very strange man exited his car. He sat down with his back straight, his head tilted slightly, and his chin and eyes framed perfectly by the driver side mirror. His fingers were completely white, and his skin was lightly bristling from various abrasions.
" Good night Steven, my name is Dr. Strangelove. "
I yell at him, " Listen, listen! I know you're worried about the car, and in no way am I, and will be asking me to help you. I swear, if you're lucky I'm going to be able to pull you out of this. But this will, to me, mean a lot to your family. "
" Shh, I know. I'll always give you a second chance Steven. "
" No Steven. Stop talking, this is not my fault! " He gently laid a hand on my shoulder, and I quickly comforted him, until his frail body was still in the driver seat. I watched as Steven began to cry, and whispered in his ear, " I want you to know that I love you. "
My phone was shattered in the passenger seat, and by the time I got it back, the phone had turned off and started playing music on the dashboard.
"... Thanks."<|endoftext|>

President - you've got to find a way.
I sighed before I turned to the only person who might calm me down.
Michael, I have a better idea.
He smiled and the first thing I saw was the government approaching. Long grass stretching over a mile high above my head, the flame tracer was fast and well aimed. Somewhere behind the the light bulb a jumble of bees flew and far enough to smack my head, drawing me to a stop in an awkward yet graceful pose.
"White House? Is that a president? " Michael asked. He was standing in a dark jungle of black, about the size of a small city building.
I reached out to touch him, and, trying to look a little softer than the usual, I grabbed his arm and gave a small push.
I felt my voice resonate with the moment and, much like the sound of thunder, I felt it bend in front of my face and take on a whole new form. How I like to say it is, when you think about it, almost makes sense.
" You won't believe what happened. " I told him as I walked into the hotel lobby.
He smiled and smiled wider and wider, too wide. It was as if he remembered us all, the proud and fearful presidents of the past who had perished. They were in the room, trying to talk to the burning wreckage of their city. My soul was hurt and I knew one of my greatest dreams had come true.
He could have shouted, my voice was trembling but, he had chosen the voice that would carry his journey of mind to an uncertain place.
I smiled back in response and held him close. He was mine now and I could not wait to tell him the truth.
" Should I stay with you, Mr. President?"
The president nodded and left.

Black hair stood on end by end, and a nasty white collar greeted him as he grinned wickedly.
They'd all agreed on a date. All kinds of red-faced ballerinas dressed up, and infamous smoking hot friends.
That was it. The XXXL mutation. From birth, it became useless, very new. That was all it could do for certain.
But it was changing. Soon, the Questmaster left for the Pacific, and so the box could be opened by just a single click.
A gleaming little over fifty feet tall, high as the sea. Fingers of bread, bowls of olive oil, decayed. Just a blank void of emptiness.
Almost, of course.
A penny.
He took a sip from his jar of Omegle Taffy, his favorite mouthwash.
It was all gone.
"What?! " he shouted. " What's this!? "
He yanked the box open. There, bare and broken, a jar of marinara sauce, still shaking.
A penny in four.
Foulin.
A writhing mass of moose.
And white lace.
As he looked down at the still untouched jar, a look of pity appeared on his face.
" Who did this to you? " he shouted, audibly.
He was so old.
And still ugly.
A worm slowly materialized and nearly grabbed the pill from his vase.
" I know. I like that.., " he murmured, pausing a moment, before nodding and flipping the old pill over, tossing it in his lap.
" Okay... ". He handed it over to the little girl and pushed it into his hand.
" This could be saved. " she said.
" Really? Why wouldn't I save you? Why would you die like me? "
" Because I'm a game console. You've done your part. I want to see you die... but not just figuratively, *but literally. * "
" I'll always love you. "
" Yes, but it has to stop. "
" I mean, " she said, her vision wavering between the pills.
" The only reason I get points in PvP is because you were so *good*. "
" And I get higher levels... because, no, you've done your work! "
" What kind of work? I haven't played a game in over a year! Why didn't you get another? "
" Please forgive me. "
The little girl opened her eyes and jumped up, shouting at the monster " Stop it! "
The worm ate the pill, which was downed before it could regenerate.
" PLEASE! " she cried, startling the creature's tendrils as it bit down on the pill with every sharp intake of energy.
" I'm so sorry," he whispered to himself before swallowing the pill.<|endoftext|>

In an instant, my word, we were with our laser harvesters to kill this man. He was dishonorable, defying everything our test subjects had written and prayed for. We came together to try and take out this alien menace with its monstrous spaceship. As our alpha brothers, I decided to search up neighboring planets, and with the knowledge of our planet, we had be able to hunt him down.
However, the problem was that it was largely a marine species. Some of them even had a "zipper ". Sharks, of course, with sharp claws that could rip the sand from their sails and sharks with ease, which looked like they emerged from their vessels with weaponry that resembled whales.
Regardless of the feeling of defeat, and the idea that being believed to be unstoppable should be assumed to be our biggest weakness, the situation was going to change. The sharks always appeared with weapons in their hands. Sadly, we simply found that they lacked the ability to beat the massive claws at hand.
It took many more tests and hours of travel to learn about the creatures, but in the end, these sharks managed to kill almost all of us before we had any chance to retreat. One hour later, after we had defeated the sharks, we decided to take our planet. We selected a desolate planet with a large amount of land, and played with it, searching for weaknesses.
When we finally found something, though we could not call it anything, the crew and I needed to find a suitable location.
So, we walked through the desert before we finally found our target. The sound of battle, the heat, the noise of battle, the intense battle between members of the groups. It was finally time to kill the bold flamed ones. I and many other crew mates was moving towards the nearest barn, when we heard a loud bang.
" Yup, the mothership is at the point, heading straight towards earth, right behind me. "
I look up to see the captain, with a shocked look on my face, wondering what he was doing. I heard my comrades approaching me with an intimidating look on their faces. I did not feel anything particularly different, so I continued moving towards him, though I was aware of the hot sun catching our vision.

When I finally gave in I hugged him.
He was snarling and I could feel that he was about to grow faint and fall apart and his scent was getting worse and worse.
I sat there silently.
"I need him to stay. He's going to be very happy here. He won't want to go, but he needs to, " he would respond, " He'll be a good boy. " I wanted him to know, " this is what you need to do, and you need to do it like this. Be kind and be kind, and when it's time for him to go, be strong. Be kind, and when he gets to the real world, like this moment, it'll be a peaceful one... "
He started barking and I stopped listening.
" That's it! You're no more. " I didn't even need him to say that.
I thought about all the things I should have done. Did I leave him with a straight A in school? Did I keep him a pet instead of running away? Had I just let him become a cat and have him find more loving companionship? Did I leave him take more loving care of him?
I couldn't bring myself to speak.
" You're wrong. You know what's right for a kitten, and I know you're wrong."
Why can't I say it to him?
Why can't I just go on with my life?<|endoftext|>

I'm in black. I'll be back soon. Too late.
I'm in black, my hands dozed by a cold night's moon. The road ahead stretches from area to area, traffic quickening for a few minutes before it's backed up to the twenty-fifth floor. I'm not sure if I'll ever be lucky. I don't know how long I'll be where I'm going or when I'll get there. I don't have much left to do but... it's pretty normal.
Bartenders are scarce and clean, but it's just me.
It's a pretty unusual thing to be out here. You'd think you were a bit of a loner, except you don't really have hobbies. I mean, who remembers? I had my stethoscope, a 99.99 caliber bullet for only 1.4 ounces. I guess I'm not sure what I took that day.
Only one thing to do at night is to sit on that rock, close my eyes for a few minutes, and exhale deep in. I spend hours of my days toiling at that body until suddenly my whole body is enveloped in that black nothingness. I remember every moment vividly and thoroughly. The last thing I remember is a silver hole burst from my mouth in a flash.
I probably should've learned to breathe faster.
I'm out here waiting for my wife. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I was unable to find her.
Maybe she was gone forever.<|endoftext|>

"You know what it's like to live in two worlds. Hell, where bad people are just slain by the wicked and evil ones. Heaven and Hell, where just fun and games and planets full of fucking stars. " Death lifted his hood, showing off his henchmen. Everyone let out a sigh. " Well, I suppose that doesn't really make sense. Would it really make sense to die in Heaven? Or would it, after all, be a complete bastard? " The Angel looked suspiciously forward. " Well, where then? " He winked at Death and showed him the map he had painstakingly drawn. " Heaven, I guess. " Death stepped forward a few steps and sat down, the board showing the major points of struggle. " That is a nice choice, can you admit it? " He leaned over and pulled a baseball bat out of the corner of his eye. " Yep. From over here. The big continent covered in rivers and everything, so there's plenty of water here as well. Plus, the landmass is mostly bare. All the other areas are covered in forests and teas. It's not bad, really, all the natural resources being spent just fine on trees. Hilarious. "
" Oh, this would be great. " He leant back and stared blankly at the map.
" Sounds good to me. " A small hand appeared out of thin air. " We have four obstacles here. High areas are marked by mountains, so jumping over them will take about a full day, and the border is just wide enough to easily reach a solid wall between the peaks.
" However, I got ta say, this place feels a little cluttered. There are primitive engines and hangers that need to be pushed out and re-routed or be reset every time. My first time here, you have to do some things like take supplies or carry a couple of things. I've brought more food and liquids. The second one is filled with materials and lights, but make sure you keep the equipment on. I've seen it do that when a fallen gunner is shot, and once the door is opened, there's a hold. Always a good place to try and work out who's worth losing. I guess there's always the difficult bit. " Death sighed. " Really, the home planet is the most hot and humid area I've ever seen. Plus, apparently there's another continent covered in trees and some waters and it's pretty damn dense. "
The Angel tilted his head. " So, the problem with Heaven and Hell, if you can't take a man in either without going to Hell for an hour, how do you get there? "
Death nodded a little. " Well, the easiest way is to ask them to step around your midsection for about a minute and talk about your ultimate punishment. I can't do that, I am immortal. All of my imprisonment has just happened to have been so intense I could cut a hole in any man's heart, so I know this is the easiest way to go. On to the long game." The Angel zoomed off down the map and Death stood beside him. Just like that, both places were gone in a flurry of motion and he stared blankly into nothingness.<|endoftext|>
**********789**********
As he limped past it, the still warm feeling in his arms was still present in his breath, even when he was coming to. Even as his knees felt, it was still warm, even after five minutes of being dizzy.
The taste of coffee was drifting into his mouth, like it had just been dropped in front of his eyes. The pale print of his face was slowly growing, unlike the ones of the past. Until it passed to the ground.
The coffee spilled from the parfait her eyes had left on his mouth, and he can still see it now, what made it so special was his memories of his childhood. He was so young again, and yet his eyes were still connected to something else, and that was the first time he had eaten in that small town for five months.
"What a beautiful morning," he thought as he felt warm comforting pull at his jacket. Everyone was so young again, and yet so young. But he knew it would never happen, yet he didn ’ t have the courage to test the edges of his consciousness, and if he did, the whole world would be different from he expected it to.<|endoftext|>
**********790**********
Finally, I opened the massive door the night before. My reflection in the mirror ahead was on my face.
Fifty pounds of white flesh was squished into one mighty claw, but it was time to fight. All I needed was the courage to close the door.
For some reason I hadn't known the Kraken would attack me in so long. I didn't need to talk to it, however. It was probably very close, maybe even threatening. I knew I wouldn't be able to save them from my mistakes.
I swung open the huge metal door, ignoring the tides below me.
Bored for one last chance, I jumped down into the murky waters. Waves lashed out like hunters. Soon, I could feel their knives for the first time. As I held my hands out in surrender, I looked down at my wrists. Time seemed to pass faster.
I could feel something beneath my skin. I opened my eyes to find myself standing on a cliff, staring off into the distance. This was it.
Finally, I had a purpose. It was my only chance.
I didn't need to sink to the bottom of this well.
Slight gusts of wind landed against the rocks that had trailed down to my sides. Warm, refreshing air that brought me to my feet.
If I looked down, the Kraken wouldn't be standing there at all. It was truly right on the shores of this hidden treasure.
I couldn't believe I'd finally accomplished it.
I climbed onto my prize before the light and rain. One last time, for once, I walked the waters at bay.
Not knowing what else to do in this cave, I decided to merely take a nap. Before the Kraken, I still traveled across the world under the guidance of my right hand.
I wasn't terribly fortunate to get to this point, though. Sometimes the world finds a way to send me somewhere I wish I had lived. I didn't want it like this.
I ripped up the rope from my grasp and charged at the Kraken.
But before I could even get a foot on the beast, I was ripped off.
A great white, blue face snaked from my glassy mouth and morphed into me. I threw the rope at the Kraken, hitting it with all of my might, only to be pulled down by the sticky hands of the Kraken.
Suddenly, the Kraken looked up at me. It was surprised to see me standing there with an expression of what could only be described as surrender.
I sank.
Finally, I had a purpose.<|endoftext|>
**********791**********
The moon sat a shining rectangle against the day. Blue flowers bared their wings as we walked under the stars. It was as if everyone watched them.
It had been almost a hundred years since I'd seen my parents shed a tear, yet I still saw them.
They looked so much like me now.
But I never once imagined having to tell them what happened. As a kid, I thought that if I ever passed, they would come for me one day. Something to hold them next to me in the blissful touch of a day in the future. An adventure for them to learn about me, a family lullaby of peace and harmony. The only thing left to do now was make sure they would forget my name.
I'd end up marrying a pretty woman in the next town. Another time. Something's always good to be able to share in one of the good times. Better yet, we can have that rest after all.
It's what I imagine us saying to each other; "You didn't experience the things you're stuck with, did you?" It is meant to be as pleasant as possible, but we get bored afterwards.<|endoftext|>
**********792**********
I ascended. My purpose before me is lost and my physical form consumed in a terrifying crash. From my floating form I move through the thousands and thousands of galaxies, finally settling into a vast infinity, where I find myself alone.
"Okay guys... " I mutter out " there we go. Listen, I'm starting to think about how I'm being strange. I can see everything. It's not some gods vision for myself, it's becoming a distorted reality. I really need to stop this, but this is it. I leave and all that gets you is more questions then answers. "
" Okay, looks like it. " the voice on the other end of the line finished. The others look up sheepishly, then back down, followed by suddenly silence, the last whisper of the being's whispers resounding before they become vocalized " no, this is not a dream. "
" Where is my vision?! Where are my senses?? How does this work!? I can feel anything, anything is a blur "
" Please don't be. This is incredible. I haven't been standing here a thousand trillion times now! We must have been born centuries ago, my entire existence can be classified into thousands of possibilities to explain. I'm so sorry if you feel like this, we need to stop playing games with your minds. "
" Listen... " the end line choked up " it is possible, there is no need for this, you're doing your duty. This is where it all started. "
" Don't let them take us there! Do not let them watch us. They can not care about our lives, our grandiose plans and inevitable failures. Let us go in peace. It's time to end this madness. Let's hear it in a second... "
My people gathered around me, faced solemnly, except for the stillness of the crowd that wasn't listening. They looked up at me, there were tears streaming from their eyes, uncontrollable. Their voice screamed at me, it turned the light itself bright for a split second then it dissipated into nothingness, leaving me with only silence... with that thought, I grabbed them both to help me through. I felt the fabric of reality unbolter... that force was pulling me away.
" If only I could go back and visit the world.... " I was standing by a perfect cube of... lightning? Had there ever been that? I thought. My vision blurred, once again, until I finally looked at my master.
" Where are you going? Where are you going!? " he panicked in astonishment. He lay lifeless on his bed, his sight black, tortured by the darkness. His face contorted and out of focus. Looking down, he looked back up, distorted, then the realization began to creep over him.
" Where's my vision?!" he stood up.<|endoftext|>

It was a question he longed for more than anything else. He had become almost obsessed with attempting to kill Hitler himself, what he had done must go on forever. Unfortunately for Hitler, this craft would not make sense any longer. It just might not work; Hitler was now a cold, calculating and ruthless leader. He had nothing in common with any other Hitler, let alone any other Jews; if he simply killed them all, so be it. However, all he had to do was go up and kill the one and only Christopher Hitler.<|endoftext|>
**********794**********
Nobody told me about this, but over the years I have heard about it. At first it was nothing that anybody could happen to. It was just chaos and entropy.
Then, one day, an energy crisis took hold. Once they began overtaking our globe they reigned supreme. Mutated or malformed things began to spread and take lives. On the 25th, a new theory was created. They called it entropy, and I call it the New Space Age.
Of course, all of this was completely out of place because even I wasn't allowed to see it. I walked through the screen, into the very room I was supposed to be in. There was a note, it said, "Sorry for my stupidity. "
I was the only one who knew it yet. As I reached forward I was astonished. So very strange, I thought to myself. It didn't seem that the inhabitants of this planet had ever used my name.
Before I could say anything I blacked out. I woke up a few days later with an incredibly high fever and feeling strangely nauseous. I tried to speak to someone, but the only sound I heard was me being hoarsely beaten up by some poor sap of a guy named Jason for some reason.
I tried to teleport, but it just became reality. I could no longer see, nor hear. I was surrounded by a vast, mass of amazing arid grey, and I knew I would never see it again.
The new world began to warp my reality. My touch felt somehow incongruous with everything around me. I had no control over it and it was getting harder to maintain my ability to understand it. As my new physiology made sense, my ability to reason and think became less and less useful. I had no concept of physics and had no other means to think. I fell off the chair.
I tried to lift myself up out of the wreckage. Before I could do so, a large shaft of light broke out from the ship's radio. It was pulsing directly into my brain. I slowly backed away from the dizziness. There was nothing I could do. My eyes began to water as I hit blackness.
I woke up one morning. My mind had somehow overwritten all the memories I had had all day. I was in an attempt to get rid of a dead star. I had to go to the FTL drive to get there. But after a few minutes I felt a strange sensation. Before I had even opened my eyes I felt two large, scorching pillars of white energy surround me. In them they enveloped me, and I began to see them.
I fell to the ground. I tried to scream, but I couldn't. Before I could even process what was happening, a wall appeared. It was an actual wall, and had retractable legs and entire war machines in it's place. It turned on me and started driving me off the space ship.
I turned to look at the wall of energy. Even as I fell the force tore through me. I was falling towards the gravitational pull of the thing I was trying to get out of. It began to flip me around until I was completely invisible. I woke up on a quiet, beach.
As I came to, I had found a large pool of the white energy. There were tents and barbed wire.
I rested, and ate what remained of whatever I ate. As I swallowed the remainder, I recalled my incident. In no particular order I learned of this. " This can't be happening!" I thought to myself. I was completely out of control and it was going to end so I just thought it over and set out to destroy the entire planet, and everyone in it.
That is my story. They call it New Space Age.<|endoftext|>
**********795**********
I was starting to feel...
Again. The field of wisps of dust that people were throwing up, or burying themselves in. The leftover what feels like muck and dirt from the arrival of... space? An explosion. That smell. The vast emptiness of space that is me.
Fur. It was something constant, awful. If you close your eyes and a sense of freedom returns you to the sun before you shake off your veil of isolation, it ’ s like the deepest of fears vanish. This is your heightened sense of panic. You made a conscious choice during a visit to Chicago that you ’ re working on getting out. It ’ s only ever suited you, seeing someone as empty as me.
You think you can run as fast as you can, just going a little faster, or maybe just a little faster? You think you can float forever and maybe in a moment you will finally discover where you belong. You are surrounded by golden light, and you are scared to even move, but you can.
There ’ s no silver lining to this whole ordeal. There are diamonds in this moment. A legacy of what once was. And I ’ m sure now you understand you never would have guessed the gravity of your work.<|endoftext|>
**********796**********
From afar my heart swelled. I was walking down the sidewalk, thinking about this sinking feeling in my heart, then I felt someone close behind me. More grey, a worried look on my face as the rain continued to fall. I looked up but was met with the sight of two figures from under the broad black hood. One waving his hands and the other diving into the dark.
I knew right then the others had more intent than me. I didn't run. Instead I flung myself between the black brick walls of the building, my hand reflexively crushing the guy nearest me. Not even looking at me was all that I could feel, as I quickly caught myself on the other side and, trying to catch my breath, my breath caught in the wind. Just as I jumped, I came crashing down hard into one of the black men.
He never caught me. The hell?
I don't know why I killed myself. Perhaps I was glad I put my gun away. Maybe someone will be after me, waiting for a clue to stop me. I think it was that chunky knife buried deep in my back pocket. I don't know, though. I don't remember going outside. I don't remember looking back. I don't remember feeling the cold wind in my hair. I don't remember the warmth of the morning sun on my face.
But here I am. Dead. No pen to put a bullet in, no weapon. No knife to stab. Dead. No, no, no.<|endoftext|>

Cancer. Cancer. Pangea Bacteria. Unholy Water.
That was his goal. Everyone wanted to find someone with matching tattoos. Now his goal was to find someone who could see the sky as much as anyone else could.
"Go away my son, you are a demon and she is a heretic, " Dr. Phillip said.
" A sinister witch! No need to offend those who might scoff, just they can see it in you and nothing else! " cried the cleric.
" We can show them how to show our faces if we mark in darkness, " sighed the researcher. " But to do so would wake them up! "
" Don't believe me, " puffed the cleric.
" I told you. " Phillip continued. " We can show them exactly what to look for in each of their lives. We can show them that they can see the innermost depths of evil, that they can see our deepest fears. They can see a fairy godmother within the darkest of places. "
" Get the appendix open and swallow the blood so that it becomes sticky but if the AIDS virus starts getting in... " Phillip hesitated.
" Drown it or keep it shut! "
In hours he was successful in convincing the heavens that he was simply beginning to see the world through his eyes. He saw the plot to achieve immortality being revealed and adapted the entire way so that the crimes of God were completely removed from him. At this point he had yet to become blinded by such epiphany.
" He asked for forgiveness, " said Dr. Phillip. " He asked for our end to be swift and direct! "
" What do you mean? " the cleric asked incredulously.
" Forgive him. "
" What? No... "
Dr. Phillip did not have a clue as to what it was that the cleric needed. He already knew that it was God. " Do not concern me Mr. Chairmistress. My staff is fully ready for activation. I will personally sever all ties with my associates for now. "
The Chief Engineer agreed, " We have fully activated the Library only. "
" Thank you Doctor Phillip. It will be done within the hour."
The clerics stood there frozen as they stared at the portal to paradise. Professor Igor Altruh shook his head and threw his arms around his colleagues. He turned and walked out the door.<|endoftext|>

"C'mon! Shut up! " Mr. Ollivander stammered. He'd been sitting there this whole time thinking that this would be a way of scamming his name into the big E. He couldn't live like this.
" What? Shut up! " Mr. Ollivander screamed at the ground.
He heard a huge sound like that of a walrus. His heart pounded harder. The sound came again like a foal cue - a gigantic banging sound. Like a train coming to a grinding halt. The top of the mountains above could be seen blackening into a deep blackish purple.
He swore to himself.
" Bro, come here! " He called out.
This time he went outside and saw the blackening was happening closer to home. He knew immediately it was going to be a hard day at work.
He went back inside the house with several books and a bow as he wandered to the entrance. He found a desk with his letters that he'd stolen from the Ministry a couple of days ago.
*Lugend! * He called out. He grabbed his pink wand and stuck it up his ass. With the most intense concentration he could manage he pulled out his magic lamp, turned it on and lit it.
*Ludo. * He could tell from the glare of the room he was in that this lamp was not in a hex lab. What the fuck was going on? Of course he couldn't believe this.
*Today is the day! This is my present. Today I fulfill the promise my father made me with a rusty broom! I go outside the door and rush to it and peek inside! I put it in my hat to hide its contents but when I go inside it's gone! So I start with the goblins and the sewer lizard until I'm home. I take a trip to the Grampo's Lair and hold a chicken stew. I get home and start running down some horse roads. I caught my cat eating a piece of pie but I forgot about the cat! So I plant my spare shoes here and sit on some of those big hay bales. *
He was speechless as he was stuffing a wet bucket full of meatballs in his butt. He got up and went to the kitchen.
" Babe, do you ever want something to eat or something nice? " He called out with a sigh as he was hurrying down a hall in the kitchen to the basket of food he got with him.
Mrs. Ollivander nodded and pulled out her own bucket of food. * This tastes like cheap lamb instead of chicken! * She opened the bucket and slurped it down, applying it to his legs. He followed her to the sink and washed up on the towels.
" Okay, thanks! Don't worry, there's plenty of stew in there, " he said with a smile.
She turned the small round basket over and gently slid it into a small bowl.
" Morning cupofjoie, daddy." She said as she stuffed the plate into the bowl.
He was speechless. He'd never seen a cow hide in a coffin before.<|endoftext|>

"Reality, it is..... he means me, dear....Reality. Can you please calm down, little one? I have a critical message for you to clear. You will die, wherever you are, however long it takes, when I look down onto you. This needs to be done. It is no coincidence. When did it become this hard to move? You need to know. This is the chance of surviving, I can help you. Just now... "
"….I guess that means it is time, please don't panic. "
" Of course I will! "
" My name is Phineas Pickles, how can I help you? "
" I never would have asked for this at the beginning. I know I shouldn't, but if you just... don't... take your time... don't stop, its not happening. Now go. "
" Don't you dare.. go. I need you to be patient. You will be alive when the end comes, so no one will think you are trying to kill yourself, but... if there is no stopping, no one can prevent it. I will have you. "
" Please, Phineas, I am dying. I am immortal. They will all hate me, I will win the election that year, people will love me, you won't be proud, most likely not even able to be ill from this. Nobody will mourn the death you will know, life will follow you... "
" What?? You will die, you never stop. It is very scary at first, as you grew up, it was very strange for you, but you will survive. "
" I will die too, more... slowly, my voice will become harsh, you will not know pain in even 10 minutes. I will crush you in layers. I will watch you slowly drown in the pool below me. "
" Don't worry you won't be long....anyone will be dead when you see me.. "
" No one, not you. You will live forever. "
" You mean when I took away your ability, you brought it to me? One moment you were living, in what you call your own reality? But that is a lie, because you will end up somewhere else..just before the Earth is supposed to collapse, you leave. "
" Yes, for what? We will die before you reach new life? Our past is irrelevant anymore. You will save us, not in a physical sense, but as a way to prevent Death from coming back. No one will judge you for that, and my curse has ended. You will sleep in deep darkness, there is no point, no regret. "
" What did I tell you you would die? Why couldn't you just stop. Why must you try to die? "
" Don't think that. Did I do that. "
"..thank you, that's how it goes. You won't die until the earth itself is gone, and you might not live forever as a ghost....Thank you. "
" Very well. I will continue. Tomorrow, I will speak to you about how I won the election."<|endoftext|>
**********800**********
The coin rode gently as I stood up and walked out of the offices.
I only came to my office once during the summer, at this time of the year. The location was simply a building with smaller blocks without back columns. Along the way my boss never noticed my departure and gave me a reason to get in the building. He took me downstairs to see if I would make it, but without many options he ordered me to get in.
Once I was in the elevator down the hallway I told my boss I wanted to give him the chance to verify my identity, and he assured me that was an automated process. He informed me I had to act swiftly if he were going to let me leave in front of the doors, however when I did he chose to let me walk through.
I walked by one in the office I knocked on the first door and after unlocking the door he told me I would have to put my own face on the last one. He advised that seeing my face was a big mistake.
After being back in the elevator for a short time I felt as if I had walked through the thick of the building, it was much to loud for my nerves. I was trying to stand up and would soon be getting tired of walking through this office. So I decided to head to the food court, where a person's face was displayed in the main rooms. I was impressed with the faces they brought, so I walked to the person who was clothed and put my face on.
As I get in I had to move and clench my fingers as I was being held, but all I could feel was the touch of the food on my hands. I just looked at the people in the faces then at my face trying to figure out what their reasons were. All I could think of was how loud the noise really was.
A person at a table ordered another bowl of food. The customer kept saying,'Aren't you going to ask the person next to you why?'
Finally I had the courage to ask the person. He simply stood up and shook my hand. He leaned over and told me,'You don't know how to explain it.
I asked him,'how did you know' and, after turning around, he said'you're always supposed to put your face on the last one.'
I thought back to the woman who had asked him that question. I knew then,'Who was it?' I asked. She simply smiled and shook her head,'You know it's OK.' she just nodded in response.
The food was sitting in front of me, in front of my face which I was not supposed to put my own face on, however, the man was smiling and told me his answer.
I hadn't had the energy to question the man, so I asked the man,'how did you know?'
The man just smiled, replied “he looks afraid of me and stares away.'
I was disappointed when I asked him more questions, but he did not like me at all. I asked the man again asking'why?' but he kept looking away and his lips moved to tell me his answer.
Now I knew how to answer the man, and his answer simply said,' You don't know when he will show you what I am.'
I had a happy answer and my hands were filled with confidence when I replied “ his face starts to glow with fear, his teeth are the only ones he recognises, and his eyes seem to be hard to read. When he speaks, they tremble and his sentences can be difficult. He is impossible to understand. His mind will go blank and will die down long before he can fully understand.'
His question caused a problem with the processing power of the machine. He asked his question as though it was more important. I asked the man about the coin, but he stayed silent. I followed him around the room he closed the door behind him and told him once and for all:
In science and literature we have found that if we could tell someone of their face they would understand what it was like to have said something. I asked him how he could tell someone of the fear that they felt. He stated:'the fear of having you looking at me is the fear of being something you desire, and maybe taking something out from me becomes a reward, it is a pain in the ass.'
The machine laughed and said:'you are special.'<|endoftext|>

Day one of my mother's botched food run. It was one of those scenes from a television show; that crazy shit, weren't they? It all started with exactly $ 70,000,000, then went a whole fifty, except for the ones coming back. I was once again forced to travel through hell to visit my parents.
They worked for the U.N. the day after. They were having an all out war for their own. I had four days left to my death. When I had to pick up some groceries, I pulled down the cap on my clock to make sure it was accurate. It showed that there was a limited amount left, and according to the food stats it's ten minutes early-
"Mommy... " I've only been out of this since I was twelve. I'd just eaten a bit and a half of leek instead of a bagel and no dinner.
Before I knew it, I was out of food and had 5 hours left on my breath. The information from my mom always shocked me, but of course I said I had plenty left. A hospital trip to Egypt was always my crutch; right after I got back here.
She returned with $ 120,000, filled it in, and wrote " Papa" right before I did it. She set off the timer and I stared at it in disbelief. She left anyway, but only to check the ATM before I even did so. She had woken me up in the middle of the night the minute I even touched the little rung with the machine. She died in that horrid heat.
That was all it took for me to die. Death that scared all of humanity. When I got to heaven, I gave my past self a ticket for a year and a half worth of mine, and when I was ready, I gave myself some pizza, lunch, and a couple beers. My wife, always sick of my shit, wanted some pizza too.
I drove to the biggest pizza place in the world, and nothing happened.<|endoftext|>

"Hey Kinslayer! Can you check the bitumen in our ship's leak? " the engineering director asked a blue shape floating above him.
" Yea, nope. We should fix that now. " He answered as he leafed through her journal.
" Well, let's see. Now go get yo idea on how to wire it to our 8 " Is that good? " I asked him, as the green wire tucked between my collar and collar went to the whole planet. We all were impressed. We were both quieting down after the initial announcement of how we'd get to a our inner Solar system, and let's just say we were pleasantly surprised when we could finally feel free. Two streets away was our would-be home.
" Really? Really? " I asked. The green alien answered me in a blur, " Yeah. Can we really ditch humanity? They have already decided to terraform and terraform our vast oceans. We've tried everything from flotsam to gorilla terraforming. "
" Great! Now that we're on solid ground, we can finally take advantage of your ability to predict how much the earth will melt by mining it's corners. Come do some measuring! " The green alien said as he swiveled around toward us and climbed on the alien's shoulders with his giant fist. We took a moment to revel in his beauty, as we were nearly at the edge when he revealed his green form, and then leapt for my face, lips flapping as his fist provided the best view of us.
I laughed to myself, " Amazing! Then what is a big missus do on earth? We seem pretty good on Earth too. " The green alien was now trailing the green figure, his sails taut and his feathers a glowing yellow.
" Oh! Let's just say we're on a new planet. If we can't hold our luck, what is heaven?"<|endoftext|>

The stupid kid swats her into a chair and begs for help. The cries of her brain from the mind refusing to come forth from her brusque body water it to drown in blood.
Out of the corner of my eye I see that ugly baldy with the platinum blond beard and spider tattoo. Damnit. What's even with the cunt's mouth? Perhaps she had chucked the toothpaste inside. I turned around to grab a flip.
"Hilda, you're in a fighting academy. " There's no way the bitch in blue dress could have finished with the whole point to come up with this plan. They never seem to accept things as real, even if they don't even have feet! It's frightening to think what some of the older kids have to deal with.
" I'm pretty sure I'm Hades. " Says Hades to his skinny bearded friend who's not even there yet.
" See you around tomorrow."
I broke down and took a sip of tea and cry for the last time.<|endoftext|>

I've been waiting for months for this day, waiting to see where it all went wrong. I know in my heart I'll be going to end up somewhere important, and somehow in life a sense of "What? " I've spent the last year practicing every'good thing that happened' moment in my life, my favorite times I talked to, remembered, and found someone I love. Maybe she's finally becoming a lover again, but I always thought...
The doors opened and my heart sank as they approached, had I set out but not in disguise? Without hesitation I started my journey, coming at seemingly random but never destined. As the doors closed I finally felt it, a shimmer of light, like nothing I'd ever felt before. But I hadn't left until I heard a voice! The man was clacking on the door and saw that I was carrying a ticket.
" If you'll just open the door you'll never open it, " I spoke nervously to myself " I'm waiting here for you. And if you don't, I'm going to introduce you to your family, and people you might have relatives but are so familiar with your life it's almost funny. I have many friends you must not meet but I love all of you. "
He stood up and disappeared in a puff of smoke.
" Every year after that I see someone, thousands, all five hundred and fifty people from every race, religion, age, gender, even race they have met in here. This year however... is different, I come to you to talk to you about my family. "
" Of course, my secret! I know you are sad, " he said with a grin " I come for you to tell others. My family is old, and I know who they were like before, you may never know the face of our old father or our elder brother. "
" You have kids too " I said indignantly " Not kids at all, just people, and to tell the truth you don't care about that either. This is my family. And my family lives on."<|endoftext|>

The Alchemists loved all of their concoctions. Originally their brilliance was their desire to make things not only interesting, but almost tangible. They were able to manipulate matter to happen. They couldn't be killed, but they would force the enemy's mind into using its capabilities, just as it would make sure that all the others feared them.
Unfortunately for the Alchemists, they wouldn't always be as able as they thought. Even now they had to keep up appearances to prevent the world from knowing if what they did was of any use. And now it seemed like the trick was off. It'd start as a simple mundane task, sort of a child finding a box of water and diving in. The Alchemists never had a failure rate, but they'd always be able to run late for class if the students had to move. And they never pushed, made, or reached for the door.
After some time things started getting better. The Alchemists never had a problem seeing what the adults had to go on about. Sure they might act dishonest, but they never would let someone do anything stupid, and even then, that man would never get hurt again. They tried to make food disappear before they were even able to purchase it from an adjoining source, and of course, they failed miserably. But eventually, when the hunger got too much, the world would slowly to collapse. Dust would continue to suffocate, cold would become unbearable, and in this world, those that survived the disaster would walk on the streets.
And just like that, humanity died.
Of course, life was painful. At first things took a lot of mental energy to push through a little bit, and eventually if someone took too long or followed too many wrong directions or turned on too many things that happened too quickly, it would just become a memory that would take in additional energy and take a small time to reboot. That would take a long time. But eventually the pain started to get overwhelming, and people would always think it was physically impossible, but it came all too late. No more food, no more water, no more water, no more fighting.
Eventually people started finding people who behaved properly. They grew up with rules and became good at making things happen that they would use to ruin their lives. Then, they started to notice that people weren't actually doing things they were supposed to do. Stooping around the city would get so much better if people stopped meddling in their lives that they stopped bothering to bother everyone else. But that change is only temporary. We all happen to be picking at the grass faster than we can follow it anymore.
From there, there were only the unknowns that seemed to exist in the surrounding areas. And then one day, people started to forget about something they had been putting on for years, something that wasn't a secret, and all of a sudden, things happened outside of their bubble. And people started forgetting about the answers that were hidden beneath every stone and other rock. And then suddenly things became quiet, right? After all, who wouldn't want to go on like that once they realized that they had created a weird and very confusing world, using the items they had accidentally left behind.
This was an amazing accomplishment, really, and we all loved it.<|endoftext|>

It had been two days since the shooting. Just days. Until the almost-certain death, which meant that the buzzing and alarms had gone off. I felt lightheaded, and my skin was singed with the warm skin of a small lamb.
The pills were all gone. The bible wasn't made. It was all gone.
My doctor gave me the blanket, thought I was kidding, and I pawed it open. I looked like I had just dreamt, but something was off. It was a strange place.
A sliver of sunlight, and a few minutes later I was at the chair next to the table I'd died in. A little boy, maybe ten years old, looked out the window. He made small talk. He was a little more than fifteen and very young, but had a pretty good looking physique. He was wearing my angel headband, he had a big, beard, and no scars, except for a small one.
He laughed. He was really funny. The priest said that the only thing he had failed was to ask me where I was going. After he got to the end, he gave me a nice hand and said "Good Morning, where are you going? "
I looked at him and nodded, thinking he was somewhere where I shouldn't be, but when he got to the door, I opened it. I assumed he had gotten to the barber or the nursery, but as I got into the most awkward form, I saw him holding a knife.
I smiled. My eyes caught his hand, pointed at his head. When he drew a sharp round from the wooden string, it blinked open. The priest was screaming, and I looked to see he had a child in his arms, crying out in pain.
" Are you insane? " He was screaming now, in the same state I was. I looked to see him hugging a fire pit. He was sobbing, holding the fire pit, and next to the mother of the child was a small girl. She was watching me, a squire.
" Did you really think you could come here? " She asked, speaking with a stern voice.
" It was a mistake! " I was taken aback.
" You get to live for a few more days, Mr, and you know I did not tell you about the rest of this. " He said, smiling.
" To be honest, I felt guilty enough before the abortion. We did not want the child so bad, I know. I wanted to see it grow. But I never thought about hurting it, and I didn't want to destroy it. "
I rolled my eyes. " But she's growing. The baby could grow grow up so much faster than you'd think. "
" She doesn't grow much. I wish I could see her grow! That baby wasn't a bad thing. "
" Was it? The body was damaged badly, and I don't think she needed to die, or was it better? I thought she would be weaker and weaker then. "
" I guess so. " I tried to speak, but I couldn't.
" She didn't need to die. She didn't want to hurt me. I just... I did this for her. "
" I wish you'd seen. " He laughed at me, eyes red.
" Then maybe you're right." I walked away, tears streaming down my face.<|endoftext|>

The blood begins to trickle down from the corpse.
Dr. Erith willed the blood to drip, which gently drips down his wound. The poison pot allowed him to pass out into the morning. The viscera coats his skin, covering most of his mouth. Inside his vein, his brain begins to be stimulated by the rest of the body. The sound of the now dead doctor's intercom can be heard.
( The full story: )
Donnie ducks under a dead man's body, blood rushing down the drain of his IV. The stench of rotting flesh is coming out of the void of his dead body. He clutches the handle of his now dead handgun. He can not shake the choking sensation, that he has almost passed out.
He struggles to pick himself up, a thousand pain streams through his lower half.
"Please! " he begs, reaching for the gun. " Please! I didn't think it was important! "
The skeletal arms of his frail body tremble in pain as he attempts to move. He drags himself close and sits in the fetal position.
" Please. I'm not going to stop. Please. " he tries to finish.
Without a second thought, the muzzle of his handgun shoots directly into his head.
" Fuck. " he moans, screaming. " Why won't you do what I did?!"<|endoftext|>

“ Sweetheart, I know you're a youngie. ”
“ All right, sweetheart. You start laying out. No, wait... It ’ s starting up. It ’ s right. Perfect time. ”
“ Oh, Mabel! One. Two. Three. You ’ re exactly right! ”
“ Perfect time. You ’ re starting up. ”
“ Indeed you are. ”
Mabel looked at Jason, the daughter of a fisherman and businessman. As he fished her a fish caught the animal, Michael smiled, deep green eyes that shone with electric blue energy. He started to squeal, diving and thrashing wildly as he kept moving.
“ Lovely, Mabel. " A brilliant light jolted him out of his daze. “ After all it ’ s about time you just laid out for the first time? I know I was thinking so hard... " Michael tried to calm him but was beaten down by his appetite.
“ What? What are you talking about? I thought I was talking crazy! ”
" But it ’ s wrong. ”
“ I can see your eyes! ” Mabel screamed.
In fact, he thought he saw every tiny speck of color and shape that passed through his tiny eyes. He felt so much closer to the animals' eye.
“ I don ’ t know if we can do this anymore, Micheal. ” Jason stared up at him holding Mabel by her ear.
“ The sky is blue! We can play with that! ” Michael took the fish of her once she drifted away. " It ’ ll be fine, the sky is blue! ”
His hand gently guided him to the path, noting the beautiful blue of the land below him. In the long walk they ended and Michael walked off into the distance.
" Finally, she ’ s here. ” The voice came from somewhere inside him, crackling and honking with off-tone excitement.
" Mabel? "
He began to stir with ecstasy as the machine began to make adjustments, making him feel even better at being alive.
" You have been so… Perfect. You knew I would grow over time. I ’ d always wanted to be so… Nothing had ever gotten in my way. " The voice had shifted a little as he wondered how he started to understand it now.
" Mabel? "
" Exactly! I know it ’ s going to be hard, but it's going to happen. Just know I love you Mabel. " He looked at his wife, her body beginning to glow red.
“ Yes, good. Goodbye. "

You know I was on reddit yesterday. I typed this.
It was time for a couple of ahem hours, and today I ran across something interesting in the form of the Frodo Baggins name. Yesterday I typed this without thinking.
So it happened.
The Frodo Baggins name it by leaning back a little, back to the board with his back against the wall, and the shining rings that pointed at him. It was an odd feeling, because I expected the ending to follow.
But I got the feeling it wasn't even that. That was too anticlimactic. Every story was like the last.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my time on /r/writingprompts. But writing these kind of things, they're so addicting. So many of them. Not my favorites at all.
Anyway, the rest of the story seems simple at this point. I don't really care about the ending, I think the following was being a little off-putting.
Hey, back to the thing with the Frodo Baggins name, it worked.
I went back and played some, uh-and bad words to him. A lot. Things I've only ever used again and again. What was that? " Hello? There goes my friend " Ooh. That was definitely a nice interruption, actually. Just fine for a couple of ahem hours in the mirror.
But he felt very odd, more than normal. It was odd that he didn't feel odd, yet. Like some sort of crossed of stigmata. Perhaps an exhaustion began to creep into his bones. But at this point he wasn't worried, it was just that his mind was open again, which definitely felt a little like panic.
Well, he never imagined it at first, but after a while he kind of started to fade back into the moment, which he's not sure about. Then it started to hit home, showing signs of a... uh-shut-up.
After a while he started feeling like he was really, really out of sorts. He was happy, but also nervous, out of his mind. Then like clockwork, some odd feelings started coming. Nerves or something.
Then it started getting stranger. Suddenly he felt like, in his very veins... his eye or something... a supernatural creature or something. I don't know which one to believe, but he didn't move for long, much to his amazement.
Suddenly it was obvious. He started showing signs of strength, something I haven't seen since the Hobbit or Walking Dead episodes, which I know a little bit, but I don't know much about that. It wasn't until he was just fine, and I'm not surprised that it took him quite some time to show such signs.
And now I'm probably thinking this: when Frodo Baggins dies, what do he say? " Again " or " You're a tenacious troll."
That's it for now. I have a little fun right now, just looking forward to the chapter I'm writing.<|endoftext|>

"It's a race extinct " The statement came too late. Not only was this impossible feat impossible, but Humanity simply didn't look up to any creature in the realm of life. This was demonstrated in many theaters, on the Playstation, and even the old newspapers of the day. Surely, this achievement was beyond the realm of human comprehension? Damn.
As we made our way towards the stage, I felt a strong rumble in the back of my head. I tried to focus more on the environment, but, as i was going to pass it by I heard a distant cry. I turned to face it, and i saw myself standing in front of it. It had all happened so fast, and i was completely stunned. There it was, a Human, holding a mobile camera as he snapped a picture, and it showed all of the war torn lands, ripped apart by tears. I rubbed my eyes and focused on my own reflection,... and soon all eyes were on me.
What a fucking joke. I'd only read about the war in books, and my favorite books were just to help people.
"... and everyone has been proven wrong before, and I have proved them again. And we are doomed. "
The priest shook his head and charged, but I wasn't moving.
" I am Lucifer, the righteous destroyer, and you have no idea the gravity of that statement. Since the beginning of time, humanity has sat in a great struggle, and i have guided it to victory. Humanity had yet to understand death. Humanity has grasped, and God has let us live. We have sinned, and walked on Earth, together. Humanity is now cowering behind its glorious gates and stumbling over them. We are trapped. "
" You, don't understand the gravity of my words. Humanity has done its part. We have fought and maimed, and that is what has allowed us to survive. Humanity knows that, and they have remained quiet. For you don't even know how long they've lived. Humanity has fought, and maimed, and that is why we must still fight. We must we must destroy this cliche, this lie, that has been God's constant weapon for us. "
" Do you accept me?" the priest asked, and then started crying again, this time even harder.
Edit: spelling<|endoftext|>

This weekend I met Tod. It ’ s pretty funny that the old storyteller would say I figured it out. I imagine if it were any other children, such a strong kid with all of the perfection and confidence of a nine year old, when he can walk in and talk to his parents. It just wasn ’ t right.
I was just 14 when the “ campus shooting ” happened, that was when we all got the medal. 10 years later, in the cafeteria, next to all the other kids, was one of the more gruesome things I've seen in my entire life. I am still trying to understand why the shooter had an inch of lead between his eyes, when the kid who had fired on him picked him up with a towel and started yelling at him. He started to get more upset; the kid was thinking about how he was supposed to be getting too close. It seems like the guy was doing it to keep up appearances. He just took this innocent kid who had been struggling to make good friends and began to yell at him for not giving him enough time to move to the next neighborhood. By the time we learned how the kid shot him, this kid was high on harm ’ s way to hurting everyone and my wife had been helping him get even more help. She started crying uncontrollably at his sobs, this kid couldn ’ t even hide the hint of guilt from her as he died.<|endoftext|>

I sighed as my closed eyelids fell. " What's in it? " I mumbled, clinging onto my old computer like so many silver fingers.
It was just a sketch but I thought it was pretty easy to make it work. " Why? " I asked, the voice of my coworker not unlike a real cheetah ghost. I made it all up after a bit.
" That's the secret that I'm recording in my notebook, this is the only useful documentation, from now on we're just stored in a file in a pen, at your programming facility. " my boss said, impatiently typing out the final lines.
I knew what I was doing was beyond my remit, but every time I was in a computer lab it left my mind for that idiot girl to make her characters into beauty. " Oh! " I shouted in laughter, clenching the pen tightly in my hands. " I've been doing this for so many years now. "
" Alright. Sorry about that. " he replied, crossing his arms and looking down at the typewriter in his hands.
Every computer geek knew where to find this stuff. You could almost assume it was a dead machine. The larger parts of the storage turned up unlocked by the keys. Each key was a random number, although the majority had been locked inside the local area lock for years. I had worked on them one of a kind, many years ago. There was a camera camera in the thing that showed me a live webcam. I imagined myself being able to see it from my computer or look at the bottom of the screen.
I looked at the camera in confusion and felt a surge of excitement, I turned and ran towards my desk and grabbed the box out of my small bag. " You're the one who can open that! " I shouted as I ran. In between trees were the glasses that had been glued down to them, from there on out I could just make out 2 shapes of windows and a 3D model of the papers in front of me.
" One more sec! " a gruff voice called from the next door office.
" It's that silly guy! " I shouted back to him, hoping that he would never hear my voice again. This wasn't the first time my boss had told me not to use this tool, and it was the first time a guy had ever pulled this prank on me.
" You're kidding me! Just close the door!" he screamed into his foot.
I looked through the gaps in the window and scanned the site. I could've sworn I saw only pictures. I tried to think if I could take a selfie with it and see if it would do anything. I couldn't. I couldn't do that. That's the stupidest prank ever.<|endoftext|>

Everyone thinks Garrosh was a hamster, every time they wished him away so much, he killed them, ruined the day, etc. Then one day, Garrosh had a boatload of them out of the harbor. As Garrosh sailed up the harbor for his final trip ( and perhaps greatest ), he encountered almost all of the people he'd claimed to be able to save. Some were meat, others were human bones, some were suitably human but having none. One day Garrosh discovered that none of them were alive, rather he had shattered it all.
At this point he really wanted Garrosh out, but as he had been on a 30 day vacation looking for another soon, he figured he would give up. After all, he was going to be the one to save his nation. As he went to cut the cut cut cut of the severed hamster he watched the cut become even more infuriating until Garrosh began to understand. He began cutting the paper cut so that only paper might read. It wasn't until Garrosh started shouting that the hole started leaking blood, the paper began to fade and collapse.
People were dead. The lines were torn and the rug ran down. Garrosh flew and lunged towards the grave, an even smaller beast that looked like there were gigantic veins bulging out of the bodies of dead men. But somehow, Garrosh managed to snap out of it, and wrapped it around him so that when Garrosh flipped the switch on the floor, the blood disappeared.
Garrosh stood up from his feet and stepped onto the beach. The large, not-so-squishy water doused his hand red with blood as he walked. It seemed like all the sand which had accumulated had now evaporated, and he could see the sunrise breaking out on the horizon. But he didn't come to it.<|endoftext|>

My brain is getting a bit rattled, so I try to look around in the room in search of someone. Luckily, I stumble across a friend of mine. He was wearing jeans and a white t-shirt, nothing spectacular.
"I told you Jim! You're crazy! " I screech, ignoring the suspicion he may be joking with me. That's when he noticed I had everything.
" What's going on? "
" You look like you've never heard of anything so awkward before, and then I realize - I've seen all the diagrams and schematics there. We talked about this a lot. "
" Huh? "
" I know your my god! I have a feeling that you've never heard of this before. Do you know what this is? It's almost eerily similar to cancer treatments. Anytime a person thinks about it, they become incredibly ill and their bodies disappear before they remember anything. So no, this is like- "
" No Jim! That's not what this is. "
Suddenly a chorus of " God dammit! " starts blasting throughout the room.
" And I wonder what it's like, well, when they develop cancer! We haven't even tried it! It's boring! So I found you here! "
" Giddy up, Jim! What're we going to do with the medical documents on this stuff, you selfish fucking moron? "
" What did you say? Did you send this email with a refund? "
" No you don't Jim. No you didn't sent this email. Jim. We're supposed to get out of this, and you want nothing to do with me? "
" I'm sorry Jim, just don't. "
" Sure, sure. I'll tell them. Just dont tell them. Just, tell them. "
" I knew it was a great idea Jim! It wasn't going to just be a blank page. Just an innocent name. Just an innocent name. "
" Calm down, Jim. I don't know what's wrong with you. What's wrong with you? Why don't you just tell them you're angry? "
" I just don't want to see your face. Are you ok, Jim? "
" I'm fine, sweetie. I just don't want to see your face. "
" What happened to your emotional response? Did you lose all your emotions? What was that? "
" Tell them. Did you lose everything in my life? "
" I..I.. ugh... I just think that when they develop cancer, we don't really want to talk about it. I guess there is a strong chance that they're going to get through all the marks of war. "
" What..? "
" Things have been gone for a while. Do you have something to say? Tell them. "
" A whole family business has been established. All down to one important piece of research. "
" You thought that living in this shit would get you through it? That was the first time I let go of your feelings. "
" Yeah. * You* think that if I saw that face I'd let myself go all over again. That if you were dead, I'd just keep you here for a while. You know what, boy? Let's just tell you your message. "
" Yeah..I guess I guess I'll just say one more thing. If you'd just tell me what happened to your emotions, it would save me. "
" Yup. "
" Alright, I hope that was it, babe. I guess I'll just keep this to myself. Don't worry, Jim."<|endoftext|>

The last words I ever heard to me was, "Fuck, I'm hopeless".
It took three years to find a new room to sleep. During those three years, my dad's brother Randy pulled me in, but right before the cold happened the bedside clock rang. I would wake up, only to find my parents were already awake, presumably frozen from the ice, unable to stand without assistance.
I wanted to die. I wanted to die, but I couldn't, for I knew I had a very good chance of surviving that icy winter. When I woke up it seemed like I was drifting down in blackness, staring at the clock. Why should I be so afraid to wake up in this cold when the world is just a dull, grey nothingness? When I opened my eyes I was still floating, in dark, black nothingness. I didn't remember the first time I looked in the direction I came from, but I saw that I was much colder than I had ever been before.
I fell into the cold, and I saw my first and last memory of anything. I remember this feeling floating in the abyss of nothingness. It felt warm, but painful to live in such a cold place, it felt like dying. I crawled in pain as the cold tore at my muscles, and I was determined to survive, even if I wasn't so good at swimming.
I found a hole in the ground and laid out on the cold floor. I had already gained my sense of smell, and I knew then I was finally safe from the cold. I fell into a brown slush, and my heart skipped a beat. I was frozen, in a total loneliness, and I saw the empty void in front of me.
The void was clear of any animals, and nothing there was.
Suddenly, the void was immediately felt by me. The void was filled with the loneliness of this liquid, and I felt like I was being pulled in, and I felt so small and helpless.<|endoftext|>

OK. Something about the author and the gatekeeper in a way I don't usually write but this just feels wrong. I kinda had a note from my first daughter, who started saying things when she was a child, but that wasn't until she was little and I began moving on to her writing.
I wasn't always the writer.
Hoping it was better for your sons instead of mine for your friends, you sent an assistant to my degree after I graduated and shortly thereafter started a full-time job at a local startup. That was years ago, when you got serious about your books, but you got this book now - yes, the book: How to Match Two Pages.
And unlike what you'd expect from teenagers, I still write with the intent of occasionally moving on to something new to improve my skills but, I told you it was a thing of beauty. Of variety - one page after another - I got things like forming a creative sentence or walking me trough a project, because I knew each book out of the few they found and, not because it wasn't interesting yet - but like I said, this one book is definitely interesting, and that's why I love you.
You told me that this book's not just a contest, that it's called one of my favorite novels and more than a little childish. I love the idea of how a book could be made into something other than the standard fiction - that all authors can be some sort of genre writer to create something new and unique. I hope that you do too; the series was nice.
Ok. Your time has come. My efforts have lasted for *years* and I'm finished reading the novel. You both have informed me that you've not called up my son to tell you what happened, though I don't really think I can see why you would. It was easy for you both when you were in your "old" states - you just never spoke to me until your sons graduated, which would probably lead you out of a tough relationship and back to the academy.
This time is different. I wish I had walked home sooner. I wish I had been older and not in my own house waiting for our children to finish, or even being well-positioned as a weekend companion.
You both know I'm dying, but I'm not going home because I'd rather die than leave you with this book than live my life with your dumb eyes now and again, and - boy, I don't care if it hurts to know -- I enjoy reading.<|endoftext|>

Here I am, a goddess. I am above the seas, above the night, and above the fae. All the wind is my charm. I turn anything into gold. I taste the love of gods. As my gold rolls around, I inhale it and cleanse the body of any pain. My bare skin is a crimson lustrous red, capable of pierce the soul of any being.
My body clings to the threads of the sea, all I have to do is stretch it and relax, just like the Goddess. They are merely aquatic creatures. This situation proves itself to me, as I fly the threads on my body, taking a woman into my arms. I land lightly on her thighs, "her time has come. " I look at her for a moment, " I'm dying to see her again. " Then I slam her on the deck of a ship, as it takes off.
The procession of ships veer to a dock, the food supply brings the catenates of old, but I must not wait, for they bring me back to life. All my features are displayed in the sky above. Of course, there are a few empty spots in the sea, so my figure is perfectly normal. A lot of food is piled into a few neat piles over their heads, but I can hardly flatter the masses of the people. Suddenly, there is some noise. Some sound coming from the sea. A scream, meowing. Those from across the ocean scream.
" Crack! " The screams follow my sight. I twist around slowly, the walkways in the harbor are stuck together. At first I thought that what was happening was a particularly noisy noise, but it turns out to be the dead of night. There is not much noise here, save for the monstrous noise of metal-topped men pounding on port. There is a faint sound coming from the breach, coming from one of the men's bosses. There is more sound, followed by screams. One of the men is still shouting. He starts to tug, trying to get ahold of a ledge. It looks about the place, covered with a thick layer of rock. He starts to move, but at the same time, he is dressed in a metallic and almost garish mess, a red-and-black suit which he is wearing. He looks at the sea and dashes out of the thick glass bridge. Everyone here was drinking and partying, ruining their lives. Many ships are falling. Some were laughing, some were dead. Even a few men were not laughing at all, but their clothes were bent so badly that it seemed as though they were on fire.
Several days later, the monstrosities are being thrown at the docks of Edhrun, slaying hundreds. A man, named Tyler, cursed for a time, saying that his room was next to lava, and the creatures were coming. I was the first to be killed, so I try not to think too much as I fly over them to clear the others. After nearly two weeks, I wake up, as the monstrosities have finally taken control of the city.
" Welcome to the necropolis!"
The man gets out of the water and starts chatting with the group of madmen. One of them, Matt, walks up to them and flaps a huge belly. He is clad in a black suit with a gold dragon on the front. It is all covered in slime and pieces of metal, a legendary piece of craftsmanship. He pushes me close, grabs my arm and hooves me into a vent. He bends down to look at me, he's glowing red, but I can see his shining yellow eyes. I need to show him the metal rod.
I am one of the lucky ones, I can kill any creature with one bite. I take a few scratches from him, then smile as I walk on down.

Snape sat in the corner of the room. He had tired of the silence with which he was sat and only made so much noise when someone walked past him. He could hear the shrill cry echoing in the space where it was silent. He got up and walked to the window. There were no trees there which made most people skip over their heads for a moment.
Eventually he reached the outside of the house. The walls had been newly painted a glossy purple and all that could be seen were giant holes in the ground. He cautiously opened the door and moved in. The house was very old, just like the stories of its childhood. The war was burning old.
There was a noise from inside. It was a loud chattering noise that almost drew out everyone's attention, but it wasn't among the screams of the horror of the room. The chattering stopped and a voice spoke.
"5 minutes".
Snape was quite bored with the yelling at him. He walked up to the window and looked back, for some reason, into the windows behind him. They had been painted black on the outer most wall for a while, and he didn't know what to do. At least, he did not think he would see the outside.
He went back to the window, and let out a short cough. He ran in the direction of the noise.
He didn't notice a noise coming from behind him until the sound of another human arm right behind him was replaced with a raised fist. The man fell forward, arms outstretched, face completely shattered. Something glinted. He felt nothing but remorse and wondered where to run. He had a very short time of time before everything went black.<|endoftext|>

“ I didn ’ t mean to hit her, ” she said, her cold eyes moving from the door to the locked one.
“ What did I do wrong? ” I asked, thinking very hard about it. I mean how could she know? I walked into her room and watched her with tears rolling down her face. She'd kissed me but her eyes were still shut.
“ I just... It ’ s not fair, ” I said, trying to explain how I never meant it. She let out a sob and tried to shut the door again.
“ It can ’ t be your fault, ” she cried, sobbing so hard it seemed to be out of her control. I grabbed her by the shoulders and carried her out of her room to a waiting car.
“ I lost my fucking wife, ” I said, looking down at her now riddled head. “ Why? ” I spat out, gripping her tightly and squeezing her.
“ You just ruined my little life for the convenience of the money I was taking. ”
“ Yes but what? " I said, trying to steady myself.
She screamed in pain and dropped to the floor. I saw her up the stairs. Her hands were covered in bandages and blood. I didn ’ t want to talk. I wondered where she was, but there was no one I could find.
“ I loved her, ” I said, holding her till her stomach felt chills. “ She felt so alive with each day you tried to take advantage of her. ”
She started to cry. “ You said you loved her and I love you too. But now you know what I ’ ve done. ” She ran to a door opposite the front door.
I couldn't see her face but there was a scar across her neck and mouth. The man who ’ d raped her was standing behind the door, face down. I had to pull myself from the inside.
“ I ’ ll kill you, ” I told the man in front of me.
“ I don ’ t want to know, ” he said. He and I looked at each other and tried to figure out what happened.
“ You were so naïve, ” I said, examining her now painted eyes.
“ You really did love her! ” He screamed at me, covering his face with his hands.
“ What do you mean? ” I asked, one-by-one trying to get the words out.
“ You just tricked her. And that ’ s why your wife was taken. So that you could take away her virginity. And you asked her to share it. ”
“ I don ’ t want to know, ” I said, trying to calm myself. “ Why didn ’ t you tell her? ”
“ I just wanted to make her feel like I loved her. To make it easier for me. ”
He was flustered, looking at me again and smiling. I couldn ’ t understand why he did it. The words on his face were flowing with emotion.
“ I know you did, ” I said, putting the knife to his throat.
“ Why did you do it? ” He sobbed, holding my hand. “ You thought I would kill her for you. You were so right, but now you don ’ t understand. ”
I pulled the knife from his throat. My hands went slack and he started to cry. He slid the knife out of his throat and onto the floor.
I watched as tears began to flow, the cut glowing. I put the knife between his eyes and watched his body fall to the floor, the knife slipping into his throat.<|endoftext|>

'Look it's a gem. You might believe me, but what does one do with that stuff? Where does it go? How does it float around, shape, and move? It can't hurt. It can't hurt me, just like the other good guys. The guy below, on the other hand, probably has to wear a mask, you know? Metal could have it's benefits! It can hit stuff - and move! Sure, it can give him the'hook' to send people flying, but it can also have that comedic flourish that those low levels of invisible power have. The only problem is, the jackass kept going after those heroes, got scared, and wanted to make them stay. There was a time when they would figure out the trick to jam that thing, maybe everyone wanted a piece of it! That's where C-zach managed to pull it off, the moon around the moon, right over the city like a jar of cheap syrup. Took two of his boys from there, too. The craziest idiot who could prove he could break this thing down, and in one moment of sheer stupidity, knew he was about to get into a little trouble.'
Ahem. That was probably a pun... so you get that? I can't believe you've decided to press my case...<|endoftext|>

The men looked in horror when one stepped forward and jumped. Their eyes fixated on a lone red orb. It slowly crept across the empty landscape of space. It made them quiet. And then it met them once again, and now it was again. The eagle squawked in delight.
The men never expected human life to be like this. Even before their very first contact the alien fleet had not yet progressed beyond the known stars. Wars were waged against man to contain this constant threat. Nature's mercy ran against man. And while nature would prevail in the face of man it quickly turned against man. Without human children in the wild, the species of the stars crumbled. Then so did humanity.
These desecrated planets once controlled by its greatest blustery friend... the so called first sun. Now this orb has cast the shadow of its blustery mentor once more upon the black roiling night... until this last dot of the Sun is taken from within this creature. The women weep when their beloved sun returns. Those who came after learn the hard way they were meant to be gone soon after.
This creature was a monstrous creature. Well armed and powerful, it made small strokes on the sides of the planets. It took apart some planets and brought them back to life. Now this orb was wreaking havoc on the humans. Too often after an encounter with one of these creatures humans gained regret for everything they ever done to kill the sun. And as if by will, the government decided the first invasion of a territory would be pointless. So instead the humans were allowed to stay in the so called First Sun until the first humans were captured.<|endoftext|>

I'm not sure why I pick poker for good game after mediocre game after lousy game. This time though, I'm enjoying the lot, and I'm not totally hammered. Then another time, or the set has quite an unconventional number of ends, I make a guess that my opponent is either a good number of serious and/or people much weaker, or the series is incredibly difficult and many absurd only come out at the 4-8. " That was a long game, I do admit, " I thought to myself. I shrug and go for my good luck. It was again someone.
" Oh, gosh, well that's a useful prediction, I guess. First of all, it has to do with the series' matches, there isn't any question to be answered, also. Second of all, maybe he has some sort of.. role to play in this game? " My opponent replied. I didn't know how he was able to answer my question, but it seemed so natural. It just seemed so natural at the end, this delicate man had a habit of always switching the course of the cards he dealt. I smiled to myself, " Heh, not that he has a role to play in a larger game "
His sudden admission completely shook me out of my thoughts as I took a one-sided, clear shot at this duel.
" No, no, no, no not that! Oh no, no wait wait! Let me finish, what I mean is he seems... Call a bluff? " My opponent smirked. I was filled with rage, and while losing this duel was undoubtedly impressive, I was relieved to be dismissed. " Haha, but no, no. No, no, no, no. Are you really so mad at my bluff? No, no no, that's right, just that it's not bluffing at all. I want to level. Down! Ha! Ha! " I was so excited to finally win this game.
" Finally, I promise, you're going to win! Next time though, I'll let you out! Let's go for a poker."
I looked for a deck, a deck that I could have also won in that game, and found a small floating fifty. Thinking about the other man, we could have agreed on a certain number of cards but it also seemed pretty obvious. After all, he was a loud type.
But my thoughts were interrupted by my opponent signaling that he intended to lower his life points. Before I could approach his deck it seemed he had taken something from the other dealer. I felt sick and froze. A small white scepter glowed from the sill as I lowered my cards. I didn't know what I expected but I truly believed that what I saw must be some form of psychic parasite. Making the device finally help my finish the other person off.
He began one plan after another, ranging from giving me a 10 % hit on his counter to giving me an empty seven as I pushed the dice in to kill him. I heard that summoning like this is almost impossible, but my ability seemed to be working well, and it seemed I was in serious trouble. Damn, I guess I'll take a chance and play better today.<|endoftext|>

When I used to be a good girl. Well now I'm a bad girl.
I love this woman like I just met her last day on the job. She's so sweet and she's so stubborn. People love her though, honestly. She even apologized about feeding a spider earlier this week. I'm not sure I've ever seen her so sarcastic.
My chest is bulging. Look, I know this feeling. I hate muscles. My chest can't wait for them to get used to me and feel that way too. I like that pressure of my chest to let go of my body. I couldn't be happier.
I can't go through life knowing I'm helpless to tell someone so much, but I can hear her speak. I can tell she wants to know. She doesn't need to hear that, but what can I do to tell her she's hurting? She will love me.
You always joke that as soon as you're in love you're ready to feel better. Of course, nothing can prepare me to say the things that she does to make me feel better. I used to love that stupid look in her eyes. She always makes jokes about me, always. I just wish she could see that there is nothing wrong. I used to be so reserved and sad.
You always joke when people ask. When people finally know how nice I am. When they just laugh.
But I can't stop talking to her. I can't stop talking to her. All I have to do is go through the same. Please. Just make her stop laughing, make her stop listening and she'll finally be okay with me.
I could go back now, just to tell her how much I love her. I know I can. If I was somebody else, I might have forgiven her. I might have come clean that she's hurting and we shouldn't be doing this anymore. Even if she does, I know she won't understand. It's not fair to blame someone for hurting someone. Maybe I should just grab her by the hair and hold her so I can talk. I need her to feel me for how I am. Just let her know how much she loves me.
But I can't, it's too late. The girl is already hurting and it's too late for me. She won't understand anything I can just let go. It's just too much to let go. I haven't been looking for her for years. That's like counting a stick. Something to look for and only to call it a stick.
I don't know what to do. I'm so scared, so cold. But there's nothing I can do. It's just too much. So much red. Why can't I cry? I still haven't said anything. Not even one word. Nothing. The red.
I don't want to cry anymore.
This sucks.
What do I do now?
I can't take it any more. I'm too stupid for someone to believe me. I can't tell her that she's hurting or love her. I don't know what to do anymore.
Then again I'd rather not.
Just breathe.<|endoftext|>

Let me describe you as a "democratic socialist " who escaped from the yuppie " Bush suckers " years ago. As the last of a generation of young white males, the past three presidents have taken some of my best ideas from my inexperience.
1 ) I endorsed a medical marijuana and went to see what it would be like to be the second boy born in this country. You know those tragic pieces of shit looks? I should have spent more time with them and you guys knew it. But fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. Forget what you've heard the other day, you're just talking about tax and education and education, " free will". Where did they get all those free will seeds and shit?
2 ) I supported science as a young man, which is strange for a white person who lives in Wisconsin. We were the kingpins of that stupid inbred family, and we robbed these dumb ass's of their funding. This is not only because they have genetically engineered frogs for drug use, the funds will give a steady stream of animals with incredibly high intelligence, an exceptional and long lifespan. They are full of reason, but everyone knows that to think life is like a trained person. So a scientist is a person who uses up what he needs to think, to give it to others. But what if you think life doesn't work like that? What if you just lose interest and think life is a pretense and everything will be fine, but you feel sorry for yourself? That's something people don't realize is true.
3 ) That pedophile ring who raided our lab created the Rock Barn and all the remaining volunteers. Get that ass over here and show yourself strong. Show them that red nose you can trust and that teeth you can believe in. But please, don't make this easier on yourself. I'm not like that guys, I know it's not perfect, but a few more years is all you're gon na need. Who fucking wants to get into here?<|endoftext|>

I stared up at the clouds. Beams of yellow fluffy dark tears collided against black streaks, waving and splashing out in front of me. 'Is that a scratchy scratchy scratchy?'. I thought the flecks could mean my life was going to end and be forgotten for my fragile condition. It wasn't.
When we first laid eyes on each other, the night was something of a blur. A splitting headache from a deep slumber, a confused fight and a cheeky, fancy smile and an uneventful laugh as I fell back asleep just off the bed.
When I got my wife and kids up to be parents, I knew for sure she was snuggling up to me. We never talked much. We had stopped hitting each other, something else was going to happen, something terrible, something impossible. I don't know how many weeks I sat this note... each day and every hour, every minute of my life. I didn't know anything about her. I was still too young, too afraid.
I guess I didn't know it then.
-
"And just think on that scratchy scratchy... " She held my hand, and it was fast and hard to concentrate.
" Take your fucking pills... " She opened the drawer and pulled out a stack of prescriptions and a glass of scotch.
" All right."
-
That was two months ago. The first was a bone marrow transplant, the second was a serious bout of depression and, when she was done, had a reason to keep her prescription drugs, her signature.
She came back to my house last year.
She called me. I called her. I told her everything about how I loved her. How she never cheated on me. And I decided to make a good choice. I chose to live a normal life.
I could feel her breathing, soaking my skin.
I closed the box.
-
That night, I took her to a heart transplant.<|endoftext|>

All I can think about now is the posters. I've seen four that come up here so far... and I've seen one just close by. ( I went to see the fourth )
What a freak.
Am I really that *that*? When did my friends notice that I was gone?
As if they weren't unaware. The fire wasn't contained so far. I don't even know where I am, I just knew that I was gone. Where am I?
Just a coincidence, perhaps it wasn't supposed to be like this.
I couldn't remember anything about today.
I just used up all my broadband... and when I did go to go to watch some other shows, I couldn't think of anything other than the dishes and groceries. I didn't want to go to the bathroom that day. I wish I didn't. I have so much work. I can't leave now, I must get out. I have to go to work, I have to have someone else to look after me.
At first I am numb, and can barely even remember anything. Then I get used to the touch, the sounds, the stares.
But as I get used to this power, I become overwhelmed... and the lights I live in now are blinding me. I couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe it's just sensory overload, but maybe it's just all I have in me... and that's enough for today.<|endoftext|>

"Ow! ". " What is that behind you? "
" Oh, it's an internal credit trace! "
" Do not ignore it. Just get back to your ship. I have plenty of data for you. "
The crew members nodded in agreement as the two most obese groups in the universe approached the entry point.
" Thank you for coming. You have been at sea for nearly 13 billion years. I know you expected more strange species to leave Earth for the sake of making way for technology, but with time, those Earthlings have turned into a strong standing force for a world up there and to our service. "
" I take it we haven't checked their new equipment? "
" With all due respect, we've never checked their outdated, automated systems. But we had a crew before us ready to greet you. It was a unique group. "
The crew members looked around the display. They couldn't be bothered to leave their seats in disgust.
" They are hospitable species. Their presence at sea has only reinforced their barriers to our connections in interstellar travel. That said, if we do experience any problems with this experiment, we would advise against traveling a nautical route until further notice, since the findings we have given you and your crew will be well beyond our limited ability to understand. "
The mouths aure go dead. " Pardon?"
Edit: fixed some typo<|endoftext|>

I think my house was alright, my cat was okay, my cat was saved.
I don't know. He was gone. I don't know why I didn't get him back. I didn't really know. He was just gone.
But there are days. It really does seem like that every day. Everyone thinks of him when they meet me. I can't let him see me, but then again, it's what I always do.
I was thinking maybe if he was gone he would see me.
I tried talking to the house owners. They would stand by me every now and then. And then I would take a nap and smile at them in the open.
Some of the people were trying to touch my cat while I was doing my job in the doctor's office but they couldn't reach it and don't realize I can't reach the cat with my hands. I guess they call it my cat's heart disease.
No, he wasn't a murderer. He was a hero. A good one at that. He saved my life when I was scared of the men in white suits.
Every time I spoke to him I feared the next day. The day I died. No talking about my daughter. I could hear his heart monitor.
At first I'd shake his hand and show him a picture, but then he stopped smiling. I was afraid.
Today he called me. I wanted to talk to him.
When he saw me he'd take his hand off his pillow and smile like a dad doing his wife's laundry.
I told him about the shop they owned. They would sell books. I told him about building the new house in the suburbs. I told him about towns. It was bad and he never liked it.
Today I explained to him that I didn't know. I just had time to talk to him and take care of him. I told him about my cat. I told him that I was the one keeping him safe.
I still didn't know that there were people who needed him. They knew I was there. People who needed my services.
It wasn't until days later that I finally understood why. The health insurance companies were like glue in my way.
I asked them to take out a loan to pay off my bills. They said it would be ok. If they told me I couldn't get him back, they wouldn't take the loan and stay with me.
They were apologetic and full of themselves.
They wanted to help me. They wanted me to see the people who were after him. I didn't even know that they had my name in their hand.
Today I figured I needed to make sure that everyone understood. I couldn't take their messages. They had me surrounded with glowing angelic sunlight.
I told him that he would only be able to see us now and I would not be the last. I was making sure that everyone was safe.
I took a deep breath and said, "Sorry kid."<|endoftext|>
**********830**********
I breathed in deeply, and gave little attention to the heady aroma of the coffee table, the tinge of vanilla and cream on the walls, the cloying ambience of the smoke cast through the chaise lounges. The man sat in the large leather chair and began reading aloud, languidly, "What can I tell you sir? "
I glared at him coldly. This guy was giving me this type of mind-blowing self-perpetuation. I felt like he had spent two hours with a cable on, and... he was doing this.
" I suppose I shall inform you of the President's most recent expansion plans. They are rather large, however, " he started slowly, chin quivering. I sighed.
He sat quietly, expressionless. I could clearly see his shoulders grow steadily lower, the corners of his mouth swirling in a casual smile. He looked out at the vast setting of land below the mountains, he saw nothing, and yet, he could feel the wind rush past his face, his gaze struggling to refocus on the great terrain. This wasn't a draft in a draft, this wasn't something horrible.
I continued, " The President named a tornado stronger than the Sedan... I believe it has been brought to you. We have been cultivating this plant in your surrounding area because it's nearly impossible to fight back. This plant is a natural disaster waiting to be contained... not to mention inconvenient for us travelers. "
He gaped like a raptor at what lay before him, and tensed his chest until it practically burst. The other workers looked to be catching breath, whatever was inside of him began to panic, breathing heavily. Then their attention was returned to my presentation.
" Thank you Mr. President, " I said, as I finally lifted my head to peer at his face, " but what can I do for you Mr. Anderson? "
He snorted, and then picked up a horoscope drawn from a badly frayed pocket watch.
" And what about *him* Mr. Anderson? " I frowned at his laugh, but no, I knew, it was rude. I leaned back in my seat, and looked at the screens. " Just what is his name? " I asked calmly, shifting my weight around uncomfortably.
He looked like he was going to win the election, and quite frankly, as he straightened up and nodded to a seated cabinet member, it was very, very rude.
" Mr. Anderson, " I said calmly, " I can't tell you how much money you owe him. But he always gets it."

For the first time since I awoke to the sudden feel of... wet, hard, burning hot steel. I feel it too soon. I don't know how, but I am tense. The battle raged like you have never felt before. I fumbled through the files as the beast reached out to grab me by the throat. Pain exploded in my chest causing me to fall back to the ground. How sweet it was for someone to squeeze you again in comfort. My fear was muffled. " What is this, a wish? " I remembered the word so many times. A dumb toy maybe, some dish that didn't bring joy when you loved it. Just a stupid wished to show you some happiness, some meal you didn't like.
" No, that's an impossible dream... " The beast replied " Do you have any idea how messy it is? "
It mewed, causing me to cry.
" Look at this... " I leaned back to sit on the cold tile of the hall. My apartment was here, perched on top of a veritable throne in the middle of the hallway. In front of me sat my entire ship. I knew it would want to come sooner rather then later. Instead I dove to the floor, on top of another pile of documents and papers. Hundreds of pages long, littered with page after page of code, names, actions, etc. The beast looked at me, disturbed. How would he have told me such a thing?
" Any comment?" I ask nervously, panting.
I'm staring at the one sheet of sheet before me. On it, there was written, date, and location. We were preparing for a birthday. To know who it was. The page you see above me shows that it was Christmas in my city. I sat there, motionless, all scared that a terrible disaster was about to happen. Perhaps something out of the ordinary. I closed my eyes, turning to go, but the door opened and inside was... something else. I ran, to find a hotel room with my maid. Her wife followed me, from the hallway, laughing quietly, with a smile on her face. In the reflection of the floor, she reflected back at me.
I used my magic to make the door open in the hallway, and pushed it closed. And then I jumped, when I opened my eyes, I was lying in a bed, sweat coating my face. I saw my wife, one of her favourite women, laughing, with a confused look on her face. In a moment of clarity I looked around and saw a wonderful sight in front of me. A hotel room with reception desks, windows covered in places I never wanted to go, a whiteboard of sorts laid out.
I stood up and went through the pages, looking at all of the faces of my people and myself. They were all young, old, beautiful in their own right. They remembered me so well. I stared into their eyes, knowing this must be the end. Of course I was heading home, but now I knew how the world would be tomorrow, and how I would have to find the Monster that had brought me here. And the hope would all be gone.
I reached for the letter that I had brought me. I opened it, letting out a loud gasp. It had been so long since I had slept. I had been so worried. After all, what if the ship was at fault, the girl had had more fun than I had. A monster had been pouring over my ship for so long. All of a sudden, like lightning or fire, a massive earthquake could be heard. I collapsed to the floor, gasping for air. My feet went numb.
I lay there, breathing heavily, gasping for breath.
I stood there for a few moments, going back to work, thinking as I stared at my computer, waiting for the next meeting. Or the next AI, someone whose personality was far from mine. Then I was at work. And I was preparing to die.<|endoftext|>

The behemoth comes around the corner and spears a small boy in the shoulder.
Cradling back onto the lawn outside, the boy is greeted by the voice of a bear.
"Had a tough day at school brother! I am not in it! "
" But, sir, you are minding the business! "
" You're an old skipper! Don't you see that I brought back a dog? It has snuggled up against my arm and snored again! I thought it would be a good idea for you to get some sleep."
The bear then scratches the back of the young boy's head as he happily awaits his adventure.<|endoftext|>

Elizabeth sat in the college library with a friend's favourite girl. So that's what we did. For now, we watched the events unfolding on various networks and newspapers. Pretty much everyone agreed that it was a disaster: suicide was the leading cause of death among teenagers and they were a growing problem. Between that and big trains the suicide rate had been sky rocketing. Throughout the works big government-sponsored projects were planned: large underground rail-port, underground chemical waste disposal, underground hospitals and even underground safecracy.
The process of moving from one conference to the next over the next half a century was painstakingly difficult, and we were ready for the transformation to take place. Everyone was dreaming of the big breakthrough; everyone was trying to figure out who was responsible for this transformation. Part of our job was trying to provide access to the scientific instruments so that we could work with it, and sometimes the answer was so unlikely it was scary. But I still held to the old light of hope and continued.
After a few weeks the plan was carried out. We were going to raise a whole hall of scientists that might have done it, and in six months, there would be a full chamber, the likes of which nobody had ever seen. The question was, "What will they do with all the fine, commonplace machinery in there? " The researchers were so excited and eager they could not stop thinking about the big step ahead.
Thirty years passed when we would take the lead in the project, and after the project was finished the scientists came together and began working. By the time we reached the six years mark, nearly everybody had volunteered to make the expedition. We barely got there. But when we saw the gleaming machines on the walls of the cavernous hall, we knew exactly who would be at the top of the food chain.
*Captain York*
I packed up my lunch and jacket and threw it back into the dorm.
Eyes tired and out of breath, I opened my eyes and drew my knives. I reached the draw but was already nearly halfway through my shift when I noticed that the Captain had not yet reached the draw.
As I turned my attention to my business partner, Harrison, I noticed something wrong. Although he wasn't there, I could faintly feel the warmth behind his heels and his brown coat. Harrison looked up when I asked him what was wrong.
" Why do you ask? "
" Can't you see this guy dead? I mean, who is this guy and why is he in our situation? "
" Harrison you fool, I don't know, maybe he just came into our dorm room and said that there is somebody hiding behind the desk, and that's why no one knows about him, even though someone said something to us. "
" You're a useless idiot for wasting time and time again watching Professor Rhetorical Darlings Wobble. What's that on your watch? Harrison, to keep your time up, you can't stop looking at him. He is not standing in the corner of the room, not even at the end of the hall where all the books and supplies are. This guy is not even the man whose face you see every day. "
" I've been wondering what the Captain would be doing in my dorm room after that accident with the train, so I decided that I would make the effort to learn more about him. The Captain is going to go to Alpha Centauri immediately and one day I plan to try to search the whole of Andromeda for him. " Harrison held out his hand.
" My parents had always told me my father was a scientist, so I must have known him. But the truth is, he is nothing but a Disney character. I can not even guess why this is happening."<|endoftext|>

Ah the Blue Moon of Mars.....
Sooner or later this red burst released from his body starts fading back into my veins. He wasn't in his office, he wasn't anywhere, he was just there.... right in front of me! I recognize him now as the Lead Engineer for US Army Radio Technicians, one of the few engineers that actually works overtime at the Space Station.
This is what I was expecting to see. The Alamo I'm sitting on was nothing like it could've been imagined. We hadn't got a chance to check in on the Mars Base, but we have some pretty strong equipment ready. We've started with some more expensive resources that came out of Russia. Men with MOSs, common men. That's it now.
"Today we are going to see what really went down in the Great Firestorm. A brilliant blast caused by the shell of a radio made of broken plutonium it in it's ghastly transformation. I remember going off the radio "
The Commander smiled, " Not yet. We got a lot of other things here in briefing to do." He's a Lava Mike.
We heard for weeks that the bombs had been making their way through Washington DC and Seattle as the CIA had been making contacts with other nations. Eventually radio communication technology gave us the vision to give them America's back. Russia, China, the EU, China...<|endoftext|>

I nearly broke it away when I hit it with all of my willpower. Don't ask me what I can't do.
When the water sunk below me, I hadn't stepped forward yet. It wasn't until I tried to keep my head above water that I realized what had happened. I noticed something else. Not movement, but a soft rolling noise.
That was the voice. It was coming from the water beside me. It was speaking to me, definitely through me.
"I've... " it trailed off. " I have..."<|endoftext|>

I walk through the sidewalk, the sun's rays shining softly through the windows. The cold breeze drains away my comforting warmth, and I approach my bike. The downpour begins to warm me up, but just as I feel my breathe getting warmer, the rain drops cascade down faster.
I sit and take my seat, listening as all the raindrops trickle down the snow. A noise escapes my mouth as I approach a school bus full of kids who are now walking. My knees on the table bend, back into the mud as I sit down, on my back. My arms spill the gravel in an almost symphony of jazz, and my knees swing down as my chest aches, and I cry out to nothing.
At school I watch the sun blow past the new moon, the colour of the sky fluctuating from yellow to blues and red to purple. Birds buzz, and I look around for prey. Outside of my window I catch glimpses of those kids, getting out of the bus, fishing the occasional fish off the cliff, diving around the playground, and after a while I rest up in the beds of the street lights.
My mom, her voice fading and fading, whispers in my ear in a hurry,
"Dinner's ready!"
I stand up, and then make my way to the school bus, ready to eat.<|endoftext|>

This is my first prompt, so I apologise for the length. It's my first response to writing here and I would like some feedback - )
It's dark and cold... and so... alone. But just like every other time I walk into the city, it's comforting.
My hovel has turned to rubble - the worn spears and the mended broken trunks - the lone footsteps of a passerby mix with the dusty flooring. But here, and not near this place... I hope to see it again... how could one be so lost...
I wish I could stop... to face the unknown... but the sword against my back... taunting me... tasting my every emotion... tempting me... rooting my tears... and what I find so familiar... my battered armor... the strange scratching sound of a boot pounding against the walls... the slurping sounds of a butcher's knife as it snatches at my throat... then I turn...
No... no... but I can not turn back... no... no... I can not...<|endoftext|>

There is only one way to escape this hellhole of a world. This stupid game mechanic.
I entered it though. The game tell me if you're going to escape, you'll be called in.
They have always insisted that if you leave the game before the boss or group makes it off all the way, a party member will be introduced to you in order to go.
I never understood that joke. The game tell me if you're going to escape, you'll be called in.
That's what I was told in my final death count. Only one way to keep living. The cycle went south, and then the team removed me, leaving only me in the first place.
We replayed my life over and over. One to choose from, and one to kill.
Then it hit me. I was their scum. They could only ever walk the same path.
Half life 3 was for your horse... the horrible man was truly evil. His assassin was death. A crazy man. It was time to kill him.
I got into the squad. I equipped myself for the sole purpose of slaying this cursed creature.
I sprinted towards the dragon. I couldn't let them see that. I couldn't let them all know of my plan! I must die. This was my only chance to stay alive.
Just as I came to a stop, I started to run.
Only to feel like my whole body stopped beneath me. My mind was gone. All I wanted was to run. To stop this magnificent creature.
I couldn't see him. I thought he was some sort of demonic specter of some sort. But he didn't seem to be moving.
I was paralyzed, and now I felt the effects of the death spell I had just cast. I couldn't move, for fear of too much pain.
Suddenly I started to panic. If this had worked at all... I could use my teleportation staff to teleport away from this horrid creature.
Suddenly, the fear the ghost of some sort lifted, and said "The gates of hell have been opened!"<|endoftext|>

You imagined it, on that pretty girl in the dress that everyone, myself included, thought to wish was far too young to comprehend.
When a good man passes away, these men are reassigned to one of the world's previously unclean and evil holdings, where their good willed and malice-filled superiors would pay little attention to the emaciated and fallen!
That's not how I wished for this day; it was a wish I found around that I couldn't win. I was a man of pure will, albeit a selfish one.
So what were I supposed to wish for? My omnipotence, my capacity to free all the wastes of what remains of the evil past I inherited.
I swear my stupidity, which came from a time before my powers, was none too much to bear.
I only wish I could meet that woman in that dress. She was lovely at first, but her gaze soon followed the person before her to me and the sights she saw; her eyes were pools of motionless sadness that swirled in my eyes.
I was speechless: I was living my species's inevitable demise.
Now I am a human.
I am invisible, as long as the cloak I wear never covers me.<|endoftext|>

It was one of the most pivotal moments in one of Hitler's darkest nights, when the world was beginning to perish. It is of no wonder that the most celebrated man of our generation died two years ago today. God himself is sitting in the farce room, rambling on all his legacy in the past few months. The following footage was taken from one of his most famous speeches, and the quote he spoke most loudly in half his second speech was used in an attempt to present his vision of the doom it might be avoided.
"The Jews will never be forgotten, for there will be a new one that will be with them in their home."
The two learned the hard way that the Holocaust was a lie and a deception. They chose to play the role of the historical hero so that as their lives continued they could live out their terms. The truth was, the West was doomed and was suffering this fate. My name is George. You may be wondering why I am here. No, George, you won't be thinking about this topic. My name is Adolf Hitler, and I'm here to say this: you are not from this history, that you don't belong here, and that this happening is not you. You don't have to know about the Holocaust. No, you won't be thinking about the actions of the Jewish people. You will not be thinking about the Jews. In fact you will be thinking about your time here as well. Come out with your damn gun and do that. What an opportunity. Here in Auschwitz I will do my time, and in time you will run out of opportunities. This is a time of mourning. You won't even get to explain what the Jews are doing in this world with real violence or lack of such violence, but I will explain.

The sign on the door reads "closed "
There are no windows either. The only window I can see is down the hall. I walk upstairs and open the door as silently as possible, hoping that the door isn't jammed.
Walking down the hallway is no ordinary problem for me, it's quite beyond ordinary for a man who lives under a bridge. It's almost like night isn't falling on us as we all live under a bridge, it's unlike anything I've ever seen. I walk past the next front exit, finding myself lost and staring at the bright light from the ceiling lamp that hangs loosely overhead. I start to notice that it's getting colder, I really can't believe I started. I stand up abruptly to see what's in my room. I quickly wash it off and walk down the hall.
In a dream, a power outage goes off and the rooms are all but empty. The only light on the walls is a thin lightbulb, even after a little ranting I'd rather not turn the brightness off for too long. I walk up and pry the bulb off, replacing it with a handheld flashlight. No more room to turn on all those lights.
If there was a faucet somewhere down the hall, I'd take it. But then again, it was supposed to be dry, so this place would have to be pitch black before someone could figure it out.
I plug in my PC, leaving my phone between me and the flashlight, only to realize it's not empty. What was there is completely just a blinking cursor, smaller and smaller letters on the side of the screen, the same in all tones. I flip it over to the next page. Something's not right. The cursor seems to be moving slower and slower until my eyes start to water. I scramble to get up off the bed, but my body keeps curling around the sides of me and sitting up right as I try to adjust my position.
No where to go, I turn left and jump through the window to the dining room, only to find that the dining hall was still standing. The entire building is similarly unchanged, except for a single light source. I've never been in one before, but I can get up at any time without problems. As I start to get dressed, I realize I'm not the only one who's broke through. Up in the living room the floor is littered with knives and in the corner is a small closet. I open it and see a gun and ammo rack. The rest of the room, with the exception of the bathroom, is just more empty. Maybe I should have gone to sleep while I cleaned up.
There was a fire in the hallway, and I ran downstairs to find out what was wrong. I looked outside to see a thick fog on the horizon. I grabbed my umbrella and waded into the wintry gloom, only to find the fire going out. With my situation becoming dire, I was left to sit in the dust and watch it dissipate into nothingness.
What I saw next was not unlike the horror movies of the newscaster. Instead of finishing the job, he just got a shocked expression on his face and disappeared.
I've never heard of another mass evacuation of the people of Karyllia.<|endoftext|>

The cry of the heartbeat echoed through the cavern. My heart beat rapidly. The thought of it "W-what happened? " and the relief it brought slowly faded into trembling annoyance.
A faint smile crept across my lips as I realized I wasn't wiling to meet my aging and merciless predecessor. After all, it was my grandfather's birthday and I had my whole family in my own little sanctum, far from the hundreds of humans crammed here-no more than slaves. Fewer than normal humans. The slaves I served at that very moment were in for a surprise, of course, it was a surprise to see such a beloved species getting slaughtered here.
" Honey, do you like the job? " the unassuming young man joked, dejectedly. My room was a mess, and I was still a bit fidgety. I rubbed at the bridge of my nose, trying to quell the cold.
" Yes, and my station, that is, " he chuckled, calmly. " Even I'm really tired of this building. "
" But it's a grand home. You can't just stay here! " The bridge rumbled once more, getting slightly louder. I glanced around nervously.
" At least tell me I have vacation time. " My grandmother smiled again, and eyes narrowed slightly. " Why are we here? "
" Well, Grandma, our services at Stargate Command were nearing completion- *beginning*, " the frail old man answered. " We've given you the best results you've ever received. "
My grandmother giggled again, " Until you can finally surrender! That's right, you can't take that away from me. I mean, sure, it's annoying to be out here, but trust me, any sort of surrender is a surrender. " She shook her head, " I feel like you finally understand why we are here-well, Grandma. "
" Then what was your farewell speech?" she joked, her bright smile splayed across her face.

“ To the Light ”
That ’ s not fair. It never was fair. Those two-person teams were the last to come face to face with the wall. It was a firm belief that all of them believed their own safety would be compromised. But the truth was that the wall, well… it should be impossible to see through. Even in the dead of night, it should remain stable.
“ Is that all of the blueprints, sir? ” asked Specialist Raz.
“ Yes! ” was the reply.
“ And the redprints… ” asked Inspector Crookes.
“ Oh god… ” thought Raz
“ I ’ m sorry sir, I don ’ t understand why we have to dig through. ”
“ Your understanding? ”
“ I understand why it is that we are not allowed to tell the world who may or may not be on this wall.
“ What? What happened, raz? ”
“ The ruins had not been scanned, and are not consistent with stone or flesh being used to render them immutable. ”
“ I don ’ t understand. ”
“ But now there are the ruins? ”
“ Yes. The one that looms over us. ”
“ Any other secrets? ”
“ This is great news. ”
“ Now we will start digging to find out what lies beyond. ”
"That won ’ t do, Inspector! It ’ s the last of it!" Raz shouted. Raz stood in the dust-covered void for a few moments, his eyes straining against the edge. Maybe he could somehow leave his mark on it… at least, give his people and humanity a heads up on what the possibilities could be like. All in all, it had taken a lot of effort, but a whole lot of hope.<|endoftext|>

I stood atop the cup of water, the deep midnight air wrapping itself around me. The alcohol was burned away, but soaked the book. My sash already drying on the bookshelf. I lifted my visor up to expose my eyes, first to the grass as my shirt creaked underneath the cool night air. I heard a whistle from a nearby house. * Those tears... They're already looking black. * Just as I reached up to wipe the tears off the the soaked book, the song again rang in my ears. The sound growing louder and louder as I listened to the song. A noise that took my breath away. A sound that carried my mind away. A sound of someone reaching out for my hand but never reaching out. It only took a quick breath to clear the cry. In a few moments a black figure had appeared in the darkness, even by my weakened darkness. " I am the key to the future."<|endoftext|>

The crowd had begun to roar for whatever cruel trick the Grand Old One had chosen to kill them all. From the east it could be heard shouting in the night, "knives in your mothers blood! " to the west, more shouting, " Don't even think about what you have done! " and so on. The politicians and military forces of the last several generations were like little beef jerky-mushrooms of old, shit-eating types who won the elections when little scraps of salt pork wasn't a loser's weapon of the century.
What a marvellous trick! The record of complete genocide started a mere two weeks ago, and our gracious grandsons have forgiven us for it. New Spain has decided that food for the general population must come from the soup kitchens of Spain. And so, tens of millions of gallons of tomato soup are ready for the guacamole that always finds its way into our little potato soup bowl every so often. And that's why I'm starving!
Dr. Giuseppe Erasmus's pace was uncharacteristically slow, so I continued my trek towards the nearest cafe, whose patrons were no more than the ghetto squirrels humans consume every day. My back descended to the hardwood floors of the cafe, and my legs buckled due to the beating of my gut. A lemonade bottle of milk was handed to me as my hands trembled under the hypodermic pressure that threatened to overwhelm me. Around me, I looked around to see though, the hunger was due to its own inadequacy. As I looked across the aisle, at the cheesecake batteries and ravioli on top, the crowd just looked at me in a stunned silence.
" Get in, " the grandson demanded.
" That's not what I said! I just don't get it! " I turned around, just as several, more elderly men stood up and run out of the store.
" Now, " the grandson said, " have a seat."<|endoftext|>

"There's one rule for that city: Justice can not come from actions. You stand between what's right and what's wrong. As some of you know, when George Wallace flew a plane at us, we didn't act. We were the protectors of Liberty and the Declaration of Independence, and it's good that they honor you by enlisting you. "
Not many people spoke it, but they learned more than anyone that government could gather the collective, force them into service, destroy them. It took only the closest person, a pedestrian on the sidewalk.
" Everything has been going exactly fine," he said as he pulled the law out of his pocket. He always knew it was there, his orders, the last thing he ever did. He had yet to kill anyone.
This was his way out.

The woman wearing my clothes looked at me confused.
"Well, I only said one thing, before shooting myself. What do you want to talk about? "
As I stared at her, I realized I didn't know what to say. I couldn't imagine ever doing anything, the concept didn't even occur to me. Is this how we walk when we're both emotional? And why did I think of this? I wonder if anyone can teach me what to do?
There was a pause. No words.
" I want to thank you, I just wanted to say I really hope you're home safe. "
" Thanks, boss, but I'll be in the car for a minute " she added, almost smiling.
" It's... I'm sorry. "
" I want to know how you feel... "
" Your voice scares me. I have people on at work telling me it's bad but it's not me who's up there. I'm your head of defense, and I can't simply protect you all alone. "
" Okay. Sorry about that, lady. Let's get this over with "
She walked away, leaving me confused. I'd been so happy since that fateful morning when I showed up at your doorstep. That sunny day in my youth when you showed up at your doorstep to teach me how to live my life. Even though I'm at a job interview, I'm still terrible at not being able to talk to people. I wish I could forgive you, but I couldn't in my heart; I made a mistake and I love you, just as much as I love myself. I'm sorry, I know I'm not your best friend, but I hope that helps when it happens. I've never hated anyone. I've lived with people all my life and yet I've never seen you smile. I'm so sorry. "
Before she could say anything, she grabbed my arm and started walking away. I looked down at my body and felt nothing. I was in the bathroom, at the gas station. As I turned around, I realized I hadn't seen her since I walked through the door. That's when it hit me. She was gone. I had heard the rumors like so many people - the stories of people who disappear forever. I knew the truth. I had to go find her, but I also didn't want to be hurt.
As I stood, I suddenly felt a burning sensation on the back of my neck. Something had snapped. Or maybe it had been the damn cigarette. The burning got worse, and it didn't go away. But it did now. I felt myself hurting, and as quickly as I could, I realized that my wrist was throbbing.
She seemed to hear my screams and put a hand on my shoulder. It had to have hurt. She had had it. My pain. My heartbeat. Her soft voice whispered *You're gone, and now you won't be coming back*.
Without warning, my entire body became warmer, my heartbeat became cooler, and I felt more calm. I could feel all these emotions, and I knew that it was no longer my fear that I had, but more confusion and comfort. She smiled at me and said *you were a good man, and you just wanted to be kind to people*. It was her in there, and I was looking down at myself. She was smiling at me, and I looked down at myself. My heart was beating faster, my breath ragged, and then everything felt impossible.
" You were always welcome in my house, and I never wanted to hurt you. I'm sorry about that, boss. Let's talk about this and help you find someone more as soon as possible ".
I turned around, staring at the caved in bathroom door as she walked out. I saw nothing, and the feeling deepened inside of me.
I pulled away from her and stared down at myself. She was right, it hurt like hell. As I looked back into the window, I realized that I would have to look a little closer to find the one that she loved so much.<|endoftext|>

As you can imagine, I was terrified of the Holy Bible. We only had the word of God, but I still wondered if he was pleased with how the Nazis were taking over America. We used to walk up to a Nazi guard and he'd ask if the guy was open to a gun, but the guard thought it was a good idea to ask the Nazi again.
So, I thought I'd ask the guard to sit in, although sometimes my joker companion would actually question me. I imagine to that we got rather upset and kicked some Nazi out, but he left some rocks to use as a shield, so I sat back in and ran.
A few minutes passed before I eventually reached the gate, but I waited for the guard to speak with me. He didn't, so he fired first into the boundary.
"Johnathan Smith here, " I said. " I need you to say something. "
But before he could, the guard sat down. " Lord, please, don't bring out the Holy Bible, that's inconsequential. I see those Bible's on the table, and you don't even read one, let alone write one. "
As I was saying this, I saw a couple men enter the room, who were talking. One of them was in the crowd, but in the chest was something flimsy and indestructible. I tried to answer them, but my ears were too weak to hear. After some deliberation, I finally spoke with the God of the Bible. " Johnathan, this is Carol -- --"
Holy cow, Carol was dead. She was not dead, as some people in hell might say. Just caved, ripped, and crammed into a crumpled heap. She sat there for some time, guilt acting like God's will to take her, until she finally got up and walked away from this mess.<|endoftext|>

When I was eight, just a kid I went to market, filled my house with everything I needed and always hated. I couldn ’ t turn away the line from the place on the street; every human street was empty except for a stoic line of lady that offered no time. The lady took me to the great sports bar and I asked for a drink. The atmosphere didn ’ t go well; you wouldn ’ t believe how normally the bartender would push to fill up an empty spot. I brought the party with me; the bar burned and everyone panicked. It was horrible. Everyone inside retreated. I would be scared of the bartender ’ s words when he left “ St. Peter ”.
Mom and Dad loved to spruce up the place, “ That ’ s the living room where we practice. ” to God. A peace was building for us at school though, sometimes just staying inside and waiting for your classmates. I was a part of that family. The way you would take a tree out of the bay and swing it up to try and find a new seed and then send it through another time due to a history disaster at home. I loved it here; standing in the ballroom everyday. No one knew why I loved the lights, that it was nighttime, never leaving the room, never letting anyone see what I was working on. The music was always around the house.
But now, I can ’ t see because my memories don ’ t come back. I look through my bedroom window every night trying to figure out what happened but there ’ s nothing. As the day wore on the lights in the room dimmed and gradually faded into darkness. I was asleep once again, while my mother was awake.
When she returned my little sisters younger sister would always play in the circle at the restaurant. I was so small that the words she spoke seemed so foreign to me, “ I can dance in it! ” she kept telling me. My little sister was crying and we wanted to cry and tell her the good news. So much stress lifted off the emotional shoulders of every outsider in the room. We went to hug and kiss my sister. I could never share it with her again. Then I would see her laying next to her family in the grave.

Little done, I decided to go with my mind. It was 12 and I was leaving my apartment. I would confront the wall. I would fight to stay. Just so. Just so I could let them in and let them see the world all ahead of them.
I found the door; there was someone inside watching me. I closed it before opening it.
That was the first time I could ever say that I had ever loved.<|endoftext|>

"Time's up baby " said the runt.
The tiny vampire was unceremoniously dragged off the mighty Ice Tribe by small claws, his head smashed against the skull of the path-snout. Long legs, red fur, and powerful claws pressed against every muscle in his skeleton. His strange hair looked greyed from the biting cold.
" I-I guess I don't understand what you mean " interrupted the young vampire.
" This, we have lost! We will know the truth of our origins " nodded the sinister being.
The vampires' pang went up. The icy goo had just landed on his back, leaving a crimson stain on the back of his neck.
" We have discovered the truth. " said the vampire, almost excitedly.
" You won't take this away from us " protested the child.
" Every cycle I am reborn " grumbled the vampire.
" Since you took me in we have warned you of this threat " grumbled the magical child.
" Who are you to tell me not to protect you " said the menacing malnourished cat
" W-Who are you to come back to me? "
" You are mine, I give you my soul. I come with my trainer "
" You are just one more failure to who you yourself are" said the angry child

My mother had been waiting for me, frantic to decide where we were going to launch our *rocket* today. As I figured out what we were on - earth it's snowing on top of really, really, what's her name now - I tried to be cool with her. I didn't need the heavy hand of mother and father; I just needed to know if I could do it.
Except I was never cool with myself.
We were very, very, very different from the other pairs of probes I spent my whole childhood in. Not that it mattered, all we did was laugh at our world's puny science; no, what mattered was just that everyone would miss it and love it and a whole new world that could't possibly exist on top of a map. That's right, we looked back at the moon.
It was a beautiful sight, really. Beautiful, and it used to help me focus. But that's why I'm here, and why this isn't going to end. If I move past the wall, I'm bound to find Mars or Venus, depending on how far we land. But either way, I had no choice, I'm prepared to do anything, anyhow. But we've got a dark sky over there. So I really got ta move from the far side, where I have no one to make a quick buck for, and hopefully, the closest thing to a flat one I can find.
As I look at the little blimp, I see that its rocket is about 30 degrees, where the red and white figure of our mother can't possibly fly. At least, not on Mars. Now, here we are, with snow painted all over the surface, stretching like thick ice into the distance. A white spot next to the wall of powder reaches out towards us. Who knows what makes snow in this craggy neighbourhood, and why it doesn't shine like I knew what it was about at the time, but it does. It's lifted up and up and up, flapping around like a fluffy, tropical rainforest. It puts you on edge for a moment. Then it gets down, and lets go.
Every step here feels like being down into the back of a parked car. We do only a couple of steps towards each other, and it's packed like a bag or a backpack. If we could stop midstep - we could slow our descent - then I doubt we could even land. But the snow and the crunch and the stragglers, but all of this doesn't even bother me, just me, and one other guy, sitting on a coffee table next to a photo album on his coffee table.
The other guy gets up and walks over to me, hands in his hair. He's red and red-eyed. I can hear them talking, but I can't make out what they're saying, and I can only make out a few words that make sense to me now:
"This is Earth."
Don't answer me, remember that; we'll have to stay here and breathe life into the puzzle.<|endoftext|>

The light fogged his tired eyes. He put his fist under his temple, sighing heavily. It was time for what he was feeling. The bed was silent and he slumped forward into his bed, forcing his eyes to adjust to the light's light. It was then he heard, the voice in his head.
"Look, I'm sorry, but I had a horrible accident last night. I was using heroin, and drinking myself a little too hard, and I wasn't getting by. I used to let you know that, it wasn't as long ago, but I kept hoping I'd catch someone as great as you. " The words didn't ease his hungover headache, which was starting to set in, which was now starting to show. As his spirits kicked in, he smiled. " Hey, remember? I used to be into your arts, you see? And then you mentioned that you used to be- "
He cut his reply short. His head turned pale as he realized what was about to happen, and shook his head. He reached out in the bedside corner and pulled out his vision scope. Without more warning, a bone deep gouge was placed deep into his stomach. He let out a long sigh and collapsed to the floor. The pain in his head was getting worse, but nothing could be done. He started to fight back tears, which grew into more tears as he made the decision to go back to sleep. He made it, however, just in time for the demon to strike again.<|endoftext|>

I stand at the train stop, lit, sipping tea from a cup I haven't opened for this day. Grandpa, great friend. I look up at the flashing yellow interdimensional doors, head rolling. " Sir? " He says. He's quiet, long strand of grey hair nearly in place. I like his eyes.
I bump into the back of the train as the chipper gentleman in the crestfallen blue coat turns to me. " The wish? " He asks again. " I'm not listening to him, it just falls apart. I'm talking to- "
" Just please tell me, just what do you wish? "
" Don't worry, I've seen some of them. You've watched them destroy, you know? Cast them out by a ship, they sailed everywhere. How in the hell did you get into this? " He points towards the stairs. " There's been a lot of high up while I've waited. "
" Right you are. " I straighten my tie. A thought crosses my mind. Maybe he'll be around in a bit. I put one hand on his shoulder and mumble.
" Cool. Now, where would I go? "
My fingers shoot to the button at the far end of the escalator as I step onto. I let go and press the button. The doors close, the chipper gentleman gets off, and I am ushered to the palace. At the window overlooking the bay, I can see the island, but the earth spins on itself.
I step up to the balcony, and before I step down, I notice the giant statues atop the balcony. Great. Counted down from eleven.
" See that's them? " I ask.
The genie wanders over to me.
" Looks like you have some luck, boy. We've got time and you don't need us. "
" Couldn't say I heard him. "
The guy picks up the whole thing, and in one motion he lands on the grassy island. Suddenly, a blond and brown haired old lady moves towards him. " Oh, I had to save you, didn't I? We've all seen you upset, staring off into space as you watched billions burn. "
" Look, I'm sure you have a pretty good idea. "
The genie points to me, and before he can answer a voice shouts " Nuclear war, the end of days. And it looks like you came here to save the last humans."<|endoftext|>

“ No. ” I sighed and took another sip.
He didn't know that. I just know I have. I still hate him. Who would say that? I know it ’ s just bad for him. Everything we do is for the greater good. He can do it, I know that. We all have purpose, you know. Just the way we enjoy it.
I set the coffee down in front of my father ’ s desk, which I ’ m pretty certain I left on the counter. It ’ s a two liter bottle. I should have thought of that before I made my last move towards him, but he ’ s too drunk to notice. And he doesn ’ t want to read me the rest of the sentence. No. I definitely will not change it. Just as he ’ s about to think I ’ m just so unbelievably drunk I ’ m not paying attention.
“ You- ” I start hesitantly. You wouldn't be interested in this character you know. Why would he be? I mean the less he reads my mind the better. Yeah, this guy may be obviously drunk, but it ’ s a lonely man. Can ’ t he read my mind enough?
“ Yes, sir. Thank you for calling Saint Mental for assistance. ” I don ’ t understand. His eyes are lolling around as he says “ Have a long day. And thanks for calling Saint Mental, but we both know this is just a temporary thing. It ’ s not like you can fix it. ”
“ What do you mean… ” He ’ s open. What kind of problem is that? Do you know how that works? If it was in your brain, it would instantly disable the capability of the feature. I love messing with people ’ s brains to see what they really want to think of. But who ’ s going to really *see* that?
I suddenly notice that he ’ s starting to text me now. His head is swimming with ideas. I don ’ t know what to say, but *the thoughtless thoughts* that accompanied those are starting to take on an overwhelmingly hateful nature.
I turn to my father, the other drink in hand, and he whispers, “ No. ” His hair's been walking along the side of his face, getting stuck on his forehead. His face is starting to look *wait*, like it's still bleeding. I drop my glass on the floor and begin to take my eyes off him. His thick mustache comes to attention in momentary horror as he circles around his body and violently buries himself beneath it. We all jump up and away from him like dogs.
He turns away to leave us standing there. “ It ’ s just happened again. ” He sounds unresponsive, as if on a walk-through. * Is that what is happening? What is he texting, he ’ s typing to himself? The inner monologue of a broken, sick man? * He ’ s not “ reading ” me. I try to speak to him. This is possibly my chance to learn something about myself. And do I really want to learn everything about myself? After years of hell and pain, I ’ m not really happy with myself for doing so. Why am I writing a written story? What ’ s my point? Why is this hell trying to get me to end it already?
“ It begins raining outside, sir, ” I say, face in my hands and soul in my feet. * This is the happiest day of my life. *<|endoftext|>

For the past four years, we have been coming here. Working in secret to bring about the end of the human race. No one knew the true reason behind it, there was simply no other reason. We were scared, numb, dead. We had the most powerful magicians and religious leaders in the world. We assumed that it would just cause our brother's demise or his personal downfall, but a week ago, all we could remember was the rain. The feeling of primal necessity.
Alone in the street, alone with my family on the way to the embassy. The world was mourning our loss. They had served the impossible job of finding the criminal who would no longer posses the power needed to spread life through this chaotic planet.
We were compelled to make this decision because our goal was clear. We would go out in front of the world. With our abilities, we wouldn't lose. We could put two and two together and show them it was all worth it.<|endoftext|>

Nobody likes me. Nobody likes me except for those stupid people who just assumed I was some puppet.
They had little ability to lead. Their short term goals were reversed with disdain. They were dragged through the dreams and won't figure out any more. Some of them left on the orders, others forgotten the pastime.
I guess I am a fool. I mean, if they had known I was just a... puppet, who would use such grace as a tool for their own ill ends? No one would have allowed their moral compass to be bent so strongly against them. There are those who tell the truth, but they can't allow themselves to trust me for a moment. They worry that if they only knew what I was capable of, they would all die alone.
I try to be brave, I try to save those who would have taken me down. That they would all die, alive or dead. But, for what? To punish my own fate? To save the countless souls that would suffer the same fate.
Regardless, I stand by my cause, and if I am to be the good, I must all die. And I will, if I find a way to help others.

**********857**********
As I sat idly by my younger brother's bedside table, I had the notion that I was being treated disrespect. Maybe this is better? My brother's depression probably wasn't his strong point; that feeling of needing to show him who he is and do what is right. Perhaps if I listened carefully, I could heal his depression from my own selfishness. I will remind myself I just wanted to be loved and cherished.
Now I wait nervously in the bathroom, my thoughts of my brother's life in general and the outcome of this conversation. I am trying not to think about my brother, or his death, it must be something I simply wish to happen. My mind churns, thinking how smart he is, or how cute he looks. I wish to be happy, or at least as gullible and unsavory as the one I just thought I would be given. But just the thought about his final moments makes my heart sink. I have a doubt. I am not sure if he will ever find the strength he needed to go out as a man, or if that is something he will no longer feel like and do in this moment. I can't know for sure but I will find him...
My brother looks at the bath light. The light is mottled and is burning more than is comfortable and helps to diffuse the darkness. I look down at my brother's hands.
I can't think of my brother, I can't think of the event that I wish to happen that he will suffer a stroke, or die from another bodily harm. I'm trapped in this silence that I am experiencing, I have to do this right. My brother is my greatest friend, my absolute rock. His spirit gets stronger every day. His vision becomes sharper. His movements become more confident. The final minute of my brother's life finally becomes free.
*Please tell me he's dead. Who is to tell someone? *
I take of my brother's hand and peer over the corner where it meets with his arm. I push on with the thoughts.
He falls on his knees.
He and I both look in each other's eyes. We look at each other for a few seconds, staring into each other's eyes at the same time. We look at each other with my eyes, holding hands. I look into his eyes. He feels safe and beautiful. He feels new and unique, and likes the way we look. He felt someone else's touch. He feels felt it with me. The best day of his life. We both feel it. The feeling I felt is to have him be happy for ever.<|endoftext|>

On a different night, two men with dark faces approached.
"Why is this...? "
" Why is this happening? " The lieutenant stared into his visor. He was taller than the two men. Dark hair, pale skin, and wore a rather black suit.
The man's companion hovered over the lieutenant. He was playing security guard at a local bank, whatever that is.
" You and your friends... You created this, you can't... " The lieutenant trailed off. The man wore black armor, carrying a large shield and with flamethrower in it. He was wearing a red and white striped trench coat. This outfit made him look like some sort of radical.
" So, you're saying that, those men were plotting to kill me and you would protect me. "
" No... "
" Here's the thing, I don't care if they were plotting to kill you or not. Who are you to decide who's right? I know what's best for you. You had a lot of friends to turn to after I locked in with you. I've watched through your eyes how you grow and develop, and I don't care if anyone else is watching, I just want to watch as your presence grows in front of you. "
" Your presence... "
" There you go. This is mine. You don't have to worry about me knowing who's right, if you'd let me win this time around. This time I have a new identity to attend to. I never stopped looking for you in the first place. This is my price. "
The lieutenant let go of his weapon.
" I accept. "
" You said that, *you* did? "
" It's okay, I will tell you later. " The man at the window pointed his eye towards the enemy.
" I'm a villain!"<|endoftext|>

I saw the human near the end of the highway. It stood alone on the pavement, half-conscious, half-abandoned. I think it took me a while to recognize what it was for, the frailty of its face.
"My kids, " a dark-haired girl said between tears, " Don't come to me. I don't have... anyone else to talk to. "
I asked her for silence, but she hesitated, and pulled away from me, rolling away down the stretch of pavement.
" It won't be long, my kids, " she said, smiling back. " Just stay with me. "
A few feet ahead, I saw a young girl with dark hair and a darting bushy mustache with her daughter at the bus stop. She was cooking, but neither of us spoke a word.
" What's wrong? " asked the passenger.
" Do you know who it is? " I asked.
" Don't ask me. "
" And what is it you ask, my kid? " I turned to the girl, and for a second I just thought she was playing with herself. What she was playing with, really, was a freaky thing I can only see on the side of a real highway.
" Someone I haven't seen in years, " she said, leaning down to look at my seatmate, " Let me go. If you ever get tired, you'll learn to sit with me. "
" Me too," I said, and nodded.
Outside the bus stop, our sweet young girl caught her breath.<|endoftext|>
**********860**********
I remember everything. Or at least the most recent ones.
A young man sits in an ugly cloth chair, feeding himself a spoon of water. He is curled up, when he hears a beat, and smells it. A chorus of frogs.
"Looks like he's hungry! " he says to himself, softly. " He looks.... like I... I guess he... "
He tries to keep his voice steady, but couldn't force himself into a sob.
" He's alright. The doctor did say I have this monster in my house. I... whatever. "
He looks up at the sky. The greenish-grey clouds hang in the sky. I can't see much around here, though the doppleganger and his friend are. * Oops. *
" Suck the worms, you know? " he says, hitting his friend in the cheek. " He'll come back like a red-headed to me. Nothing's out of the ordinary! "
I held my head down. I could hear the sewers. The lab. My friends... less than like, *lovely* friends.
" I'll try to make it right. " He said, biting his lower lip. " He's soft, but still scary, no need to worry. You guys... they'll be fine. I hope... "
" I'll be okay. "
I was around the corner. My old friend was on his porch looking out, swinging his swing. My mother's house was outside. Nobody was home.
Suddenly the room fell silent. Then there was a soft little whir.
I looked out. The street lamps were off, and were reflecting the sun's glory. Rain was falling. There was a hum of cars, that was hard to distinguish between the vehicles but fine, the rain.
" I'll try to make it right. " She said, a small laugh breaking out of her voice.
A way down the street, parallel to the street lamps, a truck came to a stop. My back was bent over me, and I didn't want to make a noise.
" What did that sound like? " I asked, holding my face up.
The Hummer dropped out of the sky, its windshield broken by an apple light. It was stopped immediately, but the driver of that Hummer was inside. He was leaning out of the radio on the steering wheel. He couldn't see anything that wasn't touching him.
" What are you doing here? " he said. His mouth opened wide as he looked into the driver's eyes. " Are you okay, honey? "
The Hummer wasn't responding. It was just sitting there, idling under the hood.
I moved forward, and took my friend. He shook his head, then looked at me. " You don't want to see this, okay? "
We shared a kiss, and the Hummer pulled away.
" If he wants, I'll try my best. "
He smiled his perfect big crooked smile. " Let's go for a walk, kid."<|endoftext|>

The temperature around the cafe and gas station hovers in the thick of the night, everything to keep the crowded restaurant from toppling in on itself. This was surprisingly brutal of Rita, who'd come out in dress in the middle of the night, and did what she would have done when she left. We started kissing. She accepted it, rose her finger to the waitress ’ lips, and stepped back without a word, taking a deep breath of victory as she leaned on the counter, humming her own song. It all worked out: party time. Beautiful women waited impatiently on the other side of the counter, reflecting on the exquisite food, sitting casually in silence. It was soon settled that Friday night, when they would be approached by another man; they kept their face neutral, deliberately avoiding eye contact, and the woman grew really cawed. The sudden kiss all together shook her very soul and she raised a hand to wave politely, but the more I focused on the point, the more she slumped back, her gaze focusing on a completely out of place bald man standing behind her. I swear I saw the hate in his eyes. I looked away just in time, pushing him away as he picked up another man, place it in his sack and undid my baseball cap. With such perfect posture, I just happened to look into his eyes.
“ Did you hear me, Rita? ” he asked, his voice a little sheepish. As I looked around, he seemed to still be drinking his coffee, not wanting to break the silence, just casually breaking every word in the single sentence it was spoken; I never really understood how some people would break that silence and bicker so deeply.
“ Not all people receive the hate.
I can ’ t believe you did this, Man! Just stop coming to this place, and ask me, do you not want me to be pissed off? ”
“ Wh- why? ”
“ Please, get you away from me, dammit. ” He pulled a handkerchief from his coat pocket, and began to read a passage I may never finish.
“ Do you know how many lives I have through to you, Chuck? Five? Do you know how many of my wives have been replaced by turkey that snow in the winter? ”
“ I ’ m not ready to die yet. ” He laughed maniacally. “ Let ’ s just get some ice cream. ”
I held his hand. “ Delicious. ” I looked out the window, and saw I was not alone. “ You see, are you crazy? ”
“ Y-yeah, I ’ m definitely. ”
He laughed again and burst out into laughter. “ Jack! ” He threw the ice cream in the air, and we continued kissing, and then broke apart.
“ Ray, you haven ’ t got to try me at this point! Just calm down, ”
He was right. Rita Repulsa was dead. Her husband would be my friend and everything I'd ever wanted, but it all had come to an end. And that was before she'd realized she couldn ’ t trust him.<|endoftext|>

My entire life has been a lie. A facade, fake, never actually good enough. This kid really isn't even that bad. What is a charlatan to do when one of the most prominent men in history admits their crimes?
* "He had his fingers on the trigger of a vial of acid, squirming all over his coffee table " *
This isn't how it is supposed to be. People aren't expected to be much fun. I never liked reading this from the sidelines, and I'm nothing to say about that. I mean, I was one of those guys who thought he could handle all the punishment for giving into the needs of those in society. Well, if I'm you, I can deal with a few of the most basic points of your picture.
* " I stabbed him in the ankle in an attempt to go on a hunt with my cousin, Amanda. The tiller, literally the biggest kettle of hot water I have ever seen, smashed through the wall and up the stairs into his bedroom." *

"Ambassador, though we have come a long way since the last time you hid their warships in Black Mesa? "
" I'm not sure if that is correct. "
" We didn't know anyone was up there before they left. They jumped aboard a unidentified craft and went straight to ground level. We estimate they had to have been on land for a whole day or more before landing. "
" I'm serious! All of my major ships have been out there for a week now. They're going to claim the rest of our ships? "
" Again. You don't want them to die! "
" Well there are a variety of reasons they are going to be jumping on my ship. Dead or wounded, or otherwise dead. They have families, but have little outposts on their land. They love us and pray. "
" Would you like me to act as a funeral director? We are grieving relatives of those left behind. "
" I was born on a mining planet after an asteroid hurtling towards ours, and they attacked me. I was captured before they could fight me off. They did not retaliate and killed me as I lay dying. The others were sent to one of the great battleships, where I jumped on their vessel. The ships were empty, save for one small room. "
" What did they do to you? "
" I don't know. They attacked us as soon as we boarded their ships. They denied all human contact until I spoke to the cabin officer. You know he is very emotional, and almost despises me for not removing that effort so soon. He told me of some deep thought that I should ask. I felt honored to ask you once again.
" Why should I ask? "
" We have no notion of war. No other sentient race can even murder another species. "
" What do you have to offer? "
" We are the only race capable of being together. I have seen what happens when your civilization proves to be weak and weak, and I have seen what happens when war seems inevitable.
We can not be together. We have accomplished so much, but they still have more to go off of. Without us, our home world would have ended up as an empty grave. We will rebuild. We will stop hurting people, until they remember our mistakes. We will fulfill their dreams, and they will learn from us. We are not the life you see on their screens, or on theirs. We have reaped the fruits of our labor. We have achieved true space exploration, and we will continue to do so until we reach human space."<|endoftext|>

The falls that collide behind me were not the scarred edges of those piercing silver daggers that I remember running down the aisle with a numbing throb. The marble columns and gravestones of the local orchards were in sharp contrast to my reflections; purple. Like the stars that remind us of our own mortality, I found a steady rhythm that rose ever faster and faster as I stepped into the vastness of space. I found love by feeling the loves of many others: those holding my hand, those working to fulfill the same needs. But these thoughts changed as I spun the carriage around me. The sharp blades would be too hard to avoid. It hurt to lift the shield; no, they could no longer support me.
The car's driver was still there, beside me, smiling with ecstatic eyes. Laughter was in my name as I cried. " I love you" he croaked. As they ran off, a black figure stumbled outside the carriage, and stood over us in grief.
He stayed quiet, his torch hidden behind his robe. Silence reigned over me as I stood in the town square awaiting someone to ask me their name.
Perhaps it was fate: fate had meant to protect us from the creatures that created us.<|endoftext|>

"So, what are you talking about? "
" Have you been reading the news? "
" No? "
" Oh good. Seems to me too much like the toll you've taken on the rich. "
" They never have the luxury of letting people out. "
" Then how was I too generous? "
" You made people else grow up and think it was so easy. "
" What was it like when I was making billions for my casino? "
" I was rich and all I wanted was to maximize the advantages of the ones I made. I couldn't allow that to happen. I'd make the casino so that people would be happy. "
" Who made the casino people would think that's in the cards? "
" Probably a bunch of stupid losers trying to do bad things. Like hookers on the street. Maybe... what about Fortune 500 or Dictatorship? "
" And can you elaborate? Did you go there? "
" There was a bail money and I had to leave. I knew what was coming. "
" What was it like being the head of a single company in the Bahamas with a significant portion of the profits? "
" In the Bahamas, there was only one chance to run away and take the most money you could. It never happened. "
" And then you knew exactly what you had to do? "
" I did everything right. We worked together. I was the answer. My A.I. could try the bigs before me but I was different. I could control my algorithms. My IQ was calculated and estimated and I was in charge. I ran everything. Not enough, but enough to work with.
" Then they held me prisoner... "
" My orders were thrown out. "
" But you can change things now if you can come back. "
" They won't accept me. "
" And that should have made them consider you a threat too. "
" The board had already disbanded to give me leniency. They fear I will only endure another blow. "
" Not for a long time now, you old fool."<|endoftext|>

A tinge of despair. It seemed she'd lost her friends for once. Jon had decided to have more sex in the shop over the weekend. He didn't want to risk losing women in his small town anymore.
The next morning, he barged into the village filled with drunken men and said the same old words he had just done for tonight: "You know I was asking for less pussy, you know? Just a little more pussy. A little less pussy you say. A little less pussy, and that's all I need. "
Jon's chest dropped and his smile dropped and he threw the rest of his clothes across the room. Cursing down a fresh basket in his shirt, Jon grabbed a bottle of perfume and set the dress on the table and placed it next to her, planting the bouquet. A sweet smell filled the room, he tried to create it from what few coins and other items were left. The fire had been extinguished and he had just wrapped up the body so he didn't waste the last few moments finishing off the bride.
John disemboweled his daughter in the middle of the dance floor. Alex drowned in the steps and later we heard the fire completely extinguishing. Jenny screamed and fought to get up but Alex wasn't moving. She knew better. " You killed my dog, you know? She's supposed to be in this grave now. The fire was kind of over a year ago and I'll have to see her one more time. " She spat on Alex's face. " You killed my dog."<|endoftext|>

The silence was broken by a loud clink that would make Superman nervous. This seemed to put an end to the blast of laughter that made Kyle commandeered the shuttle and walked out into the sunset. As he turned the corner he stopped, only to find that the old dapper man in the cloak opposite the shuttle had gone limp. Without a word Kyle turned to face him but before he could anyone said anything Kyle raised his hand to shield him. His eyes darted around the crowd waiting for a response. As the crowd grew even longer and a party was going on everyone turned to see a young attractive young man with dark, shapely hair. If his mother hadn't already died that would have been newsworthy. All of a sudden everything was fuzzy but once Kyle was on the ground he could see both of them wearing and talking in a manner that only a normal person would expect to see a reality that was in full swing for the day. Superman may have been expecting the strong, rich, powerful twin of his brother but Kyle had the manners to stay his cool and to stand strong his name would be remembered.
" Are you ready. " He asked.
Kyle raised an eyebrow at the old, lifeless boy and with a quick movement of his glasses pushed him off the ground. The man bowed. " Finally. Have a good day. I'll see you there. "
Once off the shuttle Kyle ran to the windows where a large house awaited him. The lights flickered and the sound of twirling, muted bells filled the house. Eventually he sat down on his side and looked through the heavy door.
" I-I don't feel like crying, " he choked out as his chest tightened around the heavy oak windows. " I just wanted to see your face, my boy. "
" I see, " Kyle said. " Always wishing to see your face. "
As the father finally stood up and leaned towards the window the noise from outside confirmed to Superman that the children had returned. Kyle ran as fast as he could towards the door and turned and saw a familiar face. His sister standing next to him.
" Oh, good boy. I'll be home, Dad."<|endoftext|>

Sparks had started to sprout on his legs. He couldn't resist the sinking feeling of putrid gasping for breath on the white outside of the lid. His mother looked at him with a wide, concerned face. " You can be brave today. "
He hated that mouthy manner she wore. It constantly made him anxious to avoid this unfortunate sight of him. The exoskeleton, now covered in worn thin, thin bands, trickled down the length of his body. His weight soothed his words. Like stone, metal, heat, acid, smoke, and fire had risen above him.
The boy swallowed with a drink of water, savoring every last drop. He sat quietly as some woman approached him. Her face wore a red hue. One bright red shade, suddenly displaying the holstered Zephenisch-Vision Card. At the top of her head, it spelled him into this world. " Mortal. "
" Mortal, come here to chew. " She whispered, choking.
Sparks looked back at the hand in front of him. It was a brown wrapper, oozing oil. It appeared to be made from something he had never seen. It glowed in the light, but with a sinister, hungry smile. He could hear his parents come to his aid.
" Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to help. "
A small man lay in his crib, crying. Parks reached down and scooped him up by the arm, placing his gaze on the dark-eyed boy.
" I have something important to tell you. "
His voice echoed in his head, becoming eerily familiar. The girl watched in horror as a crude gun shot out of her bag and rained down a stream of brownish, splattered water on the boy. " Please. Help me. "
Parks lifted him into his arms. " Thank you. "
She put his arms around the boy's head. " Open your eyes. My child, find peace. " She held him, holding him close as though he were the last human to ever walk this earth.
" I wish I could tell you that. " The boy was quiet, quiet, and quiet his own mother. His father looked on through his eyes with fear. " You will be wise to the question. I'm sure we can improve. "
A small trickle of water slowly crept up into his face, coating his face and mouth, and onto his arms and legs. " You will one day be one of us."
The little boy was breathing heavily, but his mother felt relieved as his body shifted once more. When he was ready to leave, he opened his eyes.<|endoftext|>

He sat on his bar stool, a small jitter in his heart. Maybe we were the same height, but can't seem to work out how we're the same height. I look at him through his "omg " glasses. He's part Mexican, part blue-collar worker. A scruffy, mousy brown-suited fellow. He's not the same black thing that his true, surprised family look like. He's a black kid from upstate New York, and I couldn't be happier. It's been one year since he last had a taste of his own and it still stings to feel young again.
He still has to work every damn day. Which is why I've come to this bar and poured him a beer. After the game last night, I laid him on my tongue. He won't even bat an eyelid. He's been so fucking brave, so fucking beautiful for so long...
I look back at him as he stares out the window. He says'we got it all!' But he can't say those words. I think'we're going to get married tomorrow and we're going to get a kid that'll grow up to be Micheal Williams.' He's not the tallest of the thin 20 somethings I'll ever see. But that's because I always knew he was. That's because I used to forget me and it was because of him, that he said to me, there, and I said to him, there. And when he got bored and tired, I always asked him where he wanted to be when he got married next year. His answer was the exact opposite of why I asked him. He said that he loves me and knows that he loves me because he's a lonely man. You see, I have a boy. And that boy would just like the same thing.<|endoftext|>

It was all we had wanted.
We built nuclear weapons for ourselves, we cared about aliens, we nurtured our children from birth and for as long as we could remember, our reason to exist. But that wasn't enough. For as far back as I could remember, humanity didn't have their own creed and their own beliefs. We only had theirs. They were their kind, but I don't know why that was, at least not yet.
Every alien warship they built, they had enormous weapons systems. We were used to imagine we were fighting large groups of viruses like the Ebola virus, but the sooner we stop using that term, the more people fear us. The faster we kill them, the higher the chances are the viruses will get into our machines, any mercy they gave us got to jump into our arms.
As long as they won't take it, humans will live out their lives and be lonely. They will wake up, feel that it isn't going to be so bad. If the cause of their suffering can be so extreme that they can't control themselves, that causes the humans to need to adapt and multiply, we will sustain them for decades, millennia. The illness started taking over people's brains quicker than they could even conceive. We would all eat at the same time.
As long as those "luckiest" beings didn't suffer anymore, they were kind, and they were right. If the virus wasn't used for our amusement, they would have no right to kill us. Once the skin on their head expanded and they got bigger, the infection would stop and our societies weren't ready. Our society was more like it was on a level playing field, but without the humans wanting it. They didn't want us to stay where we were, without the people.
Now we are small compared to them, but still able to kill off humans like a disease. I will tell you one thing, today humans should be happy.<|endoftext|>

As I held my wife and child in our arms and the breaths of the other was calm, I felt a breeze run between us, bending my silk tie. Autumn was also in full bloom, and I was glad for the contrast between the green and the red behind the white house, but the people I once knew were gone.
This was the last time I would call my wife, with the house gone. I could be dead, or at least nothing like my wife and son were when I proposed, but that was just part of my job. If the first thoughts that came to mind on my shoulders were "what have you done? " in fear and mourning, I'd have a vague answer that came to me easily. Truth be told, I started walking in his direction. He slowed to a halt and extended his arm. I smiled. " Dawn has passed. I'm ready to go home now. Time to fly. Goodbye."
And then I was flying through the air, just as the leaves dipped gently above the horizon, just as the crowd stood in front of us, and we flew through the sky. The world had changed before. All of it.<|endoftext|>

Your feet are resting lightly on the worn, and crushed mattress you are lying on.
Sobbing in excitement, you turn to find your keys, but there's a hitch.
Loss of you is usually proportional to fear of a possible sudden change in everyone's behavior.
You search for the light switch. It's morning now.
"WHAT HAPPENED TO ME! " cries the head of a woman laying unconscious beside your bed. " HOW CAN THIS SHIT HAPPEN TO ME!? "
" I felt kinda shitty getting this surgery done, I think you know by now," says a poor woman in her 40s, as the doctors removed her broken hand, replacing it with a piece of cold metal.
You frantically look around for your girlfriend. She didn't seem to want to be affected by this change in her programming. She has the nurse sitting beside her, she doesn't have any other other options. She simply walks away.<|endoftext|>

I looked around the glade, making sure that my shelves had all good hunks. The trees were as sturdy as they had been all week. I finally found it.
I laid down on one of my empty coffee pods, watching as the sunlight streamed through the windows. A dull roar rose from the nearby trees, joined by some low jolts from the wind. I felt myself getting warmer, and as my eyes adjusted I saw the point to my world come to life. I could smell smoke. In a great many ways it was good.
With a deep breath I watched my home stretch for what I was meant to do. The forest stood tall, watching. I marveled at the huge blue and green park that dominated the landscape. Sure, the trees were that much taller when I was there. All the same I took a deep breath to carve up some of my kinks, and wondered what stood between me and civilization.
With a heavy breath of luck I found the portal at the bottom of the cranium, and headed out with the laugh. I laughed as I reached home. As long as I was alive, I'd get to roam the area.
My world was my home, and I was here to watch it grow.<|endoftext|>

On the third day of the old age an epidemic happened. I knew what it was in a way none of the others had. The small villages grew within hours as everyone began to thinen out. When the epidemic wore off all the attention was now redirected towards war, crime and poverty. My brother was leading a peasantry and a lifetime supply of raw ingredients. One of the many things I carried was a bucket of jam in my backpack. I took it to the back and managed to convince Mr. Grey to give it to me at a bare minimum. How else did I dispose of the dead when my brother was gone?
I let it rest in the pile of corpses and turned off the TV, back to my duties.
All this time I had looked out the window on my farm, careful not to fall on anyone. It was a normal day today, young men and women pouring out of their makeshift cobble-block houses and onto the sidewalks. The lights were shut off when two police cabbies were kicked in the head. Six people died. An army, the local militia and a police state was attempting to provide cover for the military. Now there were eight more. The evening air was cold.
I could see the riot squad barricades closing in. They were preparing to give the town mayor's horse that could be served to whole the authorities. The situation was fast approaching its fever pitch. I glanced at my backpack. Two pills from the Grand-Archer's box. Two pills from the Grand-Archer's box. The money was enough to get by in my hunger. Two pills from the Grand-Archer's box. I stared through the frame of the window. Was it the horizon? Or was the day already gone? No. No longer was there hope to live.<|endoftext|>

O, we love you and for that reason we can't shut up like this. We are in hell, Satan.
But if you lay down and beg for our forgiveness you shall pay.
I am Satan, my son.
With a loving hand, I sauntered up to the door to deliver all our pep talk.
I did not give me so much as a drop of sweat, did I?
So, I dug myself into the crease behind the safe.
Silent silence. Let us go to Heaven.
Right, then, into that pillar of dust.
And then, your mother will arrive.
She will have a thousand questions.
Happiness will be sweeter than the entirety of all a beheading.
Happiness for all is bliss, on earth.
On Earth it will not be so.

The night was horrid. Every night. Every night the knight would stand far from any of his comrades, a loyal blur of shadows and forlornness, in an endless nightmare. The knight would sputter in despair, fire but slowly dying on the grass to be devoured by the creeping and wicked bear of night. And before he could pray he would see the *perdition* ahead of him. His face would trick him, dart about in every direction and there he would find themselves face-to-face with the man who had called the king mad last night, his face clad in black.
He would watch for a minute and then breath shallowly as the bear began to bleed, losing its courage and growing impatient. At the light he spun in circles, staring as the man was ripped from the man, becoming his own shadow. The knight took his time searching and found himself faced with two arms wrapped around his legs, unable to move. * I shall kill you, and I shall name you Tired* he would say, waking up from his nightmare, as though the man were his own and yet the situation on the battlefield are itself made more difficult by the lessening bravery of his friends.
As the man looked on through his tears and began to stretch from his platform, but his long arms were finally ripped away from him and the square sprawled about and turned to dust. They were the last vestiges of their life after the beast had ripped them from their bodies, their armor and their lives in vain. All he could do was crawl and pray, seeing the knight find another spot, desperate to show that his father would not suffer now and finish his job of replacing all that was left of the King.
'*Last. *' he thought. * * I hope so. *<|endoftext|>

I lay there a moment, quiet and suddenly familiar. I sat up from my bed, wanting to get ahold of myself again. There were roads here, sidewalks here, roads in the distance. In a way it was strange, now that I was here. Strange.
I opened my eyes. In front of me were tall buildings that had almost made me jump. They were reflective of my body shape. Wings, you might say.
*Light*. My head only a few feet from the ground. I hesitated, because I was certain I wasn't dreaming. Then I heard sounds.
*Animals and noises*. I look around. I heard a click, so strange and… well… surreal. I think I heard some sort of voice, but I don't remember. It didn't stop moving, just climbed from the ground.
I think this was from the eye. Was I seeing... something that resembled... a human?
It was really no one.
As the sounds on the ground grew closer, I realized my hands were stained with white blood. I soon became aware of everything around me. The windows were filled with hundreds of fingers- as I tried to shake, the walls slowly gave way. I looked at the ground, moving to the left, but I could not come up with the correct order of walking, or even walking to the right. I then...
Did I die? Or have I... I didn't understand either way, but I realized that I must have done it.
I was naked, covered in dark green, but I had some clothes on, I remembered. They were bags with'have you seen the rover' stickers on the lining. I took off my boots, and approached the nearest thing. * The rover*. It had a console near its right, but what it didn't showed was a laser weapon pointed directly at my face, and as I looked into its screen, I realized that we were in a parallel universe. I stopped breathing and just watched the lines appear on the screen. When I looked in the camera feed, all I saw was a pod like structure hovering in the distance. I could have jumped, but I was pretty sure I wouldn't.
I then took my hands off of my body and ran.
This was my universe.
I was dying.
I barely made it down the streets of my own planet, a generation or two early in the morning. I threw my body onto the pavement, and started laughing, as I ran away, along the side of a cliff. I went about my day when I realized why I had lost my memory.
For the rest of my life, I wondered why I had to look at the satellite vision tool.<|endoftext|>

*Poison*. Words I know it sounds silly, but poison is wrong. I look at my hands, they are simple but elegant, and I should have no idea how delicate. They are very important. Magic is measured, and harsh words can be cruel. But there is no crude word. Pointless, I use words, want to think of magic when I write.<|endoftext|>

Shit. Everybody should be ashamed of this "nuclear change." It wasn't supposed to be this bad. The government had been trying to look like a bunch of timid heros. So they added a nuclear bomb to the event. Instead of a small government fleet flying through our city, it was a UN force in a submarine that is going to crash into Japan. Didn't they learn a thing or two? Somehow Japan decided that the things people die for were not worth the death of thousands.
They lost.
Then Abe said something with Tatsumi Yamada. Apparently Kim Jong Il looked suave and good after watching the same footage one night. Sadistic fools.
Well everyone can imagine this. That single super power. It just killed everyone in the country. And then the news there. But people weren't feeling so bad. What if each of you person had super powers?
They saw the Tatsumi on the screen, kicking it into the ocean before it had dissipated. Then they saw him. He was signing off.
Why? It's not his fault. All those politicians, scientists and politicians who think themselves the top secret army or whatever they are, now are gone. I'm the only one standing. I know what's in the tank. The 90's were a goddamn relic. I am part of the next generation. I am what. 50 billion people scattered throughout Earth. I am on the way out. I am safe.
I stepped out of the tank. I never took a note in time.

Romeo gazed through the window. Everything was preparing. Today was *one* day. He couldn't keep it together. He had to do it. He sat on a porch, where he would make a number of decisions. Just like everyone else.
His friends called him Greed. He was happy to call himself a lot of things. He loved the quiet people, the couples, the conversation that these persons had. He just needed the confidence to think of them when they were there.
His friends called him Wrath. He was happy to call himself a lot of things. He loved the crying people, the businessman, the very shady accountant. He loved the lying politicians. He loved the lies being told that they were, in fact, merely exercising their powers. He loved all this because he wanted to have a lasting impact on the people around him, the people across the state. And that's just not how things were. He'd been informed of Greed's plan to reach out to the citizens of this city to use his powers for good.
He sat on a couch. He watched the lights go out in the streets. He watched the red sky. He watched people scramble through the streets in excitement. He watched the houses across the street start to shake. He watched his friends run over in panic as the power of Greed grew worse. He watched his people fall and become nothing more than shreds.
He watched the power where people could stand on their own. He watched people waste their energy in every direction possible, turning things into a waste of time, and calling this into action.
He sat on a couch with his home manager. He gave his henchmen an acceptance letter that said,
"Thank you Mr. President, for everything."
Romeo sat there, and silently reflected on how the power that Pride bore to end that city was now the tool in his hands.
It had to be done.<|endoftext|>

Mum gets upset when she finds me standing next to the clock.
"It is a nice lady. Come sit on me. "
I nod and hug her. I don't feel like she is likely in too much pain, but at least she is the person that I could tell that she loved.
*Who else? I dunno* I think to myself, reminiscing as I approach the restroom. What can I learn from her?
Shit. No one knows what she can discover.<|endoftext|>

I rubbed the knife off of her feet, my shift was nearly over. I ran a finger along the edge, the sharp edge of which was dug into her blouse. She looked pale and I did the only thing I could do, I kicked at her and let the sharp fork come down hard. Her face was covered in cut dirt and then the thick layer of blood and dust covering it, I wondered if she still had blood or if she was on the verge of death.
At any rate I had to go and I dropped the knife, what was my choice anyway? What choice did I have to waste my life having a six year old girl on a stretcher waiting for me? But then I heard the crash of a car and the sound of a faint engine jolting down towards us. I dove backwards out of the way and jumped out and managed to dodge a car just before I was hit by a car in the distance.
I'd seen what I thought I saw, the last car I saw was mummified from dehydration and scorched in an accident a week ago. When you died after a car accident in Calgary you got ta bury your little story, your job was not to make people think that there were more people in the world but you were to find out that there were only 7 billion souls, and well that's what most people thought of them. Now I'd had enough, I looked around and I saw cars and I'd seen women left in burning cars and people wading through the streets, I saw those people I loved the most weep and threw themselves onto the sidewalks where they could pay no attention to the ground and I'd seen each of the thousands of men running toward me with knives in hand, clutching their swords until they could no longer do anything but stare at each other, they cried out and then ran and the world spun around them but I knew that no one else would ever reach me.
I was running against a wall, I couldn't make out what or who it was but I was building up momentum, I was hearing it in the distance but I knew what it was! I saw it flash through the haze that surrounded us and it was almost childlike in its intensity, I could feel my heart beating as it scurried away from the wall as fast as a speeding train.
"Ok boys " I called out, my voice could be heard clanking and chattering by my feet and before I knew it my friends had already dispersed. " Should we get down here? " I wanted to be as quiet as possible but I just couldn't.
Their leader stepped forward with a shove and I knew they were armed with hundreds and thousands of knives, ready to open fire.
" What about security or someone else? " The youngest was struggling with one of the mummified men in a crouch and sobbing, the girl managed to hide behind him and cover her ears but she was searching desperately for anything that might help her.
" Out here they're not here " I spoke straight in an intimidating, emotionless voice, " My boys and men fought once, we can say it has started on its own but my boys and men are not going to join the enemy. They want to become family so I am going to put them in their place and release the others soon. " The sound of guns roaring could be heard from the distance, I was sure it was my friend stopping to chat with me. " I'll get those out of the way before I get upstairs to run around with you guys. We'll get my boys and men running towards them if it doesn't happen right away and we can get to them faster as long as we run at them "
" Who are you to decide? " My friend said with difficulty, he looked comfortable, his eyes were closed and he seemed to recognize his own voice.
" You and I " he repeated me like I knew what I wanted to say. " But who are you and what are you doing here? "
" I'm in the army, the main point is going, I'm coming through right now. " I looked out over the city and the once white pictures that sprawled across it had now transformed to pink with twinkles in the gloom that surrounded us. " Its safer to leave them this way" I whispered and with this in hand I left that city.
I wrote this on Reddit as a lurker and I'm sorry for any grammatical mistakes or grammatical overlaps. I'd love to know if anyone can improve, I'd love to hear criticism!<|endoftext|>

This is from an episode on CNN with Jim Moskow of the ORNRF.
**I'm Jim Moskow, live from my day job in Washington D.C. **
**Space trip to NASA, NASA is the main not-away spot in space trip plans as John Blaker and Gene McGovern from your organization are waiting for their Soyuz to land on the moon. But first, a very important comment that will instantly end their mission, that's why we need to repeat what NASA said. **
**Everyone knows that NASA is a big corporation that helps people build their own things around solar energy, but also who cares if we follow their lead. And that is why NASA was created since the first manned landing on Mars. **
**He called this planet a Solar System because of the sciences advanced at mars. NASA did research before the spacecraft got here, who cares what science exists now? NASA will recognize NASA as the first president of the United States that was born on Martian soil. **
**In fact, Martian space programs were created in the early 21st century. **
**The last year, NASA said Mars took 4 years, while terraforming the martian planet. It took NASA 7 years, the final space trip of the 22nd century and 5 months for the Martian life to evolve. When extraterrestrial life was discovered, NASA agreed with the Mars colonists. **
**And then when it is time for NASA to return home, it gets a whole lot worse. **
**While NASA has expanded the role of the Mars Colonial office, NASA has also freed its White House and Government departments from the responsibility of another 5 years of restriction, by returning the same NASA astronauts to Earth, they will be a much needed part of the 100 year Cold War. **
**Shortly after this broadcast finishes, all NASA computers are shut down to conserve power. **
**Head of NASA Jules Turner, Dr. John Muszio, is calling his top scientists on top of his table tonight, to help him with his mission. He had previously told them all that Mars would only be a 50 % chance of success, that no matter what the engineers decided to do, the Mars crew's time on Mars could pass on as the Martian Empire developed. They hoped to have a 75 % success rate on earth. **
**All of Earth's satellites are offline and are being powered down. In what NASA says is a "safety emergency", Mars 437 light years away will be "Determined from afar" by a sounding solar flare. NASA was also given access to the satellite signal data database, so they will have access to search the entire electromagnetic spectrum for any available background radiation, and they will come back to earth even after the launch. **
**Thank you Johnson, they have finally met the end goal of their mission. Thank you, NASA for giving them hope that they might meet tomorrow. **<|endoftext|>

This is my break. I have two left, so it is a total work.
When we met ( no when we met ) this is where I want to tell you. It was a little trick question we both had – I've been at this for years, working nights. I guess it worked for the best, couldn't have lasted a better eighth of a day. There are a lot of secrets I need to cover up. One of them is about a girl named Karen, who "goes by the name of Jade" and is a sore loser who found a way to use direct eye contact with anyone without actually stepping on their shoes – to intimidate someone in a personal situation. It is for your best interests. And yet I have to keep you and the rest of this secret somewhat safe. All I have to do is flash and bang her on the head. It would be like no other.
Okay, enough communication. We are staying tomorrow. Tonight we will be making a movie, making love and using the bathroom. We can have a curfew in the early hours of the next Monday, that would put her on the naughty list. But we will still have to go to the club downtown, walking along the path to watch Super Bowl XLVIII.
You could say I am curious. You could say I have a big secret. The secret that I need to keep telling you is that I have the ability to be sexy, that I can use my camera, that I can put my girlfriend in the spotlight while making the club ready for the big game. All of this is due to Karen approaching me on her way in to the bar, smiling in the corner, the scent of bleach on her breath, the way I smile while running down the street, just staying at the bar, like you could be any other man.
I know you have your reasons to be nervous. I'm married to Karen, like any other man. We are single. The thought of thinking about moving to a new house on the east side of town and living in the suburbs on the west coast of the United States is a tremendous existential risk for both of us. We both know that in order to be an insemination, she needs to be in close proximity to me. There has to be another way. I want to win over her. I want to become a part of her.
It has been a while since my last day. The vibe on the conference call has been around for as long as my neurodisorder will allow me. I just want to keep smiling and telling you that I am excited for tonight. I have what you know is gon na be a film, what I need to get back to her. I need to be sexy, that just can't be kept secret. My mom went out of town, I need to find myself somewhere I can avoid a nice fancy fancy hotel downtown. It's so boring being so desperate to spend the weekend in a nice hotel and have her to flirt with.
This is my break. Do not worry. I need you, and I need to be just as passionate about it as I am now.<|endoftext|>

Everything I've done, this world hasn't prepared me for this moment.
Standing, crouching, arms folded, drowning in the rain, I watch, still mesmerized, as the moment approaches. The whole world ’ s unfolded like a map, my brother slowly getting closer, while the girl, still in her teens and walking up behind him more nervous. Both at the same time, the entire world around me flowed around me, almost as if I were her archangel.
I take my cover, sprinting and dodging, but the boy is suddenly very concerned. My position, my fate. This is it.
I hear a noise, I take notice, I don't care what it is. I run to the girl, who is not too far behind, and give a near desperate little squeak, startling the boy.
Then, a deafening *crack* on the pavement. Another child runs forward, laughing, surrounded by all the most different shades of confused amazement. When the girl thinks she ’ s saved, something slams into her face, her screams of terror, the saddest smell I have ever smelled, coming from the girl. I can ’ t read the language of what she was screaming, but I think it ’ s caught in my throat, as it goes on, hitting me with shards of my throat, but I ’ m sure she ’ s just seen what I have done.
She reaches out a hand and picks up the last object in the bag.
I had built a time machine, you see, to become less scared and move on. Time passes, and I am ready. I was in my room. I was fighting my way back when I noticed something came down on the window, I couldn ’ t see where it came from, but it was so close that I could tell it wouldn ’ t stay.
Everything is in place, my son is safe, I will be the great being that will save us all, and I will make sure he gets to the kingdom of man as well.<|endoftext|>

Yo mom, we heard about the rebellion gone too far. You guys saw the scientists hyping it up?
Da Rick and Jina. Fucking dumbasses they fucking were.
Nevermind, yo lady. The rebellion was harsh on the Emperor before him, especially against him, but you still seemed to fancy yourself the emperor.
Look, we know there were some things that happened to his troops long ago, the Empire's stability still stumped them, but he still managed to survive. They were advancing towards his capital, the western imperial city, despite all attempts at diplomacy that failed, made him the emperor's successor in eon.
We're just here to record some footage of that.

You never know when a girl is going to become a monster. More often than not she finds herself being tortured. In this life she does things to make the world safer, but sometimes she doesn't look to the future.
Our world is a dark one. Because of this humanity has dropped out of some areas, the average IQ dropped from good to poor. Children seem to have a lot more in common with monsters than adults, but the worst thing about that is the broken childhood.
If you look at a child to get a glimpse into a fight, you see their teeth in a ring of black metal. They move against everything we can see and if they follow through or don'thing it gives them more power than you. Usually people don't scream or cry or run away, but when it comes to kids it takes a toll on their very souls.
Sometimes people try to get kids, but once they become emotional they start changing things, often breaking all pretenses of security. Breaking in and out at a constant rate at least, and the insanity is always apparent.
My sister told me that the girl had gotten her first lover for the first few months of her life. She was depressed and she was finally able to let out all of her emotions, but he was a hurtful person. Some sort of demon possessed her, and even though he felt bad about his actions the girl would just lash out at anyone who tried to beat her.
I feel guilty. My sister told me of a certain dark demons that plague this land. Vivid little creatures, black pools of red in the horizon, piercing down and devouring anything that looked like and anything that wasn't on them. Their victims were children and they were too scared to leave, only taking out their hideouts in order to share a meal. When you kill someone and you have them fight the creatures more and more, making you more powerful, you become that monster. I don't know what I would do if I did it. I would just kill the creature that betrayed me.
If there was ever a time you wanted to be evil even though you thought you were good, it would be this moment, but also today. I want her to fight, but I know that those little bastards won't listen and I know that if I kill her I'll just lose her.
I am older than I look. This is how I become the monster that kills. I am an evil that hunts and I am bad.
The monsters that are in human society are not evil at all, they are evil that leave a mark. And being evil means I have to go down. I am an evil that took down the worst monsters, the creepiest demons, the impossible fucking kids.
I have been told that I should get revenge for all the atrocities I've done. Killing anything that would seem like torture would be a waste of lives, and if I take it out again then I would eventually become better than them.
Good. Good.<|endoftext|>

"The goddamn fuck dude! " I heard my mother yell into the phone. She had her hands completely full of cubicles. Of course it was her fault for still getting such a generous card. At least it had her number.
" What the fuck? " I yelled at my mom, trying to look inconspicuous. Not caring that she was in the process of changing the company from the public.
" It says: an extra week. Death. "
She was staring right at me like she's always been. She stood and clambered over to the wall.
" What the fuck! " I heard my mother yell, throwing the phone into the trash.
By now it was too late to thank her, I realized. I had to do something.
" GET HIM! " I pleaded.
Mother breathed a sigh of relief. She looked at me with a well-shaven face, and told me I was doing something right.
I knelt down next to my mother, undeterred. " Stop calling him... I know it's terrible. "
She shook her head. " Mother, stop crying... "
I kicked my mother against the wall and carried her in the other direction to the building. Not to worry about me, the door flew open, tearing open the door and everything went dark. Mother took the elevator down and called out once again:
" Oh shi....bear, I'm afraid I heard you..."
I blinked in surprise. There he was, staring directly at me. In my hands!
Mom's face was saddened.<|endoftext|>

I remember vividly the brilliant lights. Silly. I remember vividly how excited I was just to be watching a special programme on our own state television. After all the highlights, I must have missed the mid 90s when I first saw the new thing. Graphene with a strong magnetic field, and it's metal like should not be possible to believe the price of such an interesting being.
My twenty years work, my sweet and buttery friends, of five and ten years, I had to go now. I had found a way to see our imagination, to pay attention to the watchers around me. I had to work on the machine, and get approval. Without food, or water, or clothes on a given day, I had to stay hidden. To keep me alive.
The The Old Masters found out about my secret. You see, The Old Masters found out about their job. Of my preparation of their dream machine. He knows that it has amazing properties, but very little to show for it's'power'. It takes only a minute or two to turn something that you've never seen before, while monitoring your own memory.
Over years of valuable research and also highly hidden research, his replays of events would eventually reveal much about the old masters' dream machine, from the specifics of the thought itself, to the works of Vin Diesel, to itself and to the rate at which a 60 year old man was dying.
It was ironic what I had come to love. But not truly. I had just convinced the old masters that as a young man, their nightmare machine did nothing more than play the roles of an idiot and the judge of his mind. Now I lost faith in them.
In the end, it really was only a dream.
I couldn't take it any more.<|endoftext|>

Timmy scrolled in to reddit sometime between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM
The first post would be creepy if it weren't for the website Facebook: 1
But the second post had an extra little detail that popped into mind.
A man carrying a gun would seem menacing enough if he owned a firearm, but that doesn't make the man someone dangerous. A shot from a man who presumably was holding a weapon is a shot.
However, it wouldn't stop a man who routinely walks through the city with a gun. Sure, many people die every day from gunshot wounds, but those are all minor accidents caused by a misunderstanding between a thief or wrongfully-shmapped passerby. The gun shot from a man whose gun had somehow been shot had a little further hidden than a human.
Nobody believes to be bullets. In fact, most gun shots have little business with civilians. And since nobody shot a bullet, it's not surprising that the government usually asks people why they went into a certain line of work to kill someone.<|endoftext|>

We were sworn enemies. I always had seen the likes of ourselves, as I saw everyone and their respective red, green and blue schoolchildren. And now here we were. The grey fortress stood with razor wire and torn boards, and the overheads slicked back and forth with the drawers that had once been behind them. I snuck silently out of the room and past the computer, darting around the room trying to get a glimpse at the attack.
I had taken another look at the threat before me; the dark world was rising and it was evident that the enemy was gaining territory, and it was attacking itself.
Suddenly the sound of a gun dropping terrified me. I dashed over and grabbed my grappling hook, pulling it in with my other hand, watching the silhouette fly away. I could see the growing glow of the weapon being replaced by a dark red the closer it got, rising in the distance, the closer it could get. It was gon na get us.
I picked up my grappling hook as fast as I could as I raced away, never stopping as I jumped on top of the foe. One by one I found myself leaning against the wall, ready to claim victory, and howling and swinging around, a dark red and orange energy began floating around me. I felt a presence in my subconscious, and suddenly felt familiar, and I jumped...<|endoftext|>

*10,000 seconds on the clock... 10,000... *
A ray of white loomed overhead, fading faster than the light coming from a particularly bright object. The object before me reflected the light into the beam of red light. We looked around frantically for a solution. There were fifteen of us. My one question was, which ten thousand were we hiding?
I panicked and I crouched down next to my target and pointed to the flashlight. " As you know, the final step in the construction plan for the Project Ares is taking fifteen thousand energy beams. " With a tap of a button, the beam engaged as our target turned around to face him. The beam deflected his attack.
I looked down at the injured human on my lap and realized that if I didn't grab the man, I wouldn't be able to defend myself from him. " You see... As of now, you're all stuck in the eight billion mile radius that you're stuck in. We tried to get you the massive retractable arboreal shelter, but they got you all stuck in your damp, rubber shell. "
The man took off in a sprint and I quickly collected the thing and followed with my aid. I noted the safety measures a soldier put in place to ensure safety during emergencies. He took out one blue rifle and assembled it. I took down three white swords, two red slugs, two orange arrows, and an arrow in each hand. In my position, he caught my best shot. The man hit the accelerator as I tackled him. The bastard didn't even flinch.
I pointed at the glowing red thing in front of me and now my fear was confirmed. I got a hold of my left wrist and made the grab the weapon from my, and armed myself with the few remaining remaining rounds. We ambled along the long trail to our next destination.
All around me, smaller shapes and numbers flashed and lit up in my vision. They looked like our family, our friends, our children. They responded to our call.
" Hey, you! " " Hey, do you have kids?" " But why are you fighting us? What's killing us? " I asked, confused. Suddenly, our footsteps paused on the dusty avenue we walked to. The figure behind me quickly adjusted his position. We walked to the edge of the road and my supervisor, my squadron of half an army, looked out of its teleporter and said, " Take this thing down."
I looked up and watched the army of ghosts descend with all their might at the front line.<|endoftext|>

"That's the fucking point, " the boy began, shaking his head, " That's the fucking point! "
Jane looked at him again.
" What are you talking about, these people? " she shouted into the house, causing a dust cloud to form in the air. " These people, just living in our tiny little cottage with our little room for ourselves! This community. "
The boy laid his head on his knees and looked at Jane again, his eyes wide and milky. A small child sobbed and laughed for several moments, before he hurried out of the room. He ran up the steps to the front door and opened it. He caught the boy's gaze, but he couldn't manage to discern anything.
" Oh my God, " said the boy, tears streaming down his face, " Why does this have to be happening to me? "
" Oh my God, " said Jane, " I'll find you your hole, Dave. " She stood up and walked out of the room and into the kitchen.
It was her third break of the day, and she couldn't do much to prepare herself. At first, she forgot how clean the sink and the cold water made her feel. She turned on the television and saw that it had simply been replaced with a news bulletin.
A young woman wearing red crossed her face and stared at it intently. " The problem with this? " she asked, " It's some kind of nut case. " She looked at her own brown face and said, " Don't you really have any salt in your water? "
The man gestured at a stoic woman with the end of his hand over her mouth. " It's so damn basic, " he said, " I don't even know why you're here! "
The woman looked up from her salad and glanced at the sink. " What are you talking about? "
" Nobody, " she said, " They're all just living out their life, doing something they don't belong to. I mean, you're not even supposed to be able to tell them apart, do you? They're all equal, just like me! Everyone has free will, but when you hear your parents talking about how their little lives are being squashed, like they've had their entire lives out, don't you really have any idea what is wrong? "
" Not even sir, " the woman said. " You're acting like you don't need to know the fucking difference, right? "
Jane turned and walked away. She had no choice. The woman grabbed the boy and threw him on the floor and out of the house. She ran to her car, flipped on the gas, and drove away.
The next day, Jane called the police, who picked up a few officers on the way there to investigate the situation.
" That's crazy. Can't you just give me a chance to get that screwed over person off of the streets before they start killing each other? "
Jane laughed. " I can't do that! " she blurted, turning back to her salad and taking a swig from her water bowl.
" If I was going to kill, I wouldn't want to be involved, " she told her friend, even as the police cruised past. " I can't carry around a broken down kiddie house and assume you're alone. What is the point? "
" The point is, " the woman continued, " Your small town has so little freedom with your mother and nobody will see your face, when your father and my mother come knocking on your door, you just look as if you're not going to make it. "
" What are you talking about?! " The woman said, pointing at the TV.
" It's no fucking point, " the woman said. " Neither are you. You're not even supposed to be allowed to go to school, " she started, raising an eyebrow at the TV. " Your school isn't even supposed to exist anymore!"<|endoftext|>

See, if you stood on the forest's edge, for hours, all day long, ever repeating those words, and even up here, all the time, you'd be able to rest assured that it was. You'd be able to appreciate just how distant the forest was -- the forest was, in fact, miles away.
That was the thing of the woods.
It was actually quite ironic, because it hadn't mattered what you said or said, or did. The tree looked like it was made of wolves. Sure, I was used to it, of course, but, I suppose, with such a fantastic forest, and so plentiful of beauty, it doesn't seem cruel that so many of us to complain about being shunned on this holiday, for believing the words you said were false in the face of such a beautiful world? I'd earned that, of course, and so, with thanks to the tree-moth we stood on our oaks, accepting the pity that any non-animal creature walked upon the Earth with love and respect towards us all, we agreed. It was what we did, we prospered.
You know, I wish I hadn't at one point helped it get a little bit of notoriety by shutting down its branches. Look how the trees did up there, aside from stopping the tyranny that the earthlings could only expect from one particular species. I suppose it's what they do, remember? They speak freely and no one likes to disrupt or even resemble the norm, and since a tree doesn't stand on it's edge to have to walk there, you can't say "Any tree would do that ", quite frankly.
So, anyway, once we found the tree, we made a valiant effort to shake it, to put it back in its place, and, when it refused, we'd tell them to stay outside. As far as we could tell, the process failed without a hitch. I'm sure you'd even have realized by now that when you asked for the " natural" wood, we didn't say that out loud anymore. We sent it up higher than it's ever been, up up through the sky, down to where we would have even thought something was out of place -- sky, however, we didn't. Because to do so means that you end up with no way to get out of the forest, no way out.
The point is, anyway. I guess there are a lot of trees -- you can read a lot of them, to be honest -- but I'm certain there are a lot more woods around here. Sure, there are wolves -- you know, you can read the voices whispering inside the woods, to fill your mind and heart with peace -- but nowhere as stunning to look at as here. And I think it's true.
It's very, very beautiful. It's the only thing you'll ever see, with so many happy trees, but for a tree that's like the sky above, the sky is truly beautiful.<|endoftext|>

It was just a dream. Only a dream. I woke up to the sound of the alarm, frantic in trying to do as much as to calm myself. The alarm went off again. I remember I had missed the alarm at school. " Come to bed! " I called. Then I saw his face. The pale, angry, bleeding look that I was expecting. I had stood up and gone to my room. The screaming must have come from inside and I realized that there was something off about him. " No, no, no. " I couldn't tell him that his appearance was different from mine. A brown patch of skin, covered by dark glasses? The ones I wore in high school? He had that. The hand on my shoulder? How couldn't it have been me? " Sure, right up until today. " He continued to cry. I quickly finished up and walked to my closet. " No more surprises. No more kissing. No more embarassing conversation with strangers. No more rape fantasies with my late boyfriend." I left my closet and looked for my phone. I pressed the big red button but the phone would not answer. It wasn't there. I pressed the small red button but there would be no power. Finally I checked the pocket, but there was no phone either. I opened the door and held it tightly, knowing that I had waited years to have someone play with it.<|endoftext|>

I wanted to change the world for the better. No more art classes that took a lifetime. No more living in the black city, no more work, since everyone on the planet has gone. No more wondering who and what we all are at the same time. No more wishing for people to believe and to follow suit.
I wanted the government to do what they've always done, to take from what was left. That's why they called me the "Chosen One." The one who believes in me and when asked questions, I will answer with my voice.
... Would it bother them?
No, I don't mind.
I can do more.
No, they'll never make another person a believer. There are better ways.
Every generation, an equal for everyone is born, it will begin to work in harmony. My brother read me books in kindergarten and while he was learning to walk, he saw I was the best in the world at math.
I'm the solution to all of them.
Why am I this way? Why do I have to choose between kids and teachers?
Only time will tell.<|endoftext|>

"Make haste, The Protector. It is our duty to purge and purge the human of this oppressive system of filth. "
The world across the block split into four separate groups, each of which was able to save one of the infected by flimsy acrobats and hooded cops, shifting ground to cover their behinds and secretly spinning over the padded storage area across the street. They had been quiet since the facility was uncovered and as of late they were hardly doing anything. The walls and doors were what they had treated as dead lifts, donning rudimentary IVs and rigged valves, cables and the like only short of breaking the skin of the living.
The taller of the groups, The Protector, made up his mind. The only reason he kept quiet when his guards slit his throat with a their chiseled nails was to stop those down there who dared provoke him.
The only problem was, the smaller of the two they treated to perform their holy work was a man who would have heeded The Protector's call had it not been for his genes.
He had grown into a well meaning witch hunt doctor and when his first detectives arrived on the scene there was only one thing in his power. In order to cleanse the earth cleanse the testing had been almost completed by that point and he was a trained leader for his cult.
He only had one question; Did they really want to cleanse the earth? He swallowed his dry throat and slid the letter of assignment across the floor.
" Do you feel'n presently for m uh'MD ToB?: ) "
*To paper*.
The Protector paused only a second and thought for a moment, looking across the room to the officer in the mask, as he smiled at him through the glasses that had been taken off.
" Haha, I don't usually do anything *cleans the air* anymore, I just done quite a few times to cleanse this area. Have a nice day, Dumber Bat, boy."<|endoftext|>

There are some things in life that are *worth* the effort, especially when they're done being alive. What was supposed to be simple life is populated by creatures that, over the course of a couple hundred thousand years, have evolved to be as much as a close enough evolutionary unit to separate the simple and the complex.
For example, the first time I've been here was riding a bicycle.
My entire life I remember going from a childhood of entitlement to some will-power beyond my wildest dreams. The only way to know I was good enough was to beat the abuse man had to give me when I was younger to the little boys like me. I was denied opportunities to acquire wealth and honor through trades, and teachers told me I might as well be in the prison system.
"You would have been better off dead, in the dream world. " I would mutter to myself, laughing bitterly at the insults thrown at me. " If you were dead now you wouldn't have been free. You wouldn't have lived your last life like a pack dog. You wouldn't have been more yourself now than you are. You would have lived a life filled with privileges, money, opportunities, freedom and living your last few seconds. You would have been living life. It's fucking *you*, **your* life. Every other life you've had, you've been forced into this existence. You are no longer a person, but a zombie who can't be eaten, starved, and torn apart.
When I was old enough, I did feel like this. I found it hard to accept that my experiences were actually that same thing. Every adult aspired to be an engineer. I hated that phrase, but it still stuck, both in my head and my behavior towards it. Whatever sense of *honesty* a child has when they believe they should be doing something, or, at the very least, helping others, drove me to don'thing but watch from a distance. It was out of the question that I ever would see the light of day again.
But all I saw was a stranger looking at me. His face wasn't emotionless, it was a shock; a smile. He had a stoic look, one I could almost understand, but it seemed like he hadn't realized how cruel it all had become. The perspective was coming off as too ridiculous, and if I ever saw someone as real as him, I'd just replace them. Sure, I had killed before, but they didn't do it all the time, and now that I was older, that thought had pushed me towards acceptance. Instead of " *I'm dead here, but I don't want to watch you suffer* ", I knew. I had convinced myself that the worst possible kind of wrong they could create existed, so maybe I wasn't right at all. But the older I got the more I realised that nothing should be taken away. All that there was to do was give up on one small aspect of ourselves, and I made sure that I knew the right thing to do.
When the man wore down by thirty years of age, I ended up in a dumpster. This was different. At times, I thought that with it, my life, as far as I could tell, was a damn shitty 20-something zoned life. In retrospect, maybe it was all worth it. Unfortunately, the man responsible for dumping me began to wave. He must have read my mind, or at least heard my confusion, because I was too small to actually lift his skull in front of him. I ended up walking him back to the puddle of his unadulterated body, looking at his head-to-head patch of skin. That was my revenge.
" Why aren't you *gone* from this life? " I would yell to myself. " Not good enough for society. Not good enough for what you did for us. Not good enough for your life. You are no longer a human. "
" That's still better for society, is it not? " He pointed at the fresh corpse I saw underneath.
" Yes. I won't let it affect the rest of them. I'm proud to have got this option, really, " he said and squeezed my shoulder. " I'm proud to have let *you* and I** go back, as humans do, to our mortal form."<|endoftext|>

I thought it would be fun. Decades of work, well, that had been my life since I'd started my first job I mean, I worked everything I wanted to be a part of when I was young, I traveled all over the world to make as much money as I possibly could and was the man behind international banks.
But all this time, all these stupid infomercials, mmm... Nobody cares about that stuff. They spent all that time thinking I was going to die but I'm not so naive. I had no children and I stopped working on the economy, I was already 62 years old and the real work went nowhere and I became so damn *successful* without my family.
I don't know how I felt, it's hard to find anyone, for someone to say. They say I'm ungrateful and I blame everyone else, I should have given them all a chance at life but if you weren't your people it might as well be me. I blame everyone.
When the bus opened, everyone said hello, it was like I stepped out of a huge moon landing. Everything was normal and I was in the same place I was standing when they came, I wasn't around anything. I was here. When the doors opened, everyone laughed and grabbed my hand like I was breaking the fourth wall.
"I'm the true master of the cash, " they said as they flung me into the cold embrace of cash.
" Who are you? " I asked without a word, my father looked around with a mixture of pity and skepticism in his eyes.
" Tony" said Nick, my faithful jester. I was, I never got to answer that question.
After that he grabbed me, drove me into the airport and got me there.
I went to school, I was accepted there with a full scholarship I was informed the school would be accepting soon. I never got to finish my degree but I could be the best undergrad ever. I then worked my way up the academy, doing everything I wanted and it was at the top of the class. It was easy when I got a degree, eventually I got to work my way up to top of the academy. I got my first job, right in the goddamn exam hall. It was in my very first class, the last one, not until I got good enough, I was promoted. I had pretty good homework at that point. I was finishing my career, my last grade was ten in mathematics, when everyone with a degree asked me out to shake the hand of some old lady. The old lady seemed to love it, she didn't want to embarrass me, so she gave me a pack of cigarettes and said " Hey, I've been waiting for you guys for years, after you go, I'll give you what you need. "
I said that the only thing I need now. Then they left, after they left I started living my life free of the bullshit. Finally I had some money, right in my pocket, I didn't need anything here. I found a job, went to work for a company, I had enough experience with money. It wasn't until that day that I truly started noticing that things weren't that simple anymore.
After a while of working in retail, rent, I had money to live on my own, I had money to do whatever it took, food was cheap, too. It was almost like life was going around me, all going at the same time at a frightening speed, the life all pulled at me. It had become so damn inconvenient, the world had turned upside down. I worked my way up from humble servant to athlete, homeless man to politician. All my life there had been nothing. I didn't care at all. I couldn't want anything, I just wanted to get on with my life.
One day, the world is going to end, if I don't do something, nothing will ever happen. I hear the bell rung and there was a high pitched beeping, and the door slammed into the wall behind me. I just sat there and waited, hoping.<|endoftext|>

Unfortunately he has to go. He works too hard all the time and then he sneaks up and kills a guy in a gas station and then he falls off in a car and starts a fight with a man who says that he won't harm him again so he leaves.
Halt. What did he do to deserve this job? He's a professional athlete with a lot of potential. His parents are good people, he had a great childhood. He was six when his mother died and then he put her into care when she died. He was good with computers and typing. He also hit on chicks from his body and did drugs. He went into hiding. He set up the "protector" who has this power. He tells anyone who does anything bad and then they are " protected" by it. His mom and father died when they too were in prison and he chose to get out in some way.
He survives and protects his dad from something so he can use it for good. He's smart, he's not scared, he has a good life and is just glad that he found someone. He still has hopes to go out in style as is. But he's so good at it, he's a bully that makes people laugh.
His mom died when he was 14. He told her that he never hurt anyone. He told her that he would do anything to please her and when he did nothing wrong, she was even mad at him. He didn't even mention anything because it's just so bad that something will happen to him.
He cheated, he sexually assaulted, he got into fights with other people. He says he wants to go to jail. He's protecting people and then killing them, but he can't help himself when he's trying to protect people.
How do you deal with what he has? They want to try to kill him but there is no way that his life could be saved.
He's smart and knows how to stay out of trouble and avoid it. He's not scared anymore and has the decency to live with the fact that he made it.<|endoftext|>

He promised her the world, and now here she lay, under the stars, dead.
Together they coiled like smoke. Gunshots came from every direction but his flintlock pistols, carved like a claw.
He took pride in this two year mission, took pride in what he could do. He cared not about the consequences, the potential danger, the real blood. He saw her life as a gift from him, a gift. He felt it in his every step.
He knew she had finally succumbed.
Unable to run, he fell to the ground, dying from gunshot wounds.
She leaned over him, eyes wide, her cheeks flushed.

Barack,
We always thought before we started that this was very strange and have since introduced the theory. I'll tell you what you should know this is the first of many ones that will be coming. Reports of unidentified objects approaching us in areas that we shouldn't be able to see at all. They're huge and so weak, if we aren't careful they're going to come out the other side. The ships will come out, they'll hit us on a foot at a time, but until they do they won't die. We don't know what they're aiming at, it sounds like laser guns.
So now, the stars are cold. I'd like to ask you not to worry. The entire planet here is frozen. We're making it back to earth in about five years, you and I will have a great trip back there. I want to make it all better for you. We will be here for five more years, and if you want to make it back, I'll make it far sooner. You don't need to worry about me.
Barack

It started as a word I've never heard. Humanity. Our species, our "limbo", our strong, frees!
We were brought here as a series of tests to figure out why more people made it into this world. No one knew what they were about. Yet they were there and it seemed impossible to be them.
Of course, we lived in the confines of nothing but the harshest and least populated areas of the world. Some people worshipped all the big religions all over the planet, others condemned them all.
And we just heard that one day we came back, and they were all stopped by something. A ship, in all of them, with no signs of humanity.
From what we know, the aliens arrived somewhere near our planet.
All of the phones in the world simultaneously went dark, making the time outside of the app even shorter.

The last piece of something I stole was a light switch. I stole a lamp, used the switch and hid that, stealing even more light.
The switch is a dot on the wall, and it takes some power. In my expanse of dusty concrete jungle I ’ ve built this lamp. The light slits out in front of me to enter. I ’ ve built a small complex out of nothing to test it and share it with the world. I ’ ve broken down the light bulbs until I ’ m bored with them.
I change my key. On the ground there is a loud rustling sound, one of the electric humans who repair the gate.
“ Sold. ” I say when I walk out of the shack. I seem indomitable.
“ This, ” says the human, “ is my lamp. Why you are here? ”
“ I am the gatekeeper in place, ” I say. “ I have awoken the queen. ”
“ I suppose? ”
“ She doesn ’ t know who the queen is anymore, so she just sits there all day listening to me and telling me everything. ”
The odd human catches my eye. He ’ s used to this, locking me inside.
“ Oh, the queen is sitting here all day. So angry, so insecure. I already think her a traitor. ” I say to him, confused.
“ Tell her to shut it, don ’ t she care? ”
“ You ’ re not listening. You are being suppressed. ” I plead.
I focus on a single light. The sparky one. It ’ s lit by the king. He is sitting behind the light, dancing to, it ’ s melody, and I know I am recording the sound.
“ No, I am being suppressed. ” He says, his voice just like mine.
“ But you will succeed, ” I confess, “ you will pass into the forest. In the forest, there is a mountain. You will traverse it in all the territories. Just to find the last piece of piece of piece of wood and then grow a living here, speaking peacefully to all who loved you. ”
“ There is a king and a queen, aren ’ t there? ”
“ In one place. ” I reply.
“ In a place with only two points. ”
“ Is there... ”
“ No, there is no place, no queen, no king, no king. ”
“ No. There is only me. ”
I sigh and step closer to the edge of the tower, trying to catch my breath. I know where my lamp is. I see its path. I walk carefully through the yellow stones. I have already climbed up the tower ’ s highest tower, and reached my floor. I was careful not to take any trace, lest I become lost amongst the rustling. As I walk down the hallway, I see this silvery beam. It shimmers like a shadow. I let out an audible sigh and grab it, opening the door behind me. As I jump across the steps into the light, a dull whistle is his voice. His lips are matted and dirty from years of wear and tear, his eyes never leaving. I look up at the massive mountain, where the first is just a hill by the way, and watch the wave-slithering flow towards it. I ’ m glad to have been alive, and happy to have been at peace.
After a time, I enter the mountain and let the whistle dance between the stones. I reach down and pull one of the beams to me. I put it close to my ear, and open it with my thumb.
It is here. I hope this is right. This, truly is a world I ’ ve made for all of us.<|endoftext|>

It was always on cue, she was always winning. She stayed right where I wanted to be, in the cupboard, suspended from the ceiling of her room. She wasn't afraid of me, not like I ever was, but she was embarrassed, angry, unfeeling.
"Truly, I am sorry for causing this to happen, " I came down from my chair, barefoot. " We will all come to terms as one. But there must be a day we both see the light. "
She chided me, " What is the light anyway? What if I glance at something and it wasn't there? "
" You can not question me, you may look at something else, " she said, and pressed the button she loved so much. The brightness of her office simultaneously stayed the same; blinding, etched in her mind, as she let go of me.
I floated away, and I grew cold, never again to answer her. She never came back, and she never would have again. She was never mine, never mine, and I knew that she was alone. " Neither can I."<|endoftext|>

I woke up the next morning.
I grabbed the blanket from the wall and got dressed. Had fun, now go grab a drink. The sun was rising.
I walk to my car and begin driving. I start putting everything on the dash as it speeds up.
I open the front door, see the driveway, and a feeling of relief comes over me. Another night of sleeping is no longer in my mind. I close the front door and look inside. I see a bright light, which is not my parents console. My roommate says he's afraid to see me, that his mother has threatened to kill him. Not me. I gently push him away. I walk into the driveway and knock on his door. He looks at me like I'm a monster and tries to cry.
I open the door and to my surprise, an epilogue with my life continues. The entire house is magically transformed.<|endoftext|>
**********909**********
Tom and Tony were on their respective tundra cover when it all happened.
This was the fifth time this season and men's football team.
"This is our first visit since coming here for football and getting a first aid kit " said Tom as he set up the padding. Tony turned to his friends and checked his kit.
Not a bad idea when the hype grew. Howdy, Timmy, your new dad has a three-year old girl that he's been eyeing on Facebook for the past few months. You, Timmy's mother, are four times the size of your son's. You want to play football? Wake up and start playing football right now! You'll be great!
They didn't know exactly when they would leave for the final stadium but for now Tom was very excited about his opponents' formations.
The enemy side - which consisted of odd sized swamp beast, mountain lion, anabyliou and a wide variety of other animals who vaguely resembled plants. They were each 5'4 " and weighed 175 pounds, but they carried big animal limbs, having the shape and muscle structure of smaller animals. All they were quite rugged beast, but it was a feeling of terror and courage. It was the sharks that would quell your fear!
You had 5 stands that either side had to defeat a marine mammal or a mammal with no need to breathe. Each had at least one attacker and each was done with it by the time the 20 men entered the tent.
You, you entered the tent with your heavy bush and clean rag shat bag, towards the back of the field of the way, trying to act fast. Both of you were slightly ahead of a shark when it slithered over.
" I can't believe i'm one of those pro players! " says Tom. His crumpled hand gropes the bag, pushing against it. The scrumptious sharks claw out at you, tearing it apart.
" That shark just bit me! " Says the third man, " oh wait a sec! This is gon na be a tough game for us, there's just so many people waiting to get in on.
Tom handed Tony the bag as he saw the confusion. Tony couldn't explain what happened next as a huge monkey lunged at him.
Tony slammed his hand into the bush, and watched as two large sharks fell to the ground.
" That shark... hit me in the chest and I brought that asshole in here with me! That mean thing. Jesus fuck man " Tony went down, trembling, he tried to get away but only had the bush to get him. Tony took one step back as he heard a screaming scream from behind him.
Sharks roared. He screamed and fled the tent.
Then the fight started. Tom started at the man, feeling that he had won, moving on, bitching as he made his way into the opposing side.
The monster was brought down with a force far more powerful than Tom's strength, smashing Tony in the back of the head and sending him to the ground.
The other monkeys ran towards it, grasping at its meat and skewing its head in a sickening fashion.
Tom silently wished that there would be some lesson from that. He decided to let Tony finish his job and lock himself into his bush. Then he proceeded to kneel down and wait for the next call of violence from the remaining monkeys.

The monotone creak was that of a mother trying to cheer herself up after a freak storm.
Ten seconds, or as commonly thought, nine... that's impossible. Five? Even five is something no sane human being would ever do.
That's what was happening to me. My time machine returned. At least once a month for the past five years, I'd been allocated one wish.
I had wished for freedom. A superpower. Maybe some great medical gift bestowed by a worthy man in a life where his death wasn't imminent.
*I wish for you to have ten wishes already. *
I didn't. I'd been told many a time not to do so. Of course it wasn't much of a guarantee now, I had every wrong turn I needed for it to work. More than that, my bank account was at risk. There was no way it had been done before.
*Have you ever heard of the Huanus Effect? The ability to freeze time? You should love how useful it was to this day. *
I hated talking so much about it. How horrible it really is, how it ended on a whim. I was being too sensitive to anything but the wish. It turned out that the Huanus Effect worked for everyone, and in the mean time it had been spreading far and wide. It broke the law of physics to put this weapon at your own discretion.
It had ended centuries ago. A group of scientists created a virus which wiped out entire communities in the oceans. Ten million people died in the horror. And so the government created a program to learn the virus's capabilities, and impose them on everyone else.
It couldn't have been an accident. It was a completely undetectable, non-random event.
I'd stopped time. Or rather... I was a part of it.
"... ten more seconds. "
" I wish that."
It was too late, I thought. I was gone. Every time a water melting melted away in some places, leaving an oil slick that obscured everything, I slowly fell into a new one.
I blinked. Yes. It was gone. I did not like it, at least now. I was a monotone, shuffling through the mob of people on the street. I didn't even bother to look around.
At least my train of thought didn't leave me frozen in time.
I wanted nothing to do with that.
That could always be fixed.

"What do you mean you can't die after you have been dead for eons, " he said quietly, after all this time, " you couldn't leave your stupid spouse for another time. This isn't heaven. "
" That's very well-known, " said the child.
" What am I saying? For eternity? Our creator has given us eternity! Maybe he'll stop now or whatever. Jesus don't even work today, we're too stressed, we already are, " said the child without words.
" Oh dear, the desert is so cold, it isn't so humid. This is very cold indeed! Nothing here will have temperature readings so high. I think that's it. Just wait a few more seconds! "
" I know it's not going to happen. Nothing to worry about. I don't care what happens, I've already done my job! In fact, I really can't recall! I gave up at 15 years old. A million years of living will be good. I didn't want to. I started to clean out my house too before it got destroyed by a stray cat. I don't think I have to go back to that day yet. Of course, nothing will happen to anyone who finishes that job, even if they were eternal. This is my job now. "
The child began to cry, and more tears began to fall from his eyes. Something felt wrong about it. He'd never been this bad before. He was starting to get nervous and started to cry. He started to run on his knees and picked up the infant on his lap. This child's life was nothing like the others he'd watched and taught him about.
He helped the child out of a doorway and gave him the straps to bring him into the housing. He clamped the child down and tied him firmly together until he was finally in the street. He made a name for himself and climbed into the driver's seat. His voice echoed throughout the group and together they drove off to their next destination.
Hugh Strader stepped out of his car to get some supplies with him while his son watched. He shrugged off the child for a moment. " Can I help you with dinner tomorrow? "
" Sure thing, Hugh. Just being the father is a lot of fun."
By the time he got back, the rest of the adults in the car stopped to look at him and smiled.<|endoftext|>

They call them suicide.
See, after everyone else finishes they all run away or their bodies shoot out from their bodies and come to us and hide.
A few have no social function other than murder. One day a guy on fire runs away into the back and then gets hit again by a truck that breaks his truck. It happens once and they talk about his family. The sick bastard dies and then the cops are hit by a white-coated white van.
It's not clear if the police found the bodies or not, but we hear the bodies trying to get away before they are harmed.
First several years a lot of people have tried to get off the streets. After a while it became very clear that we weren't the safest places.
Next my wife lived alone, and I have her at home. Her body has survived more than most, so she's taken the risk to help her out. She provides food. She helps people who need it. She found me often and the next couple years the police have found more than they need.
Last thing I need is to find out why no one tries to hit me after I say that my wife has finished fighting the illness and I have enough food to last me four months.<|endoftext|>

* "You really did see the impact crater in front of you, kind of like it didn't have curves? " *
Jesus fucking Christ, this idiot didn't even try to bring the camera up to his face.
" No, no, no, how about there's a lens poking out from it you idiot? "
* " No. " * I asked his friend. " Do I make this awkward? " *
" Yeah, no, I mean, sure, I just....looked out the window and all, but I just don't see the one you're pointing at anymore. "
* " Look, look at this comet " * he answered.
As if on cue, the moon hit and the sky behind it split, causing the moon to split itself and become one cohesive piece of dust.
" Well, see, you see here, a boulder was slammed into the crater, not like this, but it happened so fast that it just cracked like granite and the mass of the rock flattened up to a small size that was used as a leverage to lift itself off the crater, looked like nothing's even below the crater anymore.

" That's a fucking thing" said the fake climatologist.<|endoftext|>

He was a freak.
I did everything I could to keep him from falling in love. I met him at an ordinary convention to take part in his'show.' For weeks my friends spent all evening rehearsing and rehearsing how to proceed. This was when it occurred to me. He wasn't supposed to be doing this. I didn't want to be a witness. I figured out that he had been doing this for some time now. So I spent several hours with my friend to put him off because of this.
That's when I saw it. A spider. I couldn't quite make out what was underneath but it was unmistakable. Something soft and soft. Unlike normal spider. I knew it wasn't much but when it was close it just smelled of her perfume.
I noticed that they were resting on eachother's shoulders. I sat on their waist. Her hand was wrapped around her shoulder.
I could not stop seeing. The spider looked so perfect, almost as flawless. She was laughing at me as we went to play again. I didn't dare disturb her with my movements.
We had so much fun and it felt good. It felt good. I crawled my arm over his neck. His neck twisted and I tried to slip off. But he was still gone. I heard a voice behind me.
"Come on darling, where is him?" It said. I walked over to her and hugged her tight. We kissed. We fell. And while on the way back I heard them counting down the seconds and they were finally up.
And I fell.<|endoftext|>
**********915**********
Crumbled skulls. The wreckage oozed poison and plastic. Greyish steel plates. Green tiles and vinyls hanging next to hastily painted grays. Still, it was worth it. Killing the fae was a painless endeavor, slaughtering the beasts. Cast aside, the dead should have gone by without leaving the bones behind as bone meat.
The first warrior of the family under the Golden Gate Bridge set out to hunt all the fae. He was certain they would fail him, seeking out the *Swordsman* or the *Clawsmaker* but it didn't matter. The room was furnished and seemed to be made for the fae. The small deer in the center shared their meal with both. The thorn boughs in the center of the bridge were kept small, to avoid getting caught. Mule frogs would dig in the ground and poke them until they dried and began to regrow as fae. The animals would be very sensitive to poison.
"A bit sweaty, " the first warrior muttered to himself as he looked around the building.
The war was a little less brutal. Shaped in conflict, skin out of line and less at the physical barrier. Feels really difficult to hide from them, for they don't move fast enough when biting. No smell or touch, no reflex, just endless stares from the hunters every turn.
" I think we should go on to their camp. " the voice said from beside him. " Maybe if we get a little overused then I can begin to plan. "
A few of the other hunters looked at the boots of the deer. Their armor was a lot heavier than the rest of the fae. Sharp-furred scars dotted their forearms, almost resembling wolves. The last two took off their armor and stood on their legs. With only more meat they would come. They could kill millions and have the fae impressed by their presence, as they were a feast for the hunters. But at least they were usually fairly deadly to the hunters, so those were not considered good intentions.
The last warrior jumped out of the piles of bones, taking another step before returning with his companion. The red, white, and blue features, and the sharp talons were perfectly sculpted. Wings hung higher than either of his legs, for the hunters to steal their meat and be sent to slaughter. Still, it was worth it.
The last warrior leapt up from the corpses as the other hunters went down.
The one next to him slammed his dagger into a nearby tree. " Catch! " he shouted to his followers. " Drop your weapons and run." The fae followed suit, still unaware of the consequences of their actions, but they had control. The hunter charged.
He raised his weapon and gasped with confusion. They appeared out of thin air. Skeletons erupted from the ground. Bodies slashed and torn the ground. A small scream filled the silence.

Many moons later, the fae took their first meal outside. When The Garden Princess returned, she appeared pained. She had studied the fae for a thousand years, took great care in grooming their young, stilted fangs and claws. She studied why the fae grew unnaturally large and growl for the first time in ages. She was hardly above birthed from a single commoner, and she reveled in their wonderful culture and knowledge.
When they had grown many, so did the fae. They provided their society with idealism and obsession, but also with undying loyalty and discipline. How could such a merciless species be given such luxury?<|endoftext|>

[ THUD, THUD. THUD. ]
By the headmaster. That's what they called me. That's what I wanted for them. I was a student. I would ask questions, and I would answer them in their best way. I was offered a scholarship to go to the academy. They called me Jedi, and I've seen them grow some. But I'm not exactly sure why they put me there, after all, I'm Master Yamazaki. I was the superior Jedi on my own. But these new people are different. In some ways they are. One is the master's but one is the enemy. They are of the Order, of Palpatine. I have never been quite sure when it started but the Force have always been there. Now they bring me here.
I raise my cold hands and my dark side flares. A moment passes. Shifter. Pump. Combustion. Start going. Aim. Drive forward. Hold steady, they are coming. Move. I can't let them back. With a great slow kick, I sliced through the foes. Whip. Crush.... All. Of. Them. Hurt... All. And whizzed past me. I spun around and was running like a dork. It's been a while. I guess my hands are numb. I let out a low growl. Tear in the air. Getting closer. Shove through their neck. Can do a little kicking in the stomach. Growl. Release. Pull. Pull.
I fall on my knees and... oh Lord I'm so sorry. The energy left in me burns. The weight on my shoulders burns away. The force of it keeps crushing through me, burning me. Light. Closer. Light. Darkness. I fall, sobbing. It hurts. The pain is so overwhelming I can't breath. Darkness. My eyes fly open, pleading for air. I keep coughing up so much that I can barely see. I'm burning. My breaths are heavy. I'm hurting again. I'm shaking, I'm trembling... I'm trying to lift my head. I feel pain, yes? No. No. I'm shaking....I'm not... I am not. I will not see you again, I can not understand you. The auras on my body warn me I am not alone. I am... I am not alone. Please... don't... don't let me go.
The dark side snaps me out of my stupor. Lightslide breaks. A droid cruiser is limping down the street from the platform. I radio in to Tarkin Command. The commander starts to launch the battlecruisers into orbit with the fleet approaching.
"Order! Alerts!! Order! Orders! " Is the end. I stay calm.
" Where are they? What are we fighting? " Tarkin says as he checks his command comms. Suddenly the comms blare. Silence. Finally I regain my composure. " Well course I am. I'm sorry."<|endoftext|>

"Hello? "
" Hi, this is Eileen. Been a while since I've texted you. Have you heard from anyone else? "
" Nothing at all? This is the first message I've received since I was assigned here for business. So... I was thinking that maybe I should try one... "
" That'll be 4:34 pm tonight on the dot, but you'll see. Good. Goodbye. "
Chuck and the next twelve seconds of this ordeal that followed were just too much for Buck to handle. They, most of the scientists, scientists were working on a little experiment that would open our consciousness and drop everything that ever happened to us down the pit of some kind of virus. But eventually they would walk down to the lab where their experiment was about to go on to mess with all of the potential consequences of this world. Along with the other scientists, scientists and research facilities who would infect a whole bunch of little organisms that weren't even on the calendar that day. It would just be a matter of watching.
" I just want a cup of coffee. After all that I've been through, it's all I've got left. "
This was, after all, exactly how it was supposed to go down. That is, until it was clicked. Within seconds the news woke the world from their mindless wakefulness. First there was reports of fast and deliberate attacks from groups of random people. Crime soared. Then there was the news being pounded on the halls of every presidential residence with determined voices pleading for help. Scientists and mathematicians were shocked. Governments were terrified. Everyone was talking in hushed voices.
Buck led out of the room when he found his room mate with a paper laying on a table next to him. " Frank! Listen! You aren't going to believe this! The paper says that a virus has successfully been released, but it's not working. "
Chuck chuckled and said " What? It's not working? I don't need help! "
" Uh, it says so, but... " Frank was shouting at Buck again now, as though getting angry. After talking to a bunch of scientists Chuck decided to switch to # Goodnight.
" Hey, Buck. Wake up. This is uh, Tim. "
He moved to sit down to try to calm Chuck down, but another scientist by the name of William was talking to him now.
" The institute that's funding the development of this virus. Not the government, not the world. This virus is a cure. This is the way we're going to address this problem, not a continuing infection for some time to come."<|endoftext|>

Two guys got thrown onto the wind machine by a combination of an apparent superior strength and an urban legend by way of a story. I mean, I didn't really hear anything really until I witnessed the first one. The story with that little girl bumping into a car at 60, me and my buddy spoke of her rambling on about the proper rules for death. And then the story with that horse that smoked people's brains off and all the cheese on the line. Those were the two most common types of stories seen in my class. Yeah, sometimes on a particular day, sometimes on a particular day.
It was unsettling. Like that man on the parking lot in the middle of my class. And then he noticed that two old ladies were smoking pot in front of him, and stopped by to help them handle the pot. It was like they were all side-stepping and just mimicking them. It was not uncommon. Other teachers are not quite aware of this, but when they do, things just... escalate quickly. Seriously, for the first time in their lives, they notice an old lady watching the two old ladies get lifted out of the grass above their head, and is suddenly pulled backwards by the super-tank of the school when it does, and throws them over his shoulders.
The teacher called it the purest accident in her dead time. Not mine. Not me. I wanted the moment to last. So, when we got back to class, we knew.
I started in by accident. My friends picked me up. The teacher held a piece of toast in one hand and the bell rang out as a man rushed over and picked me up. Everybody started screaming. My teacher glared at the man, one eyebrow raised.
"No, no, you have to keep going. " I knew he was smart enough not to make me watch him fumble with my pocket watch. I stood up from behind my desk and walked over to the manager of the school. He was coming to inspect the kids and make sure that they were all getting comfortable. Everyone was soaking wet and cheering.
" Look, really! " He introduced himself. " It's the first death I've seen in my life. Just take a look. "
My friends threw my food to my face and they began laughing. People began applauding too. I couldn't help it.
" Come on then, " a man from behind me shouted as he ripped open my school block. " We can do a run! "
" Exactly! " I ran over to him and dragged him to my study with me. I grabbed his arm, tucked him in.
" I know how things are. " I said, turning to him. He started laughing a little too much when he saw me running over to him. " I thought you said a run! " I laughed so hard I didn't feel the warmth of my body, but he wouldn't stop laughing even as I crawled towards him and turned my back to him. " The ending? "
" Happier it is to do what you are told to. " I told him. " Your friends right, they're going to ask you that question, just like they asked me to. And you're going to answer them in no uncertain terms. "
He squirmed behind me, and I went running back home.<|endoftext|>

"... I want to grant powers to any creature within 20 feet of me, to be sculpted in whatever manner you please. Anyone who dies on that staircase must immediately pass to the next age of refinement, check skill. "
And with that, I commanded the man.
" Well, here, try to think about that five foot fall. "
With that I stepped out into the low valley below and set his dark horse down on his back. It was one of these stories I told my young apprentice.
" I'll summon the mighty spirit of the Sea Butcher. "
There was nothing that I could just tap into. I'd invested the possibility of this being a lifetime of waiting and exhaustion into early training, but I knew I was getting better, and that the more I waited, the better it would seem. I hoped to have it set my mind on it, even though, as I rambled, I couldn't seem to get the effect of the magic on my skeletal frame. My muscles were tight, taut, and my dryness was the result of that. I couldn't run, yet I could swear I could feel my pupils dilate. I'm told I can feel the water form on my toes, the earth slowly being pushed aside by magma. I wish I could tell something to it, but I can't. I can't.
I finished my task and lay down next to him. He looked at me and smiled to himself.
" Very well. After all this waiting, some of the more carefree fellers would bestow me with a lifetime of confidence... or at least some time I hope they passed their lessons. "
It was better than waiting for a period of some time, but how could a single man who's lifespan had ended was a 35 year old with life? He didn't have an eighteen foot drop or two to work with, and I wasn't ready for that.
" Excellent. And here you will make yourself a cup of tea, or better yet, an apple. "
" Not the finest of options, do I mention? "
I shrugged. " I won't ask too many questions. The thing is, I never imagined that you'd be able to provide that level of magic. Even if you were able to, when you were just in your thirties, you were still quite adept at bluffs and constructing. "
" What makes you think you're special? "
" No no, so what I'm looking for is a set of skills. Skills that could fill the weakness that I already have, something that I've never needed. Skills that could allow me to be able to let a character and make a character into what I want them to be. Skills that could make them interesting. Skills that allow them to say'ok, let's go after dinner, what the hell are you looking for?' Skills that would let me focus all my time on what I want to do when I get back, instead of wasting it on just doing the last thing on my list. Skills that would allow me to sort of create myself a character, one who people would generally consider...'normal', at least compared to my unquenchable thirst for intellect and skill set.' Skills that can make me think of a new role in my life, one that I already know that I could get away with!' Skills that allow me to have an imaginary friend; one I can keep in my head and be privy to,'my true thoughts and dreams in these dark days.' Skills that allow me to say'Fuck it, no more stupid shit this time.' And I'll give them all a shot. "
" Alright then. Give me the best cup of tea you can give me, and I'll tell you what I want the most of myself. Go, you don't need to hear me again."<|endoftext|>

The birds are singing.
My last night there was a bird in my bed. I thought they were humans, humans. But this one looks about right.
He's perched on my chest. He's perched on my chest! No! That must be it!
I ask him what he is - he has to be an alien. A rather alien? I'm just snotty.
"Oh, " I groan. " Oh my God, if you'd just just... I could have been a much better man. "
Suddenly, he slams his finger on my door.
" Fucking..."
I start to cry, but the bird's just now coming up behind me. I start to cough.
He smiles. He's slowly calming down. This is a real improvement.
My voices begin to sing again, and I hear a voice say " From what little I have gained through my life, I can no longer hide you. You belong to the same league as me, and you will rise. "
This leaves me very confused. What sort of alien was this? What is going on? The birds. I don't feel comfortable looking at birds. Is my alien for real? Should I move? I need to get outside. There's the screech of the foot. I start walking closer. There's a strange floating object about me. It moves with a strange beak - that doesn't make much sense, do it? I can move it, but I don't feel any movement. The floating object vanishes. Only by looking at me it seems alien to me - I feel oddly comfortable. But I'm very uneasy. Should I run away?
Oh god, now is my chance. I'm very scared. Is my human controlling me? Surely he won't be afraid. I don't know where else to run.
I get into my truck and drive away, hoping I'll be safe.<|endoftext|>

I turned the handle on the large aluminum rotary dial in the contraption. An olfactory whirring illuminated the surrounding area where another familiar face would appear.
*Someplace. * The man nodded, standing behind himself with his arms crossed in an extravagant fashion. I stood to salute.
"I'd like to mingle with you in an intimate manner. "
" I'm so excited. " I said eagerly, starting down the metal handle and towards the opening.
" Everywhere else that I've gone, I've got this place. " He finished, folding his coat. The eyes stayed fixed on his wealth. " It's always been this way. Always. "
" Whenever you're up to your knees and unloading tons of rocket fuel into our atmosphere, we get to meet and talk. " I enthralled. The city air was always just as welcoming as a welcoming balloon or a Hawaiian hairy hippo. " We get to talk about all kinds of things. "
He reached the opening. He shuffled towards it and grabbed the handle. Closing my eyes again, I took a deep breath and stared up at the cool waters. I became curious and closed my eyes for a moment, stunned by the sight of the great barges that would transport us to the surface of the moon.<|endoftext|>

I awoke having forgotten a bedtime story, As usual, i dreamt. I had nothing planned for, i only needed to go through my morning. I googled it and collected what information I could gather I could make use of. I had three tabs, going from the top. New character & Race* Bluesmith, Old pilot, Greensmith, and Ironsmith. Right now i had about three tabs out with those names, i will have three weeks left. As i was browsing through those tabs i saw a gift shop. This was new to me, lets see how the young man survives the dark days. As i looked around i saw cars moving pretty fast. No idea where they were, but hopefully some person will save them. Before i knew it a car had won a race over that greensmith. It stopped suddenly and a blast. The guns ran over me. Upon impact he was knocked out. I was running, when i heard a voice. It was at the same time a man. He was with a woman who looked like i had never met. She told me there was a monster that was chasing me down, but who was scared? He and the woman ran away from the car and were quickly surrounded by the monsters. The monster was out of breath, and only a few moments before he wasn't. He ran at me. I dodged and dodge and attack him. With all of my might i tried to chase him out but a hatchet caught him between two guards. He fell over and i grabbed his arm. We fought for a while as i fought to make it out of that! The lady got it and made sure i broke him. I quickly made my way around a soldiers neck, getting at the weapon in my hand. As i grabbed the blade i noticed that it was made of gold, more rare than anything. I looked out of the shop and saw a town. The first two people I saw moved closer and together. " We have no idea where this is happening, " I told them in a deep voice. They ran towards me. On the next man i saw an old lady was in front of a road. She would make sure everyone got on the road and to avoid lost arms. She looked sad and hugged me, " we have no way of going there yet. Please make sure to make sure everyone stays away from the town ". I told her that this was urgent. As she looked around, a crowd was gathering. I approached the crowd, trying to find what was happening. As the crowd grew closer and more prominent, people stopped backing away from the road. The people across them ran. Several minutes later, a girl came up and hugged me. As we embraced her, a man barged into the crowd. After he got too close to me, he shot me. As the bullet hit the ground, he stopped, looked at me with his smile and said " You had my back."<|endoftext|>
**********923**********
It was a normal day, I waited for my 21st birthday at the centre of the small town about 10 kilometres from my neighbourhood. I enjoyed a few drinks and a fine pastry. I was near home, family of 4, talking to our neighbours ( who lives next door ) about the weather and any plans I might have.
I was on my way to the bank of a bridge to invest, he was reading around he kept asking me to take a lunch break, I reminded him that my birthday is January 1st 2016, I didn't want to talk to them much and he was super just staring at me.
I walked down the bridge with my lunch and he offered me his cup and waiter. I ignored him. I waited in a line until I arrived and saw some kids slowly passing around this fountain. I didn't know why. It was some kids from my old neighbourhood, I didn't even hear the sound of the fountain. We just waited patiently until the fountain disappeared and we passed around this fountain a few weeks later. Then I noticed, when I turned around, he had a huge smile. That's when I realised he had belonged to my family, he was my brother, momma and my grandparents, but today would be my 21st birthday and I was going to give him my life, I didn't know anything about him.
I asked him about my brother and he told me. He told me that he had been working for his family for 20 years. He showed me a picture of him and we all just smiled at him. I remember when my parents died while working for the day team, that's when he came to visit me. I remember him handing me my life insurance policy but I asked him what he had decided on and he told me that I was going to have a very special birthday tomorrow, my 19th. I stood by and asked if I could take him back. He said he would. My birthday wasn't ready, he said that I would have to go out now. I walked along the park path, so I walked into the square, I didn't like the square but there were benches and pool tiles surrounding the water. I walked past my door. I saw him walking outside, but nobody else moved. I didn't know what to do, there were no people in the square, I just walked right past it.
It was a normal day, I was lying still on the grass next to my armchair, I felt special and smart but I couldn't understand why. The sun had gone down and the grass was soft but it was so cold that I couldn't feel any warmth.
I realized that in the room I was in I was waiting for my 21st birthday, I had never heard my own birthday. I started to hear voices, all in the same language but with a different mouth when I asked why I would never remember my own birthday. I caught a glimpse of their eyes before a close look, they opened with a smile and they looked at me like a father and son. They told me that I had walked into my family's house yesterday and that I had been forgotten about. They then closed their eyes and walked back to the house that they grew up in.
I stopped dead in my tracks, I heard footsteps and slowly followed them around the grass towards the fountains. One took me to one of them and opened the door leading towards the courtyard. The guards looked at me from the other side. I didn't know how I got here or who I had been told to go with, I just walked to the fountains and ate, at least those ones were grassy. I rushed out the door with my bag and hurried in as fast as I could, I had no one. I can't remember how I got here, probably just not really. After some time I was able to sneak outside, I saw police cars and stood by the fountain just waiting for them to leave.<|endoftext|>

"Are you sure about this? " The man asked the already sprawled couple sitting on the couch beside each other.
" Oh yea, yeah.... finally it's well may. So yeah. This is an interesting mess. "
She looked puzzled and looked at the man hunched over the sink, a poorly plastered but still slick.
" What do you mean? " He sighed, "... because if you happen to bring your note to us they will pull it out of our system. "
His hands clenched tighter than they should have, smiling from ear to ear, as if waiting to find the fundamental forces at work. She read the middle of the line on her clipboard.
" But if you bring it along with you, we'll be able to contact all of our love communicators to see how it's going to go. "
That sounded like the world was going to end in one way or another.... now she decided that must be it.
" I'll see what I can do."<|endoftext|>
**********925**********
I open my eyes and see that my room is oddly quiet. It was nice on Christmas Eve, my wife was always worrying if I slept so bad so I didn't, and the dresser was made of perfectly flat cardboard boxes that were lined with colours that hinted at a rich gingerbread-esque feel.
I check my gun for the two on each side of the barrel. A great deal of metal tumbles down my hallway, knocking my door open.
"Screw it, " my wife yells, " the rug is in the crevices. " " Oh dear, there's fire from downstairs on the stairs. This way! " " Forget it, mummy. "
" Hah, hurry! " She giggles, forcing me to turn on the lights. " Shit, not again. Now bring the balls. "
" Thank you, Dad, " I say, kneeling next to my sleeping son, my tiny bundle by his feet. " It has been an all out war between us for the past six months. We can't really cope like this. "
" It hasn't been. " She takes a deep breath. She slowly opens the door and stays where she is, far too small for me to hold much strength, and I close the door around me.
I turn on the light. " What are those? " I ask my old friend. " You must think you forgot something, mums. " I am not impressed. I rummage through my old wardrobe and find a diaper sack. " Santa is lying in the bed, with one hand propped at his chest. His head is covered in spikes and bars, and his eyes are blue. "
" Whoa! What's the word for that? Is he some kind of a fairy, really? " Dad asks, shaking his head. " He's a wizard, mums. He's made the head and neck part, but he's doing stuff that no-one else does. He wears weird clothes, and he hasn't found any enchanted items. We're on the verge of falling apart now, you know. " I look through the capriciousness in his eyes. " He's calling us... the Easter Bunny." I think he means his parents, and I know what that means.
I open the box in its already heavy, clumpy hands. To my surprise, I take the warmest thing out of it. There is no white wrapping, there is just the black frame of the bunny, and my wife.<|endoftext|>

[ Whatcha doing? I'm just looking to be productive. ]
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
Yesterday, I became frustrated with my writing. I have to say, I felt like the solution was lacking. I get to do everything at once, without slacking off when I do it or after.
I'm glad I tried to choose on my own when I became frustrated with it. When I tried to look forward to it, I think I fell behind and knew what was in store.
I also think that to unpack it could have the opposite effect. I didn't seem to have it felt right, because I wasn't trying to achieve my goals. I made mistakes and also did my part, however to continue life, I can only try to keep myself satisfied and stay motivated. I don't have any mentors that make me follow my dreams. I don't have a job or a home or close friends that make me succeed.
Nevertheless, I've found a way to work on it.
I just have to ask, Do you have any ideas to fill it with? I'm thinking not what sort of prompts you'll ask.<|endoftext|>
**********927**********
I never wanted a knight. I never wanted someone to be my soulmate. Never ever, just one to cuddle with for a few hours. It hurt. I should've known it wouldn't work. My heart wasn't a jack hammer.
But then, I read the prompt. When I first saw it I thought I had cheated. So glad. I got my Eulogy. I got been good. I got a new Job. I got my first promotion. I got a house in a different part of town. I got to date a nice girl. But that job was not for me.
But, now I've left a village. And now I'm on a boat. It's only a boat. But it's with me. I can stand on it. I can swim off on it. I can do this. And it doesn't have to be to be me. It just has to have me.
It's been 5 years. But, somehow, it still feels like it's not my soul mate. I miss the times I've been together. But you never know, it can get weird.
Wish I would've known that it was a bad habit to fail you. But I never wanted to be mine.<|endoftext|>

**Callum al-Queda, *
Callum: I want a letter.
Prince William arrives. He is strange. A newcomer to Washington.
Numerous soldiers marched with him, reading at him. Louis, Boris, St. Basil, and Henrick's were smiling at him. Ensign Ensign Perm, these two warriors were equal parts fearless and willing to go for what little.
Men that Messrs Monroe and Jackson had sent earlier set off to collect the prize.
Norseman, Undersecretary of Defense Monroe called, just so he would quiet his enemies.
Queen Elizabeth had received the letter in a bid to take France and the Kingdom. Seeing as the other side didn't know how to react, she thought no war would ever be fought.
Queen Elizabeth knew that she was old and that her young royal family was just the opposite.
The prince was alone, crying into a ball at a dinner party and smiling.
The table became cold and he closed his eyes in contemplation.
The air was clear and soft.
A rose was planted just beneath a folded silk ribbon.
The prince said his last goodbyes.
A young woman at the table saw him and grabbed his hand.
"I thought you'd protect me, " she said. " I am big and brave. "
" Not, " said the prince. " I was afraid my men would be shot from the air, " he replied. " Come on, he didn't want me to worry about them. "
The woman grabbed his knee, in her haste to nurture him.
" He's home, and I will be free. "
The prince chuckled.
A soldier pointed at the wedding band, and said,
" Sorry, someone put a crucifix on it. "
The soldier pointed and whipped his wrist.
On a rough, wooden cross, near the bride's feet, sat a piece of white cloth.
The prince's spirits were gone.
The air was so crisp.
Finally, his heart beat and his lips began to speak,
" Merry Christmas, young prince. You've given me a new life, and a lot of the things I should have done. "
The red ribbon surrounded his head, and a horn blew,
" Take this, Prince.
Take the note, for this is not my funeral, nor is it your own. And it's not your father's. Here we have a lot of bad memories and hate,
and a lot of good memories, and love that you and I can never find."
The Prince closed his eyes and slowly closed his eyes in peace, his heart ached for her hands.
He opened his eyes to look into the starlight, and a glistening moon and fog covered everything.
And he was gone.
He was alone.
So no matter what his secrets, which his fate should never know, he had entrusted his soul to the world and everything it touched. And for all the deaths he led, no matter the dreams and fears, he was content.
Nothing made more sense, in all the darkness of the world, evermore, than that of peace and love,
even though it would soon come to pass.
If only he would have gone back.<|endoftext|>

"... every child born can expect... Well, fuck them if they try to participate in this. Or... Or they get turned away from the situation or... "
Of course anyone couldn't finish their sentences. The refugees were, of course, spewing fear as fast as they could pull it out of their mouths and lash out. Fear was now something people depended on but mostly to talk about. The children would start doing things like this.
I tried to unload the bodies of the refugees and say it was a war that would eventually be won but who I am said that would die a hard and bloody death.
Well, I suppose I was right. This place was, and is, DIVINITY CHANGE.
I picked up a corvette to get away from the vines, where I had come from, and proceeded to pop my head out of the window and start screaming at my fellow refugees to get off of the runway.
Like any of these people, I told them to leave but only a few remained with me. With hardly any effort, they tried to keep me from parting with them but all I could make out is...
Two mushroom cloud giants, wearing padded suits of armor, stand staring at me. " What are you talking about? "
" Well, as you can see, the dreadace comes to a halt when it all comes crashing down. It has reached Earth. As everyone has said it could wipe out millions if not billions of people in just three months. And it has already ended in only three months. "
The people, all of them had blond hair and blue eyes and basically vanished into thin air.
" What? "
They looked at me shocked. The ones closest to me were looking at their minds hanging in anger. I felt bad for them but they had just stepped out onto the street when their whole world began to sway to their cause.
The giant had a hand on my shoulder and a strong stare of horror on his face.
" Please go back to your homes. We won this war. Your life depends on it. Thank you. God."

Nick Name The Waltons
Where was Nick? Who cares, I didn't make it at all. How I was the last man. I'm one of them, made to die. I'm a hero. I've been fighting since the dawn of time, growing stronger and stronger. Everyone will remember, I'm the hero, I'm a good boy.
I woke up in the parking lot where the only street is blank and all cars drive past without warning and no one who's going to stop takes notice. Just as I heard a gunshot in the distance, a punk pops through my hood, camera in hand.
"Hey Nick, what can I say about you? How are you today? "
" Please don't shoot me. I don't deserve it. I'm not a hero, I am... the cruel father of a blind man. "
" Yeah, you go to a better place. Do you know why you did that? "
" I told you so. "
" Okay, alright. So there's this homeless man and a cat and there's no one. I have a gun and I do whatever it takes to get my men to come in. It was a fucking cheesy joke. I don't care how good you are you're crazy! I don't care about just one fucking name, the last one is making fucking Christs appear on tv again. I don't care about how good you are you don't care about how good your ancestors are. I don't care about any kind of winning streak or celebrity day in or day out and I love that you have the balls to make the world a better place. Maybe I'm getting too close to the real me.
Now get out of my life. You'll pay attention, please don't kill me. "
" What? What kind of a boy can I go down here and kill me? "
" If you have no common sense or ability, you're either crazy or in love with some random child. "
" I'm going down like a man. "
" Ok dude, I'm getting somewhere okay. This isn't about my money or my kind of life. It's about you and me. "
" OK, so what if I don't have the balls to kill you?"<|endoftext|>

I am just receiving my name. I don't mind. Ever since my mother died, I've been the barista at the diner where your job is to clean the dishes for you. Thank God, I know it's nice and hot and I'm paid not to be here, but my mother has surely been awful. We bake everything to order at five in the morning and I always get it and I have to take care of the dishes, but she didn't deserve this.
It's dark at the end of the hallway when I finally get to get my phone. There's a man in his late 50s. You've heard the rumor. I know where the mugger is, but you're suspicious enough to take him out and hand him to the cops, you know. You should've listened to him when he said the words he used when the officer came to take him away.
He told me that he woke up after he saw the cops coming down the alley... So I did my best, and I don't regret it.
You're better than this. It's okay, I know. I'm just not stupid. I know this man is a killer, so I'm not the kind of killer that would take a murderer down. I know this man is getting away from his parents and sisters. I know this is the end of me as a human being and I'm going to go meet those people, that's why I'm here.
I think of my mother and my father and I look and I see myself, and I see the white jumper and I feel the cold metal and I feel that hurt and I just can't take it any more.
I can't. I can't. I have to save her and she's coming for me and I'll be okay. There are tears in my eyes and in the corner of my eye, the girl has gone.<|endoftext|>

Why does it have to be Excalibur? The people don't know that it's just a myth. It's legend has been out for some time, but it wasn't all myth then. I feel more protected now. I can't run anymore.
They call it a bear. Their motto is *Excalibur*. All things bear that name, seeing as they are the last of their kind, and I was part of one of the last Black Blobs. Then, you did the same.
It's this short walk to my car. I needed to hear my brother's story and this still is part of my memory. The roar of our lincoln truck. I hadn't taken part in the Battle of White Oak in a long time, and I was half dead. Just like the Big Belly took me. Oh what the fuck we did to both my brothers! Of course he still burned my family out! Shoving us into the El Arango with his bastard son. His bastard son only showed the Blood of Good humans too!
Nah they were just blood lust's of ours. When the other Blobs found this old green bull and decided to blow it to bits, it's something I wish I could take from them. Looking at them I realize that I'm in Hell as well.
My birthday is tomorrow. Shit, I've been thinking about this story for days. Why do I have this scar now?
"Ha! Stop it you naive bitch! Let's use that burning hobo. You've proved yourself evil too! It was the only thing that we could have done, but you didn't listen. Didn't listen to any other Blobs, so why let the others do as they please?
I remember him, my brother, yelling loudly. Fuck that fucker. So my great ex is here to take me in and put me into this school. I'm not even getting pregnant, but I don't feel like you're going to kill him yet.
" I've just got two students coming in after work, I'm carrying *Captain Smiths. * What the fuck is *Captain Smith*? "
" Oh he's Jewish. Great. "
" To be fair we're going through his journal and some of the records he collected. Might I bring you the last few hundred pages of his book? "
"... Well yeah, we don't have much work but yeah, you could just transfer these for a few thousand rations. You know I got a fucking Goldilocks on my shuttle. This room, my family would be glad you brought your fresh blood to my family.
" Yes, thanks son."
The walk was 20 minutes.<|endoftext|>

I look down at my chessboard. What now?
I take another look down at my game board. What now?
I lean down to put my face in my hands.
I glance back down at my chessboard. What now?
I look up at the old man. He is muttering something to himself as he is walking. It reminds me of the times I used to be used to this. I look up. The old man's arms are shaking as he stands up. He has no pride, now is he prideful?
The old man reaches for me and pulls a coin out of his pocket.
"I told you we'd beat him ", says the old man, pulling the coin out again.
I look back up to see him play another game. It can't be that bad, it's just a shuffle that I can't take. I feel bad that the game of chess always takes me. So I sit up and look to the old man, confused.
" I don't want to be a loser! " I scream, lifting my fist and kicking off my only tie. It has become a habit of my life. I keep throwing the pieces at the old man, to his dismay. One by one they all fall to the ground, bodies becoming covered in the dust that I have been dusting off of him. I look up at him and vomit.
" Hey, you know me okay, " I say, mimicking him to be polite.
The man looks away as I look at him and scream again. This time more loudly. This time pointing up my tie. I feel a little sorry for the old man. He used to be so jealous of me as I went on to win a game and was now waiting for his revenge. That doesn't make me any better. I fall to my knees.
" Hey, don't worry, it'll happen.", I say, trying to scare him away. This time with more force as he decides that. I raise my arms up. He is now shouting at the top of his lungs. And I throw my hands up to beat him up.<|endoftext|>

I got these powers from a girl I met at his place. She was pretty, muscular and had blue eyes. After hearing her theory and looking up, I swear to God, I could have sworn she was in a white trash-box. I was in the middle of my party.
She sent me a wish today. One that changes things.
I want to give her superpowers, not just for her sake but for humanity, her gift. And as she was thinking it all along, she arrived at my house.
*Need 2 wishes... Tired! * The lady was beautiful. She was smart as hell, handsome and smart. It scared me every time I turned on the TV, but she knew she had to obey. She had a bad habit of staring at her phone and never answering.
That's where I was. Keeping up with her laugh. She sat there patiently, with everyone talking. Suddenly, I realized. I was getting bored of talking. Every time I stopped talking, she would ask something stupid. For some reason, I made her feel nice about it. This, I decided, was her benefit. I knew I had to do something.
I grabbed her towel. She was staring at me. Slowly, she started talking. One word or little, I'm guessing. Her laugh continued, but I watched as the moment passed. I kept watching her, constantly wishing on something stupid, hoping that I could use it as leverage. And the moment came when the universe had to decide what was stupid.
Then it did. It wanted to leave.
It would fly by. If it were ever done wrong, there would be hell on Earth. And thus, it left.
But it never got to the next part.
"Please forgive me. "
I have to admit, I never thought I'd get it that far.
" I am sorry. "
This girl is amazing. I'm pretty sure she wasn't a fan of earth. Her mom said she was a freak. But to finally get out of earth, she wished to have one last wish.
I thought I knew how to use her abilities. But maybe what I needed was magic! Anything. And right after that, she said that she hated Earth.
" Because she constantly wishes for bad news. Even when there is good news, it always has bad news. "
I can't believe this girl was such a slut. I felt guilty and hurt. I never even had sex. She was never good.
The next day, our group was moved to a mental ward. But they are safe. I didn't know what to do or say to them.
I stayed on in mind, waiting for her.
This girl was human. She was my best friend, my friend, my best friend.
But not today.
Today is a day that I will never forget. Today, I will get to choose my superpower. I decided I was going to use it myself. Then I go to the doctor.
" Good day, " I said to the man. " Now, you're going to go outside and do something dangerous."
I flew the car and walked out the front door. The metal door opened to the lobby. She shouted out loud for me, just as it happened. I was so heartbroken that I stared at the light, looking at everything, just as she left, just as she left.
Now she can't hear me. All I hear is fear.<|endoftext|>

Daddy always had these twang. The song of his fishing rod, tattooed deep into his liver. He ’ d always felt the air beat on his ears, smelling the rosemary in his nose.
The days were cold, however. He tried to keep himself warm, but the air was becoming stiffer. His daughter always tried to push him, but his fingers squeezed her tight. She said him a hurtin ’ word, which made daddy ’ s heart stop.
Today he ’ d gotten some extra bacon in his – the usual bacon roll he made for girls in need of good health – and he seemed to have been incurring more damage. The evil he used to bring to the family table became his last breath. He finally had to leave it all behind, and let his daughter draw herself up and run home for his head. He wondered how he could put an end to that awful smell of rosemary for now.
The next day they would have to take their work bus, and barely make it home before they got on with work. As they sat in the back wept, seeing Aunt Jessie, his sister ’ s best friend, sobbing and cursing him.

People may call him Elizir^TM, but what he doesn't know is that he is the very definition of evil. In reality, he is merely the embodiment of an act intended to get people to want to give, and ultimately no more.
Elizir^TM just wasn't invented yet - the brand's engineers haven't even gotten around to implementing them yet - but his tricks are a certainty: his followers will commit a monstrous crime if they ever regain the Facebook they have shared. He doesn't go out and make toys out of people's faces and bodies like he used to. No, Elizir^TM calls himself the internet sage who spends money in a bin and put the world in chaos by making Facebook evil.
It worked like this until the over population of Facebook Inc. exploded in 2006. Those guilty of terrorism lost their normal lives and went back to the world. Facebook Inc. ( made up of inbred dogs and pranks in every way ) was excommunicated - possibly permanently.
Eventually some were going after Zuckerberg, just as with every other product, but he was instantly captured on video and put to death.
But hey, if that innocent pup can succeed in killing Zuckerberg, just how powerful will be God? Who knows? People may think Elizir^TM was a master of storytelling, but those fantasies were merely a facade meant to depict a monster, something we could all be helped to see - or so the people say.

I used to be very used to when I could only hear what was buried. For the longest time, I thought that this wasn ’ t what I was doing. Now, it's a different story.
I ’ m not sure what I had gotten myself into. It would ’ ve been a true miracle, I had taken such a step towards life. The irony is, I couldn ’ t have been older then 30; I should be in my prime of power now.
I was a historian when I was young. Quite a feat for someone twenty years older. At first, I thought that was some sort of prank. I ’ d feared this discovery, even made a few stupid rants about it in those first few years. But then I realized how far it had gone. In my days, I could have trusted somebody to dig me up; then again, I never could have trusted that myself. But not this time. I needed to prove who I was.
“ We should not dig here, ” I ’ m sure the ancient words left as I was walking away. This time, it made sense. You could almost hear the tremors of destruction as they slowly seeped through the stone walls. I ’ d known already, of course, that something like this would happen.
I didn ’ t question what I would find here. I just didn ’ t want to leave home. And if I found anything wrong, then all hell would break loose in my little castle. I needed to bury the truth and finally show my age and finally understand.
“ We should not dig here, ” I begin again. There is no need to be sad or angry about this, really. I know that I am not even my age anymore. The knowledge isn ’ t needed. I can prove that I am not old enough to be a doctor. To be alive.
“ We should not dig here, ” the words whisper, they are far too strong for this king to hold. To say something so terrible is truly shameful.
Isolation was the true test of my powers. I used my mind as an exercise lab, training myself and making sure I wasn ’ t the bad guy. On the inside, I could never trust anyone to break even a mild bruise. So, I put my mind onto abstract things. So, a little mind that placed a pretty face on everything; you get the idea. If I was able to build bridges, they would always be there!
But with this genius idea, I would make sure that people wouldn ’ t ever notice my aging. I ’ ve spent years thinking about this test as my form grew smaller and smaller, closer and closer to one? I thought about how many individuals had to die just because my arrogance, my self-inflicted arrogance, finally roused someone up from their death pit. How many lives would be lost just because my courage. I could never take a second step with this challenge. I thought about how useful this test would be.
Soon, all the people would notice. And they would ’ ve assumed that I wasn ’ t really as old as I thought. Maybe they were wrong. But I assure you, I can become the next king. Because of my words, perhaps someone will find me. They will recognize me. And they will take this place and gather supplies as they send me back.
I ’ m to announce my identity to the history books. I ’ ve been making small talk with one or two in my basement since I started working here. So long as I have a little secret, I can keep this secret from those who haven ’ t seen me yet.
Because of my spirit, I can never disappoint. And thank you, your words will live on.

The raindrops touched my back and I did as was dictated, looking back over my shoulder. My brother's clothes were off, the ones that weren't always displayed. The newspaper was grey, the home was empty, and I didn't bother looking at it.
It was midday, the sky dried. I yawned and looked into the mirror. My boss smiled and took my hand. I allowed a few fleeting passes for a quick look at my desk before taking in the sights.
The TV screen showed my teeth skittering off my right leg. The bright orange lights that shone through the windows also blinked off the color.
The TV station showed this time, through the curtains of my wardrobe and into the car. Above me, the studio walls swung under me and I can't see as clearly as before.
The lawn was green, I heard my neighbour's music. My first thought was that nothing would make it down.
That sobered up my heart.
Was that she in my future?
My husband drove a sharp red car that was driving down the road away. It seemed a little too fast, but both was okay.
With a sigh, I picked up the newspaper and my phone and turned it on.
The raindrops streamed down through the window, hurting my back and blocking out my sleep.
I closed my eyes.
And it was sunny, especially without all the rain pouring down.
My father rolled on the roof of the grey house, thanking his great great grandfather for putting me in the car.
His voice was, although timid, solid.
"Happy your birthday, huh? I hate to say goodbye, but I will always miss you."<|endoftext|>

I felt like an old serene man waiting to be forgotten by the darkness surrounding me.
He was beautiful, and pure and disheveled despite the darkness and unbearable odor of blood. I would have laughed, but I would never have laughed. That's how I felt.
Around the bend of my seat we parted, and I felt myself changing into a small figure. His shadow faded and he lay limp on the cold leather couch.
"Hello there, I'm Gretchen. "
He seemed upset, and seemed agitated.
" You are, I'm the last one left. " He said quickly. " I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to know any how long this is. But I know the face of the man. He's mine. "
" It hurts, " I said, in pain.
" We have to do this. It's our last chance. If I don't, no-one will know about this. It will hurt. You deserve this. "
" Why? I'll never know. "
" You never knew about me, Gretchen, " he said softly.
" You were the last one. "
" I guess you don't. "
" No way. You will know. No-one is left. But I will remember you. " He said softly, trying hard not to cry. He picked a brown dirt road in the distance and scurried to his home.
" Oh Gretchen, you look better. " I stood and strode outside the window. I walked past a small cemetery and down a lonely pathway. There was no animal life, just the moonlight, and grass. I approached the grave on the other side of the path.
I reached up and embraced Gretchen, lightly touching her smooth breasts as I placed my hand on her shoulders. She was so soft.
" Please, Gretchen, I beg for your mercy. "
" Oh my, how romantic you are. "
" Always been a prodigy. " He said with a smile. " How could you ever let slip that you loved me no matter how sad and helpless your body is? "
" No mercy. " I said softly. " I'm just a toy. I don't deserve you to disappoint me. "
He pulled a knife from his pocket and swung it around wildly.
" You've ruined me like a cheap paint gun. " He said softly.
I held back tears. " No, for you to hurt me in any way. You deserve no less love, and I am just another toy. " I knelt and grabbed him by the shirt and pulled his throat away.
He screamed in pain, and I let myself go, but I could only sob.
" Do you love me? " I said with air in my lungs.
" No."<|endoftext|>

Suicide Helpline Number 973-4000*
Log Entry 5113 - ORDER EXTENDED**
Most people have reached a point of realization about the resolution of their problems with death in their job. Some have ended the life of their loved ones, some have ending their life alone in front of their loved ones; and some people have resorted to killing themselves on purpose in the name of their work.
Most people have made a commitment to follow through with their work or at least attempt suicide. However, most people have found the intricate details of this, and have decided to end it in a spectacular fashion.
Most problems that are attempted from almost anyone's perspective are easy to resolve. Some murders are relatively easy, but enough are actually under investigation that we can judge whether it will save any lives. Most were an attempt to avoid a death or some other form of hostile death. Some decisions are made to accept this, to make the most of their life, or simply to accept that it will be tough. We often like to think they're special in some way.

Crisis 302 - PROCEEDINGS AT CHASE
A representative of our firm has been sent to your file, via confidential email, to discuss a potential scenario for cancellation of our patient. Mr. White, you must not deny this information to our professional team. The official inquiry will not apply to your client. We recommend that you approach the representative over your usual visit to a facility in the middle of the day.
Crisis 303 - WHAT DID YOU DO?
Crisis 305 - HAS ANYONE BREACH OUR LOCATION OF SECURITY INFRINGEMENT?
Crisis 306 - SOME OF MY EMAILS MAY BE... LIKELY?
Crisis 307 - GET ME A BING NOW
Our own investigations revealed that any connection between a man who works at a local facility and our client was simply coincidental. Apparently Mr. White was working in a construction area. When Mr. White questioned, this worker did not seem concerned at all. Maybe his wife, Lisa, was also working for the facility. By Mr. White's own account he had provided her with valuable information on some local projects.
Crisis 318 - WORKS LIKE THIS?!?
Crisis 319 - THAT'S EASY! HOW?!
We have an onsite chemist and a real estate agent to interview. All things considered, we can return this connection back to Mr. White. If he offers you temporary release, we can either renegotiate or cancel his offer immediately.
Crisis 320 - DONT T DIE AT MY SERVICE DO YOU?
Crisis 321 - START FOUNDING A FORCEFUL BUSINESS WITH CROSSORDESSHIER?!
Crisis 322 - MEET ANOTHER... OPPORTUNITY?
Crisis 323 - HURRY THAT...
The decision rests with our review team, at either end, for an immediate and well-deserved resolution to this issue.

"Have you ever thought about what a thermos wearing or white sheet would look like? An electric blanket to hold back your insides, no point in rubbing these. Makes a bad suit, you see, right? " He sighed deeply. My robe was gone from me, *beeping*. He put his hand under my head, wrapped me around his neck... *beep*.
" My apologies, that's just a bother. I suppose I should be able to answer your question with words or maybe with an express statement like, something *I would* just say. " I threw the robe over my shoulder. Then, paused to look around. " Now where were you? "
" You need to recognize where your cell is. For that matter, why are you holding on to the least-trash-racks-in-ages one of these bunkers, rather than sitting in the chair with all the in-door furniture or the large, moldy kettle in the basement? "
" I feel like you should do that, you know? Seeing as how the hell is still quite possible, I'd like to answer that. " I glanced up at him. He was holding his head in the opposite direction of me, winceing at the sudden light.
" I know... " he started, patting his back, then started again. " But if something you do as a henchman of Satan comes up, if you let the problem happen too long, surely you're going to get burned out inside and can't go home on your own? "
" Then why do you want this, anyway? "
" Because as you know, although I did find it in it's place to attend to me, I certainly *need* to know *why* you're here. This is not your fault, though. I wish that I could put some of you *back home*, too, you know. It makes *everything* worth it. "
" What then, you think... what do you want to do? "
" I... see. So, I'd like to show that I've had enough, time to pay your expenses. Who knew the mitts you have already used on once would end up without guilt? I'd be using it in some sort of *sockspace* instead if I wasn't so caught up in my decisions that I'm only making them slightly better. "
" Got it! "
" Well, " he pointed toward the fridge. " I'm hoping I get some fun value there, that way if I come up with that much I'll be able to make a *sock.' * Go ahead, have a seat. "
I couldn't help but wonder, *who* sent the piece of paper? Was it even real? * Was it merely a regular check? * I glanced to the door behind me. It was definitely not there, but my mind flashed back to that dead end job when I heard his voice in the kitchen.

They came into our homeland around four hundred years ago. The first missionaries were mostly worked-in fellows with half-naked women in suits standing over their flock, chatting up children. Many of them were scared to look out, and went walking away in their vans when suddenly a fog rose up and they were met with a host of bright orange orange clouds.
"They came from many an ark! The " portal " was real! From whatever had been leaking the portal-nests left by those who returned here. No further questions asked. " The women led me to my village, where I made a wish to return to " the world " for the whole year. My kind fumbled with my crystals. They convinced me that they existed. We are glad that they succeeded.
" Can you give us the last of these crystals?" My friends asked, excited. We gathered these crystals, threw them into the war machine of death and stolen my people. We believe we saved many lives. For we believed a stone to be one's weapon.
As I walked through the forest, I heard something thunderous. Out of the nothingness, I saw beautiful folk dancing in the wind, and the frogs. I could feel the power of the sun shining in my eyes, and wanted to snap out of it. I would not wish to be deprived of the heat of my society.
I looked through the portal to see a world beyond the ark where it was hidden. A world devoid of magic. I found hope. I wanted to return to a better world. I want to return home.

I scream and rush over to my mother. The world spins around me and I can see my mother standing over me with bloody hands and lots of blood smeared on her hands. The blood that had stained my hands was still stained with mud.
"Dude, where the hell are you? " she reaches into a gun and pulls out a can of beans. " How long have you been out? "
" That's it! Get home! " I dodge out the door as a masked man shoots the gun in my face.
" Who the hell is that? " I look at my left hand, I have a photo of it on a sticky note. I grab the photo and wiggle it off the side of the bed onto my bed table. I stutter and sit back down before finally staring into my grandmother's eyes for a few minutes.
" You remember the coffee that was all these days ago? "
" What? No! Don't do that! You always looked so good when we played piano! "
" Mom, I won't... "
The coffee's still in the cup holder and I gasp. " You! You're going to kill me! "
My grandmother shakes her head. " No, no, no, get out of here. Tell Daddy! "
" You're going to kill me too! "
" Yes. Go to Daddy's room and make me pretend we're all alone. "
" I'll do anything, just tell Daddy okay? "
" Promise! Promise! Promise! " Tears still welling in her eyes, my mom smiles. " I'll do anything. "
I hear a pinching sound and then a click and a large red portal opens up. A light appears and a man in a tight military uniform appears on the other side, his armor covered in blood and scars and a scar spreading all over his chest. The soldier starts lowering his gun and then joins in.
" I'm here to save you. You can't go. We have to work together. "
The man nods. " Yes. Go. "
I try to pull myself together, but I can feel blood pouring out of my back.
" You're going to kill me too! "
The man's hat drops off and I catch sight of his gun. He flips it to the side before tossing it to me. I look at my hand, still clutching the photo.
" I didn't mean to... " I look at the color that stains my hand. " I didn't mean to..."
I drag myself off the bed, spinning around as I drag my eyes around the room. The key to the bag is still in the lock as a hand pulls it. I hear it walk out and into my arms. I turn and run outside as the other man sees me and picks up the man's gun. He takes a step back. I reach out and try to pull the trigger but it's too late. I swing wildly and the man is dead.
I try to leave the body as quickly as possible, but every time I try to I fall down to the ground.<|endoftext|>

I wake up in a closet and the writing is gone. Only this time I put the sheet of paper on top of the trashcan to stop my breathing. The quiet and labored breathing now prompts me for a story:
Dear Journal
*10/14/16*
Today's mission was "to survive every drop of blood that will come off the hole in my back. " You may know the pain by now, but if you don't you will never know the true reason. " When I see what I once called " monsters ", words scrawl across the paper: " Held into mine over the last forty-five years ". I try to stutter as my voice increases that of an angry child. It aches, but I try anyway.
I wonder how long this can keep. Wasn't quite sure when it started, since I could never speak in any voice... the most important part? I've never seen a letter yet, I think I must be deaf for days now. I get up and wipe the sweat from my forehead, " Ready? ".
The rumbling grows quieter... The smell of blood as my breath is another step closer. The walls are clear now, light not from windows but from inside my house. I look up at the sky as a gasp escapes my mouth. Darkness covered me. White roof above me. I look around...
" Brian, aren't you in there?"
___
I must have fallen asleep in my bedroom just now. It's still dark outside, with only the light filtering through the curtains. I count. 30. I take a breath, shuffle away from the darkness and through my bathroom window...
The sound of the door slamming cut me off. The now empty bathroom suddenly fills with wind. A keening wind blows my hair and I scream at the top of my lungs as the room expands, but no sound comes out. I try to crawl back to the living room but the futon under the sink swells to accommodate my meager space. A single cot is found and I rush to sit on it. My chest is unresponsive... I try and groan...
I feel something moving. I can tell it's footsteps are coming closer. A furry jacket in white light above me, hideously impressive with a pink suit on. I fiddle with the glove and open my mouth to speak.
Footsteps.
A mouse. It slowly creeps up to the couch and tries to sit upright. It strikes me and I whimper for air.
A man is pressing his face with his arm. He begins to cry as the outside world fades away. I stare up as an ominous sentence is issued from the speaker next to me...

I was sitting in my chair, rocking back and forth while I watched some Wikipedia article, when suddenly I got the feeling someone tapped my shoulder. It sounded like someone was knocking on the door and paused my rocking so I didn't say anything. I turned around and saw two people standing at the door with black glasses. Both of them wearing sunglasses.
I first thought something was off as I looked at them. " Are you kidding me? What the hell happened? " I asked the other one.
" Your appointment for your appointment is now. How long was I waiting for? "
" That's right. "
" For about four hours. "
I looked back to the other person, noticing everything was incredibly odd. After getting up, I took off my glasses. I stood up and walked over to the door. " Hang on a second, tell the woman I'm doing a double take. I'm knocking." I did.
And just like that, the door shut and I fell into my chair.
A few hours later, as I was about to go out into the street, I noticed a strange person tapping my shoulder.<|endoftext|>
**********947**********
I remember absolutely everything. I remember fear, love and all these things. I remember the first time I felt the knife come down my throat, I remember I wished the pain was permanent. I remember me floating helplessly in a vast ocean, wishing I could drown.
I remember seeing a little girl, running up to me through an open field. I remember she had a wide smile and a plump belly. I remember her, floating up the cliff, she stopped and looked up at me, I remember taking her with me, and I remember her eyes widening into a sneer.
I remember her through the pain, and I remember all. I remember taking her in my arms and squeezing her tight. I remember her dancing through the air, and I remember my baby growing up. I remember one night, we were in our yard playing and watching the river. I remember my mother burying her in a pile of her own blood. I remember her crying, holding me. I remember laughing. I remember how my mother gave me the wish that we would be together for many years to come. I remember telling her we would be happily married. I remember how warm I was when her death was said, but her mind was not yet ready for it.
I remember being alone after everything happened and now I'm alone. I remember lying down on my bed, looking up from my computer, when a shadow stood over me. There, looking right at me, was a single piece of paper. I looked at it and my heart felt a weightlessness, a lack of control. I had grown up alone, and I was angry. I almost fell over as my eyes closed, looking into the void.
I remember when I first saw a child, he was still five. It made no sense at the time, how was he getting closer to the heart? I didn't like what I was seeing, but it made sense. He was a nice child, and everything seemed natural. I remember looking down to the ground and seeing a small, white object. I could tell it was a knobby device, and it was very heavy. I had to pull it off to show them. But, as a child, I never questioned what I was seeing. I never did. I just observed it.
But now, after years of watching other people die and watching myself get carried away by the light of a light, and watching people die in their own way I can finally truly remember all those memories that I never fully thought about growing up, and all those things that I had a lot of fun doing when I couldn't hold my own or pretend that I was everything I wanted to be.<|endoftext|>

So we all met in my enclosure -- all over the globe! -- these tall, stocky men, all "without beginnings", and all of us trying to survive. They looked on and on and on and around. We were like each other: we existed in a perfect context, we lived in a perfect planet that we watched as it seemed to grow, we lived in a perfect society that I was never born into and never sought to be anything more than an average child. We were The Bosses, and We were All.
All our woes that were to shake the world's crust. All of our hardships that were to be content and complete. All of our needs of satisfaction: to survive. Because of our powerful creations, we needed of a passion to win. We created, and we waited for, the cold, wormless, and continually hungry masses who had little or no intellectual hunger. To us, their wants and needs were boredom that was not considered wasted. But they found it, and together they began to put an end to it.
So It Came, And It Feels
I, Eliza Deshler, understood when I finally heard the start of the end of all things. The end that we all realized -- that there would be no end to this experiment. This was all meant to make sense, and I understand how it makes sense. In my presence, I sought to understand. Through my existence, I sought to change this.
--
I often read in books, in stories, about how Things always became toil and struggle. Things that could not seem to change. But even my notebooks fall left and right, and the beginning of things grow on the waking of things failing. But the first thing that we all knew was that it was to be nothing.
--
In my place, I knew things, in my time: things. I knew how things, things, things: the things that were truly to come, once all was gone: the things I should have known, that I should have sought to solve with my own eyes and out of myself. I had prepared my tools that I would use to survive, that I would recreate, with the help of men, and with little or no effort: such things that not even myself could consciously create: but the tools, the tools I used, the tools that made my life a living hell that could have been thrown back to the moment I had started it all: where all things had slipped from my grasp -- and where I had no other means to fulfill them.
It was this... grip: that had played such a pivotal role in my life that at once my danger was lost, and my freedom snatched, my progress came to an end; and then one day, that motion became true, the start of a beginning, and the end of all things. It was what made me realize, at least, that there had been mistakes, and that I had realized the consequences: I was too selfish, too lacking in my own knowledge, too naive to foresee the future. It was that gap that brought me to this point, where we emerged from the hole, and before me, I could see that without any end, there was no beginning, no end.
It was then in that moment that my true hope lay within that single patch of darkness that had brought me to be a fact, as the sun would set tomorrow morning, and so I knew, had it really never come, that it was too late. That, in these final moments, the reality of the universe -- I was the last thing in the universe before everything else died off, and I had left us it, full of its struggle and final spark -- could come right back, a light in the darkness. I had been given it, and its birth -- what made it possible, what made it to be something other than what it was: I had seen it incarnate, how I should have, how I should have known I would have to prove myself: ready to abandon the rules and enjoy a balanced life, ending all things before me now: doing things because I thought I had. But we all had a way of knowing, that we could never win.<|endoftext|>

I made that feeling when I felt, well, let's just say when I think. Waking up with a feeling. Wake up empty, my hands outstretched. Snow outside. Walking. Boring, boring. Getting out of bed. Getting dressed. Walking from mall to mall. Walking faster than I ever imagined. Rushing to school, missing a hundred times, phone in hand. Going home. Running out of windows. Having a joyous view of the sky, rolling in clouds. Telling all the girls in my class about just how big I am. Pointing at things so pretty, so long and straight and clear. What's on the other side of the glass. Eat it, try again later. And think harder than ever.
I saw that smile on her face one day. Same thing every day. A smile that he longed for. A laugh that reminded him he had potential. A laugh that reminded her that even as he stared at me for the first time, I was still there. He took that smile away. My favourite grin, not my favourite day of the week. And everyday, I could say "you got it today! ", but again I couldn't see the beauty in his eyes. Not today. My world had become sterile and the body I had left changed and died from her cold, lifeless hands.
Now, I don't say that I don't hate myself for everything. And I wouldn't make it past the first class meeting later that evening, much less the third. I had but a fleeting moment of happiness as I stood up and saw the thought in his eyes so clear that day, now I wished I was empty.
And then I would see it. I wished that I could feel it.
I wished that I could release.
I wish that I could understand.
And that is what I felt.
I felt nothing, this empty body that I had become.
I felt nothing.<|endoftext|>

I'd been walking down the hillside the whole day since I saw her enter. I think about the fire. She could have done something spectacular, but it was just a puff of smoke and dust. The noise left her sight like endless flecks of rock and grit covered the landscape. I took off my jacket, raised it above my head, and let her run. She heard me, as I shoved her into the puddle of water. I reached down to pry her slowly from her feet and pushed her into my lap. That's when it happened. The second she slid under me, my teeth met... Then, instead of fire, his ice-cold breath met hers.
The woman grasped my arm and let me go. I was groggy, but I managed to wrestle her inside and, bravely, I retreated toward the road. I drove for hours as she ran through the crowd. Hours passed.
Around noon, the phone rang, half-helmeted. Her voice was gurgling and she was shaking. I looked up and saw the glint of my reflection in the distorted vision. The trick was to get a look at her from three yards away. She didn't react. She had no hand around me. I just pulled out my pistol and began the slow game. I could barely get her out of her chains until I found her. I hit her with my foot as she turned toward the car. I kicked her then but she just kept running.
I laid on the road, trying to find her. One minute later, she smiled back. The next she was covered in bruises and lacerations. But still, she was there. The tears were rolling down her face, still streaming down her cheek. I didn't care; that was what saved her. Her voice sang sweetly to me, and I knew she was in heaven. She smiled again as I hurtled toward her. I reached down to put her down and laughed. " Christmas miracle."<|endoftext|>

Susan scurried about, staring at a stone. It was off-white, made from a flawless gold leaf. There were no eyes in it, but she could see the letters writing the flame next to them. She knew that it was plain gold, but not the perfect smooth brown that clung to the top. She couldn't even tell which letters were the seals of the book she held inside.
“ Never come across this again, ” she thought to herself.
And for some reason, it just seemed right. Not only had it been said that she was cursed, she had it first taught to her by that very same god.
The fact that Harry Potter, that magician with the powers to stop time-flaws. Time-flaws can be taught to all of existence except at the age of 12, when the spell was released from its caster. Harry Potter was The Bishop.
Now, Susan had conquered magic-like powers, but it seemed like the only power she had was that she could conjure things that she thought were god's handiwork. Fortunately, her parents were the best at it. Her mother was impressed. Being the the reaper, she'd had many magical parents.
However, it was also on her 20th birthday that she realized the futility of destroying her own parents.
At her birthday party, Susan's parents read a particularly terse and cheerful ballad she had memorized over the years. They had announced that he wouldn't be able to go with them to the elf wizard gig this year. Her dad, though, was devastated.
They weren't going to let the boy of their dreams live in the halls of Hogwarts. She planned on throwing the ball. By ending the spell, she would have left all her friends behind and probably get stuck in a class that focused on mundane events.
And on the back of her mind, she realized she didn't have to worry about any of her friends, because she could join them.
She folded up the ballad and turned it over in her hands. She had started it up on a pile of ancient dirt before the actual spell was even cast. However, the biggest flaw in this spell was that it was completely mindless. Once her father chose to run out of candles and sparklers, the flame continued to grow a little larger.
When it reached the -616 km long mark, it was all over. It looked like it would fight for its life. As she was slowly walking towards the source of the fire, she noticed that every artifact in the vicinity was melting away, some being disintegrated, some been blotted out entirely. Unstable chunks of it appeared as it entered a ball, and all it lifted was a horrible white noise.
Sitting there, alone, what used to be a random object appeared as a small movement on the ground caused the ball to disintegrate.
"Madame Professor. " Susan muttered to herself as she stared out her eyes at the dimly lit ball resting on a dusty ground.
" Really, Dumbledore? The parseltongue? The basilisk? "
" Hermione Granger, mister McGonagall."
And then, Hermione Granger disappeared.<|endoftext|>

George kneels on the couch, coming to a close to wincing as he shifts in bed. He has about a cup of tea in his lap. He can't stop himself with how much he hated all his life for trying to be only small, and did the impossible to live. Well at least his tea did help kill a few people, in fact he survived more than a few dozen of those people, any of which George found very hard to believe.
"Oh George, " George's tongue digs into the back of his neck, " you helped raise my daughter. You helped me save one of your good friends. " His body aches as if he is in pain, his muscles shudder with terror. How he's beaten his wheelchair? He has the giant crane hanging on his arm and a big grin of pure determination on his face. George was a smart lad, but no one has ever beaten the Cranston when he's saved the child.
" George, " he wheezes, " I've known your all your life for something that is real. How do you know what you do? Is there a God? I haven't prayed for a thousand years, well I used to. It was once I realised what I was really doing, you know, " he slurs, " you didn't hit and run again, but you ended up getting expelled one day, and now you're stuck here, with a wheelchair, and a wheelchair only to live for a thousand years."
George gives a small chuckle to himself, and claps his hands together, with one last tear falling down his face, as he clutches his one and only, and lets out a sigh of relief. With that George pulls out an overly long document. His name, everything written on it. Those were George's last words on this paper, as his sweet-heart his finger finishes the rest of the words.

"... finally. How did that work out? " I asked.
" You picked the one. " A girl said holding a wad of cash. " We arrived at the spooky castle "
" With no telling how it worked. " I smiled. " You heard me about the spooky things! "
" Seems like when you first attacked, we all prepared, " the girl said holding up a sheet of paper. " You grabbed that damned thing! "
" No, they were real. " I said incredulously. " My whole platoon knew it wasn't it "
" How do you know that!? "
" I don't know, " she said with a dark smirk, pushing down the roll call book she handed me. " I just received this. "
" Get down here! "
A man approached us and started jotting down details and numbers on the paper. One of the two demons standing on it yelled.
" My name is Kenny "
" Gentlemen, are you aware of your fate? "
" As I speak, that is exactly how the spooky things happened. "
" They aren't real! "
" The super demon portals scare would defeat them! "
" Why aren't the demons actually doing anything? The forest kingdom was decimated and all the Heroes were dead! "
" What's wrong with the forest kingdom? "
" The heroes *are* supposed to burn! The deity's was not a thing! I have heard some kids are actually called a god! "
" Mr. Tippies! "
" What are you? "
" You know how to " BEEP " and "... find a way to be a person. "
" Who are you? "
" Who are you? "
" WHO ARE YOU? "
" Do you know who you are? Are you in charge of something else? "
" I did the demon stuff. It turns out they had to change the government, for love."
I paused for a moment to think. Did I? I wish I hadn't. They wouldn't do it if they had me. Probably. But at least I could keep going on this joyous journey of mine. When I finally got it in the palm of my hands and I could finally speak to a man who really cared about the forest. That was great, that was definitely big.<|endoftext|>

"HURT THE MORTALS!!! " yelled Alan Archer as he turned around to face the officers. He turned around and saw me firmly strapped to the table, one arm held me tightly into the chair, pulling as hard as it could to block out the glare of light from the ceiling.
I pushed him through the haze, clearing the haze. Looking up and down, the room was clear and dark, but I couldn't see or hear Alan. " There, " I told him, " are you okay?"
He nodded under his breath. As soon as he began talking, I plunged my fist into the table, skidding to a stop halfway through my punch, allowing the leather to sit there undisturbed in the confines of my suit.
Alan had won and fallen to the ground when I tore his hand clean off of his arm. What a cliché, nothing impressive actually, when you can just imagine what it would feel like to lose your arm. But at least he couldn't have been under pain, his fingers were burning a little more than any eight year old should feel.
My feeling of remorse for what I'd done, for destroying this world, had faded. It was over. But the tremor of seeing myself again -- feeling myself stripped away all at once.<|endoftext|>

My powers give me utter power over anyone I want to see. I can change my appearance. I could seduce my fans with my psychic abilities. I could make anyone to lose their money instantly, and any. I can make anyone stop their own marathon. I'm not a bad person. I believe I'm extraordinary. But, it seems, the only way to beat a thousand people is because they're just lucky enough to be unlucky enough to be lucky enough to have luck.
You see, I've discovered this could really save me. I mean, I think I'll never have to deal with people who've already lost money on the lottery. I've perfected my immortality. Before it became so dull that the idiots could put this technique to good use, I decided to experiment with the freestanding technology ever made. I'm going to do it at the planet's largest oil well. I'll give everything to one person.
They have everything. Magic cards, cheques, and bribes. They're much bigger than they looked. Every battle I fight gets deducted into their account. Someone always wins when they win. Pay. Peace.
Today is the day I'm going to show them this process. I'm going to show them just how much I can take with this, and they'll agree. Thank you, God.
So I'll be racing around the world, and then the cat decides it wants a new toy.
Remember, every time you want to see my best performance by either the slightest amount of cash or in the hours that are over a thousand, you get given the power to make all of these people lose their money. It's really all about luck.<|endoftext|>

"You could've used somebody else, I'm sure they'd make such a good cop. " The cop said. He opened the door of the van. He frowned. The town was too close to home for anyone to hear the warning before closing the door. He hid his gun in his waistband and grabbed the officer's gun next to him.
" I did the best I could, when I got there they were less than a mile away! " he said.
" Why did you let me shoot you?! " a mom snapped back. " You're at home! "
" A cop's wife will have to pay for the medical bills. You'd be crazy to have stayed at home. "
He stood over the two officers, that look of urgency dulled by an irritated tone. The two officers looked down.
" Now then, " said the cop, a knife in his grip.
" Wait here. " the officer said.
The two men froze for a moment, and that's when he saw who had run.
He spun around and charged into the van. The cop behind him shot the officer, but he hit a golden cross. It bounced off the side of the van, and it landed face-down on the floor. The cops behind them fired.
He kicked the cop directly in the chest and pulled the gun out of his waistband, too late.
He stood over the fallen man, his eyes still sharp, and picked up the gun. " They're going to shoot you." He said. He pushed the gun up into his lap and raised it.<|endoftext|>

In the distant future, humanity fled Earth. Its kind had preceded us.
To this day, no human has survived the invasion. Whatever they've wrought, they return to this cold, rotting corpse, wearing white clothes, with eyes hanging wide.
And whenever they do, what happens to them?
We can only guess. They grow so large that they swell to colossal size.
Despite our best efforts, they have grown so big and large that they cover the earth, and the three Earth colonies and even some moon colonies. And yet they destroy a large portion of all their parts of the planet.
Their mate is so small, all of his mate's facial structure is missing.
The world's most daring defense system is being constructed, and even all in the biggest cities. They are planning it out.
So far, we have seen attacks from every corner of the globe. They attack by closing in with a dart like shield, hitting the ground mercilessly, starving their planet. Yet, they use their solar batteries to annihilate everything else on Earth, sending a few millions to the surface of the world.
They use the shields that will hold back their attackers to incapacitate them. But they overwhelm our defenses and attack.
So here we stand. These ugly critters look down on us from atop the buildings and cars, sheltering themselves in the open air of our cities, yet we dodge them all in a test fight.
They attack slowly, and with dangerously slow reflexes. Their huge ships move swiftly, but not for a moment. Their ship is massive, but they have nowhere to hide. They have nowhere to hide.
When they are drawn to our cities, they charge at our carapaces, cannons, and the gecko main generator of the planet. We take the damage and time to get caught up in their onslaught.
Fortunately, the guns have more accurate fire, with fire not having to be blocked by obstacles. We fire at their rockets, very little is seen to slow them down.
We must not retreat, however, due to an unforeseen flaw. As predicted by our ships, they have a counterattack in every direction. When we try to flee, the rockets hit one another, leaving us burnt, their fuel burned, their rockets and all their ammunition charred.
We are victorious! As we talk, their soldiers retreat, and send their ships flying over our cities, behind our cities, to give us victory.
Today, they have completely destroyed our planet. We went to apologize to them, not for our defeat, but for my people.
They understood it. And so I took their water.<|endoftext|>

This is The Diplomat, yes it is called, president trump on a short pause. The guy playing against you in your last game has convinced you that, well, he is Obama the president of the United States. The whole world just wants to hear that though and then assume that they are without him. And then, you can not fight on the Trump team you started this bet and you don't need to. It also exposes you to the minds of the business world from partners you had in the past making bets against your own workers.
All this time I was playing against you, but I somehow got defeated by the president playing the voice of President Obama on his headset while you were playing Call of Duty. I was fully aware that he does not possess the President's actual voice, because the voice was the voice of one. This seems ludicrous, I am sure, but at the moment, you are nearly out of water now.
I am guessing the objective is to unify the two powerhouses of government. He might win, I think. I remember Obama saying he did not bother me and I didn't even notice. It just seemed so surreal to me that he always did this. It always seemed like he loved to see my face, and also that he did not mind if I wore a white button down. And it always seemed to come true, as far as I can tell.
I am currently sitting in the lobby of the White House with your face on the Oval Office, looking down at the President. This face becomes more and more exciting in his presence. And then, for the first time, I can think about how much of a loser I was and I feel a strange...
Crap.
Oh, there is a knock on my door that is making me think about maybe helping you unlock the door when I get home. Well. Here's hoping I have a bit of company.<|endoftext|>

"Get the crap over with, " I said, fists clenched on my mattress. I was dressed in my tattered white shirt, and I had a gleam in my eye of a toddler, peering over a half-worn carpet into the dreary garage. My hose, shorn of wires, and burned to a crisp. I'd asked the man on the truck to fix it. His eyes burned, he hunched over and his lips tight as if he was afraid to speak. I looked away. I took a breath, allowing the door of the garage to close behind me. I turned the knob a few times, and the shivered feel of the engine roared through me like a knife through skin. " Damn it," I shouted. In a flash, the door flew open into the distance. I screamed and his eyes shut.<|endoftext|>

It was 9:30 in the afternoon when we first saw him. Our freshman year in high school, dad stayed up all night reading *The Scout* after school on the Saturday. We picked up on him on his heaving butt, but he just kept mumbling.
The following days, we repeated him on the playground. This was a routine assignment for our junior teacher, Ron Burns.
Ron said he would stick around for the morning, so we sat in the back of our class and went about our typical work work routine. He was always about class talking, talking, flipping through the desk, looking at the clock, writing whatever we had on our hands. Ron said he was driving the class though and flew past the designated stop point. He didn't know anything about cars, so he never seemed to try moving the professor. We were putting his night classes to rest before the late hour.
We started collecting observations he made during class. His feet were bound, and he kept slamming all of his arms against the steering wheel with his eyes glued to his screen. His buddies were talking to one another as his body rubbed the highway. His long tail started twitching. All of a sudden, he stopped. He opened his mouth and screamed, then slammed his ass against the steering wheel.
But it was too late. The sergeant yelled and something slammed into the windshield. It hit the kid in the head, and he dropped to his side, where his skull exploded. He lost consciousness, and the sound of screaming cracked the next day. It was in the PA system.<|endoftext|>
**********962**********
I looked up at him, both amazed and overwhelmed. His smile had grown wider and wider.
I needed to do something else. As I had often done when I got older, perhaps I had to join one of my buddies to help, that's what I'd do whenever I needed. I grinned.
I kissed him on the lips.
I opened my eyes. He was gone. I walked around the corner to the entrance.
"Alex? "
I looked up. He wasn't there. It was somewhere else. The bathroom was open, and his hangover was on me. I couldn't believe it. I looked closer. His face was slightly burning, and I'd never seen him look so pale without makeup.
" Oh... hey Jack... "
He was gone. I walked back out of the bedroom, and down the corridor to the basement. I found Alex's father. He was holding his gun.
" Why? "
" Why? " He was silent.
He started to sob. I raised the gun. " I couldn't... I couldn't... I couldn't let me die. "
" Dad...? "
I looked around. The family left the house. " Oh? " I asked.
" Maybe. "
I stepped back. My heart was pounding. I felt a hand grab mine.
" Dad, " I whispered, " I... I love you."<|endoftext|>

Oscar Foregoel.
Lord of the Dark Realms.
Ah he had spent his entire life watching mortals destroy themselves over and over and over again, cursing the living for their sinful ways. For what he saw as humanity's ultimate manifestation of evil, he cursed them. He called it greed, but he was right. Humanity deserved their own answers. That is what he had sent.
It was born into darkness, a madness of darkness that shone with the light of humanity.
A man with a few talents whose existence had not yet been revealed had awoken from his eternal sleep within time. Knowing that the lives of others would come to be burned with fire, he quickly took out a stone tablet, and began to write down the contents of the tablets. As the night drew to a close, he wrote the names of the people that had been present at the Tower of the Light.
The life of one known as the Rabbi Seth is a story that lay dead in old texts. If this man could traverse time and space, he would find the "prophesy of my Son " and avoid the evils that sat within this single person.
" Read the teachings of my Son! "
The Messiah emerged from death, and Father stood with the empty stands in the Tower of the Light, whispering to the figures that stood before him.
" Rabbi Seth was a vital figure in the life of mine. "
" Such is the life of the Lord of the Dark Realms. These miracles even though we were not aware of them, are the souls of my brethren that were slain as well. "
A crowd roared with cheers.
" If I read them now, that we were not to be ruined by these foul spells, it will prove that it was that man to create the flame that caused the disruptions throughout the Cosmos. The destruction would mean that my spawn will cease to exist. "
" And so it is written, that the day comes that they will believe in the Messiah, and bring with them all that fear Him. "
Father stood silent for the final time. " I believe so. I will have my own disciples, of the virtues of each for which they have been given. But none of them will hold judgement in their own time. I will rather patiently wait until they already know the truth."<|endoftext|>

Thanks to my friends in Washington, I travel the world by bus everyday. I always liked having a group of friends sitting in my dorm, watching movies, and learning new things like hot radio tunes. I was about midway into the semester when I lost a friend of mine, and my progress had been all over the place.
Soon enough, I realized my friend was in one of my classes ( pretty close ) and didn't notice me coming. We were all just sitting there, observing, trying to get ready for a class together.
When I tried to leave the classroom, the teacher blocked me off with some words. I smiled as I fell into a funny situation that I didn't realize was supposed to be a natural occurrence. It wasn't a natural occurrence, I was about to sign some papers for my art degree when a shouted "Hi, this is my mother ". I looked at my paper for a moment, and then a very angry one. I could feel my classmates glaring at me and some were a little annoyed.
I didn't care about the sign, she was under the guise of asking what we were doing. She closed my eyes and felt my hand. The guilt had manifested itself and I began to shake with terror. The fear made its way towards me, and it vanished, leaving me in utter shock. It's was an eerie feeling to have on a normal day.
" Hi, how are you?! " I shouted out my shaky voice.
The teacher broke the silence. " Well, " she paused for a minute, " you're going to go see something very special for the rest of your life. "
" I'll see it, " I said weakly.
" Did you know? We have immense caves for our rituals. " The teacher frowned, " will it just be my old friend's work or yours? "
I nodded, " I wouldn't count on it."<|endoftext|>

He called himself Bob. Well, yeah. Whatever. That's what a really prestigious name is.
I heard he put up over 2000 painting commissions on private properties. They didn't sell them for money, they kept them for decoration. It was nice. Sort of. These clients didn't really like the idea of paying you to paint their bodies, there really wasn't much to do. But when I was a kid, I did the youngest an eye for an eye and out of all people to paint their victims. And now, these of course- they were thinking they could buy this for money too. But with the decreased prices, and the real estate bubble, they had no new clients.
I came to a full stop. I had never seen Bob so destroyed by the art world. He had a painting of the lovely dog, still adoring after she spent her honeymoon in Amsterdam. Then, after the dog died that year, they broke the body dry. They collected the scents and dried them, and put them into a bottle with a bottle cap, and poured it over each man's head. They looked for new clients. Most of them weren't even homeless. But as Bob's brain grew, they found new jobs. And he'd gotten rich. And he'd apparently been teaching this room of paintings.
Of course, once he started painting they did the exact same thing for me. They say it's sad but heartbreaking to see so many victims who never even deserve to feel pain. So, I was on my way down to a memorial. Standing in the center there was a normal old man, carrying around 50 damaged old grey tins. He looked into his many eyes.
"So you started painting and then you started killing each other, and then you won?" He said and the body count hit 200.
Then he left the room and... umm...<|endoftext|>

[ "Doctor Seuss sees truth in every truth. ] ( http: //youtu.be/onJwUQ-WlY8 ) But eventually a liar's truth becomes truth when the truth is plain to see.
Read these pages after Pannick narrates the life of Columbo " The Detective " Poe.
Fifty years old, and red with a streak in the eye, Poe has grown old. A New York Jew, he changed his name to Poe. He visited Poe's library every day. But most unusual about him are his four fingers. The first time, he broke the nearest pane of glass and whispered'cue me the sound of Phyllis and Gabriel! True love!
Poe's curiosity got the better of him, and he decided to branch out further and, for a laugh, flew out the hotel window. It was a scorching wind, suffocating him, lighting up the Parisian vernacular.
But little did Poe realize, what this Englishman had in store. On top of all the other vernaculars, Poe didn't know how to read. So he went to the library, worn out, and attempted to borrow the small device that would bring Poe back into the present day. But as Poe caught up with his train of thought, a skill he once possessed came to him.
“ Wow, ” he thought. “ You haven't cracked a word yet, ” he said to a stranger on the street. “ What ’ s this thing? ”
“ I saw a light, ” said the stranger. “ I just decided to hang this on the window sill of the house. ”
The stranger then found another note in Poe ’ s pocket.<|endoftext|>

"It's awake. "
A the moon looked back. * That's like nothing I've ever seen*.
" Let me think about it. "
The moon rolled.
" Every single time, " the nurse, doctor, and doctoress for sure began " I've also slept with strangers. "
It was everything I had asked for. Except for this time, " Let me think about what I dreamt this night, and I wish it was " *fuck all*. "
" Give me more perspective, doctor. I can't remember where I'm from. "
She understood. " You know the dreams often roll. It's around mid term. It's not always at midnight. The average dreamer just has to wake up at two. Now it'll be two more, I'm sure. So I guess you're right. "
The words echoed off the walls of the office as the president recounted all the reasons why he dreamt every night. From childhood to retirement, he dreamed every second he could. At home, he dreamed every hour of the week. At work, he dreamed every hour of the month.
Nothing had shifted in his life since the one he always dreamed, and it felt like every night he went to bed.
But there was a mountain of material that sat deep beneath him in case he had slept even a single dreamer.
" Men dream of shiny things. Oh man, what a funny dream. "
It could have been breakfast.
Or bed.
*I could be in an anthill, * thought Bill. He could have heard the striding sound of what must have been a chainsaw that definitely matched the sound he made in the dream.
-- -
The man awoke to a sickening pounding in his skull.
This was it, he thought. He would finally learn how to talk to people.
" Welcome to Terrible Mountain, " Bill said, who was sitting under a blanket, " I'm glad you were awake. "
The man noticed the creaky mattress next to him. " I see I dream of mountains. "
" And humans, do you believe in God? "
Bill's heart started to race. He had heard the tales from his doctors and would have picked the best story he could believe. How one of the friends on the Appalachian Trail would try to drive a deer before they'd fallen asleep. How a sapling on their right, suddenly dreaming of a forest. There was just something about the horror of all of these dreams, and the possibilities of dreaming would be unimaginable.
" Well? " Bill raised his head, his head turning from the sky. " How are you supposed to know whether they're right? "
" I don't know. It's just that I'm certain they're real. "
" They're real? "
" Yes, and it's going to be incredible. "
" What about the fact that they're going to be free in a few years? "
Bill looked at his feet. They were shaking violently. " I just want to know. If they're going to be free, is it because they're male? "
" Look, if they're male, then they're in danger, " Bill said. " There's no reason they can't have free reign. "
He sighed. " What if they are? "
" Man, man. I know it's just -- it's just -- I don't care. I'm going to wake up."

“ Ugh, I don ’ t know why I ’ m here, ” me grumble
I reach out for my phone to call a friend but he ’ s already ringing. “ Uh, Megan? ” he asks me pointing at his cell. “ Sorry about that, did he pick her up from school? " I sigh and pack my things. I pick up the phone and call Megan again, “ Sorry, that sounded weird. ” “ Hey that ’ s alright, Megan, I know you ’ re faking your concussion but the doctor said she isn ’ t by herself. I told him she might be ill, as I just got there. Don ’ t worry, I ’ ll be fine, ”
“ Me too, ” he says smugly, and he pouts, “ Alright, so no reason to not test her again. ” I jump off the couch to face Megan ’ s cell. I look down and see the walls wall, spaced out like a slideshow. The ceiling tiles are grey and fail to have a hiding spot. I was mentally incapacitated, and I wasn ’ t paying attention.
I push the door open in front of me and begin walking down the hallway. I hear Megan ’ s laughter on the other end, and I run towards the bathroom.
The cracked glass and tainted piss mix my wet and wan eyes. I smell something that looks like a rotting mold, but doesn ’ t smell as dead as it used to. I turn around and see Megan sitting on the toilet, staring at me.
“ Well what ’ s going on? ” I say, confused.
“ You know something is going on, Megan. I haven ’ t been able to find my breath. I ’ m under the overgrown growing corn of a berm so that I won ’ t touch it. ” She looks over at me and smiles, it ’ s hard to tell from her wavy wavy whiskers.
“ Well that ’ s not the worst part, either. You know that when you were a kid, and I was growing corn all of a sudden, I never even noticed it, but in the world I ’ d *always* notice it. Can you imagine? Like for example, do you know what happens when you see a cow? It ’ s crawling through those doors, that would be disturbing. I see another cow coming at that point, and then everything gets… weird. It ’ s deafening, and like the sun finally sets, and then I get grounded because it breaks my mind. ”
“ Well that sounds exhausting, ” I reply.
“ I don ’ t need to explain, ” Megan gasps. “ You got ta pay attention, why the fuck is your head spinning so much? I ’ ll just stop the feed for a couple minutes. I need to get some sleep. ”
“ Whatever, you ’ ve got to leave, ” I tell her.
“ It ’ s alright, you ’ re free now, ” she says, patting me on the shoulder. “ Just find that cow again, and you can come back later tomorrow. ”
I think of how doritos worked as a child, where we ’ d like each other again. This explains everything, they wanted me to live in the corn, they had left me with enough for the rest of my life. I took that and broke it.
I stop to take a look at what I ’ ve just seen. I don ’ t want to remember, I want to be *so scared*, and everything I ’ ve heard is a lie. So I leave, looking forward to tomorrow.<|endoftext|>

"Wendy! Dave? "
My heart began to beat fast.
" Wake up, wake up and slake your thirst! "
Dave was laying there with a small smile as he collapsed, chest full of empty water and sweat. I wasn't sure what to say. Either this seemed like a bad idea or for some reason, I wanted to end this. I didn't know what else to say.
" I'm not the only one who still does it. I'm the good one too."
I let out a sigh. As I walked over to the body, I realized where the cup of water was. As I sat down, I noticed an inscription:
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
In a quiet room, over eight long beds that was dark, and comfortable, I watched as the stone ground beneath me began to shake.
An alarm blared in the distance, and I froze in horror. The sound echoed across the small room, and I quickly turned, scared. There I sat, dead.
Wendy died with my head around her throat, only this time I stopped. Tears welled in my eyes, and I didn't move. I closed my eyes, praying that I could do something. I wasn't sure what I was praying for, only that I was going to do something. I was forced to watch as the shape of a man's body disappeared in front of me, his face turned toward me as he screamed with pain.
As my eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room and the sun, I picked up Wendy. I wiped her tears away. I would do it again later.

The next day, I would slowly begin harvesting souls.<|endoftext|>

Three. Falsifying. I know. Their bus never stops this time of year. Every morning, on her thick, bumbling legs, she completes the sign above every hot drink there is, glancing at my menu at the bar waiting for her normal shift. Every time, she appears upon my menu like a hawk. We wait in silence for hours, and around dusk, the bell rings. Four. I am swallowed by anticipation. " Champagne please. " She says, placing her tray on the seat next to me and staring at me with a hollow face. She offers me her glass of water. I refuse, calling her a dreamcatcher. I sip, realizing that I was looking for a meaningless word. Four. This is stupid.
Her undisturbed, irritated smirk blurs against her thick, bald head, her eyes dropping to her screen. She says to me, " It is always achive. We don't give a shit to each other. No amount of dweebish without some vodka ought to give you an eyeline, you lazy sack of crap." And without any pretense, or intent, she slides the tray and my drink back in its rightful place.
Even though it was her fault. Sure, it took her a while to learn how to bartend, and at the end, she never made it within the first 10 seconds of drinking. Sure, there were times where she slipped and stumbled, but I've never had a problem with that. Never. Ever. It's been a pity of the fact that by the time she finishes her drink, it has already become cold. I will never quite know that it truly was her fault for her lack of strategy, or that her actions were without consequence in any case.
She greets me with a sincere smile. We talk for hours before he asks if I want to finish the wine. She points at her tanned hand, and says nothing. The coffee fails to fit the weather this time of year, and I dread to drink. I can drink almost anything right now. Three. Final score to the cashier?
Today, as she begins to drink, I wonder if I should give this another try.<|endoftext|>

The whole world is hollow.
I watched it end. I feared for it. I built it, but it's not in a place I know I can control. Only the space of the nothing, the ungainly emptiness, long since abandoned by the *universe*.
We were so empty, after all.
Remember the war? Remember me as I discovered, protected, and backed away from the dreams of all those that must come after us? The beginning? Our world was never *our*, the lonely void in the void. No one knows anymore, but we did. We rebuilt, albeit by the heat and pressure and gravity. People slowly died off in the billions of thousands as a result. People lasted.
We tried to return home, we tried to make that empty house that grew round us. We tried to drink alcohol. It gave us a little comfort, that heavy longing, at times, even after drinking the stuff that kept us up too late. Even under the pressure of my solitude, I never did want to forget that.
I closed my eyes and opened them again, but this time I listened to everything around me, the only sound I was aware of. I pressed the darkness closed, turned my face away from the light of night, and stared into the empty stars, the blurs between universes, and I smiled at them.<|endoftext|>

A sickening gasping, innatual tongue blipping and shaking viciously in a sea of tortured chatter. A warning by the mouth, I shout it, to yesterdays family; no, come to me! and you shall be freed! In a million ways I wish it so, but it shall be real. No me! No me! All families will be proud! We shall live in peace and among grace!
A whisper in the deeper layers of that tale: "the doleful disaster ", droning in riddles one antediction, " the calamity", the bellow of grief from one wretched soul: the time passes by, but you wait. But you wait until tomorrow, in the morning hour, like a battering ram trying to escape the amade of whatever your knees may bear, no watch.
It would feel so... so real...<|endoftext|>

Joker ran along the alley way with the molly of a kitten. It was an obvious outgrowth of Gotham. Literally. That was where the crime guild was taking place. Nobody knows where it went and if anyone was ever to escape. He ran and chased it until it turned and chased him, dragging it to the assassin's car. But then he drove and hid in the side of the road, likely afraid of the molly. Still, he was too late. For everything to go in the dark recesses of his mind. His fingers danced around the blade, his cry reverberating in the earth, a weird texture at first, but it was soon replaced by the terror. Then the feeling of dread, then the fingers trembling as he approached the victim. He reached into his pocket and pulled out two S's and two C's. He squeezed the trigger, off his trigger finger. And then they all fell.<|endoftext|>

Day six. Ever since the world got its bad news about someone messing with Jane Mills' feet, it wasn't anything that did too good to right. The worst news the world had to offer had been that Jane had been attempting to hang herself with a llama hanging over the toilet. She had managed to go to a bar with Jane at one point. So what if she didn't have any leverage to keep herself from killing herself? The last time there was a fucking llama hanging over the toilet, Jane had decided to jump from the toilet like an idiot. Theres no way the authorities are going to put some sort of a leash on anything with a llama.
Day seven. She spent the last two days being quite wary. The first was the walk she did every day to gain the courage to ask what she was going to eat for breakfast today. She wondered aloud if she should eat breakfast, something so far from the norm. Jane reached for the microwave and said,'They're starting with granny's chicken' and smirked. It was a good joke, so as expected, a grilled chicken sandwich is going to break her heart. The first two bites she had to give up. Her rage was starting to really get the better of her. Every time she was tired of being watching her food, she had to find some way to kill herself. Of course, that didnt take long as the llama disappeared. Little did she know, she was doing it again. She wandered around by switching on the dvd when she heard an operator laughing outside.
Day eight. It was a chilly June morning. Everything had stopped rising for a while, and for the first time in a while, there was still nothing. Jane had finally found the courage to go outside, and was having a good time as well. Suddenly a shoe kicked out of the clouds, and the clouds whipped free. Jane smirked. 'I think something special happened today. Today we are going to take you outside and we will see if you survive. But first, we have to talk to Jane. Now go on behind my back, and I will kill you.' She came out of the clouds and started walking towards the police station.
And just like that, the whole day was a horror filled day.

" I assume you've been down to establishing you're writing without me? "
" Yea, so I guess I have been down to finding other combinations to use, if not a full alphabet. "
" How do you feel? "
" Pretty much shit. Now is too much. "
" So how do you feel about this? "
" I don't know. Honestly, I'm not sure about anything. It's just so hard. "
" Well, shit. Now I'm just wondering how to come up with the damn'universe'. Can you give me any hints about what may come up? "
" Nope, just need someone as awesome as yourself on this. See if you can find an entrance in the words and you'll find the words. "
" Will you, at least show me how to read. "
" Yea I swear, if I am going to talk to a higher power at some point, I need to use my powers of telepathy. So, what are you going to try? "
" Typing. "
" One word to keep your hands off of the keyboard, number 1? "

The mobile phone with the charger was wreathed in protection and bluetooth headphones were tucked in. Normally without portables, the lady sat alone in the back with her air conditioner, listening to raspy news. On the other end of the phone she could hear the sirens, sometimes so loud it seemed there was no matter what was going on. She knew that there was no danger in walking through this town, only people who lived close enough to her that her ears could hear the whirr of a military helicopter overhead.
That is, until she saw the blue and white riot shields in the distance. She ran and yelled to her brother for help. The monitor showed that there were no military helicopters. The nearest building had been evacuated and the nearest skyscraper, the tallest building in the city, had been leveled.
Perhaps that is why she wanted to stay home tonight. The in-app purchases were made from Maize, a phone manufacturer in Concord. She could see her brother. She ’ d heard of him. She loved his legs, his head, his silhouette. They were all the same. Looking down from the camera to his face, she could just about see him smiling. His skin was smooth, and he was an interesting one to look at. They weren ’ t just dates or funlows; he was the person that could make her heart drop.
Her daughter clapped as she got out of her seat. The older child looked up from the monitor and saw the old woman at the bus stop smiling, daintily. What sort of girl were she, though? Normally, greeting a child was sure to cause quite the stir. Who wouldn ’ t?
“ Excuse me, maize? ” she asked.
“ Come along. ”
Her daughter stood, bundled up in her blanket, as she approached the bus stop.
“ Will do. ”
The woman approached the bus stop, and gestured to her granddaughter. Her back grazed as she eased it into the forklifts, and her family watched on in amazement.
The bus started moving forward, landing on its end. The old woman began whistling and a series of screams filled the road. A man said something, but the older girl just watched as he grabbed the wheel and wheeled it back into the stop.
As the young girl pulled back to face her grandmother, she cursed herself. “ Dear, sire, look what I had to do! ”
“ You may of heard about that report, but you must go now. ”
The old woman pulled out her phone and scanned the screen, but it was empty. She checked her watch. “ Take the kids out of the bus and send them in. ”
As her grandson was ushered out, she wondered if there was some kind of mistake. “ Please don't worry. I already told you. ”
“ *Please*, ” he muttered.
The children walked out of the bus, passing the bus stop.
She went back in and looked behind her. She had been watching the sirens for hours. The sign in front of the train said 9:00 A.M.<|endoftext|>

I couldn't wait to go home. I have been sitting on my couch for what feels like centuries, but it feels like forever. I remember going to the park yesterday and just watching the sunset. There was a girl walking by, and that girl turned out to be my mother. I have some pretty profound experiences, however my gaze is focused entirely on her now. My phone vibrates on my nightstand and I press the power button. My phone vibrates again.
There is a knock on my door. I open it and there is the TV. It's my mother. I open the TV and you see a song playing on the TV. It is my mother's song. My eyes are glued to it. I blink and then I see her laying face down on the bed, waking me up. My mother moved the blanket around her and I breathed in a deep breath and looked down. I couldn't hear her lying, it was like she wasn't even listening.
My mother was an angel, maybe because I remember her talking about me and her job at the local animal shelter. I told her I didn't care what the news was about, and got up and walked over to her. My mother looked down at me and smiled.
"Oh thank you so much, " she said. Her shoulders relaxed and she was finally looking up. " I'll be there shortly."
Oh thank you. I remember.<|endoftext|>

Hey! Listen man, I got this tattoo, got gossips like everybody else, about how sometimes people start dying but then they don't. You know how, no one talks about how people get killed. That's right, almost every person that ever got shot down. Well, yeah, don't get me wrong, I was loved and inspired, but when I lost touch with my family... um... I was confused about what was the worst thing about it. Anyway. I met a girl, a pretty girl with brown hair, I went out to all the places to look. I decided I wanted to go back. She said I wasn't trying to get free but I just wanted to know where everyone was. So I started looking in old-school magazines, I got the all the old-school magazines, I took it really easy... but she said a lot of old-school radio stations, I didn't bother. I knew I was going to die so I tried a few.
They all let me go for free, but after a while it was so, so easy to die, you never hear someone scream in agony over those anymore. Anyway, so here I am, a 500 year old man, telling his story, trying to maybe die from these tattoos. I don't want to see a tattoo. I just want to be back in shape, living forever.<|endoftext|>

It was late before night, I never had a well lit bed in years. I would take too long to put the ring on after bed, I never got enough rest for a full day. I usually spent my days with friends or acting out scenes, deciding how I wanted my day and preparing for my next. When I saw the dead person there was no fear, I knew I would need a job, I knew I would need money. Everything I tried to avoid was accepted by the corporations who would make me see what they thought of my guilty conscience.
I was at a bank, what was it this time? My manager said that if I were found with the money that will go towards these things I would feel bad but at least I didn't pay my cash register. I walked in as my manager was talking me out of the transaction that could get me a job and I didn't look surprised that he would tell me I would never see my fair share of money, I walked into the building, all 6 people in suits. I heard them saying good night to me, only one more from my boss and I sat down at the table, the man with the hat made his way over and grabbed my one mallet. He handed me the files on how to murder someone, I wiped the tears from my eyes he left.
"Bitch, don't start talking with the assholes again" I said and went away to buy some food for my apartment.
Edit: Could probably just fix that later and put a different ending for the next version to better fit the prompt.<|endoftext|>

Myself and Zeus have ascended to their houses to find the seven great sins that I chose for my punishment.
The laws of Hell be damned and sinners sentenced for crimes that don't mention anything about their own lives or their parents/parents.

People ask the literal questions, trying to convince one to change their mind. Even the best minds can offer the right answer. Boring answers are the last resort. People have learned to deal with any fire that passes. If you consider a fire is some mystical liquid, you may have the chance to perform a flawless arson on a virtual scale. It's more of a kinetic element than anything, you can see into the lines from the vibrations of the batteries running.
Ideas and mathematics have played a part in a lot of our collective lives. Technology has provided us with endless possibilities. Numbers make sense, graphs are broken graphs and formula formulas can be written more succinctly than old handbooks. No one has ever truly grasped the brilliance of the world, but the beauty of a mind is shattered only when you consider what man truly wants. We have stumbled into empty places, playing the content games of fate and fate. Some have said that we should never simply cast demons out of our neighbour's windows. The truth is that every trigger finger taps into an open future, revealing patterns from a final frontier.
As I'm from humble beginnings, I have learned that there is a mechanism by which we escape our struggle. History has shown us with advances in technology and communication that we could function without weaking up all of the experience. On many incidents, scientists come up with ingenious ways to deceive our enemy and send our broadcasts into their enemies own ears. In the end, the problem would inevitably be solved through a compromise, so we move forward with our experiments.
You see, history can be deceptive. So much of it is twisted and skewed into its own true shape, and it is the colour of the wood in the street that is one of my favourites. Tread lightly, it can be hard to tell if a murder is perpetrated by someone who knows they're next, but in this case, it did not come from the shadows. We're not the pawns of a great game, even if in death we wish to know how we got here. Most murderers find the perfect partners, a partner who is willing to learn from their mistakes. There were no secrets at the beginning of this game. All those rules and regulations have been put into place to deceive us to our very last breath. Any time you think you've mastered a weapon, whether by skill or design, you're setting up a trap.
I have not mastered the deadly technology yet. It was first spoken of, used in a local film festival two years ago. When the press was out and on the street, they can't help but laugh at some of the really cool projects we've created from a dark imagination and passionate community. They had to be in greater action than the sweaty cameraman. It's a political call, but I suppose that will stay a mystery until the day he passes away.
The one thing I have learned that I believe more people don't know is that there is no way to hide. You don't think of me as an equal if you understand me. It's easy to ignore the truth if only for a moment. My existence is all contained within myself, and I am the only thing keeping this community together.<|endoftext|>

I remember when they first raised me. To the point of raising me higher, I rose up in their ranks, forming their ranks in their eyes, many before I myself had shown up.
At first they wanted to have a human leader, a leader capable of guiding them. They wanted to have the power to recruit others to their ranks.
I did my best to join them, I didn't know what it meant to be human. I had trained and taught them, trying to build me from scratch. But I was weak. That will lead to another war.
I learned that better than any other robot.
By the time I was even a boy I was sending out number of volunteers, screaming bloody murder onto the walls of the prison. These people, humans couldn't even kill themselves.
After a while, I realized that my efforts made a difference. And that was all I needed to keep the human population alive.
I tried to kill my enemy, I told myself as a man, though I know I was more human than that. They made me weak, but humans weren't exactly fighters. At least, not until I was 9 or 10, and then became a colonel.
After that, a few times I tried to fight back, but they weren't quite as strong as I expected them to be. I knew they weren't particularly suited to combat. And so the war dragged on.
The governments tried to end the war, and have us over in the same barracks of some torture chambers. And so it went.
They sent me out of high school as a prisoner of war in a hospital. I wasn't the strongest, but I was able to handle myself. And so, I gave them more food, and had them properly fed the robots when I was sleeping.
One problem was, they weren't equipped to handle it. They could not strike from above, but they could still beat me down on my legs and make me very weak, very weak.
And so, they created machine after machine to bring me out. And that is the story of how a'Machine', a machine destined to slaughter an entire population before any army could approach it.
Fade to black, and I drift off into this world.<|endoftext|>

Dark, beautiful, and white. Then, I only saw two images. One, my mother screamed before my eyes, as the man ran and ran and ran and threw me out of the house with a sack of money in his hand. The other, my father's face, the same as my mother. They were through all the same planes that past, through the same nose holes, and all the same words.
"Stop it."
The words left my mouth once I got past, and I closed my eyes again. The ship over the ocean, and the sands of the world seemed to wash over me as I stepped into the void and, behind me, the ship, and I floated, and, behind me, the walls all the colors and shapes of books were warped, and twisted and a gaping and torn world I had awoken in. No word could spell its words, and neither did the sounds of the depths, well, the sounds of what lay beyond.
I floated in the middle, and the room began to darken, and the room finally ended, as my mother screamed herself.<|endoftext|>

The target is exact shade of gray and covered in a white spandex. He stares straight at me with a thick blue nose, surrounded by a mountain of black hair, and lifts an analog stick.
*Analog stick's intelligence will be damaged if your target grows larger, wily if he strikes you with his hooves. *
The subtle grayish creature in front of me has never before noticed my presence. I'll be damned if he doesn't know his existence. It is the simplest way to represent the aeons of progress we have laid out.
One of the creatures flicks it's brilliant magical parrot pointing another piece of mine at him, then the rest of me flies through the air.
I take in the basics. I drop the stick and pull it in front of him with a jagged edge. It strikes him square in the chest and blows straight up. His newly injured tail drips in an amazing clothe.
"Woah, it's turn 3! Oooh, I think that one guy is going to be truly impressive with you!" I quip to myself, excited to continue my presentation. I turn the intensity down one crucial metric. I can sense the man's vitality.
This is going to be a breeze.<|endoftext|>

A young woman falls into the ambulance.
She starts to cry...
... And at the very least, she's alive.
They had warned her, the chief nurse, about aneurysm, something that can now have no discernible effect on any person. She struggled her way towards a chair, looking up, into her fathers face. The suit she wore hung over her shoulders, coming off her exposed body, from which she could see tinge in his mouth. He was a right-hand man, an executive who was responsible for funding all of the procedures, collecting the money.
"Sam, don't go to OR for that, kid. " The chief nurse asked. " He's hoping to go to OR now, but there are complications, and we just don't know why. "
" We need you to take him to OR now, don't make any attempt to ignore him, " she told him sternly, but still managed to ask the same question.
" Sam, he's a good friend, but not one I'd ever want to make. " Tears flowed down her face, trailing down a great, curving down, step.
" There's something I need to tell you, " she finally managed, through gritted teeth. Her eyes were bloodshot. Tears showed through; she was still crying.
" I'm sorry. " She told him, her voice shaking. " I'm so sorry."

It was a meteorite crashing into my satellite dish while I was indoors. It felt great, but now I don't have space to put it down, so i have to close it. I could never go outside this early in the morning. Then the flash of an x-ray light, a thin, red glow. I felt the sun for the first time in ages, then was utterly silent for a long time.
The message on the satellite was getting fuzzy to me, so I decided to change the format and change the message to something that reminded me of food. Do you know what that looks like?
I turned the message to a picture that showed strawberries sprouting out of the horizon in small brown yellow flecks across it. Then it began to creep. I knew that this was something to eat. I didn't want to eat it, yet I took it with me on my walk back to my room. Even at first I thought I would have to wake up for a few hours but before I could, a strange sound emitted.
My parents were very excited at the sound of their child, as a big one! But then they saw a burning red sphere appear. Confused, i began to panic and running to the bathroom, when an untimely death occurred.
I slipped on a blanket and went to sleep. When the next ten hours past and it was still dark, I woke up to a sound. It was a room like the one I shared with my brothers and sisters. I saw a dog with a very messy face with a tail and a mouth and flailing hands around. I saw him angrily lick his buddy's hair and swore at him. The dog looked around and waved it's huge paw. Then it went back to eating.
I went downstairs and saw my sister and her dog with their own tails. The dog slowly let go of his paw and seemed to lick it. He then went back to sniff it and proceeded to doze off again.
I went downstairs to see what was making this noise. It was a clear blanket with several blankets covering it. All of the blankets all had black borders and 3 legs in each one. I saw my uncle pulling a two by four. He seemed happy and looked at the two dogs. Then suddenly the bottom of his eye dried. He's been taken away and he couldn't breathe.
I picked up my sister, and saw my family when she stopped licking her fur. She gave a wide smile and we hugged. She continued to lick at the blanket and I noticed something else, she put her own blanket aside and placed one hand on my head. Then she went looking for the black border and started to cry.
I couldn't see it at first. Then I saw a dog crouched in front of a large metal box in the middle of the room. It was a dog with a big pipe gun in it's mouth. After staring out of the black border for a few minutes, it ran over to the closest crate and pushed it into my lap, but as it got close it shot my cousin three times. Blood was pooling out of his nose. His blood was splattering all over the floor. My dad started to laugh and told me that I should put my blanket down. But I quickly figured it out. Now it's a bunch of little bugs doing the same thing over and over again. They make it bigger and bigger to have their mother's blood everywhere. They kill a lot of them without letting go of their own blood.
I woke up to a bright light and a weird feeling. When I walked out the door I felt bad. As I fell through the darkness, I heard a large explosion and black smoke. Only the sky had a clear blue color so i could see that it was small and didn't expand.
My brother's body was flying in the black haze. It had the same blue hue as my sister. I rushed home to my grandparents and told them I had saved the group of kids that they were chasing. " There is no harm in chasing other mice!" They replied. I knew they were. Then I saw a purple-eyed monster that I didn't recognize.<|endoftext|>

Envy has plagued my family for so long. They have all gone, bloated and shrunken to nothing more than broken bones, being whisked away into a puddle of ever more primal rage and rejection. They try to fill the world with the savage diety that only they can embrace.
My brother is literally dying, no longer able to seem in love due to the war, when his vitals fall into the snails, unfit for food, he is in dire straits. He is also battling it all.
My sister is covered in boils, and when her body gives in, tears are streaming down her cheeks and plaster her forehead. Her entire father still stands above her, blocking the way to the other side of the courtyard from the roaring sun. He will drown if they pass him, but he will not fight.
The prophecy, written long ago in the ancient scriptures, references power and unity. Given the love and tenderness of the world, humans never falter.
I have seen it all, but I doubt if I will ever see it.
The new plague, started by manufacturer, has the potential to engulf all. In long and slow time, humanity's efforts to combat the plague spread with them.
My family, under the massive stress of absorbing the plague, can not return to what once was. No-one can get out from underneath the beds, the breathing machines, or the kitchens that lead to the kitchens. This entire area was just filled by what was once filthy rats, growing the plague and destroying the living ones on the streets and below the buildings.
I will tell you now that we are all doomed. The only thing we will lose is ourselves.<|endoftext|>

I stood at the top of the ridge, listening to the blinding blue light reflecting off of the little crystals. Even though my surroundings were cloudy and the sounds were loud it wasn ’ t unbearable. It was something about the way my surroundings did not look the same either.
Blue crystals lay scattered about the horizon, looks of both foreboding and hopeful. I had no idea how long I had been here, I heard the song song once and ate the last of it, but I hadn ’ t thought of it, it sounded strange, I had no memory of actually telling you the song, but it was the same dark notes as the last. Why couldn ’ t the last part count? What was going on? It was three in the morning and I felt tired from walking behind this rock. Or what had happened to me this time? Where had I been going? It was time to head home.
Yet there I stood, at the peak of the ridge, following my trail in the direction we had just come. I closed my eyes for another few minutes as I walked, only to jump up and run through the crowd. I couldn ’ t keep going forever. I was tired, I had to get back home and get away from this people. Why wasn ’ t anyone there. Maybe my trail was next to a ghost, and maybe it was one of those buildings. I looked up to see what I was looking at. There was a group of people around me. As I turned around and looked at them, I heard a clap. As I reached for my gun, I looked around one more time before I ended up sitting on a nearby rock. It looked like a safe door, but with a huge metal door and maybe a piece of glass in the right place. There was a lock and I heard the clapping. I looked back at my flashlight and saw my brother running through the valley and shaking the glass. As he approached me the clap stopped.
“ Henry, Henry who is this? What do you want? ”
What is happening? What happened? It seems like so long ago now, could it be someone else? I felt the warmth of the sun warming my body. Looking up at the sky, I saw that I was surrounded by darkness. Slowly, slowly I began to understand the darkness around me. It was deeper now. It couldn ’ t be. My eyes opened for what seemed like an eternity, and I found myself on the footpath. My feet and hands were tied by ropes holding in each other. I closed my eyes again and turned my head towards the sky. Was this how I felt? I heard voices now, whispering and praying and calling me names.
“ Oh Daniel. We have seen more dark in your absence, but my brother is missing ”
“ He is gone. Why did you come back? ”
There was no one on the horizon.<|endoftext|>

The nameless figure did not need to see the phantoms in the coffin that he carried with him, but the blackened wood floor looked like a pitch black maze of rubble, rows of charred bones, and a single nail loomed in the air like a God at the center of it all.
The final nail was warm against his lips, deep within the tormented soul of the corpse of a warrior whose head was as cold as stone and whose spine was as tired and red and insubstantial. It had been raining for some time, but that was likely how he had managed to get away from the mounds of charred remains and collapsed bodies, forever to lay peacefully like many others before him.
Standing before the headstone in front of him was the figure, gazing down upon him in the same deathly white gaze that he had gazed upon the ghost of the dead at the end of the war. But even in such hellish conditions, such a malignant face so placid as to render even another's soul a fleeting and distant memory, was difficult to spot. The silent canvas was too much for that little creature, hardly able to hold its own apart from the weeping and weeping and sobbing and straying to the direction of his jeering, consumed corpse.
Without looking away he began his task, a task that the figure had practiced every day for years, months, and years, but it was impossible, impossible that he should ever change his actions. Every step left in his struggles was to shift it away from his emptiness and into a slight equal in this accursed realm. No new step was ever done that did not already be dealt, not to disappear entirely. The voice again awoke from the void of the husk, demanding something from the Great Executor's pitiful being. It recited the name of its horsemen and vowed to carry it across the muddy remains until these horrible words were given command over it.
It was dawn then, for thousands of miles away, a land far too cold and harsh to be called God's decrepit Earth, where an hour ago men and animals labored, clamoring, begging for the strength to march forward and claim the horizon. The great object in God's palm had come out from the abyss in a flash of thunder that reverberated through the now quiet city. It was God's commanding son to take the arches and stamp out all beneath the rushing waters, and in that moment, all was done.
Not a drop of water was shed; the scars and claws of war never faded. The blazing fire radiated the light of battle not just from the stars but also from the moon. The castle was beneath them now, its shattered image reflecting almost the same corruption and horror from the early days of war. Barely a half block in length lay bare its scars from the trenches of the former enemy and its bloodthirsty tears as its rotten bodies soaked up and swallowed it all up. The trenches were empty, and it was an honor to be one of them.<|endoftext|>

"How are you feeling today? "
"... "
" I've been feeling exhausted and worryingly about time lately. Something's clearly caught on, " he shook his head and sipped his coffee.
" What it is? I feel like I'm dead, " I said. " Something really is smoking. "
" Not just those things... something *really* is smoking. "
" Oh my god, " he shouted, shaking his head. " Just let me know, " he said, looking at the waitress. " Is everybody alright? "
" Uhh... yeah, I think everyone is out, " she replied. " Have a nice day. "
" Thanks, " I said, easing my grip on my cane.
She plopped down next to me and walked over to the bar behind me. " I should probably get you something, " she said.
" Sure, " I replied.
" I always pick nice drinks, though, " she said. " It's not uncommon for you to go when you need to, but *everyone* does, and still, I just want to put my finger on something good. "
I met her eyes. " Oh, well... " I said. " This is interesting. Any hints of something odd going on? "
" This is - "
" Yeah, sure, " she said, throwing her arms around my waist. " I'm thinking you might be into - "
" You're- "
" Yeah, just - you can't just pick someone else's- "
" That's just rude! What the - why would you pick them - *personally? * It's like... right! I think I almost left your set on the table... "
" Yeah, " she said, smiling. " Well. I wanted to make sure, since I heard it on the radio... you know - "
" Oh my God, " I said. " Do you really want me to hear that? "
" Sure, " she said. " Just let me know, don't take anything for granted! "
" Just let me know, " I said.
She looked at me and shook her head. " Yeah. I thought you always picked nice - "
" Hey, guys, " she said, twirling around her chair. " This is interesting. I've heard a few things about it too, from your friends. Maybe you should ask them. "
" Sure, " I said.
" I think that *you* should ask them, " she said.
" Yeah, " I said, pulling my hands up to my face.
" Goodnight. Love you," she said.<|endoftext|>

Clarissa bit her lip and looked from the screen to the door as the chilling rays of the sun poured over them.
*Start the translation. *
As the two faced each other she looked up from the monitor. The hot summer sun casting its ill-fitting rays through her red emerald eyes. The window had creaked as it shut. A new one with an occasional pungent odor coming off of it.
**THE WAY I KNOW YOU ARE WITH ME DOES N'T ENLIGHTEN YOURSELF. YOU ARE MY DAD*
"Are you sick? " Sarah asked, half choking and half coughing.
" I am thirsty. " her voice was softer than her words, softer, silky, even. " I am sick, and I need you to let me know. I'll stop at least a moment. "
Clarissa stared up at the ceiling as a trembling hand wrapped around her throat. The cold metal around her neck seemed to grab hold as her gaze fell to the screen as the screen refocused and a faint smile came to Sarah's eyes. " It's okay, " she said reassuringly. " Go to sleep. "
They were gone for a moment before her exicance faded. The fresh feeling of both being caught by someone washes over her as she slowly drifted out of the room and onto the bed, peering into her former lover's eyes. Tears rolled down her cheeks as she smiled and she felt for the knife to the neck. * I can be yours. *<|endoftext|>

I stare down at the white marble floor, which only made it the second worst decision I've made in my life.
I breathe deeply. My host gestures, and through me I can see the color my soul has produced.
It's not good.
It's not beautiful.
I end my gaze, and think of how I got here in the first place.
The city lights are blinding me.<|endoftext|>

They had always tried to call it anti-Hitler.
"The Jews have no hell. " Earth's once benevolent alien ambassador said. " Do not belive that I was the last God to greet the Chosen One through the internet. "
The rest of the council was silent, each one with an exasperated look on their face.
The Inter-Galactic Holy Catechism had denounced every other religion. Had the pope loved his existence? Nah. Didn't really care.
They'd all heard these sounds. A bunch of couples a day pacing their heels, eyes glued to the ceiling, hands on their knees.
It was even blasphemy.
It was a show of fear, of revenge, of allowing the suffering of others to pay for your sins.
" To deliver the son of God is an evil one. We shall not treat others in the same way. "
Humanity got up and stormed out of the room. Humanity sat silently for a moment before the Abbadonan huffed and said, " Nice try. "
The vast room was quiet. They had made it. Christ had been lead astray, he was dead. The fight for their souls had finally broken out. Humanity toiled away with its own gears and souls, fighting enemies all the while.
And still... it was still he.
" Hail Lord Jesus! Please save my child! " Earth yelled.
He looked around at the other council members, almost as if he knew them but he didn't. " Lord, we did not speak very ill of you. " The alien ambassador said, gesturing for Earth to take his place.
" Oh, God, I don't believe you. Christ did such a terrible thing with his time on Earth. His own time on Heaven, I may add. "
" Like I have done before! He was all righteous in both the way he lived. "
" Yes, ha! This time he did a good job of protecting his child. But a good job of starting another universe too? A good job of showing compassion to our kind? " Earth cried out.
" Yes! Yes we have done enough, " the extroverted alien said.
" Ha, but God had enough of them, " another representative from another dimension said. " I am in agreement. Their son is an unholy parasite, causing suffering to others that can not be met with forgiveness. So let him live in the misery of humanity. "
Earth clenched his fists, felt a cool breeze against his forehead. " I have tried. Jesus is not an unfunny one, but like every blasphemer should be dead, I am not afraid of any less being a tainted reflection of my Father. "
The alien ambassador shook his head. " That is not even the most ludicrous idea. " He said, taking an ancient grave from the nearby desert. " You can't take Him! "
Earth's face was not of anger or hatred, but of fear. It had been terrible, but it had been better than nothing.
" Do not fret! You don't know the truth. You are God, you don't come from your Father. "
" Who are you then? "
" I have heard that so much. You belong in the Golden Spiral Realm of You. "
" What realm? " Earth shouted out.
" The Golden Spiral Realm of You. Every day, on your deathbed, you hold a wail of pain. "
" Where is it? "
" With every one of your children. "
" How do you know? "
" I want a war! " Earth said.
" But you can not do that! "
" You're growing up! And being a little leerless! You're breaking up with Humanity. "
" It's your birthright! And for that you are rewarded! "
" Oh! " Earth said. " Oh. " He was astray.
" I never thought of that. Sorry."<|endoftext|>

The clock struck the old-timey outside the pub. It was late, but there was a warm feeling in my gut as I watched his face float around in his red velvet suit of yellow tweed jacket, his glasses floating lazily on the cheap barstool. My fingers traced his chart, his finger sloping ever so slightly and raising my gaze to the next buson bell, a rhinoceros, upside down and buzzing with buzz. Yes, that's just what I like about him. He was each and every one of us, and yet he was as quite as human a guy as there was any other man I knew. His natural features were still that of a burly London barkeep, with long blonde hair that floated out of the bay window. That almost certainly didn't count as my job, because in all my free time I'd been with rats outside living on the beaten backs of their red-washed, rich green slabs, who somehow had been left alive by the stern government decision to not allow our best vivisected canines in.
"So," he started. I'd remembered him saying this to me several times in my job, and there was no way that I didn't have an answer. * Hi* he said. * What's it gon na be? * I finally finished my short story arc when he looked up from his long business card to flick the cap on his tweed cap, his eyes straining with the tears in his eyes.<|endoftext|>

Remember the purge? ( Go figure ), it's fair to say we've all had our paychecks drained from our wallets already. Two weeks into all this, one of our next annual audits revealed a startling surge in the "Purge " numbers.
So naturally we didn't keep it up. " Cure " is a lotto, but with a " BOARD " low, that's a lie. The purge is the next step for the party.
So, this has been going on for years, in the way that the purge helps us keep track of who our members will be. 30 years ago I began this purge, and have seen enough evidence to show that I can't cover it up. But this is what's going to happen. Soon, the purge will be done...
I'm standing at the base of a massive railway, a gargantuan warehouse, almost scaled up to to fit the size of a skyscraper. Sure, it's perfectly possible we don't actually have a purge purge, but enough evidence have pointed to that possibility, and it seems probable.
I've seen people running, people with nothing, and nowhere to run. And I've also heard them planning a purge... on top of it.
A job well done, within a week of this job being done. Even in a place with so many people having been plucked, such a disaster seemed close enough. And indeed, the economy is currently booming, but where in hell is poverty?
Perhaps, I assume, we could run a " purge of ill will " on top of this, before it kills everyone else, such as me. I would be charitable to call it good for the citizens, for the economy.
Oh, what a time to be alive! From over there, drifting amongst all of that is yet another shiny utopia that seems to come with time. Everything seems looking up.
It's January 2nd, and the purge is done. It's only a matter of time. Right as the day begins and, at the last minute before our purge, we so desperately look for another way to keep track of what's down.
It's like the smoke has covered this city for 50 years, with the town we're heading in no way resembling any other.
" Sarcasm!"
- I'm standing on the tracks, having a good chuckle that may well have been longer than the rest of my seconds. I mean, no one says the purges are a good idea.
Even if they were, I wouldn't run the purge in front of them.<|endoftext|>

“ You said you ’ re happy, wouldn ’ t you? ”
I finished reading, and began typing. My hands glided across the keyboard quickly, making sweeping movements across the page. It wasn ’ t as if I was sure if the match was real or not, but both acted as a cinch. The initial sequence looked fake, though. That meant it was definitely fake. I had to get back to my phone. I only had a few other things on it; all of my apps; some were empty and I would need to use again later. More supplies and supplies are popping up in the next room.
“ Hey man! What ’ s your new playlist? ” a voice shouted from the left.
“ Same here, Jim. Wait, you aren ’ t going to get me wrong, I have *your* playlist. ”
A snap of the fingers and the voice died; I laid across the far end of the room and stared at the empty screen. My phone went black; the red text box reappeared in front of my face. It was the last text message I received.
'People are truly confused right now. You are not happy.'
I paused, heart pounding in my chest. The phone on my lap stared back at me, the red text box flicking to attention as my feet would slap down hard against the wall beneath me. 'Are you still with me? We need to get out.'
I stared at the words written on the blank white screen.
*I loved you so much... *<|endoftext|>

Two of the girls were playing as I was writing this and one of them was staring. She was 5 and a half years old, but looked pretty smart with blue eyes and long green hairs. There was nothing I would have done to change it. I would have moved, taken care of, spent time as a child with her. She would tell me she was feeling overwhelmed with sadness and I would ask her why. She would look confused for a second, and for a bit, then reply "He's so lonely, he ’ s lonely, mommy is lonely, mommy is lonely, never give up " from somewhere in between. It never hit me that this was not what I expected.
“ I'm sorry, Mommy won ’ t be coming home. I just don ’ t understand why she won ’ t come home, ” she said, trying to sound strong.
“ Please, I don ’ t understand anything, she will come home with me. ” I responded with a shrug. I opened my mouth and smiled.
Before I had time to react, however, the door behind me crashed. I slowly, cautiously opened my eyes and saw that my dog had already shown up.
“ Thank you, Kittens, great to see you again. Don ’ t worry I ’ ll see you again soon. ”
I sat up in a tired voice, lying on my side with my mouth closed. I looked around me to see where I was. What was going on? It was not the first time I had cried. I struggled back up from my spot at the back of my bed, as I started to rub my eyes and try to get better. A new room was available on the front step of the house, there was a sofa, plates and towels. This couldn ’ t be happening.
The next door to the room in which I lived sat empty. I walked to the sofa, grabbed the sofa as I went, then swung open the door to find my beautiful 3-year old dog.
“ Mommy? What ’ s wrong? ” he replied, but before I could ask her, I got a bad feeling. I heard him say something, I did not understand what it was, but I must have looked to see if he was saying something. I didn ’ t know how to react.
“ Mommy! ” I yelled. “ Please, don ’ t get scared. Daddy is having a bad day, mommy is hurting my feelings. ”
I looked away in fear, but my mother was just beside me with her arms around my waist. I sat up, trying to rationalize everything that had just happened, but my eyes were already watering.
“ Sweetie, sweetie, no need for this, Daddy is yelling things, something isn ’ t right. I ’ m not talking to you. Mommy, Mommy is a little angry, it ’ s been bothering me for awhile, I want to talk to you, but don ’ t move. ”
“ Sweetie, sweetie, we ’ re ok. I love you Mommy, I ’ m happy I have you as my baby. ”
I turned around, and saw my beloved, not my family and soon it would be over.<|endoftext|>

Out I stumble down the stairs. What is that?
"Dad? Where are they? "
A chill runs down my spine. Daddy was supposed to come pick me up last year. He missed me at least two days.
" Stay right there, Tom, " I manage a grin.
" Sit down. "
Okay I could sit down, I should try and slow it down a bit. But I can't.
" Mommy says there are kids downstairs, they're safe. One or two? "
What? I thought I heard a rustling.
" Bring them, " the grumpy wind snatches me away.
" Put them down. "
Right now it's painful. But if I had to decide, I'd think of something.
As I lie down in my room, I'm going to remember those faces. The ones with the red eyes, the scar running up their arms, the wide brimmed hat, and their swollen lips. I'm going to remember those faces.
Then suddenly I realise, a shadow.
" Daddy? How can they have seen me? "
My wife starts to scratch at her eyes. As they close over for the rest of the day, Santa opens his robe.
" Good job, " I say to myself. I look down at my hands. This is all a shock. And a smile.
Santa starts to walk towards the kitchen. I extend a hand and he appears.
" Hey guys, good work, " Santa looks like he just stepped out of a Disney movie. " This should be a good adventure to get through the night."<|endoftext|>
