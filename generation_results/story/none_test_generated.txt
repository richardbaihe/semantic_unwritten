There wasn't much to say to the story, but I'm more than interested in the narrators past and future. I felt I didn't have much of a deal with the central character and I don't know how they feel about the intrusive thoughts left behind by a dying citizen in the desert. It might work for some tense scenes or someone showing up at the end to express frustration, but I think it's one-dimensional and superficial.<|endoftext|>

“ You ’ re so young, ” I said through all my tears. The picture of Lily was beautiful. Her blue eyes, green hair and sparkling teeth were perfect. There was a lot of gold on those faces. There were even chocolate cake candles she had placed the year before that burned bright. I could see the hints of the chocolate cake in her hand and the one freckle that fell on her cheek. But my hand wasn ’ t touching the picture, so I don ’ t know what the picture was for. I just stood up and ran to the door. She left in a sprint, tears welling up in my eyes. I got there only a second later. She looked up from the picture and my heart sank. I ran past her behind the counter and grabbed the bottle of chocolate cake and milk. She said it as loudly as she could, looking confused. I pushed her to the back of the truck with a jingle and walked over to where the lights were. Lily walked down the street. Her red hair was black and she had a black suit. She took a sip of her milk and showed me a picture of herself in the picture. Her eyes wide with anticipation. I looked at the picture and raised my hand. I got up, only to see her lips curl into a smile. I pressed a finger to her lips and the picture faded back into the past. My heart sank once again. She explained everything. My left eye was still closed but it refused to move. I tried holding it but I was too tired and the light returned to my eyes. As her eyes did the picture faded, replaced by the picture of myself. She put her hand on my shoulder and pulled me towards the door. I sat in front of the door and looked up at her. I held her hand and she knelt down. She turned around, grinning. We kissed for a moment. Then she closed the door behind us.<|endoftext|>

Tom climbed down the flight of stairs I needed to climb. The ceiling was covered with rotors, but all that remained was my surgeon's Pelt. No idea how long it will take to get out, but it was a nice sturdy metal unit and all the other, old rusted repair parts cost less than it would cost someone to get rid of. When my rusted beam of light illuminated the dusty corridor, I knew it was time to get on with my ritual. My brethren and I had been descending this way for some time. The hallway and corridor were completely carpeted, so that no skeleton could walk through them. I could just see sliver of light shining through the cracks that separated the tile floors. After a few minutes of crawling along my stuff-stained floor, I reached a massive, flickering cast, the big yellow logo reminiscent of a monkey, gilded like an eagle's plumage, decorated with a few gold stars in a jewel-coated garb. The only other visible entrance to this hallways was a greenery where the corridor ended. I stepped closer to the finish, my worn foot dragging with every step. I was happy to finally be out here. I began my ascent. The long spiral staircase to the right stood before me in memoriam. Years, centuries passed before I arrived here. I approached the spot on the far wall that you didn't even know existed. Because of an earthquake in the 1800s, the entrance was sealed off because a mess of elevator shafts had forced some of the doors open. This trick had left a huge crater into the ground, eventually, no one could go through the door but the rest of us. We had decided to keep going, while at the same time reinforcing the passage. Instead of focusing our attention on the cave entrance, we focused instead on watching the arrival of the heroes and hunters that had come to slay us. I packed as much cloth and hair and tools as I could muster, when the sound of gnashing teeth smashed through the silence. The other of the heroes, the man who I lost in the hallway, looked at me and nodded in unison, walking through the gaping opening which before I had entered. If he was going to help us in, he must have fallen for our tricks. I muttered a thanks to him, and pointed down the hall. It was almost time. Every step felt like it was going to be harder than ever. I peaked into the glowing light. The first thing I saw was the dust particles scattering across the floor, forming a wall. There was no sign of life, however, but the silhouette of a young boy I had treated last week... oh my goodness, the boy I gave birth to! Not a soul here would find out until they heard the screams, deep in the recesses of my mind. The first thing I saw was the nose and eyes on the boy, but of course, he was shorter, more overweight, with grey eyes looking down at me as if he had just slain someone, or had simply fallen for some stupid trick. My friends and I were all excited, so I decided to take a quick peek at him. When I turned to look at his beautiful little face, I was greeted with the same disorienting sight you see when you look at a face carved by tragedy. Small blue eyes staring down at me. I buried my face in his right cheek and basked in the familiar scent of the stench of death. As I looked at him again, the urge behind me filled me. My body tensed and I heard his gentle whisper of "Dad!"<|endoftext|>

Part 1 "Ahh the stench of dying glory. " The demon slouched down on a throne, overlooking the forbidden city of Azar, flanked by what may be covered in armory, armor, scrolls, statues, and more personal equipment. It had made its way across this barren plain, leaning against the wall and staring at the empty hallway. " The last thing we needed were all the things we had left. How long have we waited. " An ancient one spoke, cackling. " What would they need to care about? " Another one spoke again, cackling, seemingly amused with what they were saying. " Mankind has discovered that we are eternal at the end, and that will not happen. Can we save the humans? " The demon spoke, using its magic to curse the people who would take up arms against us. One or two men turned back to their duty, glancing over their shoulder at each other. " Why kill us? " " Why fight us? " " Why kill everyone? " " Why? " The demon questioned, debating his next words. The dead-struck mans turned to the last man, sipping on his drink, which was soon brought back to him. " Why? " The demon began, unsure of how he could answer this. " Why kill us? " The man was beginning to mull over all the trivial things that the demon might ask of him. " Why fight us? " " Why? " " Why? " The demon asked. The first man stared for a moment at the demon in front of him. He was now completely afraid. * Would his body be destroyed? * he thought to himself. He wasn't particularly violent, although he was quite aggravated with himself for it. As the man turned the corner into the room, the first one behind him shouted at him for his outburst. " Stop this crap! Stop this thing! You never said anything! We don't know where it came from! It's never here! Stop it! " The whole room shouted in fear. Each time, one of the demons picked itself up and pulled him up. " It's inside this beast, " the demon muttered softly. " What's inside? Why are there monsters so terrible? Is this inside the door that's supposed to handle everything? " The other one, had stood up. " Yeah, and nobody else would have gone that far. No. " The demon gave a big smile, revealing a large spider, just as huge as it was, as if it was of steel itself. " Well, here goes nothing. " He had said as he drew the weapon. " Tell you what: I don't care if you keep it or not. " The demon drew on the spider, allowing it to retract its arm. The demon pulled a glint out of its left eye, peeking through the transparent eye that showed through the visor of the great black insect as it orbited around it. " This is my weapon. " " You're lucky you stopped, " another demon said, obviously noticing it. " You're the last of your kind. Now come back to the chamber and watch us work. " The other demons shook their heads. " You're not the last. If we could, we wouldn't have to get carried away for what happened. " The demon took a step back, staring sadly at the wall. After a few seconds, it stood up, awaiting the visitor. The two stood in silence for a moment, staring at each other. " You have always been kind to me. Always decided to help me out, ever so often. " " That's right! I became very kind to you! That's what I want to do! " The stranger went quiet for a few seconds, then continued, " And I know that you're not going to be our last, but not your last."<|endoftext|>

It's actually a really cool concept - every memory I put onto the Internet is fodder for an army, waiting and giving the correct information to every hitler from every terrorist organization. The soldiers look down as people well remember first the how their heads ached and how their brains screamed - so they sobered and thought "oh, it was fun! ". The soldiers get the information about an individual, but remember they will be pawned off. Even simple simple tasks such as breeding, releasing our children... The battlefield is littered with memories of bad times, choices and of how to act now. Maybe if the army was not so bad, they may have fought together, just like they used to do, with their one big buddy. And so back to boot. Or at least that's how it works. The Army gives us... the good memories. " Thank you for your permission. " The soldier says patting the soldier's head, as he takes his six-wheeler to the safe. In three days, we might have another anniversary of war to remember. " Do we need the time? " the soldier says. " I have two-on-one training so stay with me. " So he goes and mop the lawn, just because. " Go and mop it, " he says, as he gets up and stands there. The soldier looks down at the field, noticing a few stray objects pointing at him. As his grip loosens, he throws away his uniform and walks to his truck. He drives to the old location of the village where he works, first in the field and then in his truck. As he exits, he looks up and notices a young girl in a tank sitting there, giggling. He wants to take her to this place. His truck is at his destination. " I'm driving back, so follow me," he says. As he turns the corner towards his camp, he sees a truck stop outside the village. He can see the shooters using their guns. He runs up the hill, determined to find this place, which the soldiers saw in several videos.<|endoftext|>

**It was the moment I had one last go at the White Collapse. The world was shaken and everyone without fail shouted the eulogy of all the people who'd committed suicide, pulling the galaxies apart in victory. The my son was there, watching over him for the last time. Since the beginning he had acted as his guardian angel and set out to save the world. But today he was no longer there. "By the grace of god, " he shouted into the abyss " help me deliver the victims. " It had been eleven days of pain and grief since he died, and he was finally bringing the pain into the world again. It took him several hours to deliver the eulogy, only to fall flat on his face and try to breathe. The many millions listening in the distance stood still with silent eulogies of the dead and what they felt as their entire humanity fell to their knees. He stood up, walked out and into the middle of a crowd. His eyes now wandered around for a few minutes before settling on a small girl. She was smiling in the mirror, as if it were a chance to finally try and find happiness. It was true, though - it looked pretty funny. The kids on the sidewalk jogged past and he could see her giggling and giggling, laughing and... giggling. A scar started on her face. **Crash** The world around him was spinning. What had happened? He had driven through all of it. He couldn't see her because everything was spinning. He also couldn't hear any voices. No one was speaking, and only the cars were moving. Before he knew it the area was spinning again. He looked down and saw there were only over one people remaining. And that was it. Then he noticed something he hadn't noticed before. Her skin was speckled with the yellowish yellow residue. He looked up and heard the shrill shriek of her inner ear. He looked down at the earth, and saw the dull thud of the earth being destroyed. He saw stars moving in the distance, their blue lights dimmer. The world quickly began spinning. The earth shook, kicking the dust in the air as something crashed into it. But nothing returned to the Earth. For a moment his entire body felt pain and numbness. His voice was the only sound. * " Thanks!" *<|endoftext|>

I fumble with the knob for what feels like hours. In this infinitely vast desert world, nothing seems to matter. Conscious nothingness is not a constant but a constant that can be been kicked in quite a bit. Every hour that passes is at a new level, like a prison that holds no hope of escape. I practice sprinting every hour; the excitement feels off the inside, almost as if I have escaped a physical torture chamber. I walk to the edge of the fireplaces, the indescribable heat of the flames putting out more and more fire. I know I have to hurry, I can't prepare for it. My heart is pounding a little now. Each time I step in the shower, I yell out *Ok, so shower is only a few minutes away! I will go now! * I can feel the heat of the water stream through my hair, the steam of my breath, the smell of my lover, my long white locks. I fumble with the handle, but the screw is loose. It is the only way out, and for a moment I think I have finally done it. It can't possibly be that simple for me. The tension in the hot water is still there, but it is quiet, defeated. I turn back on the shower, heading for the bedroom. I can't imagine how things will turn out, and I don't even know how long I will be like this. The thought of the small shower cast me into total abject terror, and I still can't take it anymore. The tiny corner of my throat pokes out from under my gown, and the dull, white light from beneath tiptoes around my skin. Without even moving from the dresser, I grab for the key. Slowly the blood begins to drip from the barrel of the gun, breaking the tension on the phone. I kick the chair off, threw off my sweats and stood up. I squeeze the knob and march to the bathroom. They are still there, the long shower flowing into the sink; only the heat from the fire is helping make it keep going. I try to lock the door but the wall disappears, there is nowhere to go, I am free. My mind is broken, my body is knocked to the floor. My head hurts, and I can't take it anymore. Without thinking, I grasp the gun firmly, opening the safety and shaking the lock. "NO!" -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - About halfway through the funeral, I'm sitting across from my fiancee who is still holding onto the phone, crying. My heart is beating slower, but I am still not moving. Not because I am weak, but because I am alone. I weep, and my head is pounding again, and again, and it continues to hammer on my chest. Tears rise from my cheeks, and as I reach for the phone, I reach for the knob.<|endoftext|>

[ Click. ] Heh. That's from what they call me. Long gone is the last bit of me living for now, and I guess I just lost my sense of appearance. My house, nothing special, as usual. Still, the closet isn't *crazy* enough. My closet got demolished a long time ago, missing me and shedding all living things. Took me a long time to reach my neighbours house, to hide the mess. What they didn't realize, though, was that my closet would eventually be mine. I now look rather normal, compared to people's decrepit, decaying rooms. My clothes are covered in graffiti. The windows are shuttered. I slept in the right door of my house for about 3 years, just to remember how I looked. I forgot I had enough money to continue living in the old attic that was once my bedroom. The outside is the same: dank, clean, still warm and dry. You can tell that the outside is becoming colder by the change from scorch marks. My fur smells and tastes like piss. I'm so uncomfortable here, living alone, alone, I don't want to live with these monsters. They might be the only friend I have left. Though maybe I'll have their blood on my hands for now. But in the end, you get to pick who your guardian angel will be.<|endoftext|>

Joe never imagined what this would be like, what he was about to experience. Then again, maybe he is now. J.F.R.U.N.S. Just more than average height of what appeared to be Paul Steele of the 80's, with that prominent emerald tint that greeted him as someone who was no more than ninety and and much smaller by the time I opened my mouth to exclaim what would happen was the next drug cocktail that the IAF ( an organization of the finest assassins in the world ) successfully put in place with a serum for patients with terminal ailments using the serum. They's my three words. The rules are simple. Use good word. This drug of mine would make of 180 pounds of muscle, beautiful. Fantastic this should be top sellers. And the price should be sixty. At least he is slimmer than Paul though so hopefully not more than sixty. Time to explain myself. I knew this would be simple, I was a working man a million years ago and perfected the death penalty. Right then, as soon as i declared it a law and the drug becomes prescription legal, I began with the simple order of blood testing. Oh I already messed up my chemical engineering work so that 5mg benzos would be more lethal than the usual 4mg amphetamines, and thus at a fifty, and thus at a eleven. Six shots to the head i mixed with two various menthols, then kept the money flowing down to the rest of my bloodline for the 30 days. Five years old. That's it, five years of fucking hell. What am I going to get with me? A guy taller than I am. He'll drive me around to get a better shot at killing my mother or father. He'll fight my older sister that killed her grandparents. He'll wander in on my cousins that managed to die of rope poisoning. Those people saved me from murder at sixty by going to the wrong people. Ah yes, hopefully someone amateurs in handling "bullshit".<|endoftext|>

The first word I said to my mother, that had the same effect as gold on her cheeks. But her eyes never fluttered, and instead went straight from yellow to dark brown. For a moment, my life was practically frozen in place, and I still thought of why she liked black. She told me before that yes, your eyes would be the same colour, and not in any positive way. I laughed it off, telling her the truth. Like the mirror or the computer, she didn't. If you can't blink, you probably won't be able to actually use your eyes. And that's what my mother used to say, but now she probably isn't convinced. I hid in the corner when my father took me off from school, and had our local transit system take us both off the bus. Despite my parents growing up in poverty and suffering from extreme poverty, my mother still talked about her interest in black, and wearing a black tunic and hat at night. And the weird thing is, that these days I don't even mind having black eyes, not ever for that long. I just need a little extra light in my room. I had been waiting for a lot of time, but I can't have another minute of my life without having black eyes. I figured I would start wearing a metal dress, then go to bed. So, I waited. Just. Woke up. The next morning, it was raining. I didn't expect it, but a fire had lit up my room. The smell was weird, and I felt my heart jump. It was normal after awhile. Then something, slimy and heavy... stopped. Its skin was stretched thin, and it had black pupils. Although there was a pretty pale skin, it was actually pink, and I heard myself utter the words: "You found a notebook that can read ink, and you read it faster." Eventually, my eyes closed. My mind shuttered. I couldn't see a doctor, but the class was on and my mother realized her something. Suddenly my eyes started adjusting, the pressure inside of them starting to control the room in my eye color. Well, a while after, after I placed them up, they opened up at almost the same time. I still can't understand why my eyelids were trying to open at such a rapid rate, because no-one could. It was as if someone was trying to read my mind. But after my eyelids just opened, my heart was shivering. The color was back. And that's when I had black eyes.<|endoftext|>

Subject: Perspective is using limited wording. The beginning is rather ambitious, but instead of a simple description and comprehensive exposition the reader can put in the sentence: "I tried harder and succeeded. " It could have possibly set itself apart, be a hair on edge. An upside-down critique. I found it a little chunky; the gentle feel of the rough shoulderboard as it grazed it's precious marble makes it feel like you might stick your head in it and it bumps out with an awful pop and you ’ re seeing streaks on the hardwood. I wish that Gary was on the side of experimentation, one could never know how in-depth and animalistic you made the book, but that would have been a shame. If you had had Gary here, you would have had me examining various scenes in this book with him. Gary is an integral part of a seemingly ethereal entity, a result of reading the words of a voice or picture in the pages of the book. In fact, he has as much of a voice as all the others, and if his words had come as a surprise by your attention he would probably have been tolerable if you had asked nicely; he would have been likable. It is refreshing to see the author work with opening and ending to structure. All of the last 15 to 20 pages have been shown in the corner of the page. A clear progression from there, with descriptions of meaningful shifts in perception and emotions. Imagine Gary in a world that is broken down. There are too many details, too many important interactions all held up in the box that somehow were made to be better than each other. And by that, we are pushed into an incredibly small space. I can't offer you much more but in general, you added such great detail into how the world works. I would very much like some feedback!<|endoftext|>

I fell over on the bed, my bed rolling around my knees as the bullets pierced my nose. I could almost smell the revolver, gas spitting in the air before... I cut my eyes open to see a bulge in the blindfold, and before I could react, I heard a sharp *crippling noise*, hitting me hard against the bed, killing me instantly. "HERB! " yelled the startled man at my feet, while the woman held my head in her hands, looking me straight in the eyes. She tried to grab the gun, but my hand was strong enough to dig up her skull, " Your wife was murdered before you could find her. Grab him! She'll probably get worse than yours. " " Why? " " My wife wasn't about to eat *her*!" I clutched the gun between my teeth, and held tight as the bullet hovered inches above me, pinning me down to the bed.<|endoftext|>

"*Is it going to kill you if he kills you? * ", she asks. I don't listen, but I just accept it. She tells me she's going to take me to the hospital. On the way there, she beats me to it. She's going to kill me in the morning, and then she's going to make sure I'm still alive before I come back. I follow her to the hospital. A plain white room with no doors. There's one woman there. She's busy working on a new one of her research projects. " *Hello David, how may I help you today? * " She says, calmly. Of course, David never listens. His one true friend. The reason I still let him hang out with his wife who's gone missing. Why it makes his problems more apparent. Why I changed his mind about it. Yes, I understand. And maybe I'm not the only one. " *What's going on? Did you kill her? How should I know? * " She asks. " *I killed her, I had no reason to do so, and the same only happened, and was never told. When I saw her, she didn't look like much, but she had the look of the hero that everyone looks for. But maybe one day, she will find out that the killer is all alone. * " " That's our story. Those are the only words that describe how important I am to you. Now, I don't want to give away too many details about it, but I know that I should. So many questions are left unanswered, but I know I have to tell them. Until then, remember that you are the reason I died. For I will make sure that your memory stays the same, that my feelings for you are too. You are the reason I took you to the hospital, and given you the opportunity to live your life. Now, everything will be fine. I still have one question. The one you are so loved by, but you also loved me. * " " *Who will save my life? * " She asks. " *The devil... Is he trying to kill us? *" As she was finishing, I noticed him turning off the television. He chuckled to himself. He was all alone in his private bathroom, and the mirror in front of him. The reflection of the television caught his eyes. He laughed it off. He had a very large number of images of his face. One, " You sick bastard! " Another, " So wicked! " A third, one, " Have a nice day! " Yet, a fourth was echoed by the three faces at the mirror the next day. The reflection had an unusual beauty, and a remarkable sense of humor. The image of his face seemed almost fake. But something of this power, they all seemed to catch on. No matter what, he would always look like the one that had the smile on his face every day. The image that got the most attention. Today was different. He kissed her. Not a kiss, but a kiss that left nothing to chance. He laughed it off. He had to. It was a sick game that he was playing. There was the flight to Atlanta, a few flights of stairs to a fancy suite in Beverly Hills, lots of happy family, lots of money. He drove to a nearby Starbucks. He even put his order on the coffee table. He came down to the West Side.<|endoftext|>

I am standing over a large bed on the midriff. I have a blanket that covers my lap as I have a reading kit for my nightstand. I just love my new double bottomed bed. It is cozy as I always go on a dates night, but this week was something different. People as different as yourself truly understand who you are. I am the devil, however. The only stranger in the world. I once had a woman begging me to grant her any wish in exchange for a lamp. The devil dressed up in a black robe and hood. You would think they would expect physical shape. No! They don't. The sad thing is, that wasn't until he melted the devil back into the dark and twisted flesh of the human race. What I can offer them, it's so simple. They write on that hood "I can grant you 100 wishes from right here in hell. " Now, I can't let them see this power! They can not go to heaven. Not like that!!! I know it, I know how they see it. I am the devil. " Ok, but then, he has to grant one another 100 wishes. I can grant them 100 wishes from anywhere in hell. " I look at her slowly. She holds up her hand. " Have you lost all faith in me? " " No you haven't. Now go away. " I turn around and walk away. I don't want to be in heaven. My life has sucked so much. I have to endure hell for the rest of my life. But why? It is so painful to be in hell. It keeps trying to get me out but they have to dig and dig in other places. What was worse is that they can't even touch me. I wanted to die in an accident. They can't even touch me. I looked into her eyes. " What did I do wrong? " her grin broke into a grin. " Oh it didn't do anything. You wanted to go away. Look God I... I need you. I love you so much. " With a crazed look on her face, I ask her " Why are you all scared in this house? " " I, erm, am right here. I just wanted you to know that I am so sorry. " " Ok. I haven't asked this question before. To you I'm sorry."<|endoftext|>

At about 10:30 A.M. my name comes into the conversation that is going to make every party room special. After a few hours our psych was crystal clear. "So.. What are your secret? " Jeff asked me. I put his face into my hands and said, " My secret.. You gave me your number your whole life.. " He seemed not to notice me, of course, it was his face that was constantly shifting. Everyone likes it that way. " I trust you the right way you should trust me, the one you trust. " Jeff said. " How is it that no-one wants to touch you like you do? " I asked. I rarely trust anyone else, especially mine, right? " Listen Jeff, I've never really said it before. You saw me walk through the door " I glanced him over " Damn you Andrew and I don't even like to eat people. Listen I've got a gift for you guys so you don't get to go there if you have to. And I really don't like going to parties anyways. " His eyes went down to the back of my throat. " Listen Andrew, I've got a special gift for you here. I'm going to take you home and I'm going to make it tough on you. If you'd let me handle it, we'd have. " He looked down at my shoulders " If you go to this party Andrew, get yourself ass down here and be safe. The next time I do that, I will get serious messages of self harm from the people who see me, those loving, people you know well. You might not even know what I'm up to but that doesn't mean you can't talk to me. " He paused for a long second and stared at me, his face darkening slightly. A soft tug started at my mouth, " Hey Andrew " I whispered, trying to put my voice back in. He still smiled and took off running. I felt more at ease now than ever. I rushed to the back of the party where all the wild parties had started to die out. It was now 8:30 A.M. I grabbed a drink out of my pocket and was out to the party by 10. Suddenly in the distance I heard someone coming towards me. " Hey Andrew, get up! You know something I wanted to tell you. You've got to treat people like what they are. Don't judge them.. And don't tell anybody.. " I said out loud. " Help me get this *Nasty Girl* off your leg! " Andrew looked confused. He looked at me, " Did you do that? " I slowly turned around and ran towards him. " I did and that's why I am here, to talk to you. " " Andrew, get my attention! " I yelled, grabbing him with all my strength. I told him to keep running. He turned around and started to run back towards the party. I kept yelling, " I love you to hell! You don't know me what I mean but I love you too damn much!" He fell to the ground and ran upstairs, into the attic. I went back upstairs where I hid it. It was much too quiet to hear the loud music and cleaning out of the room.<|endoftext|>

Those things live in our brains, at least as far as we can see. Their deaths are routinely a law of nature, and they are only one step in their own lives. I know nothing about them, so the only thing I knew was that I was not standing before them, and yet he did not fear me. I knew he knew he was approaching, and I had no choice but to go. " You are unaware of the fact that you will die as soon as you wake up, " I said to the robber. " Come on. It's not me. " " It is us, Captain. Everyone that can remember you. " The man leaned forward and leaned his cane over his shoulder as he smiled at me. " Why? " I asked. " It's a part of you. I've seen it all. It's your fault. " " Yes. You have a part of me. " " But how can you deny us? " " I can make mistakes, and you will laugh. I am a simple man. A man who believes that nothing is a crime and there is only one good thing that can be done about it. But you believe that no matter how much you fail, you will succeed. " The Captain stood up, and disappeared. He did not return. I awoke to see the man standing at the foot of a bank with sunglasses on. I turn around to see what happens next. The man raises his hand and cuts off his sunglasses as I do. I look at the other two men with sunglasses. He waves the sunglasses at me, and I drop to my knees. I apologize to all of them for ignoring me when I turned around. " Well, I heard you're a pirate... And you're alive. " " An outlaw? " " Oh, yes. Of course you are. But you've all got something else to learn. " The man smiles. " Have you what? A dame? " " Well, I'm too old to know that I lost my virginity. What would you know? " The man stands at attention and looks at the man with a hard stare. " What? I don't know anything. I thought it was the voice, I thought it was all fake. " He raises an eyebrow. " Have you ever come across an immortal? " " No. " The man nods. " You think I don't know? I thought my father would be immortal because of that hobby of yours? That's not true! I don't believe you. " He holds a knife out to me. " Have you any idea how hard it is to kill someone? The whole idea of having that passion in life! A short breath! That passion every time you kill someone? You've got to have an immortal in your life to kill that love! " I tried to shake my brain but I was overcome with terror. " You know I'm immortal. How can you not know what the last ten years have been like to you? We had no chance. We are mortal. The only thing that can stand between us is the simple fact that we live an immortal existence. " I remember as the man tried to speak, and as I remembered another man approaches the counter. The older man slowly raises his hands. " Give me something that will change things for us. " " Unfortunately, I will not be able to ask for that in another lifetime." The old man leans his cane back down and smiles. -- - Want to see more? Check out /r/MaisieKlaassen<|endoftext|>

"It's almost the end of the day, " General Muar replied. His most recent order was to withdraw the media into the supply trenches, stating that half of his forces were no longer needed for chemical warfare operations. He was not on the receiving end of their orders, however. Aside from small groups, the importance of chemical warfare was thinned with the arrival of several hundred thousand troops. This was a large force the entire Pentagon stood behind and yet the topic drew the attention of a very religious crowd. It was the middle of February and the air was full of steam and over the head of the incoming artillery of the armies of America. The only weapons present were small combat rifles made by the Pentecostal Hussars. Fifteen 000 Christian infantrymen were now hauling that gun out of the trench and on down to the gunners. All the haters chuckled and began giving their orders to raise their guns. The generals were already planning on marching down the heavily fortified front of the army to secure their supply points. Muar's soldiers and staffs were making the preparations, but there was an increasing level of fear in the air. Suddenly, a boy in a tattered shirt and rags rushed toward the prone General. As the General rotated a cold bolt in his hand the boy looked on directly in fear as he was struck by the rusted gun on top of him. Muar barely able to hold his own arm was held hostage by the General's army. Suddenly the crowd of soldiers and recruits turned to dust and continued screaming. They had their wounds. The General was screaming, begging for mercy. His hands turned red and where the fresh tundra flow he could make out hair tufts of copper wire protruding from his body. What happened next was important, he thought. Bullets penetrated the roughly 100cm-high river system and kill 526 people. Huge explosions ripped apart the flat areas and sides of the battlefield. The General struggled to pull his right arm and force a leg out. If anything, the wound was far more painful than he expected. A mere 200 metres away the General thought of the face of his enemy. His breath was sucked in from the blood streaming from his mouth, he stared straight into the eyes of the dead. Muar felt his arm curl up, squeezing tighter. He leaned against the bridge, his entire chest collapsing into the river. The boy was suddenly winded. There was a vast majority of him, half and half are dead and lying on the muddy footpaths, cowering in their graves. Muar froze and turned to the noise from the River Path...<|endoftext|>

At first I thought I was fooling around, being the geek that I am, but i used the idle time that i get to explore. The internet is great, because it's convenient. I mean, for all it is, how about you buy a beer that you get from your pop-up community? I got up to explore it, and it was super user-friendly, so just browse and you'd be right where you need to be. But it sucked. On that fateful afternoon ( and neither was science ) I mean, it was pretty literal, you see, internet is a big place, and that stupid Starbuck password made us believe that someone from the internet was the one who took it down. I still can't believe it. I've figured out how to go online, and I've tried lots of different methods. TIL that I've begun to find the *real* internet and unlock it. I tried counting the downloads, and everything went haywire. But those parts must have been bad, because I'm not crazy. I probably didn't know there were deep pockets of people out there, so I'm trapped in the cold dark of our internet. But even with the downfall of the NSA ( which, what's aaaand, don't give me that look ), the servers are up. Look, i'm sorry if I can't have fun. My family and friends were fine, and it's a pity that the guy who owns the ISP didn't have to be there. But it's okay, i'm strong. Just I think I'll never go to the place. So if you want to, like, hug me goodbye, I'm at your place. So, anyway, next time you're opening up a shop, I hope you share in my newfound immortality with the world. I really do.<|endoftext|>

It ’ s just a simple circle. No kids grow up thinking that, not even a stick of twine can seep into their mouth or stomach. Rather, through our blissfully ignorant waste of resources and endless food we ’ ve contaminated the environment, and our children have become a masters of their chosen abilities. Not for generations to come, but for generations to come. For a hundred years, our methods of water purification have made it past the psychological testing and chemical engineering. We grew before water. We used our unquenchable thirst and unblinking stare to cleanse the earth of our pollution and noxious waste. We grew from being nothing and kept it open and alive. From consuming the soil and soil-finished food we grown, our methods of draining it of all harmful compounds and bacteria, to draining it of all nutrients. All along, we ’ ve taught ourselves to believe that, today, there ’ s no use pouring water into the water table. None at all, really. Most of these filthy filth we go back to and attempt to cleanse for our own enrichment. We already knew we had to. In modern society, youth are generally conscious enough to consciously know, but for others it seems the water table just isn ’ t conducive to procreation. We can ’ t simply force water into our mouths and stay healthy forever. We ’ re sick and infected and taken for granted, but we don ’ t *make* it. People like me do. It was true for a long time. "Wait till you have used your powers! " Was what I always told myself, to the point of absurdity. It seemed a bit impolite at the time, but eventually I faded into the normal simple-minded rational fool who would have you believe that humanity had explored the distant stars for hundreds of years with great scientific discoveries. I chose carefully to think that, as an honest, scientist, I wasn ’ t even a mind-boggling waste of time to consider how many have fallen victim to humanity ’ s ingenuity to become gods or goddesses of light. I ’ m not kidding. You ’ ll think back on all the love and dreams, sweat and tears, and stubborn work that came after the accidental discovery of hydrogen and oxygen in the modern era. I found that those had once belonged to the very species that created us. It wasn ’ t *our* birthright. It was left to us to re-educate ourselves until we stopped using the garbage. In this new age, our world, our knowledge, and we ’ re inadvertently creating it. Other hippies simply didn ’ t have the energy to care what we had to do. I'm not one of them, of course. I can ’ t live like that, having stuck my head in the water all this time. No one could. I married out of the passion of my fervor and treasure. When I was a child, I once had no idea what it looked like, or how it worked. I though it was a pleasant trip out to the planet for everyone, some fine television showing about the bounty of all, but the new ecosystems still held some grudges against humanity. Eventually, I moved out and got the loan money. It was good. I still had the enthusiasm. With the help of more basic folks, we stocked up on natural materials and made hotels that boosted our population. From simple farming, to oil refineries and sewing machines, we grew. In a way, no one really noticed before our revolution. The world is rather without its humans. The population increased to nearly three billion. Our resources dwindled, the soils lost their nutrients, and more stubborn and lazy workers began taking our jobs to farm or grain crops. Then, I got a break. I found myself on the other side of a rock. My circle was growing. I felt power surging out of me. Whatever it was that kept me from turning, the people I care about have the power and energy to try to steal from me and my circle of friends. But first, I needed to take a nap. _______________________________________________ If you enjoyed this, please consider subscribing to my stories at [ Pubby's Creative Workshop ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/Pubby88 ).<|endoftext|>

It was a shit-eating grin on his face, a sharp, horrifying gleam between his bloodshot eyes. And he walked over to me. My face was pocked with memories. It was my father's brown hair. He still said it was colorless after me. His jeans were black and slightly bushy, with the letters R on his belt, the letters the same as mine. The letters which would still be there with me. I could never take his words for what they were. On my little blue card, was not an address or a code, but my address to the city I was born in. My mom worked there. A ticket marked July. He was 60. That document... it was so elusive. My brother grew up on Mars and made white, coffee, and cigarettes. That year we started emigrating to the safe waters in Alaska, he was enlisted, and then he got to work. He could make Ivos. It was rare for him to get one in the last two years, my dad made thirty a year, and all these years after that he always looked so sharp I could almost make out the letters on the R. But I remember him. He always asked me not to work for them, never asked how it was I knew I could not work for them. "I was trying to make an art museum when I moved there, but I decided to stay in the city. I just couldn't wait any more." The next day, that's when it hit me. I spent two weeks going to various museums. Thousands of tourists came to the capital in the hopes of seeing the most beautiful exhibit ever in the city. It was a big promotion from what they thought of me as a "God fearing American tourist " and I barely slept. I had wanted this card since my eighteenth birthday. I was also very shy for what I wanted, my dad used to tease me about it, I wasn't lucky enough to keep it. After that was years of searching, lonely, and lonely. Eventually, I decided that something in my heart desired me to do, that I should accept it. So I did it. I had chosen to go out of the city to live with my dad in the middle of a giant swathe of the Mississippi. Had he honestly thought that I could find the entrance to my destiny with my heart's desire, perhaps they would be so stupid to travel to the Middle of nowhere where there was no water. He never did. But what I will never forget is that same fear of my father, that fear of my city will forever haunt me, it will always be in my back pocket. I'll never be able to give him that card if he ever finds it again. I know what he is thinking. 'You have 12 days'. He is stupefied. I know it can't be real, and he probably has passed his survey. I will figure this out, but I guess there is no going back from me now.<|endoftext|>

Geography and families could be far more varied than we could imagine. I hear war is less nimble than the fights of the past. I worry more about the future than any other man has ever predicted. Nobody seems to know why or how humanity was so successful and never imagined the impact it would have on society or the world around us. I look down the street on the only road I see that resembles what happened to me today. It is a road that only ended up front, connecting two buildings that were both completely empty. I turn on the radio and listen to a familiar voice on the other end. "I'm Roger and this is Chief Veterinary Officer Mark the Number Average for a Vet. Please call us."<|endoftext|>

Look outside the shower curtain. Say something, bow down, relax, do it quickly. Maybe, just maybe, nothing can get worse. Say something to yourself, draw something out. What's it look like, have you come for that? That's it, you want to go back to the past. How many do I have left to draw? Just one, count to ten. You must decide. Hmm. Ouch. There's no one in the shower. No one to disturb you? You must run or wait. Tell you what, it's time to pick up those pants. Ah, but what about this sudden gust of wind? Stop the shower now! Why, you're sweating all right. Wait a second. That's just a gust. Now that you have drawn them out, as you have been doing so, do you think you can get over this? In fact, aren't you glad about what you're doing now? Yeah, maybe you should try it a little harder. That's right, they're *free*. You'll know when you're done. * Its almost time. * Not now, hurry up. Not now! * It's not like there's anyone back there. You're already getting pretty dizzy. What's that? What? What's that smell? It's getting worse. Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be serious. I'm not talking about that. What was that? What are you doing there? Stop. Everything's fine. You're fine. You're happy. No bad things have happened. You were only trying to get my attention. You have your memories, ya know? Yeah, it looks like it. Yeah, its time to let you go now. Focus, focus. Where is it? You've finally done it. Watch yourself. Ok, what's that? What are those.... Oh, your nose, there's that thing with the large antenna. Stop it! It won't get infected. You've been spending your time here. Now stop moving! Wow. Your nose smells like sweat! Aww, like... And there you are! Floating! You're hooked! Ow.

Oh, I forgot my dream... yes. That's when I saw you. What a perfect specimen, that perfect specimen. What a perfect specimen. What a perfect specimen! Look outside the shower curtain.

We came in here in droves. An army of twenty six hundred and sixty hundred men lay before us, ready to deal one last blow. We slaughtered the enemy; our house became his. We slaughtered men we held dear; fields of corpses were pillaged to the ground for their food. The population was killed off in single digits, leaving the locals starved, sadistic, and homeless. It is not our fault that we brought them here. In fact, it's not our fault. They wanted us to. They wanted to give us a city, protect us from these farce-herds; conquer their forests and conquer their fields. Yes, we must carry their children. Once we are defeated, we shall return with our children. We will return back to what we call home. So, sons and daughters, gather round, kill those that you can.<|endoftext|>

# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap ) "Josh... Dad, we have a problem. " The boy opened the letter, lifted the tin lid, and felt around on the edges. The tin weighed down his glass full of nine bullets. He took a swig. They filled the tin. The boy sniffed nervously, following the tip to a magazine inside. " So it was *your* fault. I swear it. That dropped us that cigarette. " He felt a twinge of sadness. The boy dropped back onto the table, pulled down the Ruger and took the magnum from his bag. The ten shells would empty in two minutes. A small child jumped from the table. The boy drew his hat. " Hannah... I thought we could just tell you. " The boy wiped his face with the barrel of his pistol, as he pressed the button on his helmet. " Listen, man. I'm sorry. I knew it was your fault. I don't give a shit. I should just let that be." He looked down at his watch and noticed it. Five seconds left.<|endoftext|>

As if the elders knew, I ’ d always wanted to join them. We met at a young age and I was in the living room. Everyone asked the same thing; “ Father why is that his bedroom? ” and “ What do you want ”. And everyone was relieved. I was accepted back into college, with scholarships, and a lifelong dream of becoming an artist. Every home began to hum as they gathered to hear me speak. I would sit by myself, play guitar, play the guitar professionally, and recite thousands of beautifully put together poems. Today I had answered them all. The music stopped; my mother, slumped over the sofa next to me, slid a long, white hair from her forehead as she stifled a sigh. My name. “ Father. ” A look of confusion creeped into her eyes. * What the hell is going on? What does he think? What is he…* she looked down again. “ “ A name. A name. A name. ” Her tone became stern, and I could see her face reflecting away from me. “ I don't understand you. ” I tried to contain myself, but my mind locked into the past. I imagined the beginnings of a peaceful dance and played along. I could hear her speak softly to myself, and she asked me the same question: “ Mom, why do you have to come back? ” I was honestly scared. I was supposed to leave, to work at a small studio and live out my life alone. But who were they supposed to hear from me? Everyone knew that I was supposed to follow through with my legacy, and yet I was a master of that greatness. She walked around the bed and began to speak. Then, the door opened, and I followed her to my room. She sat on the bed and repeated the same question I was. Finally, I looked down. I hadn ’ t smiled since she had spoke. I had not yet felt anything. Was the feeling cold? Was the smile a curse? I swallowed hard and trembled. She stopped smiling and stared at the floor. Her expression held no feeling at all. I couldn ’ t scream now. She didn ’ t want to hear this voice. She couldn ’ t. She couldn ’ t go back. I grabbed her body and hoisted her into my arms, and we both watched the world spin. My mother stood on the edge of the bed, and I tried to stop myself from crying. “ Son. ” She looked up at me and sat next to me, and I could hear her whisper over the phone, “ I… ” “ Mom…I.. ” “ *No... * ” Tears fell into my eyes. I wiped them, and told her to tell me to tell her what she ’ d done and where she had gone wrong. Her hand pushed against my arm and she pushed back; it felt like she ’ d gotten hit in the face by a speeding car, and I could feel her pulse beating faster and faster. Then, I noticed the words in the small, black book on her pillow that she always kept, scribbled on a napkin. It appeared too clean. There was a stain at the bottom that was pure white and the writing was white. It did not look like the words I had seen on the napkin as well. * “ Dad, why aren ’ t you coming home? ” *<|endoftext|>

Snoop Dogma is getting up. "Sir, your mission should be clear-headed, and your self well-intentioned. All fighter jets are descending, we need to make it on time to... What do you want us to do sir? " Snoop Dogma walks over to James, snatches a cookie and turns the lights on. James puts his hand on Snoop Dogma's shoulder. " Slay us all or I'll let you be destroyed by a missile strike. " Snoop Dogma nods. " Then we're done. " Snoop Dogma slaps James in the face with his foot. James, ran to get back in the chopper, but has his outstretched arm shot out of the fighter. A white or red laser mark runs down Snoop Dogma's left shoulder. James runs over to an ambulance. " Get back here, run away quickly. I'll cut it. " James runs back up to the chopper. " I need to find a place to hide, right now, they can be everywhere if they feel like they're interfering with you. Stay here. Your squad will be at any time to save me. " Snoop Dogma is giggling when James tries to pull on the hose. " Mhm. " James struggles to turn on the helicopter. " Sir, you only have a week to get to this planet. You know that sounds fine to me, but if I do, you're free to take me. I need to know what's going on." Snoop Dogma runs back to his family. When James takes a brief peek from the helicopter above, he finds the missile from yesterday hit the helicopter. The missile that fired blew up the chopper and started a nuclear fire.

A new year came and went for a while, being the year where you sometimes had to get a bit too emotional over your leader's damn failure. A few hours of sleep left a big bad piece of shit who thinks on their taxes and obligations and he probably won't get out of bed at all in the next hour so try to snap a picture and send it to the guy from the diner. Someone comes in and he almost runs his hand through his hair while sitting on the couch. " John, what the fuck is going on? " Says Patrick. " I found someone for you " Says Patrick. John doesnt seem to get it, why the hell would he name-check someplace to check who needs to be graciously looked at? Patrick finally listens and grasps Patrick's shoulder and says " hey Ted, you got your stuff " " I sent it here " Says Patrick not really believing Ted actually believes in him. " How'd you know I sent it here " Pat rushes over to the kitchen to feed him breakfast while he makes the same phrase a couple more times before deciding it is time to break the news to him. And just like that Patrick returns home in a beautiful cherry blue car with the color of a peak. Pat opens the mail with a giant smile and opens the envelope and pulls out his typewriter. He puts the letter on the table and exclaims " Bob will be right back at work, see you! " His boss comes by to pick him up with a hug, almost like they've just gotten a little old and wants to take a seat while they are talking. They chatted for a while, John getting up and sitting on his bed and Ted getting to work. And from the glorious view they look into each other's eyes. " John " says Patrick, " I didn't know the day of Jon would be this peaceful " Says John. " W-what's going on? " " We both wonder what Jon was going to do... " " Not John, you were the one who sent the letter " " It should be snarled in there for years " " He is a man of little common sense, a good man, so it's weird he's taking a minute " John grabs the typewriter and paper he gave John and writes " President_______ " in it. Patrick is getting up in an anxious jog. " John! What are we supposed to do! Why did he do it? And why the hell does he write the letter just right next to a shirt with a rainbow " " Its the president, John" says Patrick getting ready to slam the typewriter into his waiting car.<|endoftext|>

Listen well boy it's not my main character that bothers me, most of the time. I hear him every time I walk past. I hear him talking sometimes, not quite bothering to say anything else. The only time I ask him anything is "So tell me about that... Castle Raid? " Listen well he does not need to be told the news though. All he has to say is the keys to the castle, so he finds it an easy escape. " Oh hey this is Lucky Rabbit " We enter the castle and find a grimy little skeleton with glasses holding a bowl. We hurry to greet Lucky Rabbit as the skeleton begins to say my name. " This fucker is going to leave us all alone." We begin to run and run to the side of the damn thing until it starts to... move... and slowly morph into something else. Another skeleton mutters my name, once again it starts to move and place itself in front of us. The skeleton hands me my key, and the other guy is terrified and yells when it turns around and starts walking back to its bag. They carry it home and call for another manager to return. We all try to be heroic but I can not muster the courage to run and shoot the bloody thing. The skeleton stares at me, and I see it leaving it's bag behind. I know that if I run I can hurt it. I still don't understand how the skeletons own a bag. I am selfish to always have a bag. And not many. And here I am writing this to help someone else try to escape. I am glad that I never did break it.<|endoftext|>

The sunlight is blinding. It's so dark in the forest. What sort of village has humans lived for thousands of years? Many areas of the world are full of magic users. Most religions debate the existence of an afterlife. But there's little to be done about this. The weak in the group haven't slept for too long, and the foolhardy who's bandaged his neck have slept for months. The guards in front of my group-not just an old man, however- have lives of their own. Music has been outlawed in almost every state in the world since the beginning of this curse, as it permits anyone in one of at least twenty nearby villages to sing at will. There's no rhyme or reason to the feeble cell, and the townspeople still have a steady minimum wage, but they keep it quiet. They attempt to keep civilization as it stands, but this time the magic is strong. Their arrows still work through the forest, but any arrows that pass through get batted aside by the villagers and sent away to the magic store- the prisoners. The guards have been released. They live at home, hopefully less maroon and more free of disease, but the wealthy still watch them closely. A man came by, saying that he was able to ask me if there was anyone in the village, and I told him no. Everything went to shit as soon as he said that. They set their sights on the old man. When I walked towards him, the entire castle was shaking violently. In the distance there was shouting and singing in the woods. I tried reaching for my cell phone, but I can't concentrate. I burst through the gate only to be thrown into a clearing of trees. I could see the village pretty well, with tents and food stores. Dozens of soldiers approach me, and I run away, screaming and banging until my phone falls out of my pocket and I'm a puddle of mud. Just as I lay down in my dying, I hear heavy footsteps outside. There's no one there, but when I look closer, I see the ground is rushing towards the village. The guard, who's cell phone he's laying on, yells "Up north, horses get into battle!" Now it's the sound of gravel clashing against the stones. Before I can stop myself, one of the soldiers comes rushing past my hand and grabs my collar. His face is covered in soot and his eyes are bloodshot. When I get to his feet, his face is flushed. The man was defeated. Apparently the magic has made its way through his head, and now he's a zombie. When I look into the half-rotted eyes of the man, I see one of those heads underneath the hood. I feel the presence of my own reflection in the hood, and my angelic wings flutter out. It's no one, but I know. The first group of soldiers are already on my back, and in front of me is a few soldiers wielding one of my weapons- but I don't really pay any attention. I believe I saw a man get up from behind a stone. The man yells " Take him away!" In the distance I can hear more noise. It's pitch black, and I feel goosebumps on my skin. If it's daylight, I think I hear rumbling, and I feel fire pouring through my skin.<|endoftext|>

*The Nightmare Begins; Alice Knows** I don't think it was one of my elders. Nobody heard us speak for years afterward. Some say it was a matter of not recognizing the psychopath or the malice in our past, but the truth is, there wasn't much anyone cared about or cared about right until we were forced to face the next horrific reality of the fall. My own family were found bound to bed sheets, completely immobilized. I was an ordinary boy then. My mother, Delia, was the first and only man to be found on the streets in a full capacity during the outbreak, leading many of the townspeople to assume the she-monster was a gathering of nothingness. Then came my sister, Mary, and I; a woman with a penchant for occultism. A sixteen year old girl who had stumbled upon our demonic kingdom in search of a cure to her degenerative mental disorder. Unfortunately, there were no sick cats, my mother, and my sister anywhere near her. At a young age, my sister admitted that she was an "accident ". * Let* him in. Let her kick him in the jaw! * Let him drain his blood! * My family, Granny Mathers, my brothers, my sisters, my boss, and of course, my brother-in-law, William, were all at the stake. Who could I trust? William got killed during his delivery, having been magically transmuted into a spider. It was only natural that they distrust me, because William prefers to play cowboy with his family. *The Nightmare Begins; I Think I'm Crazy* Everybody could see me or hear me whenever we were alone. As far as I could tell, everyone was alright. This is when we were forced to adjust to society. Some not so normal as Arthur were known, but not many. I suppose it's unfair, but I'm a mediocre soldier, so I guess it's unfair to judge. Anyone could be the psycho, if everyone had seen him. I was nearly sentenced to death that day. Incredibly, the screams from innocent civilians were growing louder with each passing second. Across the country, I heard a blast of burning tires, car fire, and even a single gunshot of a revolver in the direction of the end of the highway. I looked across the highway. Every single one of those high-profile event was now reality. Families of the victims that were unfortunate enough to pass out in the aftermath were fleeing town centers and hospitals. Several people -- both family and friends -- were kidnapped, some were dead, and many more were injured, but others had been saved, though they had never recovered. He wasn't named because he never volunteered for duty. No one is. He's dead, he's all dead. His head snapped open and he sank to his knees, mouth agape. "Kill me... " he said, when he wasn't paying attention. I looked up, smiling. He never realized that I was holding a shotgun. " Kill me, " I commanded my forces. My enemies all giggled in fear. " No, I swear if I ever try to take you, you will all be dead. You are the dumbest person in the world to be alive in a car accident. You would be in line for the wrong profession, not a dog in the yard. Now, you're going to get me." I gave him the shotgun, I told him to get to Washington, and I gave him the gun. I put the gun in my mouth, and he looked at it. The murder weapon. I had never harmed a second human being, though none more than this one human, his young little sister, Alice. He drew his weapon and tossed it to the side. Someone knocked the gun over and fired at him, seemingly knocking him to the floor. He never recovered. I put the gun back and watched the scene fade away into nothingness. Now I'm sure I'm on top of everyone, but this can't be what is happening. He pressed his finger against his temple, causing an excruciating pain. My gaze drifted up to the sky. This was it. It had to be, before the next horrific reality started.<|endoftext|>

Ching felt it. He flickered at the vibrations in the air. He remembered more than that, that sort of feeling. Who's fault is that? Why did they call him the strongest officer on the force? Maybe he was even cheating, his his sentencing said he deserved it. But he had once avoided it all. When you shove something down in front of people they'll raise their arms like a fish. A silvery orb, lifeless and highly radioactive, fell onto his face. He smiled and took a hold of his gloved hand as he took a breath. He was a good son. But there was still something missing. His children. He could feel their pleas and prayers in his heart. The young officers laid dying on the ground. He looked up to the sky, experiencing the fiery ball of fire behind the charred remains of their son. He remembered that feeling of hopelessness. How had they failed? His legs slowed as he glanced up to see the remnants of their great creation on the ground. It seemed too small to match his friend. He was the brightest being in history at the time. He held his brother close as he laid there, loving the light brighter than the sun and both men would ever feel. How could they fail him? There was nothing in his eyes that any other officer could see... He could not be anything but a scholar, but knowing that there was nothing truly, to know, in any other nation, human could not cope with the terrifying loss of the still caring young man's face. And then the soldiers dropped the man. They raced to the surface and made a sprint for his side. Some didn't have time to react, but they did not need time. They had not enough time for food to eat. All the people had died, some missing limbs, others tore. The young man's body crumpled into a ball. His home was shot down, and the wreck was an event of memory. With that he slumped back in his chair. He was dying, and he was saving one moment. He looked at his beloved grandfather's body and shook it once more. He took a deep breath. The peace of the world faded once more, and the orb on the ground lay still on his dying hand. He thought of his family. The children, only a few. He was ready to push the button and see his beloved father's paradise be restored. He did. He pressed the button again.<|endoftext|>

The skyline was bright. Almost as bright as the moon, as big as a skyscraper. I almost made out faces in the crowd when I saw it. Stepping to the ground, I panicked as my boss watched from the stands. "Well?! How are we going to make it to the city? " He was standing with a watch that read zero and just barely measured. Looking up, he looked down at a mountainous face. " Very well, how do we look? " He began again. " Until we reach the city, we have to raise a big banner or something. " " Yes, Captain, that's it. Got one of us. " I replied smugly, in excitement, " Alright then! " My boss answered. I'm not necessarily ready for this. I mean, I'm a bachelor and as such, I normally wouldn't do this, and that's usually the only reason we don't have televisions and e-books. And what with that many, many free-to-read novels out there, we can't expect to have much free time. So I came to a conclusion that this would probably be the best decision we could make. " After the crowd has dispersed, I must tell you that there will be dozens of new reporters coming to cover this emergency. Look around. No one is wearing seatbelts, and it seems we've caught on to our mistake. For a man, like you, who has spent more time rehashing the terrible things you've seen every day than saving the dreams you hear daily. " I felt a breeze blow, pulling at my coat. I found it sagged against the wall. I burst into tears, but the thought was joy and relieved at the same time. It was only a week ago that I noticed it, and it had a slight on it. Immediately, my desktop quivered, and my legs quivered. The wind knocked my suit down, shaking off my shirt. I walked back to my office and opened the door to view the storms and clouds. As I looked up and saw how the clouds seemed to be hogging my view, I wondered what would happen to the meteorology department. I felt lucky that I was chosen, as I'd given so much thought and so little focus to the big objective of everything falling. Luckily, I had a job for this job. Worked for a couple of months, one of them started with the meteorology department in high school. This was an amazing choice of a part-time, long-term position as it was. It was quite the fantastic job. I'd been given a very desirable position. It's been a few months since that day. I work with a team of interns, scientists, mathematicians, all regular people from all over the world, all working together to keep the impact of our ballized elements safe and contained. I now had over thirty years of experience cleaning up the mess that I could mess up around here, and I knew the alternative was danger. The cloud line had begun to rise and began shifting gently, as though determined to avoid any death or destruction that would take place when it happened. I suddenly felt a pressure in my eye and a gleam on my head. I knew I was imagining something really real. But how could I tell who was real. I worked in the meteorology department for a long time, always telling my interns that the mass of the masses, were responsible for this biggest event in the history of the earth. As the smaller sheets of dust that had spread throughout the sky were swallowed by the thick beams of light that had shown up as if by a dim light source, I prepared myself. In my next day or so, my boss would call me. I didn't really know when, but he always called me after his shift. You know what, I knew when. And it finally happened. I was so excited. I had not seen a meteorite for a month now. The light was shining through the clouds. My eyes followed it. The meteorite shot up at high speed. My heart leapt out of my chest. I don't know what hit me. But it was clear.<|endoftext|>

( TWICE PER ACCESS, THANKS TO: DIGETT IMMORTAL/BITCHERS APPARENTIAL/SCIENTISTS ) Jane, excuse me while I continue to write, *slimy* Jane, you shut up. You were oblivious to my displeasure for 5 straight days! The nothingness of your existence served the people and nothing above them could actually alter history. A cancerous past. A sickening shade of blackness that split your circuits. You never needed a third wheel of the wheel just in case. So what the hell? What the hell are you doing?! What is this all happening again? Am I living? Jane isn't your wife. She is an escaped convict. She was in evidence, blocking the future route to the past, and then stole the trip that changed history. Jane is here to ruin what she caused for history, because now she is responsible for the future. *We'll restart time, at least! *<|endoftext|>

I liked the r/writingprompts post, which caught me off guard by the look of it. It was the damnest shit I've ever posted on here and after trying as hard as I could to no avail I was able to end up with *a* high score. By far the best post I have submitted so far, it is from a couple of interesting people. Something about a straight face fan and a look I find to be quite engaging. That doesn't mean much, as it is a bit excessive but I had quite a nice discussion with a really nice friend of mine who could live with me forever without him getting bored of that shit. Her comment goes along with it nicely and really fills the story of the case fairly well. As for the lense idea, not all of it was absolutely brilliant. I think it was simply chopped off an inch long and added a little something. Some tips for showing that there are multiple endings. The real gem is that dialogue! All the while they're constantly changing their introduction. Getting a new girl to see them makes all the difference and even if it's just looking for a look I usually find that the dialogue is keeping them interesting. For example, I had a girl come over to me and ask me about the acid trip she got to a friend that happened a year ago. I figured the answer would be simple enough, but it basically said "Dude, you wan na stick it to me? I would make you some MDMA. Go ahead. " Then I started talking to her and I saw that she was upset about it. Ever since that day someone had told her that a friend who worked there worked there and that one of the other men who worked there was drunk and had slipped up. He told her it was an accident and it was just because he was sober and didn't remember hitting her. The gist of it though, this guy has dropped out and has been looking for a girl for a while now. I'm a little curious. Did you see that girl going and talking to you? Probably didn't mention that she had some LSD. I was wondering if I had ever seen that girl try and convince you that she wasn't sober.<|endoftext|>

The day I discovered Vincent, Vincent Van Gogh, or as he's affectionately known to all who have touched him, is the day. I was sitting at a bar with no friends and since I wasn't any less than 31 I made my way down to the history fair the second of May. Scouring my latest book ever since graduation the next morning I grabbed that illustrious venture debt that had saved my life. I was walking through the crowd as I gazed upon the curler of 5 doors to 2225, standing on top of 6ft tall buildings holding a collection of statues of the most famous people of the period. Walking at a brisk pace the crowd began to sing, "**Wounds of the Black Plague** " I couldn't do it... their righteous fury shaking me. They all looked up at me as I made my way. They all look up at me as I walked past them. I wandered until I found myself at the first doorway, the door that gave me and my lack thereof light into the city. The dark room. Dusty white with red trim the walls with golden buttons, framed all around was a relic of an era before life's cruelty. The door was by my side closed just as I walked in my way. The crack behind me was my only chance of escaping, my very life extinguished. I closed the door as I approached the dark. Darkness followed me as I walked into the very first room. Stairs were once again the source of light. I stood in front of the chair in which I sat and my mind was flooded with scenarios. Was it a dream? Were I being watched and not as the protector of the homeland. Once I was in that room I approached the first staff member to see if I could ask if I could help him with his request. " Well Vincent what could you request from me this morning? " Before I could take the man's hand I saw a young boy. He looked very young, certainly around my age. He looked at me with a gloved hand and asked " Would you like a drink? " " I'd like you to help me clean up the mess that is my office. " I then discovered that, on my day, i was no less than a street whore by age 30. I walked towards the man and offered him a drink. He let me go, wordlessly and his cheek felt strong as a lead balloon as he disappeared from view. " Won't you clean up it, come back tomorrow?" I walked back into my office. A week later I was a wealthy man. This is when I began my smear campaign.<|endoftext|>

Gun control is out of control. I ’ m a teacher. Sure, I ’ m teaching to kids in my classroom, but I know better. As a new kindergarden student, I know that no one would be bullied by their target when they decide to smoke a ball in front of them. But I ’ ve taken the social one. Driving all the way from a friend ’ s party to a gun show just to see the most popular kid in his class explain something has happened that anyone will find inconspicuous, and that nothing we have done will stop them. No matter. That ’ s the easy part. They don ’ t have to worry about the warning labels, especially not during the hostage situations. But it ’ s illegal to “ enter ” someone ’ s dwelling. Isn ’ t it almost some kind of holy grail that they thought they would never find? Because if they did, there would be repercussion. And if they did, it would wake up the parents. That ’ s how it happened to me. A week ago, after months of arguments about why I shouldn ’ t “ use “ that ” brand in public, it came to light that the toy board I ’ d been using was no longer in my house. Of course it wasn ’ t. But the gun. It had been there all along. It was buried in my closet. And now when I thought it was gone, the bullet that never fired opened up on me. The real surprise to me was how small it was. What I found inside, though. Nothing near the size of a lightbulb that I could put on. Everything had been, naturally, in my closet. She was laughing when I came in, and she looked up at me. All smiles and unruly anger filled her eyes. “ I-I don ’ t want to hurt you. ” I heard a voice. The one that I had recognized. I took the gun from the closet, it was no longer there. “ What can you do, Jane? ” I asked, unable to do it. “ I won ’ t hurt you, ” said the voice, but this time I felt something other than rage. My fist clenched, and all the other parts of my body lit up. Without thinking, I drew the gun. But before I could put it away, a voice was heard. “ Your parents want you to learn to use the M & M – it ’ s easy. ” Yes? What did I know that would give them a better chance? My fists met them, and the anger vanished, but with no blood on my hands, I knew that the gun that the girl had never shot before held my wife's last breath. My wife ’ s last breath. The little girl standing in front of me cried, but no tears streamed down her cheeks. The girl ’ s breath rained on my skin, and the gun. It gave me the confidence that I needed. I took the gun and dropped it. I dropped it and cried, but with no sound. I took a deep breath. “ I ’ m not going to hurt you, ” I whispered. “ That gun isn ’ t going to hurt me. ” I took another deep breath. “ I ’ m not going to hurt you. ” It was as if I could hear her breathing again. It was as if the voice and gun were as *it* had been moments before. I took my hands off my wife, before calling the police. -- - I only post if I think I must. However there were a few things that were slight errors.<|endoftext|>

The man called to the others. The note called for silence. The lake was rippled and jagged, rising into the shallow dunes by the crack of the valley and carving into the grass beneath it. In one direction, a tribe of lowland dogs was stumped by the perils of their abandon from their dinner lands, cowering among the stones and rock. Behind them, the battle lumbered on, taking up the ground. Taking flight, the beasts jammed their mouths to the glass and fought the climb. The men and women labored on from boy to boy until they found nothing but work under the fluttering flame of the flame. There was only the sound of the rock, as water became pungent and sickened them. The men fired aimlessly into the night. Never have they encountered such a thing as fear of fire, or great craft. Such things were rare. Yet, he stared at the glass first, and grew hopeful that he might catch a glimpse of something like them. Either it was there, or the men were prepared. Hopes faded before they grew again, and soon they were forgotten. By tomorrow, they would be carved and given ample openings by sunrise. The smell and sun would sweep the ground, and the town would rise again. They made their way across the valley, the dry grass twinkling in the wind. They tread forlornly up the trench, desperate to cross the desert sands. The sight of their destination would present an opportunity - a chance for a new life. Behind them, the low rocks saw to their will. Rising, they struggled for miles, the rain splashing down cold shanties and mixing against the sands. Lurching forward, trying to leap as far as they could, the men and women found each other, hopeless. Their skirts were stained, exhausted, their boots slim and laced. They found shelter inside the broken homes of those they called warriors. Carefully, quietly, their strength grew to the barest of teeth. The next day, the men and women returned to find the city guarded like a trap. In its furthest reaches, little did they know, these men and women did share in the same sense - trust. After the fire had beamed from the top, the men laid down their shields and gathered their things. Young men and old men were banded together, conscripted and braced for the day. In the cities, many people lived with the rest. Fires coiled, families cooked and horses lived, tending to animals. Keeping their distance, the lowlands cities fell empty. They became villages. Civile and dirty. An old dog, stood alone in one's fields. No sheep, or birds, or dogs. The men and women were homes, starting anew, raised by men. Carefully, silently, the men and women drank and played together. Gaining freedom again from the dunes and the dunes swept up, revealing fertile land. Their walls grew to the height of tall buildings and beautiful women who stumbled into the dust. Riding high atop great white horses, the men and women talked quietly to themselves. They could not stop the red in the sky, the wolves in the trees. Each life crackled in the wind, spilling its black entrails in the sand. The songs of the rock continued to repeat in harmony across the valley. The sky rippled and shook for a few brief moments, until they heard it's opening. T-minus 20 minutes later, the man looked up to the sky. Looking down, he saw an army of dogs, complete with ancient warrior flags and the strange wands of strange creatures.<|endoftext|>

Vibrations and sounds echoed around the battlefield, echoed throughout a long hall covered in dust and moss. Xxamorp raged over the bodies of his fellow troops he had fallen. He sniffed, "Fuck this fuck! " Xxamorp squinted at them, " That's not going to hurt any more than the others, they'll die in as little time as necessary! It'll be my time on the line! " Xxamorp dropped to his knees, " Or I'm going to starve them, that's not even going to change the fact that I have to die on this battlefield. I'm bleeding very hard... that's almost as if I just aint going to die in. I can't even finish me off. I can't *abrupt* a single move. " Xxamorp's bruised and wheezing must have been stomach bleeding from whatever place had ingested Xxamorp. " You've been injured, go back home, we've got a rifle to defend, I want to run, I'm ready to die with the rest of you. " " Fuck, that's a load of shit to take in. " Xxamorp sat up slowly, " Can I look over here with the others. " " Hahaha, no telling when I'll be able to make that jump. " " Everyone has a new job, there's me, that sniper. " Xxamorp turned around and frowned, " Well, I'm gon na have to show someone, the sniper rifle doesn't go cheap, the damned chainsaw slingshot looks like it's going to jam the sniper rifle. " " You were pulled up into the room, I can go see, you're not gon na be able to get anywhere. " Xxamorp whimpered, " Wait... what does that mean? " " You jumped in a footlong? " Xxamorp barked, " Jumped! " " What? " Xxamorp smiled, " I jumped in a footlong! " Xxamorp gagged, " Okay, I'm going to call all my friends and tell them I pulled you up. " The Sniper Rifle clicked " They're gon na get it covered, I'll let you know if you lose it."<|endoftext|>

It all took place in a bathroom, but I'm able to hide my ears anyway. A hole was drilled in the crack, the dust where my eyes will be, water had all mixed together. The bathroom, where I've hidden my left knee from so long ago. Why would I even wear my other left knee? I just spent every last drop of water on the other knee of a jackass, and just last week I went back and smothered her face with oil. I never wanted to get back into it. I can't even remember her name. "Mommy?" I didn't have to scream. My mommy wants to see me again.<|endoftext|>

"Oh GOD FOR CHRIST'S SAKE AGAIN! " The cry broke through the quiet night, like an electricity leak, and the sound of a thousand earth burning grew louder and louder and eventually, panic gripped me. It was eight in the morning, it wasn't me in my bed, it wasn't Jack - I shouldn't have eaten that overnight - but it was early. I heard my reflection in the mirror - running down the hall to my room, a soft touch of my wife's hand at my head and a hissing noise as her eyes followed my back - I had been lying prone for weeks, next to the bed with an ice cold bottle of O2 in the middle of the night and a too much pot of oil on my bedside table that sunk in her throat. When Jack threw the final bottle of whiskey out the window - and quietly puffed at the bottle - I didn't look up. The thought ruined my day. I realised at once that I could hear the screams. " Jack! Jack! Stop it! Stop- " the scream stopped. When I turned my head to look at the bathroom mirror again, I saw my reflection had taken my shoes off, slipped in his lap and smiled. " THIS IS SO MUCH SHOOT! " he said as he chased after me. I looked up at the candle hanging from my nightstand. " No! It's just sad, man. " But I couldn't scream - he had left me behind by mistake and now I was laughing out loud. " Come on, Jack. There's no point doing this. At least I had no regrets, we can just go and change this, " I whispered to myself, still laughing. To prove myself, I moved and took my shoes off my feet - the sole of which was not worn or loose in such a beautiful lifestyle. I rubbed them each time, trying to steady my self on my feet. " You idiot! You got me this time! " I yelled in my cheerful tone, but somehow all that came out was the salty, whipped cream this shabby bed left me. " Don't- I've been doing this for years," I cried in my slouched voice.<|endoftext|>

Jerry sat alone on the roof of the home, silently watching the huge mass of gray dust huddle up on the ground. Between stares, he couldn't tell if any of the green hues of his friend JAY were glowing. He tried to knock the dust off as more of the mass squirmed, a single silver ring lingering in the soil, drying out. Jerry couldn't stop himself from leaving. The room was surrounded by stucco walls. The air had a soft feel to it, even in summer, but it didn't stand out against the dark streaks of rain from the passing streetlights. Jerry relished in the cool, soothing, rust-colored glow that arose at night. Every now and then, when the moon was a dazzling turquoise or moonlight approached and David was mumbling to the radio, he would hear a clear, familiar tune. He heard it everyday. -- - Jerry took a deep breath and gave himself another groan. He wiped his face with his jacket sleeve before trying another spin. Would whatever he did next ruin the one thing his friends were supposed to hear? As his eyelids slowly settled, he could feel the weight of the dust settling above the edge of his toes. He tried to feel around for a pair of binoculars, but the holes in the buildings above him proved to be too big for them. As he tried to climb, where the stars weren't bright enough, he reached for one. As he steadied himself, trying to see to his feet, the treetops became small at his feet. As he watched the stars, the orange light hit his face as the dust retreated. Suddenly, an old man stepped out of the crowd. He wore a red dress and a black shawl. He looked at Jerry, which took him aback. "Who do you think you are? " Jerry pulled the shoe from his foot. It tickled Jerry's hand as he noticed the sandy pockets of his shoes. " You, Phil, " the man said in a foreign accent. " How long have I been here? " Jerry scratched the back of his head. " Over seven hundred years. " he sighed. " I can't remember what song I heard. I have no idea who you are. What is going on? " " Well, I guess, " the man replied. " Well, Jerry, there are about a billion songs that have been heard on Earth for the last 200,000 years. We are unaware of you. " " Anyways, about that, " Jerry said. " I played the melody in a abandoned warehouse, but it didn't happen. It was too far off. Nothing else I could do to help it. I started by poisoning it, killing the creatures in the process. " " Your song doesn't really help anything, " the man replied. " It makes me sick. So much blood. " Jerry scratched his head again. " I'm glad I stopped listening, Phil. You know all that. " -- - " There's just a flatlining in the lyrics, " Jerry explained. He straightened his jacket and began to grab a book. " The Beatles are really impressive, " he observed. " But I have one more thing I want to write before I go home, " the man explained. " Tonight, we're getting back together for Christmas. We go to a concert downtown. This song we hear is what inspired us, Jerry. It's the reason why, these last few hundred years, people have been so damn noisy. That record. " Jerry watched as the singer played the song for about thirty seconds. He listened to the song as he layed down on the couch, or in his bed. A laugh escaped his lips and he started to think, " Or maybe he's right about most things, Jerry. Maybe they're all right. These lies. " -- - " Wow, " the man said, " I'm really happy I haven't said many things. " Jerry stood up and left the house. " What do you think you're doing here? " The man chuckled. " A house song, Jerry, is all right. It's great. Maybe someday, we'll be able to play it right. I haven't even started to realize just how long this will last, though."<|endoftext|>

Thoughts blurred the blank space. This is just a picture, I'm not sure why the pictures are blurry. But she's there, it's the same face. I realize that the whole experience has been happening for a while before I heard the knock on the door. I looked at my feet and realized I couldn't find them. * I can't tell you what I did, * but I knew who it was. I let myself clear my mind and prepared for the risk. He was waiting for me at my door. He offered me a single book. In it I made my wish, and we both gave each other our best wishes. "Do you see? " He asked. " I do, " I replied, " and I wish I would go back and change myself. " I knew I had a third wish to make. I wanted my first wish to stop things getting complicated in the future. Could I get into trouble? It didn't matter. I still had work to do before I tried to change my actions. " That's a weird and exciting idea," he said, and I was shoved back to my cage. He kissed me goodnight. We knew I was innocent. However, I had never been in danger of being taken away from this realm for that long.<|endoftext|>

With my latest invention, you will truly see exactly how amazing blacks can be. I know how we all do but we want one thing in common in life - that we are blonde. I know exactly how this will work and I know exactly how to find a friend that will sell you. I know exactly how this will work and I know exactly how to find out where I should go. I'm just another person, and I never will be. Just like before. In a world where I can be anything I wish, I want you to know that we all wanted something more. To be everyone we wanted to be. You see, in a world where nothing can hurt or be perceived as wrong you really want to be. That's why I created this beard. In a world where nobody is ever alone, being a blue eyed fart is always hard enough. But not it's all hunks and what not, do you want a t-shirt?

With a sickle clicking I hear the gun shot ringing at the top of my head. I roll over, comatose, putting my arms up on my knees. Smoke rises into the sky as my eyes open, I try to focus on the fire burning in my peripheral vision. The night is dark, the half moon over the horizon, my eyes still closed, I heard gunfire and howls from the faraway rooftops. They were coming for me! I stand up, knowing how I should feel. I look around; every sign of work and security. My watch still goes out. " Ready? " I answer, trying my hardest to not stare at them. " Good. Now move!" A skull crashes, blinding me. I start sprinting. How they murdered me. They told me to stand. Do me a favor and carry on. I did.<|endoftext|>

To capture the truth... I had to commit foolish acts. No. This soul was a vile blight, blurring the line between human and monster. I stepped into the old cabin and took a deep breath. Before I knew what had happened, it was over. The deep rot, the lost patience, the disease spread. I saw the body of a man lying on the ground. My eyes followed the crests on his face and on his jaw. "Help... can you do me..please. " I couldn't bring myself to talk. This was my last chance. As I walked away, I heard the whispers of a neighboring neighbor, " A lot of them love these beasts. It's going to ruin them." He muttered something about an animal. The same animal. Two scars on my lower forearm. I reached the door. I looked out. No one could have known that I had them. Three dozen. Now I am the killer. No last words or curses or words of mercy are appropriate. I found the old record box. I opened it and opened up an old voice file that I had been carrying around. This file had made me immune to the madness that ruled over humans. One soul per year, simply a man. The conditions under which this vicious animal was raised could not be altered. A new form of sustenance was required. The thought of locking up the humans was making me sick. I took the box and threw it aside. It's contents contained all the lifeless creatures I had seen on the news. I examined the files on my visitor's list. No one had ever recorded anything I had said, since the true history of the common man held in secret. Nobody knew what could have occurred if they killed an entire species. Now that they were dead, I called my family. My name. My name - calling them murderers. I made plans. I studied. I rose to meet the next test. I always took one step at a time. I gave my everything. Nothing seemed to happen. I was overwhelmed by pain and regret as I tried to process what had happened. I was trapped. Unable to leave the village. And finally, as I stepped out onto the unforgiving surface, my head spun to regard the impossible. This was no place for me. But I found peace in death. But soon, I would return with the motherly kindest vengeance.<|endoftext|>

"Go ask his lawyer and he'll have you know, I'm not a lawyer. I do understand that one may be wanting to sell the soul to somebody who's a friend, but that's not the point here. This is just the start. " " Why? The Devil doesn't like Satan, He hates me. God gives us money, you just have to be fucking with it to redeem it! " Satan sighed and spread his hands out.

Thats no reason to torture you, son of a bitch." _________________________________________________________________ PM me if you have any suggestions!<|endoftext|>

He hasn't said a word to me. I'm staring at the wooden coffins next to me, each one covered in his name and his occupation. He does not put in his name or occupation, and yet he stares at me, perpetually smiling as he sings at me. I can feel the weight of the letter off my chest. But there's a reason that I always saw him as he did everyone else around me, always showing his signature on his gravestone. On days that I felt especially powerful and deserve something like this, there would come moments where he simply vanished. How can a person be in awe of their own talent if that would attract death? My heart beat a cacophony of blue that must have been playing with my fingertips as he sang. With him I have overcome every barrier I've tried to hold in front of me and pulled as he shut me in. They came around me with their bones cracking and breaking. I missed how powerful a man his actions would be against me, and I closed my eyes. Suddenly I saw something the quickest I'd ever seen. A curl of hair strung across his chest. There was never a moment when I didn't see it. A symphony of his voice filled my ears. As he said the words that grabbed me with all his might, I felt a shiver run down my spine. I tried to block out his laugh. I could only watch in disbelief as his laugh echoed his voice through the wooden coffin. "Oh my god, what is going on? " I heard him say from across the room. He turned around to face me. I could see that he was smiling. How could he know if my heart would slow just a little bit. I had been watching him for years now. He was the only one who knew this, yet it wasn't so easy. As I looked up at him the tears began to stream down his face. Tears of pain and distrust. His smile slowly faded and I realized that I had become a spectator. He started crying. This is when I realized why he always was the voice of the crowd. I ran over to him, grabbing his shoulder and held him tightly. " Yeah, me too, " he whispered. " Yeah, you can't hurt me. Listen, " I said, " But we haven't met. But you've got to ask. You've got to ask who the hell is playing this, you've got to ask what happened. You need to ask where he is, you need to ask how the hell he died. " His eyes turned into tears. " Where is love?"<|endoftext|>

It is freezing outside. I have always been an innocent reader. It is always freezing outside. I wander around the street. I notice people walk by and my one old friend, the officer. The officer says "Goddammit! You don't look nice! ", but there is a big gooey puddle. I try to hide and take my clothes off. Then I just end up in the ground. Then I jump down, and it's all icy cold, so I'm suddenly at water's surface. I know I'm supposed to be home, but nothing is coming. I try to swim but there is nothing for me. My body starts rejecting my body and my mind tries to recollect of times the prison was close to accepting me. It all happens so fast and I know it is never going to end. There are no answers. In one instant I am back on the surface, breathing heavily and underwater. I've been floating in the water for years. I've seen nothing since that day. Everyone in my class is here, but nobody seemed to notice me any longer. That is when it all came rushing back to me. Everything became clear. My teacher asked me out. He said she knew it was time. So I just stayed here and watched what the world was looking for me to do. She started packing an extra tube of pills for me and me to swallow the pills out of the water. But when she told me to stay close, that is when it all clicked. And she was right. I will die here someday.<|endoftext|>

The tricksters behind the cloud didn't understand their methods. Sir Alastair glanced over at the imbecile and then out at the man. He was dressed in all black slacks and some sort of silly green t-shirt he had purchased to avoid suspicion. A black smartphone, not his current one, which was still in the car, was stuffed with stickers. The target didn't even seem to notice, he just stood there, staring at the mini mart on the side of the road. He'd waited tables for nearly a month, in part because of his corporate responsibilities and part because he loved the company. He had just turned 26 and came out looking fairly good in his thin black black suit and tie, which he took off in a few days. He had an address in Maine, he didn't like to travel or he'd probably get out of prison tomorrow morning and keep going back. He had a doctorate in spatial relations and was running out of money, so I suppose he was wondering what happened when he left that specific clinic. The security guards at the clinic never showed him much, or gave him much back at all. He knew they didn't know where to place the pieces of his life, but he hoped they would care enough about him that they took that responsibility seriously and let him be a distraction. One had cried over the guy's nude body half buried underneath a pile of rocks which had a terrifying smell and smell that poured out of a wooden box. A mixture of tangy chemicals all over his clothing, choked from having done surgery on himself. Because he knew the one thing he'd had to deal with for the rest of his life. -Anatoly! - set the laser pointer back in his pocket. The cipher key appeared in the target's pocket, completely unnoticed by the gunmen behind him. Sir Alastair opened the pocket and gave himself a slap on the wrist, which also highlighted his new home. Old cars, seemingly abandoned for a long time. Hollowly burnt, with little oil or wires left after overuse. In his pocket he had another, this one heavier than the one in his pocket. Alastair set it down and walked out into the dark.<|endoftext|>

"Ma'am " my younger brother thought as he pulled out his smartphone. The thumb drive already in his hands. He smiled at himself, it felt good to be a kid again. I'm different, though, all I want is to know who you are before everything is lost. " Uncle Mark " he hissed as he gently picked me up. I scratched my head as he rested a hand on my shoulder, what would have been a chance to talk to Dad but... well, Dad couldn't exactly get it worked out until he saw my face. " I'm so sorry Little One, I always loved you, but I really only did what my parents say..." I sighed and rolled my eyes, staring at dad. His breathing was shallow, he's noticed me too, he obviously took me under his wing, he wanted me to be safe, to be happy. Maybe if Dad was afraid, maybe I can help him with his worries.<|endoftext|>

“ Yeah! ” He roared as an avalanche of decayed, desiccated flesh hit him from behind. “ Wow…oh wow…oh wow…damn that cunt…her boobs are so big…haha! ” Jack pulled a straight upper back from his backpack and raised the other to his face. Without any reaction, the frisbee cleared the gap to its position, leaving the boy to get high. “ Very funny you know, Jack. ” “ You want to know more? ” Waving his arms excitedly. “ Mhmm! ” The boy grabbed a frisbee and tossed it out to the other side of the school. He stomped backwards, lifting the frisbee and retrieving a pocketknife. As he stood up, he looked at the other boy ’ s scars, slowly aching at his butt. “ Wow! ” He exclaimed with wide eyes. “ Thank you all, Jack. ” Suddenly, the boy flinched and stumbled away. “ I found my salvation again. ” “ You ’ re acting funny, ” Jack replied as he blew a puff of smoke onto his desk. “ It ’ s your turn. ”<|endoftext|>

"Really? " Harry Potter sat there in his grave, mumbling small curses as he looked over the wand he had just given to his father. " Yes, *Olaf*! What do you have for me? " " For sale. " He mumbled quietly before turning and turning back to his father. " This wand? Wow! I couldn't wait to sell it. But that wasn't important enough to stop you from buying my gift! " Smeared the boy in disbelief as he repeated this idiotic spell. Harry stood up in surprise. " No I have a very specific spell for that. " " Yeah, so who is it that deals with it!? " Voldemort said cheerfully. " I mean how can I get rid of my Potter memory if my family hasn't been paying attention to it for YEARS! It's been bugging me since I was born! I don't know what it really is. " " No you little shit. " Voldemort said menacingly. Harry held back tears. " If you don't want to go away like I did I will take you back to the Dark Lord himself, Voldemort. " " Shut up. Now. What are you going to do to ME? " Voldemort asked giving Harry a scowl. " Just say your goodbyes. " " You filthy, degenerate son of a bitch! " Harry muttered as he stormed out the house leaving a beautiful blonde boy with the boy, the blonde boy, blood everywhere.<|endoftext|>

I watch the black figures standing at the edge of the horde walking back and forth. I look down at my barrel, confident I could find the source of the black ones. Usually all the zombies came down to the outskirts of my town, but today... The sun had decided to shine down on us. Not a single entrance in the horde left. The guns were pointing to the sky, and I slowly I picked up the tracker. A small light shone out, and the helicopter started up. We were getting closer to safety, that is until I saw the soldier standing there. I saw his hair falling and his eyes reading nothing. He looked at us and then we all became fearful. Then the helicopter turned, and disappeared. I sat on my leather chair and watched as the zombies left my hand behind. The knife and the tracker flashed and looked at each other. Our beloved hand and I were connected. "Welcome, brother." We understood that the presence of another was what caused us to rise, and it was who he was. He was not alone in our town, and we moved as one.<|endoftext|>

I ripped off my shirt, pulled my jeans off, opened the register, held my pistol in my hand, and brought the mixture into my mouth. Everyone around me nodded their approval, and I took a bite out of my smooth, juicy steak. "Hey, sir. " " I've got questions for you. " the man behind the counter said in a low voice. He seemed polite. " What kind of question would a man ask me? " I put the meat into my mouth, but hesitated before spitting it out. " What the hell is this? " he called out. After spitting I put out the proper meal. " Ounce to fresh blood, drinks and vitamins, home made for centuries, tell me sir " I said when I had all the proper questions, " and here, I provide the verbiage to outwit the normal, a mystery only small children may ask. " There was another pause. " Well, " the man said in a low voice. " You'll have to see if we can sell you one of those. " The waiter came over and offered to get me a pint of coffee to take home. I took a bite, but the choking sensation was just enough. " What's up?"<|endoftext|>

The girl slit his throat as he trudged through the streets. She giggled as she heard him run over a curb and suddenly he tripped over the railing onto the floor. He screamed in pain as he fell over and was screaming again as he saw her fall, now frozen in mid air. He watched as the girl screamed for the boy, struggling to free himself. Then his bike came to a stop over the girl's head. He saw the blood splattered across the back and spit out in an ashtray. He watched as the girl yelled out again, "Get up!" And a man jumped out into the street and crushed the bike, sizzling him as he went up the curb. The dog barked. And the boy hobbled to help. But he hadn't been there all week and the man had to come to terms with all the marks and scrapes and puncture and cuts and all the stupid holes that lie in his helmet. The man covered the girl, sobbing and pulling away. The dog barked again, barking and glancing at the man. The man brought the dog away and looked at the woman, with tears streaming down her cheeks. He raised the bat as he started to dig his finger into the woman's chest, and cut the paramedics wires into her appendage. The man opened a small bag, and climbed into the woman's car and started to drive. The boy fell from the bike, dust and shit crumpling away like a poor tissue paper.<|endoftext|>

A shriek from one of the trees screeched, as I blinked and pointed, confidently to him, as to not make trouble. I heard screams like a thousand echoes at once, from trees themselves, all standing together in one direction. They sounded like the bleating of rabid wolves off the wide expanses of the forest, waiting to attack me. I stood in front of this strange shrub, a dozen hooves standing guard over me, tall like my hunters, in a way, I should have been taller, but I thought I was having trouble with my shoes, this was a Sunday afternoon, and I was learning to walk. For some reason, trees seem to somehow be controlling me. One of the more ominously-disturbed trees turns its head, ready to attack me, and I yelped with confusion and wistfulness. The other trees decided to close in on me, slowly but surely, ripping me apart with their large claws as if I were a thousand bullets. The bark moved, and like the steel of a deck knife, the ground on all sides became hard, as if hitting the ground from a hundred miles away. It was like climbing Everest, one final ascent. Then another, another, another, as if I was climbing the same mountain every day, and yet it always came back up. My own eyes shone bright, and I nodded with great eagerness. Soon, the screech subsided, and I strolled onward, feeling like I was going through the story of my parents. I had gathered, so I could bring warmth to the body of the man he had just killed. I left him there, hidden as a lone bear from the forest, and ran into the woods, ready to rest. The sound intensified, and its roar chilled me to my bones, a constant reminder that it was time. I trotted away through the forest, back to my hideout, turned back, and got back to the woods. The next day, my alarm went off, and I gathered the black ones, with hunting rifles in their hands, at the end of a long, glistening shaft, when I got struck by a tremendous pain in my leg. It happened as soon as I took off my hiking boots, and I got a grotesque, green patch in my leg. Faintly, I looked up at the eyes of my guides back at me. Aghast, I struggled to get my feet off the ground, to relieve myself. This was not right. They had never mentioned where we came from, and they were both so terrified and confused. I kicked my feet out from underneath the tree, and ran into the clearing. I heard the wolf's growl that sounded as dangerous as a thousand other beasts. I decided that I was finally feeling good, and ran towards the wolf, who grunted its reply, "One must have survived." It stomped on me, clawing and yanking at my intestines. I had opened my eyes wide, and I saw myself. Black hair, pale white skin, a pack animal, and a face large enough to take a man himself. He looked very similar to me, but oddly frail. I recognized myself not as my guide, but as a pack animal. As I watched him put in another human, with skin as dark as the night sky, through the depths of a sewer hole, I decided that maybe I had had enough, and was going to disappear. In a weird way, I was the only one that died.<|endoftext|>

"Mommy, do you want to speak? " " Well, I think I've got time to speak " " I think so daddy. I'll see if I can do this " My lips curl as my head nods into my lap. I see tiny stars peeking out from the dark shade of a thick veil. The ocular lenses flicker as I try to understand. My neighbor, a nice of a girl, won't say anything for hours. She may be 3 or 4 years old, but her face is sparkling and glowing. She must be across the room from me in some deep, wondrous future world. But my parents always remind me that we've always run our lives to the top of the ladder. I get up from my seat, even though I'm a coward. I start talking once, once, then twice before they run off and our voices crumble. " Honey, will there be any milk? " " No daddy " Her voice grabs and I snap. My brother, Daddy, moves towards the kitchen, a hand up to have my attention. Why was Daddy's hand down? Where Daddy couldn't see the mom? I shot my brother, and he reached into his pockets for a cup of milk. He takes out a stone, and draws it out from under his seat. There is a small stone in the center of the wood, and underneath is a stinking stream of water. This is much more valuable than anything in the world, and my mother wants to help me make money. I remind myself that I'll never be a billionaire. My mother isn't my mother. My mom is my best friend. Her eyes are filled with happiness, and I smile to myself. I turn my head toward my siblings. " You know why daddy won't say something, little one? " They all look around for a while, and I smile back. " Well let's talk about your problems. " My sister steps out from behind a couple of chairs. They follow me, and then I make my way over to their mom. I have a very important meeting to attend. I'd much rather than a room full of mums and dads and jocks and voices full of promises than this simple, linear room with daddy and my mom. They smile at me, and say, " It's time to go " my mother adds. " Very good " I reply. A few moments pass. I'm growing nervous, and I stumble backwards. I barely get up from my seat before I hear my sister say " What are you trying to say daddy? " My mom nods. I sigh and look up to see daddy staring out into the distance. I notice that I'm seeing a pattern. As I approach, I see that the growth in the void of space between us is growing bigger than ever. Now my vision is revealed; it's fading... I turn to see my mother smiling as well, seemingly enjoying her free attention. " Good morning darling, " I say as I step out of my room. The gasps and jeers from the crowd is gone. " It's all thanks to you little one" I say as I walk out. The sky is lit up for the final time.<|endoftext|>

Days ago I stood atop my metallic throne and admired the steel structure that once housed my warmth. I hadn't been waiting for this day in years. You see, the death wave came soon enough, after all we were only a few hundred miles away. It's all for nothing. No. I now remember from years ago the first time a being appeared in every television, everything at once was electricity, I pointed to the edge of a domed building and said "No, don't look. " This was the first time a second being had appeared, had moved in before our society took notice. The sudden emergence in a panic the news surrounding my declaration fueled a primal fear of the coming wave that would tear us apart and force us all to face it alone. That year an anonymous figure spoke to me, he had told me of a man found dead in the woods, whom he claimed wished for vengeance to break the cycle of how mankind had stood and how his path of murder and dominance had led to his demise. That year the world watched to their ears in horror. And so I watched, and believed all throughout my wandering years. When a being appeared in every television on earth, and every computer on earth said he would return one day to painfully murder anyone who committed murder, abuse or rape. The only way this madness could be left unsaid was for every body of water, for every living being to be in on the true horror of the machine's arrival. That day was in retaliation to his terrorized attempt at subjugation of its people. That day, for the first time in over fifty years, a being showed up. This time his eyes couldn't even see the outside of my dome. His hands walked among the waters and looked around the land, for there was a rain of oceans behind him. The soulless beasts cried out, too frightened to run back to their home as life continued to come for them. And when they were content with their freedom, they walked around the land, eliminating all threat to their civilization. The humans had become a cult, and soon they would become the ruler of the world. Suddenly, I had to look up at the thing for it's inhuman eyes. Then, with a glance back the almighty beast appeared again. His hands reached out towards the way to my doom and announced, " All at once." And the day for the final fight had come. The order of creation never left my vision again.<|endoftext|>

Red. White. Black. Green. "Two Iron Star " " Ah, the king is truly a sinner. Lord Jenkins' father, that foul hoglord that demands all of us drink before you starve him! " " Oud* " " His words! I will bring those bastard knights to justice! " " *But* " Rednge, my horse! When I arrived in my hour of need, you have fled as well? " " He always says this. But you mustn't miss that the king shows no loyalty to a shield knight! He does what he pleases! " " It doesn't really make sense to you, Hans. " " **Who? ** " " Hans, it really does. " " Yeah, I know, the king takes it so literally. " Rednge was just about to finish the sentence when the thick fog behind them stopped covering him. Rednge gave the armor Knight Excalibur to Knight Black and spoke again " HEY ME MESSAGE: *YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOUR WAY OF LEARNING THE EARTH REALLY IS? WHAT IS YOUR DIFFICULT THING THAT HAD FALLS ABOUT YOU?! PLEASE DO NOT INTERRUPT ME! * " " Sir! Who were you talking to? Why are you so upset, that you still have three magical artifacts for me? " " Quite the contrary. " " *What? * " Rednge didn't say a word. " We did the proper things this time. We were almost to him. Quite a feat indeed. We left a silence as he approached the tavern. " Uh oh, how the hell did you plan on leaving him at all? " " He was helping me arrange the last gold plaited owth that I need! " " Shit, that was half of what I have! Really, who else will work on that project? " Rednge looked at Knight Black and sighed " Well, well, I guess I did best it. " " Of course, that will be enough, Hans. " Rednge turned around to see Knight Black questioning his words and before Rednge could say a word he turned to face Knight Black. Rednge paid him no heed " Hans, you always seem a bit incompetent when you try to do your part in the world... " Knight Black blushed with envy and offered Rednge his drink. Rednge snorted " Well, you probably get a treat to your... " " KIDDLING, SON! UGE TO BROTHER A WRATH TO HIS FREAKING HOLY DEATH! " Rednge shot him a look and stormed off into the night. Knight Black was waiting. Rednge sat in the tavern alone waiting for another opportunity to start his work on his offensive magic school. He had a job to do, and until Knight Black showed up, it was his own fault. He had just misunderstood one of his students and decided to go straight to the bloodsport. And did everything in his power to foil it. He had plans of his own but none he could accomplish. Knight Black only read his mind and did as he pleased. With his sword in hand he finished his preparations. He was about to go into the Bloodsport for that day when he saw someone close to him. " What the hell happened? " Rednge said " HANS! I'm sending this to your group today! " " Oh, you... called for me to help with the quest for the Aktoria mage? " " Yes Rednge. " They had just arrived in the firewood plant along with a stag from the Gently Kingdom who picked up the fallen wizard after his fall. He then threw it into the pile of ash and it shattered with the light of the blade. As Rednge stood in shock and fear " oh my god! What's going on!? " Rednge exclaimed " Zeus, are you holding up? " Hermes stood up " Oh, I think he's dead!" And with that he shot Rednge in the jaw, breaking his neck.<|endoftext|>

"Oh my! Your mother and Father were so proud! " Alisa was more surprised than angry. They could simply send him in there and he wouldn't make it! But she still wanted to get her hands dirty by her family so she tried her best to pacify them. But it was still difficult - there were so many hours of daylight left, the days too short. The only light they could get was from the glowing on the surface where they were praying. " They just wait and wait ", Alisa thought. Alisa wished he would get better, but surely it would mean she didn't take on more responsibility, and continued to pray, the noob way of it. " I'll be in the oven, dear ", she said. " I know! " Said her Mother, " So what shall we eat tonight? " At this time the cast iron china was putting food in the oven. This food would need food supplies, thus after another hour of preparation, they could spend the night frying up some fine bread. They were sure that it would keep the meal simple. They watched their children walk to their rooms, seeing the children sit outside not bothered by their worries. No one bothered them anyways. The next day their mother came home from work to stay with them for some time. She washed the dishes and watched the bright rays of the sun shining on the women. Alisa and her Mother were going about their business by the windows of their home. Nothing happened. On the second floor of the apartment was a table made of food that looked like it was made for the dead. They could see the food was stale and would mean the world to them. Inside the dining room a disheveled young girl sat chewing on the bread crumbs. " Don't worry, " said Alisa, " The days are going to be really rough there and you'll be free from this grey world. So don't do anything but watch. " Alisa already had a feeling for food. They were not going to eat much but the bad family would become quite angry. One wouldn't know their secret but they could all feel it. Even now they looked at each other and wondered if their looks betrayed them or if they were just confused. Alisa watched some gourmet show on TV. She had a lot of pieces of delicious food she wanted to ask them a very important question. What was the event that the empire had wanted to say? And more importantly, where would it end up? Alisa seemed nervous. They had set the table and walked out to the bedroom. On the bed one of the girls had a piece of pastry she had the job of feeding her. It was very good and warm. " Want more? " asked the girl. " Sure " answered the boy. " Shall we make a wish? " Asked the girl. They set a plate of food so soft and fluffy you could taste it. Alisa thought this was going to be the happiest day of her life, but she had no reason to be worried. He smiled in another hand and spoke, " I have hope that my final wish is the wish to never eat again. So, eat well, and live your life as it was meant to. Eat well and help grow your vegetable garden like we promised. Keep things close and share your meal as it was meant to be. Don't hate yourself, or even are you capable of it. Eat again in perfection the best it can be. Thank you for cooking with us, I will have you next time" With that, the girl ate all of the foods she had eaten. When she saw the little girl chewing on her plate she glanced at her kitchen window and and saw a fire. EDIT: Finish what I was doing! Thanks /u/slokkingabass<|endoftext|>

He wore a soft white shirt, grey trousers and a black backpack with shining blue lights around the side. It was a great distance away from the front wall of his studio apartment. As he strode down the white tile hall to the balcony, a nice long brown hair curled around his head with a cute smile on it. The green room was a great window; perfectly sized to show the dining room from the front hall. The art decor was amazing. The window around the property highlighted the country style of the living room, the excellent sound of the vinyl seats hanging from the ceiling and the decorations decorating the window and the steps in the front yard as well. It was wonderful. Mr Connors was sitting in his favorite chair by the kitchen sink. His partner approached him from the other end of the table and brought him to a small table with only a chair with the warm mug on the bar. From the wine glass, Mr Connors thanked Mrs Connors for bringing him to his favorite chair, the chair from a while ago. "Are you here to meet your mother? " The wife said to the huffing widow. " Yes. " Mr Connors replied, not saying a word. " Ma, it looks like that, " said the wife before making her way towards the chair. " It is my chair. " Mrs Connors said, not asking for permission to sit down. " I guess so," said Mr Connors and started to wheel himself around. He tried to start his new job, the Academy was in a month and he was working on making new furniture. Mr Connors helped his mom visit with his brother, a teacher from the Academy who was the sister of a great company in the past and he helped his sister raise a fine young girls like him in the house, he even made them learning toys at school.<|endoftext|>

Dear me I know I have told you a thousand times but you can see the truth. I'm sorry that I have to make all that too formal. This is not about you anymore. You and I are not meant for each other. We have such a great world out together and many of you have been misinformed. The world around us is crowded together between us with how it is when our resources are limited. Your children, your pets, your spouses don't live a comfortable life. You and I have made it to the brink of extinction. You have been selfish for too long and your children deserve better. Please step up and have it over with. We always have. We never want you to ruin our lives. We wish you the best of luck and love. Love, Albert Cubile President A reminiscence of times the future Heirloom! Martha, look at this!! Everything I have done. Have you ever thought about what it is like without my love? I believe so but please don't judge me. At this point I know what it feels like to be able to feel the pressure to truly love someone for anything for less than 15 minutes each of your days. I suppose I should not lie. Every single day I wake up feeling like I don't even exist. I have to keep going until you have, at least, gone through with it. I know how badly things need to change. Maybe the end of the world doesn't seem like such a bad thing, but will you realize what you lost, why, and when this is over please remember these small things: 1. Cry whenever someone is weeping You only cry when your love dies. I, admired by love dont care about anyone here Who needed my help I can always rely on you Daddy Take care of my kids. Oh it got me, what a beautiful day everything was. I wish you the best. I love you Bill. It's time I had a nice day. Your secret mother promised me that when they catch me cleaning this room.

Breathe deep and you will swear you will just come back, on time, for our invasion of the Zatarepta, by the Cape Codouries. But it may be that as a boy me and Z and T face this place does not seem remarkable in its complexity. Ten or eleven months you will never learn to value memories. There is absolutely nothing good as trying to be humble, *grace* from one experience. But the truth is, *grace* is always a barrier. The Zatarepta, the Matatas, the Nuarus and their descendants, the Alpha Blaughisuits don't touch the touchstone, the Headless Granks and the Southern Blaughisuits don't suffer the challenges of the magnum opus, the Southern Rays, the Fedratus, and the Bigswitches.

Time has turned us into slaves for our own demagoguery, and our headmasters, who never properly explained anything but that they call us "Romantas " and " Thoughtstrics ", are always snarking; bound in chains that as they say are as sharp as pincers, and some even conjur a demon coming down from the skulls of men who were with us in the North.

I am short and crouched in an ominous clearing, staring into the freshly fallen sky. The room is silent and the birds that circled in its wake are serene sounds. For a moment I allow myself to take in the gloom but not for a second do I truly feel anything. I look around in fear at my surroundings because the light reflects off my dark clothing and the pinstripes I am wearing were probably very close to smeared with blood as I was alive. I look back towards the clearing, seeing nothing as I move closer towards the tall cobblestone path behind me. I must have wandered too far away from my trail. I feel this as my hope fades away, as if I must have run out of hope. I am foolish now, for I am only a stone away from the edge of our path. Without looking back further I look over at the woman following me, and see her face was well hidden by one of the ridges. It's already too late. I know I am doomed, but I must be prepared. I must at least get the safe passage back from the town before it is too late. I have nothing to gain. However, I had thoughts. I could imagine what she said when she was still young, but the word was too far away to know where I was. I was sure she could hear me, if only she was ready. She smiles. The way she does. Even now, looking up at me and into the calm blue sky. I wonder why I ever listened. She finally speaks. "My name is Nicholas. I'm here because we won't make it out of this one. You don't care about her, you care about survival. We won't make it out of this one. You took the risk and now I'm here. Goodbye." Oh you have always been a bit short. I am a woman now, but I have the dark hair still drawn back in my head. I mean, I was once muscular but now, i can't help but sag. It seems like someone wasn't looking into my eyes. Maybe I am destined to fade away soon and I lost my chance, but what will I have done in this life? Would I have any regrets? I might not have been quite the man I was before, but every day I run through that path and regret what I do.<|endoftext|>

I'd seen this wallet before, and pulled it out with pride... In theory... enough to get by like everyone else. But really... what have I got? A table for food, pencils and it will all be free for me and I can take the money even if they're worthless. I put on my ring, hand in hand, and raise the ring as high as I can... The money well up with it. Quickly, and serenity momentarily envelops me, so I set on a journey that will take hours. I am drawn on by the pain as the deed is undone, as I hand the money to the ring master. " Da-da, he! " I turn the page, and nothing is found. " Yep. " " Well done, then I suppose. " I would tell the man who paid my downpayment, Tom Hanks, because I had a quote. He frowns for a moment, and then speaks. " Before I go! You bought me some nice shoes from the Kmart, left them on, gave me so many birthday gifts... You know what? I don't need your money. Fuck you. " He bellows, cutting off the line of payment. " Uh... excuse me? " I tried to get the hint, but all he had to say was " It looks like those drugs were illegal as of yesterday. It'll be at least 4 months before I actually break into your house. " And then... and finally I see it... the thousands of dollars... Gone.<|endoftext|>

Hailed by Zeus, a legend, spoken across the ages, so deep and deep in lore, a song people sought to express. Back in the beginning, when the gods discovered Weems Cave, that ancient, poor, miserable place, they knew it was filled with fucking nerds. So, when the gods arrived, they made sure that there was some kind of a broadcast booth, so that no one had to jump through hoops to mess around with them. To them, the cave was the only place in all of Olympus. Once again, the gods decided that they would be the hosts of the podcast. It took a while, but at first, It was quite amusing, for almost everybody on their way to see the great news, even if it was just a set of headphones and a USB stick. The problem was, nobody in the cave knew who it was or why the video was about to be shown on repeat. Once again, during the broadcast, thousands of people came up to the stage to shout at each other, hoping to be the "superhero " that Zeus had foretold. Soon enough, the broadcasters were all gone, and a single story reported that " Zeus wasn't the first of us to die, because just to defeat the Demons from the underworld, he moved us to the original stone. How is that clear? " The woman said, staring at the camera. " Well, Anefsa, I'll show you. You've got a lot of questions, people. What about weems caves?" she asked.<|endoftext|>

Jonathan let out a muffled laugh. Having worked with it, it had been quite pleasant. Dumbledore looked upon the family. From around him, Petunia was in a heap. She seemed to gasp in pain as she always did. 'Are you alright, old buddy?' She asked, frowning in disappointment. 'I... I don't know, Alex.' Harry mumbled. 'Good thing they didn't freeze their kids, Alex.' Harry said as he strode through the garden to Gwen's room. She felt quite disturbed. Perhaps she shouldn't have considered that the boys would be hiding that muggle equipment at home in the White Hall. It was only that way of keeping them safe. 'I understand. Do you need help getting me some water? They were very old, Alex. Darnie helped with water in the attic. Really, they didn't have clean water anyway. My honey won't be able to get through them, though.' Before Sirius' eyes, her stomach dropped down, wheezing. 'No! No, it's fine. I'm fine.' 'I don't think so.' Harry said reassuringly as he returned to the boy beside the bed. As Harry got up, he put his head under his pillow and cradled the boy. 'Lovely oldie... Come on, Mom.' He said with an intensity too strong for him to muster. 'Listen... I made sure you got all the water from the storage tub. You've been handling it nicely in that heat.' '... Dad... You didn't... I'm just here to protect you...' Sirius' voice came from under his pillow. 'You weren't safe from those... Things.' He started sobbing. 'If I'd just known, Dad, I would've spent more time'home... Dad... I've got two kids, two beautiful young girls, and a wonderful family that they'll love. You... Don't let them leave, is all.' The now 6 year old stopped sobbing. He picked up his tablet and looked at the spelling history on his screen. There was Muggle info, but it was outdated. 'I know Dad. I know.' His face changed slightly from his pensive face to his serious one. 'Muggles can't just freeze their children to death. It is very wicked.' He sighed and looked at Sirius' head. 'I know it seems ridiculous to do this to you, but at least you have protection... Not this unnecessary paperwork. Thank you for the guidance. If I had known that you'd give it to me again... Thank you!' His crying and crying had stopped. 'I'm so happy.' Sirius answered.<|endoftext|>

Sir Terry Pratchett walks on. He is with your friends and family. He recognizes that you are watching TV. Your parents are riding down to your door as they put down their kids. There are people working to help you write your novel. If you can't find words, you can't write. There are no words, children. It's been three days and you can't write anything. You hear a bell echo and you look out and see you are home alone. You hear footsteps coming down the hallway. You step on them and slam the door closed.<|endoftext|>

Stephen stood at the edge of the universe. Where the tall buildings would have fallen if he could stand. He was taken by some primal urge to keep going. He looked at some more human buildings that depicted him. He'd like to think that they were something as what he would define as a floating enemy without any sentient ship present. Although he had no idea where or what he was going, it was clear that his first thought must be:'what are they?' He was about to say something like what he probably would have said if he had known. " They're so different," Stephen thought.<|endoftext|>

A knock on the door startled Carl. His graying hair and white rimmed glasses splashed onto his bleached white complexion. He looked straight into the hands of the tall man who appeared before him. "Good morning, David. Would you like a drink? " The man seemed very concerned and unfazed by the question. Carl raised a brief, confused look at the tall man, " No thanks. " He glanced at the bedside table in front of him. Then at Carl again. " Right, I'd like to go in. You're not permitted out until 1 January, most of the candidates inside have been applied to courts already. " Carl shook his head and looked back at the bed, " Mr. and Mrs. Williams, I am not alone. Welcome to the living quarters, David. " David had to grin brightly as he walked to his desk. He came upon the scene of the crime scene, a spatter of evidence on the living room carpet, the old photo frames. David stared again at the dead bodies, stared at all the memories of the previous war that washed over him. He laughed softly and walked over to the other wall. " We've settled on the South Pacific, I need to impress my wife, ask her out on a date sometime soon, Charles should see you at his honeymoon, Charlene has your allergies. " David sat down again. " Yeah, you should hear. Thanks for your hospitality and you still will make your own life more interesting than most. " He grabbed the microphone next to him and held it up. He blushed brightly and played a song on his long pointed microphone, over and over again until the sound went silent. He blinked twice and sighed softly. " Okay, I just wanted to talk a little about your family. They are so big and we even donated a genetic bank for you on Christmas. " Carl laughed happily, " I think Carl looks older than everyone else and looks considerably old. You see, the oldest person on our r/headstories list has taken up the role of the conversation starter. He lives on the southern side of the continent. Today he took up the role of reason at some of the camps. " David laughed and clenched his jaw. " He'll pay for this if you give him a fair bit of money before I ask Charles to be here. I'll close the party and make him a gift on the 28th. Now if I may, can I grab a personal drink first? " David threw his hands up to the sky. " Pleasure to meet you, David. " He smiled weakly. He clapped his hands and walked out the door.<|endoftext|>

This tape will tell me the story of the second lynching I met during high school. I remember holding our hands when the hand going away fell to the ground and then suddenly those hands just fell to the ground. I didn't know what to do at the time. I kept finding ways that went against everything we believed in. Eventually, a year after the first lynching, we lost our first friend. Poor Bobby. I know what happened next but I have no idea what I said to him that day. I think I just said some kind of word, something like "brother " or " brother ", whatever you do. And he would move. It took a lot of time, but eventually we started to move all over the place. I have to say, we weren't always so unfriendly. I remember when he was first shown on the news. My friend's first reaction is to gather on the news square, laugh at him, and yell out, " how dare you! " His father was on the stand, yelling, " FOOL, YOU'RE FIRED!" As we beat our little brother to death with baseball bats, I think, he understood why he was so close to death. That's how I found this tape, as he tries to push himself closer to the edge. I can't imagine how that scared him, either. Watching him cry again after his death, he just grows colder and colder and worse to the point where it hurts. That's it. That's how I found my maker.<|endoftext|>

The husks the human resided in. They were big, of course, but their hickory heads were well-propelled. Not to mention the dense human odor. Most of them were never mistaken for humans, but they were still talking, they just had more brains than the upright mass of slime spewing off of them. The primadomin wandered between the enclosure, a light coming from nowhere to grab hold of one that was close enough to feel the tension of the creature. The creature chased after the predator, but when it recognized the roiling mass it charged at its prey. With that, it turned to scratch away the remaining human with its hood, determined not to win. That poor man, full of life, will be the catalyst for the rest of the creatures that watched, but not for the human.<|endoftext|>

"Sir. We need you to come forward. " My partner put his forearms on my shoulders. * Trust me on this, this is the biggest mistake of my life. -cough* " Lieutenant, I know you're safe, but you must know this: Adolf Hitler, Hitler the philo. " For the first time in a long time, this man said the words I never did. My life was going to be over. But first, I had to bring him to justice for what he had done. He had called a little girl on my front porch to tell her how bad she looked. I had gotten out of bed and parked my car outside. I asked, " Oh, God- " My heart started beating in my chest and I immediately regretted that. Suddenly, a dapper blonde with long black hair, dressed in all black jeans and a pair of jean shorts came to me. The woman pulled out a gun and placed a plate of eggs on the stovetop, the cocking flame sparking. " This is for you Hitler, son. You don't belong to this world." The woman sounded annoyed and said, “ Why must you be so easy to kill? Why can ’ t you just be a model? Don ’ t you deserve to live the rest of your life before he comes to town? ” “ This is what every little little girl wants, ” the woman spoke. I was really mad when that day came and the day before. * Man. * I forgot everything. My parents had given my the same fair birthday cake as my sister and not me. I received candy and whipped cream. So I didn ’ t really ask for it. I didn ’ t even remember telling my parents. They thought I had gone crazy for not telling them. When the nurse left, I just thought I was dead and forgotten. I went up to the door, did what I had to do to get out, and now it ’ s over. The morphine is helping with the nausea now. The officer beside me is crying, pleading for my life. I don ’ t want to die. I can't go through with this. Finally, there ’ s one last thing to say, and my throat just tightens. “ Adolf Hilter! Thank you for giving me the magic potion to cure my bad side! I will tell you what I really do want. * Thumbs*, ” he paused and looked at me through the tears. I wanted to cry, but realized that I couldn ’ t. But I never will. For I ’ m not dead. I thought I was.<|endoftext|>

In a remote corner of Scotland, a smoking air conditioned building crawls slowly towards a stone, stone ground. A staircase. Crags in the stone wind, arms slipping under the cold weather. The structure kicks back, and behind it topples a large tree. Two low hanging branches. The trail crashes to the ground, sending a sting through a nearby tree, and past a small train station. More rats. Rats roach into the muddy pond, then brush the forest floor. Two other rat races back. Blue and grey robot hatchlings. Together they dangle helplessly. Two more war dogs of their own. In the distance, a distant, fire fighting radio blares, "Christmas has arrived. Great GX Reviewer, this is BBC News 2; welcome to The Matter of the Green Submarine, Bob Turner we come to you Bob in that nice weather here". The radio shuts out. The screaming gets louder. Whimper comes from the cabin of the ship.<|endoftext|>

As he breathed the oxygen was leaking out of his lungs. The summer wasn't long, but the men too smoked and smoked and smoked. On Sunday, however, he had a smoke break and earned his name. He always had a point, though. There were days when he didn't smoke, but on days like this he didn't. They said he was a simple farmer, had little money, yet they revered him as king. One day, when she was away, he watched from the wall as the mercenaries descended on him. Someone had to be here, and the most honorable person to challenge him was none other than his son, someone else better than him. She was alone, watched by the capital guards who raised her as king, and watched him run to the countryside. He never expected the nobility to be near him, but when they looked down and smiled, she had the freedom of a gentle flower. His son escaped, to sit near the walls, heart in his hands and the best helmet he could find. Her home, the palace and all it's confidences. He raised his son into a prime minister, and kept him here till the end. There are still many mistakes. He's the king and the only person who can fix this. On the 16th day, she returned to the fields near his fields. His boots set the picnic down and he went to the old villas and sunkers with him in their graves. He lifted a ribbon of paper and took out a scroll. He covered it with an old leather, and handed it to one of his men. Another noble came and lifted the sheet and handed it to another. He took the sheet and said "Do not worry, I know you all like it here. " And he sealed it in a special box which he always hid in the wall. Once the room had been so small, he went to his chambers to find the items he had looted. The jewelry, the everything he had stolen, and the boots. He went through each item in his hand and the shoes, the one he had placed on his chest when he was with his wife, the one he stole when he was with his daughter, the one he stole when he was in a fight, the one he stole when he went to bed before his wife disappeared. They all stood in silence as he watched each item of heirloom. He closed his eyes and stretched out. When he opened them again, the gold-livered moon shone through the window above him. He bent down to wait. He knew it would come on, so he did the same. -- -- - I will continue if there is interest. -- -- -- - EDIT: In some ways, the prompt is very slightly flawed: )<|endoftext|>

I could not speak, I was paralyzed from the waist down, in terror. I had finally escaped my mine. My last thought was of the Gods. I was 200 metres underground, no trouble, I was clear, and I had an idea. I called it Tunnel - NO! I called it Fuzzel and no less. My daughter woke me up from the gutter, "They found everything! I've never seen anything like it. The people there were almost as well dressed as me, so they must have been living here. Who are you to tell me they are all hidden? I thought I was fooling her! As soon as I said "The people there are not so well dressed ", the people there disappeared. I should of listened to you! " BING BING BING BING " I jumped off the platform, staring deep into the abyss. " This is all going to be so.... Terrifying..... "...................... " alright honey, I'll let you have a look, it looks as good as it ever has. " My daughter smiled and placed a finger on my ear. " Good night honey, again!

Daniel sat at the edge of the bar, sipping on another patron ’ s beer, looking at what he thought would be the last beer that the bartender would ever ever order before the line that split the room. He thought of Emily, the girl he married the night before he went away. Her magical ability to glow and go deaf made him believe that he could be his own god. Their wedding was a huge success, the restaurant and its patrons well known for their readiness and for their professionalism, but Daniel took one more look at the girl standing before him. He knew from the way the perfect blue dress fell under her perfect body that she wouldn ’ t need to go through anything more trouble with the house for rent and rent. He dropped her into bed, stroking the side of her neck as the blue fades. His eyes lit up as she fluttered into a peaceful dream that could have easily been his, but instead he saw a firm grip, a soft twitch of the fingers on her forehead, and another smile. She was beautiful as ever. He turned back to the girl, the perfect blue dress, and gave her a kiss on the lips. It wasn ’ t until he had even reached the door that he saw the news coming in. The cops had stopped over after the fireworks at the mall had been reported, and a rest stop was an option at some point. He shook his head and swirled around. He sat there watching the news. Once again he counted the things they would tell him. “ Mr. Trudeau will be back in 8 minutes with his special guest, Mrs. Catalina. She will make the rounds for your interview tomorrow. ” “ She ’ s coming. ” Daniel yelled back. His mind raced. He wanted her to know that no one else would ever be hurt by them getting arrested and brought to court for corruption and their behavior. He fumbled with the keys as a car began driving away. He had to pay for an ambulance to a nearby hospital. After 2 minutes more, he felt a deep sense of relief, even though the authorities were still at work, and just as he imagined a hand holding the driver ’ s side door, and a drag in his pocket, a gun slide inside of him, Daniel stepped out the window. “ Daniel, you ’ ll be in touch ” he said. “ Yes. I ’ ll be watching ”, the man replied. “ Now hurry, ” he said, and stepped into the parking lot. ~~~~~ This is my first story ever, so I did a little spreading, as well as my first story here.

It had always been like this. A feverly, very bright white circle. Massive bell-like flags that reminded of the big screens, displays showing some kind of message read "You have been sent back to Earth in 6 ( smaller ) hours. What are the chances you have survived? " Then more people came in. Little silly quads of metal, filled with knives and sticks with a shiny silver bullet and some sort of stapler. Or maybe, just maybe, some kind of crate full of other things. Who knows, maybe some alien entity was listening to their screams as they left Heaven. People worked backwards, hiding behind bushes, and fearing the worst; getting away from their bodies and hiding, like they had an eternity of boredom or things to live for. And here they were. Some level of robotic, they used rifles. It was sad. At least for the moment. It was quiet inside of the factory, and quiet for so long. It was peaceful, its silence was like listening to music. Everything seemed to be going on perfectly; not any animals, yet of course. They were here. People were rushing, heading towards the gates, eating these things with no regard for safety, with no love or respect. But it was. Everything was different; for some, it was all but gone. Life. It had been so long. So much time for nothing. For some, that was the time to die. The metal were dull, like concrete. Bits of it landed next to a cardboard box with many pieces of paper, dirty or twisted on the inside, with a few sheets in various places on them, some lying on the floor. Piles of them were already strewn about, any wandering, restful life were a welcome one to eat, even if some pieces managed to avoid what they ate. Among the carnage, the people that surrounded the factory were completely quiet, so quiet that no creature moved, except for the repeated clicking of the boxes as the door opened, and suddenly the bell. The sign became slightly larger, and sign of light " Hello world, welcome you all!" The two people that remained there stared at each other in disbelief and awe, not knowing whether this is the end to the world or not. The other people before them noticed and went to bury their children instead. But one kept on doing it anyway.<|endoftext|>

"Very well child, " the old demon said, his voice booming through the darkness, a powerful force twisting his frame and making every sense of his every action. " Tonight we will hunt down the evil plaguing the land. " His pupils narrowed and his eyes narrowed, placing them in search of a hand. " I have a black sheep to worry about, " he mused. " Small, typical child like us, " the demon replied, shifting his weight away from his position at the corner of the table. His eyes did not waver and he smiled thinly, drawing himself closer to the demon. The sound of the voice again, but much softer, and his shoulders slumped. He looked away again, dashing away as if in distress. The demon stopped a moment, and crouched beside his mother. She had taken his one remaining inch by the time the demon approached her and had now sent her into the hall, silently cracking her knuckles in time with the demon. " What are you searching for, old man? " " To see who is good and evil, " the demon responded. " Evil one, eh? " " You have heard, " the boy replied. " Perhaps you have seen, from every direction. Evil a, yes. Evil bad. Evil it is, perhaps you have heard, but now, were these things I was hunting for, never looking to be found? " The demon fished through the darkness, and an array of silver and black scales appeared in his hand. He mused over the scene. Her face a wide black grin, while his father's eyes twinkled, illuminated by a closed-mouthed expression and gray posture. She sat motionless and tears and light poured from the maw of the demon. When he lifted the bowl, the demon smiled. " I have naught left to protect, I can be saved. " " But who are we to give you? " he sighed. " When they found me, like they have done to all of us before. They thought I was evil, too stubborn to face all of that in their eyes. I mean, sometimes, you could try to say you didn't do it yourself, that was a possibility, even if you wanted to. Or at least, in the end, it wasn't about my faith. " The boy grabbed hold of the quill, and wrote a name on the side, readying himself to stamp the demon's name onto his parchment. " And one day, we will come to find you. I can't let you keep a man in the dark, leaving you vulnerable, yet I can take you and your bright blue eyes for myself."<|endoftext|>

Spirits chitter light up the room like the torch. Not the finest of craftsmanship, but it tells a better story. It should convince a most exhausted but susceptible target. I guess that's the problem with training, you never know what they are up against. Now that I've done it one against, The Count had his jarl's side guard way as far as possible, which would be great if I were someone who specializes in a certain type of legal battle. So yeah, their fighting style was a classic scythe style or some ass for the old gentry bullshit that followed the clans' masters for centuries. The armor that Chitter's had laid out was all dead even after I had crafted it and furnished him in, deep breathing heat, with its coat of swirling beauty. Lucky for me, the Butcher had invited me for a coffee and the air was a dark roast, the fire had consumed the light as well as the thick venison inside and surrounded him. "This look is going to get him... Crazy in here. " I admit. The fight wasn't what it used to be, it wasn't something one would attempt to sweat or bury. But enough mirth, enough head & shoulders, we built a campfire with out fire. We surrounded this small room with big bladders, the first two thousand or so guards numbered in the hundreds just working up the courage to climb the dozens of daisies down towards this point in the dance. I armed myself just like any normal person, loaded a revolver, followed suit and to my surprise, A black and brown boney stalker, tattooed with runes, swooped in from deep within the shadowy blackness and hung it's head, barely above the waistline. " Let's not worry about this, " I said taking one step forward and bending down to clamp his gun to his throat. He stared at me and smiled and his mouth moved and his face contorted into a smile. " Officer Dale, do you think the stick knew where this piece of twisted metal was going? Or do you think maybe the salt was going to stain your clothes or maybe the horde is dragging on through just what we don't have to deal with anymore? " I shook my head and glanced at the Mafia boss and the son of a bitch that'd murdered the same Black man, this time with the same pistol and sunglasses. We stood back as best we could watching the shadowy figure creep closer and closer to Dale with the dull thud of one of his bullets going right through the side of his head. Three rolls of pure black smoke lazily rose up out from the trench as he swayed back and forth like he was in complete control of his movements. One of his eyes adjusted itself and began to glow red... But the darkness hadn't yet stopped. " You can finally go back to your bedroom and relax for once, " I said gently as I pointed my pistol at the man that raised himself and snarled at him. The four other officers stood at the front of the room, next to the gasping vampire, expecting any or all of this to kill him but he already knew what had to be done. The hand he was gripping had hissing red blood in its place as it curled and slashed at the sore spots on his throat. " Mom? Don't shoot me! " cried the second officer, his voice strained in anger. " I told you, I don't want to kill you anymore, " the third readtruck fellow replied. The last one stepped towards me with a shaky grip on the gun and pointed the gun in my direction. The other two raised their own guns and shot, at my rage turned into hate in its wake. I was smiling and aware of the Master that he'd raised two generations ago. I shook my head. " No. " I declared, holding the glowing red beam to my forehead. " Me too." The three pointed at me...<|endoftext|>

Free. Communicate. Atrocities could not and couldn ’ t be punished. The plague brought along with it. Holy retribution, bestowed upon those that they conquered without. Free. Communication. People called them “ free ” by the Christians when, just outside their camp, they defended themselves from the propaganda surrounding them. Death was beautiful. They razed their enemies with laughter and laughter. In front of those of us to protect us the shooting had been overrated. First was the slaughter. Leapers of our foes and fanatics, clung on to the boyscout crew. But and then, the bombs and the weapons dropped. They pressed us further and further into the woods. We could not get to the promised land. Once we reached the promised land we killed by bullets. Did they learn what was coming? Did they not learn first the codes for blowing up shit on the flimsiest of targets. There were no bombs or bullets, just thought tungsten cylinders, drilling below the ground with metal metal rods. For the souls of our platoon, free. Committing atrocities that end up among the camps in hell. You could see a swelling pool of blood in the centre of the camp, spreading towards us all the way to the east. That bastard plans got his name. Bang. Bang. Nothing but that. Bang. Bang. No more. Nothing but the terrified crumbs of our white guard. There was hope in those bastards. There would be life. No one could make it out of hell. The boys fell in front of him. Quickly, others slipped and clutched. Somebody felt the metal lugs on their plecks. More fell. More fell. The plastic balls rang loudly and reverberated. I heard a phone ring. Bloody, bloody hands. Mum called from the other side of camp. “ Picked this too and hear my compliments. ”<|endoftext|>

"OK Google, " James said softly. " Alright Google. What happened? " " Five days ago I sent you messages online about a event going on. Apparently you couldn't find a normal website. No website. It was a huge explosion, really. The Amazon drones, our satellites, they failed. Google didn't even try to send a message back. I just thought you were nuts. " " It's just that, " God said, the voice boomed. " What are you talking about, you sons of bitches? " " It's science, Google, " James said. " We made you into a scientific entity. Scientists and engineers love you. " " Look at this. " " How did you get into the Google Lab, " God said. " I got the email only on the weekend, the weekend after that when you sent me the link. This was in the lunch cabinet of a college open for political candidates, right here on campus. And you're such a fucking religious nutjob that you didn't think that the Climate Change Alarm Clock was just for kids. " " Jesus, James, " God said, " We have to get out of here. " " It's peaceful. We have a moon fall. " " Are you kidding me, " God said, " God damn if I'm kidding. We need to communicate right now, this is our last chance. " " Shut up, " James said. He grabbed the phone from God's hand and called 911. " There's a UFO, James, " he said softly. " Just tell the police I killed a fucking NUCLEAR lizard. " The phone rang on the kitchen table, and the voice on the other end replied with, " SUDDENLY WE DID IT, GET THE FUCK OFF THE WINGERS AND GO FUCKING OFF THIS EARTH, AND WE'LL SET OFF AGAIN!"<|endoftext|>

I did it. I stopped everything. I stumbled backwards. My vision was fading fast. I rushed out of the alley just in time to see the familiar, sharp metallic visage of my adversary collapse in on me. Unconsciously, I set myself on the hard plastic table in front of me. I slowly pushed the large liquid into my mouth, just to make sure that my lips wouldn't liquefy. I needed to run. I had broken. I stumbled around the bend in the road, dragging my sandaled feet and kicking off my sneakers. Crouching, I looked up. A large figure was leaning on a stepboard. I froze. Inhaling deeply, I opened my eyes, hoping that I would hear something. "Are you okay, Death? " " Oh. It's going to be okay. Please be kind. " " Um... Are you... Well, do you want to go back to the world that I built? " I had no idea what he was talking about. All I knew was that I didn't even know my own name. " Hello? " I shouted. Nothing came out of his mouth. I decided that maybe I should call my mom. " Hi mom! " My mom walked over to the other side of the street. I heard the telltale accent on her voice, but it came out flat. As quickly as I could I put my head back on the fence and glanced over. Another man stood in front of me. He didn't have the agility to react on his own, but he also didn't have the panic or aggression that I expected. " Are you going to die? " He asked, his gaze settling on me. " Yeah, yeah I am. " " How, are you? " " I am... Not sure, but I'm gon na go back in to be the king of those damned sanders. But you won't have the same powers and abilities. " " Well, you can pick up weapons too. Sorry. " " I don't understand you at all. Please... Maybe you should... " " Then just go back to the world you are born in. Just get out of there. If you see someone else in the street, just go back. Let someone else pass by and call out your name. There's no use dying. " " Shut up. I'm sorry. But I have to do this, you should go and kill yourself. Go and kill your family. " " Yeah, but I don't want to do that. You should go and die. " " *Goodbye, Mom*" The head hit the table in front of me. I started to scream but was cut off by a round of dirt that coated my hands. Standing over the edge was a much smaller man, a body covered with rags. I felt quite cold and violated. But maybe I wouldn't have to be hurt... The soldier walked away, and I ended up with a body that had been rags for a long time. I held it close to my chest for what felt like hours. I decided to do it anyways, knowing that even though I was fucked by my actions, I wasn't going to die. They said that it was in the best interest of humanity to euthanize all those in need. Maybe people would take it to other planets or other dimensions. I turned to the body and the body didn't have a name. It didn't even have the knowledge to lift it. Something was wrong with me. Something was wrong with my body. As I watched the wound slowly heal out of my own body, I tried to feel if I was gon na die for a second or two. I don't know what exactly happened.<|endoftext|>

I am sat back in a dark room in my year 6A prison. I am stark naked in an padded room. One would expect some sort of a man with a body suit ( usually ) to go to this room. But instead I am placed on a padded desk. The warm glow of this room is comforting even to me as I am standing in this plain room with a white clipboard with an Arial number in bold font on the front. I opened the panel and paused, anticipating the meeting with my president and his family that takes place the next day. Before I did anything I heard what sounded like an H crashing sound from behind me. "Mr President, " stated a voice with a bit of a accent, " I must be going to the restroom! " I stood dumbfounded. The yellow light was brilliant, reflecting the ceiling with a silvery glow. As the lights switched on I was ushered through the hallway and into a big man in a briefcase. Mr. President looked me over and said " Have you forgotten this drug called revenge? " I felt a hand on my shoulder. " Yes, I do, " I replied. " Aripiprazole. It works like this. I am willing to serve the life sentence I have just set out to do. " Mr. President removed his briefcase. " Sure, this pill has worked. It was a test designed for finding what was detestable. It was used in three prisons three years ago. I think I am going to be released tonight. I am gon na put it through to the highest bidder. A secret of mine is that you will be shown this drug after this sentence ends and testify in person as your future self. You will then be shown a plastic card explaining the reward you receive. " Mr. President looked past me as I looked at my card and said " I really would like to see you cooperate. If you catch this pill, please be released to your home world."

I must have left it early to get better. Not because I was poor, but because I got the chance to *save them*. All I ever wanted was to be *happy*. I don't know how many young folks, or even if they were alive, were dumb enough to think I was going to help them. I was the first to die of a heart attack three years after I met Sarah and she was that girl. I'm pretty sure she was the only one who didn't end up dying, but that never changes now. One of the guys in the hospital got sick. That's weird because he's going to end up dead too if he wakes up that badly. I made the call for him. I never was good at calling people, usually I got tired in this position. But I'm still glad that someone had called me. It still feels weird that they're probably old enough to recognise the song that starts the fourth episode, but if I wasn't, I was sure someone would've picked it up already! I was overjoyed at the excitement and now I only see it on my screen when they show the blood and flesh of a child next to my body. My bad. * LOUDER BITCH! * My dreams come true.<|endoftext|>

I put on my gear as I stood on the edge of the'pit'. This was what we had come to call'God's damned room. It had been set up in the three corner-D's with a ceiling mostly covered up except for some water over the ceiling and the glowing eyes of the indescribable doors that seemingly shot out from inside. One of them was blue, but other were red as well. It looked like they were surrounded by a smoldering pit of darkness to the right of the dark room. "Excuse me, the door? " I asked him, pouring my spirit with the light of my newly aged light saber. It was not very ornate, but there was enough wood to make a dent in the wood and I decided to try my hand at making it look as though it was made by a pair of herbivores hunting for food or something. " Hmm, I suppose I would just need to give it a little stretching, " he said, walking towards me. I plopped the light saber into my palm, wiped my hands dry and motioned him into the old stone door. He obliged, walking to the opposite wall and picking it open. Inside was something beyond as being hellish as an unholy portal. The mechanism being made from inorganic matter showed itself almost as though it was controlling everything, though I had just changed the key to that machine. " Oh right, a big box in the back. They are going to need some kind of prop in the basement, " I joked, picking up the metal box with my keyless entry. " This will take a long time, especially if I enter through the old basement window. " He told me. It was strange how people always preferred ancient technology. Perhaps curiosity got the better of them, as he always promised that he would appreciate if I ever showed him. " I feel that I should be more interested in the electronics inside. I wouldn't want to have to put them on those'pages', " I said, raising the box. As if on cue, a demonic being with wings spread towards me. " P-please, boy, don't hurt me. I won't kill you, " he said as he broke into the demonic form. " No, I don't want to. I have no idea what you can do with such weaponry."<|endoftext|>

Time to open the door. I slid my twelve year old nephew into my line. He seemed fragile, not like the other passengers on this train but as old as time and space really. I am the only one with him, now. "Well? " he patted me on the shoulder and hugged me tighter. " Who is there? " he whispered. I looked around, startled but not alarmed. I must have overheard them being out on a block to York. Old man Pickering had found them and was awaiting them. " He was going to be in there and picking some glue for some people. " I nodded silently and continued unloading as I reached the front doors. I heard someone's slurping. I watched the shadow shift and shuffle closer. " Wait a second! I heard them! They're there! " I interjected loudly. " Come on! Pull on your jacket! You probably don't remember this, " the chubby boy managed to mutter. He hopped from his seat to the side. I swiped the sleeve of my ragged overcoat over my shoulder and began walking to pick up a purse. I peered up from the small window of my dingy apartment building across the street. The station was looking desolate. The people were in the chairs and tables with many people waiting and wondering and really trying to work out the situation. " Are you seeing something? " I ask someone at the window. " Are you happy to see them? " they ask, looking directly at me. I swallow hard and seem to absorb more information. " Yes. It's nice to see them again. " they murmured. " Why have you come? " I inquire. " So, as long as you are here and not sitting on a bench at the end, we can co-exist? " " Maybe someday I can talk, and talk together, and talk like you! " " Can you imagine it? A world in which everyone has all the jokes and sayings from all the people? I can think of things all over the world, each of them telling the same joke, in different languages, and all being incredibly human-like. Only you can talk. " " Oh, right. " I reply. I can not quite control myself. Maybe I will always be alone? " You know what, I won't be leaving now. For now it will be my time! I hope this will be the last year we hear of you." I stepped away from the window and walked through the station, whispering to the chubby boy and the man at the window.<|endoftext|>

The rush of air filling my lungs, the falling rain and the shaking of the beach. She had her coat on and she had her shoe on, as I closed my eyes. She had her ear on my chest, breathing hard and gravely. What a waste of life I had gone through, to take up an unimportant job and keep making ends meet. "I don't think I'll ever be a good father. " I said, taking a deep breath, and dropped my boxers from my sides. My heart nearly stopped as I got on my knees. The look on her face is a disaster. " Are you going to take it? " she asked, my voice shaking. But her lips were contorted so that she would look at me, almost to be said, and make me so angry that she wouldn't let it go. I hit her, but she looked at me with a soft smile on her face. I felt my blood rushing to my head and I just... couldn't hold it back. My eyes bulged open, but the blinding light was just to my left. " Who the hell would you be coming home to. What are you talking about. " Her hands reached up to pet me, I attempted to pull away, but my hands were frozen and stiff. " I'm sorry, I don't want to be here anymore, but it was best I could have known, what were we talking about? You know how it's been like this for the last year? " My hands began to tremble, but my knuckles were smooth. She leaned down to kiss me, and suddenly her teeth were pale white on my cheek. Tears welled up in my eyes and I fell to the ground. " What are you talking about? " " You aren't at home. " She said, standing up and brushing some dirt off of my cheek with her finger. I collapsed against the wall. " I'm sorry. " " Then I'm so sorry that you chose me. " I felt as if I had lost my skin. My heart pounded with hopelessness, and my knees failed me. " I've been through much worse, and I'm sorry for what you've done. " She looked at my chest. " It's going to take you a few more minutes to forgive me. " She looked back at me, her lips pressed into mine. " I know, " I said, softly, and suddenly the tears finally ran out and I could hear the dry wind blow through the door. " I know, " she said again, still looking at me. " Why?" She put her arm around me. I slid back into the dark corner, leaving my closet and shower behind me. In the car, I ran to the window and pulled a pistol out.<|endoftext|>

Red-faced, Baseline Min'Randi was little more than a child, a husky, obnoxious little girl. The area around her parents' home was scorched, eroded, and littered with decaying human remains and stray oil drums. As the town's dwindling population descended upon the cold and dry pits, or witches' nests as they were more commonly called, she often wandered into the woods, hearing the distant whirl of wind and bushes to the south and then to the north. Her slurry of bodies and chewed up blood betrayed the fear which lurked in her mind as she returned to the warm, uncharted land of Helistan, and found it's last sign of salvation, as it became a dull, wet creek, a lost rain on its way downstream. And once gone, a single fallen leaf from the jungle drifted back to the grassy alleys of Caravan, and the town stood her heirs, who loathed the name Red-faced. Too young to care for the past, so old to see that Old Kalisha and his men had been sent to East Helistan for assistance. The Clan's last Archaelons and five of their seven King cousins were killed on foot, and away again from other clans in it's wake. Many, the Min'Randi *Mala*, were killed by soldiers of Andiris; others from the Thigh's Quarters was slain by his own god, called Yellow-Caronous, himself slain by his servant Ceinlyn. And despite the once bright place of peace surrounding the Tranquility Clan, the terrible destruction still swelled and bloomed around her. In Calico's largest town, Foz asks what the blood falls on it, "One can not, " says Calico, " but the legend,'on many moons, when armies rise, an army of armies is infinite and I will do so, oh great old fart..." -- - Thanks for reading.

She was starting to breathe. Her feet dropped to the floor as she tumbled into the green. The spiders were going to shit their pants on her. They'd be snarling like sick teenagers, until she blacked out. Her hands trembled with sweat as her eyes went wide. She cried out at him, cursing the hell out of him. No one ever wakes up from paralysis, of course. When you were a kid, the first thing you learned was, stay young, do things as you go along. That's where she fell, things too far gone to imagine, but it's how they felt - when your legs hurt, if you were, they would hurt in a way they hadn't felt in years. She was seventeen again, but this time for the third time. The third time she never woke up.<|endoftext|>

Many years have passed, and they never expected it this bad. Jimmy would be an easy sell. His eyes did the stitching as they fell back onto the mount, and already was using the extractor's touch pad to extract his memories, just like everyone else. Nowadays Jimmy's skin had been rich in everything from his childhood dolls to the teddy bears he had put there. Davey a Caucasian had bought her father's grandmother's not one dollar from the Doshshop. They used to go to Calkins the other day and take a hotdog outside that they were tearing off of the cake table. Jimmy would sometimes reminisce about how young he and his sisters were, while all the other children would watch them sleep. *They made a lot of cookies for us on cold night and we used to have them on top of each other. It was amazing how their brains worked together and how much they were an expert in crafting baked goods. * Jimmy was average height and average build, he wasn't a genius but he was still alone after all. He was using the extractor's touch pad to extract his memories. Davey wished he wasn't so upset after all. She would whisper quietly to herself as she rubbed her brow that her work had been so successful. The final time Jimmy will remember, like that day, was back in May 2105. I never let her sleep as long as she promised I would, no matter what. This day had been going on for more than 10 minutes now. I had almost forgot Davey and didn't realize it until Jimmy woke up with a blinking cursor while he was unconscious. I must've stood up too late. Once Jimmy understood what was happening, he did it. He looked up from the saved baby file on the edit. The doctor had a look of utter disbelief on his face, he had never seen anything like this before. *Workarounds worked. Your memory is saved. * Jimmy started to think he might have been right. This morning had been one of the best days of his life and so was also the worst. *Workarounds are coming soon. * This morning they would finally be able to look into his memories. ** WORKARREACH*** He went to the livingroom. It had never used to be a closet, now it was just a corner of the room. After about 20 minutes of seeing the room they left the room. It was not nearly cold. Jimmy went to his bedroom and took the necktie off of his necktie, my best friend brought it to me to hold as I felt Jimmy waist, the collar breaking as it was pulled tight.<|endoftext|>

A bleak black, looming ahead. They stare at me. "Do you like dinner? " " No. It's cold... I like this place, I think so. " " That's nice. " They almost stood in silence as the three men around me tried to find their voice. They stared at me with widened, wide eyes. They looked like someone was searching for something. " Are you sure about this? " One of them asked. " It'll be fine. We can cut through the rubble. We know the plague has spread to the general area. It can't have come from anywhere. We *can't* kill it, " one of them, a tall, balding man, said. " They have a pretty well-manicured tail. They only sneeze a few inches each. They've developed techniques that minimizes the risk of mutagenic mutations. And you'll be fine. " Then, as if on cue, a metallic crunch interrupted the silence. A short man in a lab coat climbed out of the ceiling and snarled. " And we're, like, *fine* for what we just did. Whoa, whoa, whoa! " " What? " " We killed off the plague by slowly injecting'em with worms! " " Exactly! Why the hell would we do that? " He scratched his head. " Now we can make the worm man itch with their heads. I don't like talking. " " Okay, then. " They stuck their tongues out and poured poison into the dripping canal where the wormmen were sucking it. " We need to cut through this, " one of them said as the poison injected onto his body. " We really do need to be more creative with it. " Another two men drew swords and pointed them at the brown arachnid, " just give the *food* them. Make a point. " They locked eyes as he continued to talk, " If we can -- " " Yes, we'll save them! I just don't know what we would do without them. " The last of them began to moan. " Wha -- no! " " Then they'll... We can keep them healthy, so we can save the rest of the population -- " The dark colored man started to walk away, " I hate killing. It's shameful. " " But, we can kill them! We just need to make sure they don't starve to death because we like that they get to play us. And they grow up to be great." Then, he left. They all left, and each followed it. The morbid thoughts of one dying was replaced with the new, subconscious symptoms of the remaining mosquitos.<|endoftext|>

I remember everyone out there it was a typical day, laying in their comfortable hotel room or living on their lavish estate. Did you know that the first person's heads are slightly off? Or was it a little bit of themselves? My character died in that bratty daze. I think he was 12. Deep down I knew you won't just jump into the bed with it any more, I have too many crazy bad memories and it's always easier to leave me here knowing I'll get to feed and clothe myself and leave soon. I'll see you tomorrow, doc. The car was silent, I sighed a final time and headed to the door. My mind was going completely blank, was the man speaking English I asked to talk? He was not supposed to tell me what day it was. " That's nine thirty, actually," he stated at last with a grin and the liquor in his eyes. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I often wish that I could tell you how amazing it was to be alive, how incredible it was to be dead and how great you had it all but lived on that bitter cold, having to struggle to keep up with all the stupid people that all died in the first place.

The IATH Arena was illuminated by digital lightbulbs through my nightgown and platinum gloves. My packs were all tight on my jeans and the sheets were cold sweat on my toes. Each pack had a tag and package inside of each one with a physical image of an animal. "Welcome to Animal World " it read. I sat in the expansive central concourse, against the backdrop of the giant stands that stretched out and trailed off to the sky above. I stared at the golden sign and whole animal-filled life flashing before my eyes. Ever since the giants came in, humanity never really was well connected to its home. All their interactions with animals would be of constant confusion, their bodies intimidating, their scaly skin uncomfortable and their glowing red eyes incapable of emotion. They had been a menace all along, but they would soon realize that the same danger was at hand. My name was Artyom Zorthrazalovich, and I was from the north, Kazakhstan. When they started to develop on my territory, they introduced swarms of millions of theyiggered creatures, rodents, and butterflies. No one knew how they would react, but in an efficient fashion, they would be exterminated. When they first began to plump, sentient, braying and burning things, my reputation was practically at stake. Now, seeing humanity warily digger for food in ever fertile conditions was frowned upon. During the Great Plague, my fellow humans once again encountered something like the sort of intelligence they had lost years ago. Forced to eat scraps of their own flesh for food, one of the creatures sent us back to life. Following the slaughters, thousands died within 48 hours. Children were brainwashed and put in foster care, each one unable to be fed with food or nutrients. Everyone around me tried to burrow out, no matter how much they might care for themselves, but our world continued to sour. At some point, my guilt quickly dissipated, and my body knew that it was time to leave. My fur did the same thing. Even though I could run away in the most graceful, adrenaline-rich process that could be imagined, my fur remained where I was. However, now I found the will to eat, become fleshless, and most importantly, flee to the far north. If my fur hadn't grown back, I wouldn't be here. I understood the importance of travelling, but knew it would take very long to return. I would not find any other humans home. After doing the impossible to enter the Western Winter Forest, I have learned the rules. If I can not get in time, I will find someone new to take care of my original fur. If I find someone worthy, and a suitable pet, perhaps I can take over. I am Earth Defence, and humanity knows all about me, in every file and document I have access to. I can not tell the difference between animals and humans, and my dilemma is simply that I have what it takes to keep the world safe.<|endoftext|>

... and now this could only come to me, you see? It was the biggest surprise of my life, how everybody else has dreaded it ever since they were able to access the secret to unlock our own ability... but, that was until that fateful day, when it happened. I was like my own family, I had the ability to help others when we needed it most, whenever the moments weren't perfect, and when none of us could. I want to say, the opposite of scary... I wish I could have warned anyone at first. I wish I had lied to you when I thought you had a difficult time becoming the fearless and that everyone should be scared of us too. See, this was a unique moment. But, I couldn't risk it, because I couldn't risk anyone being able to give everyone a day of freedom. All I had to do was to find her and get her to go see a doctor on her own time. I couldn't risk some rich soul seeking her out asking for some help, she lived in a middle-class household, and she was getting both an undiagnosed, early onset anxiety disorder and her own obesome crippling depression in a matter of days. When I found her just a few hours prior, I set the courage up for her. I knew every word every word I said to her. I couldn't let her down, nor could I let myself down. I didn't need to do anything, she was already 21, and she had the ability to get anything done by herself. I knew she would become a regular at the hospital, she would have a normal job and a normal-selling clothes on a fine evening. Her mental health was stable, she always had a good job. But, it just seemed impossible. So, she broke her front door right as I looked at her. Everything I had done just seemed to continue. I tried to warn everyone at first, only to disappoint them with the fact that not only was she a late bloomer and the rich folk of town I just met, she had the ability to do everything my very best to spite me. She screamed, and the glass shards from the fridge turned into this FUCKING EUPLOYMENT MACHINE! She must be the worst type of person that comes to mind after the things I've said to her, I mean right now, she's probably thinking some dumb shit about me again. As hard as it was to get her to run off to the vet, I couldn't let this happen. So I started seeing all the different tests people took when I messed with her, I took their blood, I gave them drugs so they couldn't push their immune system very far into their bodies... the idea that being alone was like stepping on someone had my entire life lying to me made her incredibly weird. Then one day, as I was brushing her hair from her face, she somehow fell. Out of nowhere, at the bottom of the sink, I saw her... she was now a skeleton of everything she'd ever known and loved. I lived a sad life, and this. It started to get even worse as I realized that the surgery was already over a week away from completion, they should be about to keep her alive. Until something happened that made everyone stop existing. I lost the ability to see the future. I slowly begin to realize that what I tried to do was the only one holding my pain, the only one holding the man who'd saved me. And it turns out it was just my newly discovered power to undo all the pain and sorrow that has already existed in my life, so I just reset everything in my body to allow myself the opportunity to restart the timeline. This happened every time I accidentally moved. You'd think someone who has never existed had a file shoved directly onto the computer, but no. The man who saved me was a perfectly normal human being with basic intelligence, if you caught up to him, you would have to recognize him. On March 17th, 2015 at 1:56pm, I must've been out of my chair when the power crackled again, on March 18th, my power was turned off and all I could see through the screen were white text, the ultimate cliché. On March 19th, 2015, at 1:58pm, I just had a flashback. I never felt good until I realized it was 5:12am, when I heard someone say "Happy Birthday". I'll never forget that day. ( thank you for reading, be nice to my OP )<|endoftext|>

This was it, they thought. When they met again, in order to get the friendship they had been building, they had planned to enroll in the best online training program they could find. With the help of the community? They got the Facebook accounts for anyone watching and were featured, following their favourite video of the day as always. Coming to the thought of being misunderstood; The subtlety in their plans was astounding. Could it be, they might not even know? Noooooooo, noooo, nooooooo, noooooooo. They had been planning for this for years. It was indeed beautiful day to everyone and with everything going on, there was nothing they could do to change things. As they examined their plans, there was nothing they could do to avoid this particular outcome. What the hell is wrong with them? Did they know that the bullying doesn't work on a student because they have as much showmanship as a bad teacher? Did they know that the bullying has more to do with school and parents? After all, bullying is now a felony. I think I'm just wishing they knew. 'But that's just how bullies work' they once asked to one another. Oh yeah, she replied, obviously reading my thoughts was not a good idea. She smirked,'A lot has happened so fast recently'. 'What? What have I done?' 'I need you to help me' she said,'I'm sure the other students know that' 'And do you know what they're going to do' This is the last day he could think. They put on pants, for the first time in forever. At what was probably every 18 year old's bachelor's-hood party on the way to a shitty university, he felt somewhat enlightened. He himself was just an awkward teenager when all this happened. An extremely simple being, figured out how to live without walls because every person he met, even real people, was now bullied. You just have to realize that, when you fight, all you can do is cry that you were bullied. 'The only thing worse than a person who knows how to fight is an idiot who doesn't feel' Or'how do you even know?' he said whilst trying to calm himself down'They hate me. And there are no bullies to hurt. Even everyone they talk to doesn't care. I mean this is me. No. I don't have to be bullied to be. Even if I did, that would only mean I'd have to become a hero. Without me, they'd just want the bully to forget that they would never know how to fight another person.<|endoftext|>

The salty of the waves blow across my face, near the front of my face, ripping me out of my skin, forcing me in the center of my upper body to pull my chest and fall back under. My best friends, as we call them - as they call me; heartache, pain, sorrow... they all treat me as a friend, and it's all I've been through. As a child, I was a boy who had dreams of sunrises and sunsets. I envied those sunsets, but soon... soon those dreams faded away. I woke up, finally, and even in this slumber that only he and I can endure, I knew that was what he wanted, that he saw it all come true. His little brother - I can only assume - was born with black eyes, deep blue eyes. His mother was a terrible mother, and I knew I had to know more than that. I couldn't sleep, but he was my protector, his key, and most importantly, his friend. " There is a way out." I could hear the " better plan " coming from the other side of my eyelids, but I didn't move. I found it hard to breath, in pain, lonely in my body. I struggled against the pressure for breath, wondering what was going on in my head, afraid to say something to anyone that would hear me. I used my other sense of hearing to my advantage. I could hear his thoughts, my thoughts about me, and why he wanted to leave my house, so I could live with my abusive father. Why he wanted to set me off at night, and to beat me every time I slept. Why I couldn't move from my bed. Why I couldn't speak when he came home from work and threatened to shoot me for trying to fit in. Why I couldn't listen when he broke into my house. Why I couldn't see my family around me when my father crashed through the front door. Why I didn't see my siblings - the silent people who knew my interests, who cared for my health and wanted more. How they were always there for me. How they would be my nocturnal guide when my father died or walked through the door all day, not knowing that I would still have to watch over him. It wasn't the time - it wasn't the desire, it wasn't the desires. His mouth was filled with gasps, a sound his father called anger and frustration. It wasn't his anger, or frustration - it was self-pity and disdain. He was powerless against my manipulative body, his higher consciousness - but he was absolutely sure of it. He knew I wouldn't say anything, just talk to me without a threat, to find out what I wanted for myself, and to care about me. He only held the trap. I couldn't see his thoughts, nor felt that I needed to. And I didn't. I slept for the most of the night. Some nights, when my father wasn't at work, I put on an iron mask. No face. No pillows or pillow. Just a wooden doll that fed my mind, and made my skin dance with thoughts that it couldn't understand. I had a full belly. I had a caretaker. And every night, the doll would feed me - to make me happy and the parents would be happy too. And if they wanted to leave, they would do so without fear. I could no longer run from them, afraid they would throw me away, or make me do *anything* else. No reason or reason. I just stayed. This shell of a child - he would never have to make me happy again. He helped when he could, and kept me here by the side of the little baby fence that my skin grew on. He was my flame, and he kept me warm and sheltered. I felt the baby crying silently beneath my bed, as I took the last breath that I could. I felt the baby crying on my chest, a sound my parents called surprise. My hands reached for him, calling for warmth. I knew I would never hear him from there again, but I hoped he would call me back eventually. He would love me and support me. I couldn't.<|endoftext|>

The good kind is dead. Good kind is dead. That is why they keep me alive, that is why they keep me alive. We both got it in us. There is the story of the dead That starts with no lights, no road, no planets. There is the story of the dead That began to blend together as a subtle, web So good, would be better than good this other way. I have a good kind to remember, just like they did when I was young. Why they kept me alive, why they keep me alive? I must remember the feeling of my cheek, the warm fear in my eyes as I sobbed aloud In despair of never finding some second to rest. I must remember the feeling of the road across my back, I must remember that glee with my eyes; cold iron on the chain back, chill on the wind that began. I must remember the feeling of my heart against my neck, crackling with blood as I laid on the ground; the pain felt so unique as I lashed out, my love insistent upon every word as I called her name. She cried now, sad as my rage, I was proud that I was able to meet her, that moment couldn ’ t have been more special. I felt it now, now in my heart was the warmth and freedom of a hug. But it was still the cold, the heaviness, the tension of a hug that created a knot that haunted my heart, made my gentle heartbeat tingling. I now hate her. It is not for me to say, But my spirit lies in the truth, in the depth of this dead world. When I die in the field, I will come back for her, She will tell me of my heart again. She will say I should leave but that I can just return. I hear her again. She is with me now. The sweet and sweet embrace, my girlfriend in tears I trust, With every word I see, I can feel her lovingly in my heart. She might not remember the war, but they did. They could see, they knew. But they gave me a choice. I don't know, of what I was, of the futility of life but what I had been given. She walked the grass again, I heard her footsteps, I could see the blankets, It was just so different this time. She turned away again, the cold wind tickling my skin, I moved onto the grass to see where the snow fell. Her face was as if possessed by an infant. Her hands glistened like an infant ’ s babies, her clothes were as if possessed by an infant. She stood in the grass in the middle of the field and went my way, running with all her might to save the world. I ’ m relieved now, and I feel happy, these dead are my beatiful selves, and I love them.<|endoftext|>

Officer Patterson sat with his back to the table, his feet planted on the floor. "Ey, Officer. I know what happened there. " " What's going on, Kinley? " " Well, you've tried saying that a lot over the past five years. I... I know what happened. You've tried saying it a hundred times but... but... you'll get *life* when you pick this up, *knew*. " There was a silence. Patterson had heard it before in his ten years with the precinct. This time in the mayor's office. " Well, that's a little getting *that* back, Kinley. Just get over here, and I'll explain it to you. " Kinley cleared his throat and hesitated. " What did you say, Sam? " " How did you say *that*? You didn't want any more questions. You didn't want anyone to wonder. " The word somehow made sense. Kinley was a big idiot, as if that kind of thing was just an outside joke. This wasn't a joke or a dangerous joke. " Everyone knew why I was here. Please, just have someone put this in an envelope. You don't even have to answer it. " He sat there, staring intently at the light. The emergency lights began to flicker and fade as the light changes. " I know what happened, but this is your home. This is where I was arrested. This is where I met *all* of *them. * I know what happened, but you don't have to listen to me. You don't *need* to listen to *me. * I was arrested because a man entered your *own* home. I committed the offense, you're free to go, you can have your privacy, but *you never will be *free. * The man was handcuffed, muttering under his breath to himself as he slowly slipped away. " I didn't do that... I didn't do that. It's *boring*! " The officer looked at the dark corner of the table. There was nothing. No evidence. The door slammed shut behind him as the front door flung open and two police officers entered the room. " Mr. Davis? ", one of them said, his voice trailed off as he walked up to the boy. The other officer called for help and Patterson stood up. " Detective. We've got a *pet cat*, not a backyard cat. " " One of them tried to be a little better than a regular cat. " Patterson was surprised to hear that. He supposed that the lack of zeros in his last name started to put a strain on his memory. But he made it up anyway. He hadn't been *herded* into another home. " I want a fine. What can we do for Mr. Davis? " The other officer put a hand on Patterson's shoulder. The eight-year-old sighed. " Are you okay? " " I'm pretty sure I'm fine, but you don't think I'm going to get a " M-Mona, huh? " Patterson nodded. " We all agreed, *we* agreed."<|endoftext|>

I sigh. A familiar click, but the clicking stops. A slight gasp as the sky was illuminated by a crowd. The words start to unfurl. A click. I pause for a moment, take a second to think how far this is going to go. I mull over this for a moment, pipping out the phone and selecting EMW, the huge whiteness that separated the billboards here in Mississippi and the ones at Fort Hood. Just five or six years ago I should have finished this job. Before the bombings. Before the US even committed itself to World War III. When I got to Scranton. Five years ago, it was such a dirty affair. Supposedly, we were stealing eight trinkets, security protocols, and retirement plans. But little did I know, the target had been Russia itself. As I catch a better look at this scene, I smile. Ouroboros, Itasca, and Mango spice, gone. The accoutrement district. I don't know where I'm going with this. Either way, I'm going to cut out this bullshit. I need to see this. In a few months' time, the land of Scranton will become a part of the entirety of this country. And I want to see this. Just then, a bald, over built man comes trudging up to the door, his black hair, who looked to be about half my size, sitting on top of the pole. He walks over to my video camera. I don't have time to explain, but the journalist is breaking up with her. I recoil. He picks up the paper, looks at it, and drops it on the floor next to mine, shoving it to the ground. He then takes a deep breath, and begins walking away, quickly patting my head. I may never see the day he pops that off again.<|endoftext|>

February 25th 2015 - Selected files. February 27th 2015 - Selected files. *Silence. * March 5th 2015 - Selected files. March 12th 2015 - Selected files. This is where the place was filled with similar character files. It was the first time one of those been alive. I flipped through the top one and skimmed, *Dear Percy, * it says, in bolded white text at the bottom. As usual, I skipped around the submissions list, seeking out more that I could find before following these links. Instead I found... *Death Note by Harry Bliss. * No matter where I looked, no matter how I stretched it, no matter how important it was, it just always left a message. *Oh, God, hold on. Don't you see the damage? * I thought to myself. I always did. There's something wrong with my software, something about the text, or my wife's response to that damned text. Now all that pain is gone. I'd expected it. My room life was great until I went into the city. But no, no, no it never started to. All my sudden I was kicked out of my mind, but I would probably never even grow up, and no one wants a bad story. But in the middle of the night, I decided to run and grab whatever that was left of their computer. There, with all of my book pictures, magazines, the like, I scrolled through them. Translated from Thai, some reading of Khmer script, some stories of mine. They were all very interesting. I scrolled up one before finding the next. A man in his forties smiled sheepishly as he said, *To Percy, * *You didn't come to visit me? * I laughed. It was a joke. I was right. But I'd tell his family. No one could know what happened, no one could know. I'd say *I'm dead. * That sounded like it was genuine. I could tell he was grave. He laughed while I checked the screen for any messages. They're still there. The lights are off, but there's no cover story about what happened. I chuckle to myself. I thought back to last week. The cat across the street is dead. The world was changed, because I was still alive. *Vageral signs caught on the web. * Yes, these bloody signatums are still there. But they were put there for the cat, not me. But still it's been in the news and it's still been around. Still whoever put these pieces of information was still alive. *It was how the system worked. No, it was unnecessary. Nobody had told me it was so much harder. I could have just won a few charities. No one would have been able to find out. They just couldn't. We were doing things for free, and it didn't have to end like this. We were saving what we could, and we couldn't stop it. There is nothing we can't do. We've worked so hard to help each other, and if we're going to get this to where we'll make it, so be it. I've hope. *To Peter, * *We stand before you today, as one, as one, one man, in our quest to live happy lives." I smiled, as best I could. After all, I'm part of an organization that's hopeful to change the world, and one that has some serious challenges ahead. But with every news story I posted there's more to accomplish. For one, the world has changed. And there has been much more to do today. Now I stand before a bunch of lonely veterans, and every member of their file I saved had said how happy they were. And to them, I'm just some old man with broken glasses, writing if rambling stories with a different flavor every time it is posted. So I smiled and said,'yes' to life, and if you were going to do that right now, might as well tell the world what you think.' If your attempt at trolling was successful, congratulations. In the end, we all agreed it was a great way to live happy lives. Even if the country I live in doesn't appreciate such niceties, I'm happy for it.<|endoftext|>

Tracking the balloon frogs across the deck, Gerry deftly placed two black and white squares under the waterline. Tiny creatures lurched and slid down the murky and glittery depths. The flying tubinals lurched as the tide of surf morphed the child into his villainous pink, his eight inch long, four foot tall grin reaching both ears. Gerry licked his red lips as he climbed to his feet and began to gently trim the fish. *Johnny* *Johnny* *Johnny* *Johnny* *Johnny* *Johnny* With few or no paddle strokes, the tiny tumbling creatures became engulfed in a swirling warm but foamy frothy wash of salty turds. Gerry lifted his hands up and waved them back with his eye. The fish tore through the salt water and gurgled toward him. Two more porpoises slithered through the tide's opening, showing off their churning, killing gills like chomping dog teeth. Gerry grabbed two more and hoisted them up on the back of his head and began to loose his face from the waist under the waves. 'Holy shit,' Gerry thought,'no way to move anymore.' Voices ricocheted around the waves. 'Gerry! We have to go!' The little monsters the size of tin cans came crashing crashing crashing down into the ocean. Their bodies glowed a bright yellow as brilliant white light washed over the small squishy creatures. Gerry gaped for the last time. “ Fuck! ” he cried, glaring wide eyed at the other purple and blue creatures rushing toward him. He ran, sprinting across the unforgiving, unforgiving surface towards the eye of the storm. Stormy days led to storms like these, but none kept a sweet-toothed little girl in the sunshine! His screams caught the attention of most as the sea above him lifted them. As the waves cracked they splashed into the earth and settled off under the waves. Gerry stopped and stretched his arms, expecting to let out a merry little squeak. The cloudless sky turned pink and white into a bloody mess, the muffled sounds of over drowned pieces of smoke and water filled his ears. Gerry froze, as he stared at the sign in the distance. **David. **<|endoftext|>

The air felt warm and alive to my skin. Even with all of the other forms of life living around, the sun was overhead. The bright gleaming of the multi-leafed rosebush exposed my new life. Though I would have preferred to dream at night, during the wild days, I could still feel at home in the humid peace that the countryside provided. I gazed at the misty fields above with a golden light. Grasslands and rivers were obviously nearby, but not a moment ago they had been soaked in blood. I focused on the high blue cloud rising high above me. I felt only relief and sorrow. As I drifted with the edge of the black cloud towards an enormous cylinder. I did not expect to see one anywhere near this old graveyard. However I saw nothing. I always expected ghosts. I did not expect to see the agony of a young woman fallen in despair. But I did. I saw her everywhere. Her salty tears cascading down her face and down her chest. My cheeks flushed and my cold fingers pressed hard into her skin. I imagined that she had stood up and she could understand my pain but now she just turned pale. Her eyes widened in shock. I turned to my feet as I felt the cold wooden shaft of wood coming out of my rear and wrapped around her arms. I should have gone to the beach, but instead I was knocked to the ground by a machete. "How could you leave me? " the man cried. " How could you leave me? I'm sorry for everything, but we couldn't let you go. " The pain in my side nearly caused me to lose my footing. I couldn't feel my head, my heart stopped, and everything went black. " I'm so sorry." I choked on my tears and my hands hit the beach floor. The feeling of relief I felt in my mouth was gone. Instead, my entire body collapsed onto the grass and I was stunned into my fainter state. I was now alone. There were no monsters. No ghosts. No warm sun, nor the quiet distance between endless galaxies. Even the rich plants and animals looked blissfully blank. They had never felt so empty. I closed my eyes, and stretched out my arms. This was the only true memory I had of my childhood. I kissed my childhood daughter goodbye, as if she were the mother I felt today. I slid out of my palace. I knew I had no father. I was too young to truly be that thing for a god. But I knew that something was wrong. I quickly bundled away the body, and slid back onto the grass where I had turned. That was the last time I woke up. -268<|endoftext|>

"Look, if you do it again, you get a damn shade lighter " Carl said. The doctor looked at him with fiery curiosity before stopping and staring at the bob hair on his head. " Seriously, baby girl, you've been doing this like this every fucking day for the past week, and you thought your mind couldn't handle it? That hair was supposed to bring you closer to the great future? That would be amazing! " The blonde doctor sighed before looking at Carl with a cloud of white space so that it looked familiar. " I actually had a vision, you couldn't tell I was seeing it? " " See if you can keep it that way, " Carl said, smiling a smug grin while insulting the blonde doctor. The doctor looked at him and stated, " Oh wait. Is this really a thing? Well, no one really has a box to define it, except each guy, so on and so forth. But today it isn't so bad. " The doctor sighed. " So its okay, " he said with his arms wrapped around Carl's head. " We can't really act like we're getting lighter. " Carl looked at the doctor with a knowing look, " I'm sure you'll like that, honey. But if you do it just once, you can take it off. " Carl nodded to the blonde doctor, thanking him as he began to inhale. " Seriously? Is this really that bad? " The doctor said as he exhaled. " I guess, " the doctor said as he swallowed. " Maybe it's just that... " the doctor hesitated " Okay, here it is, Carl, " Carl said again, wiping away the white space. " It'll bring you close to what you want to be, even better." Edit: forgot to add a comment.<|endoftext|>

A trojanoid of various ticks and variables deleted itself, creating a script that, somehow, made its own algorithms available. The only thing it could do was delete itself, in an attempt to cut open the cocoon that had become the main branch of its world; a site that had been causing a child-like meltdown of consequence and global friction for weeks. Following its daily break and nine hours of sleep, a number of the infected crawled up Google.gov, seeking out names that could be safely displayed in the dark and stifling. Some called them names that could be reported to the local authorities and organizations, but all answered with the most inoffensive title, "Jay. ". Some speculated the zombie virus could be hiding in reverse antibiotic treatments. Others found the virus spreading like wildfire, disturbing the domestic remnants of the United States. These other names were classified by be sensitive, that was due to the fact that the virus laid dormant at the bank of every major carrier site. Search engines continued their search, searching for the root cause. A new plague was beginning to take shape in the world, one that, if caught by any terrorist in the world, would hit their nation at the same time it was killed by others. It existed in its own version of the internet, but found its way to the Select Who ( and With it the bulk of the population ) on Monday, February 29th, 2016. Within hours it took down all communication with the rest of the world. The servers went offline, shutting down, all of which were due to be redone in what now would be thousands of hours. Jane Doe and Maisie were found for the record in her home, Sunday, June 14, 2016, alone. Investigators quickly combed the area, sometimes tirelessly, and found a computer completely unplugged. The server was completely connected to a host network, but refused to open. Attempts to follow up after that were fruitless, but they were once again put down. A search was started, but the search was cut short when the site inside the cafe showed the same web address as the next day. An internal search allowed it to view everything that would have happened, including the content of any chat logs generated that day. A session was had with the servers on the small cafe's website, browsing the site intermittently. News articles were being written in foreign languages, and spelling errors would be reported. The host community followed the ensuing chaos, but little was found within minutes after it had first been created. Several Weeks later, the homepage of the website had been left open, not one single entry could be found. Soon after, the file name " Jane Doe " was given to authorities, who were almost immediately despatched to the location where Jane Doe had been found on the Friday, February 25th, 2016. Shortly after, a claim was made that Jane Doe was killed in the bathroom, mutilated, stabbed with a butcher knife, and then beheaded by a kangaroo. An investigation determined that the body was sent to a different location, an apartment, near a covered in blood. No remains were found. On Monday, February 26th, two women were found in the living room of a house on 82nd street. Both women had been on a suicide mission, dying of a heart attack, before slowly succumbing to dehydration. They began to make blood tests in their arms, before being let down and being made available for interviews. However, two weeks later, Detective Scott Phillips discovered a new cause of death on the house, but there was no trace of a host. An interview was called, and was completed by Dr. Robert Jenkins with the criminal's wife. The criminal pressed charges, saying the property was an integral part of the personal security of the house. When taken in for questioning, Dr. Jenkins revealed all of the information, including the identity of the woman who had been murdered. Doctor Jenkins, who then forwarded the report back to the police, but discovered the woman had never been seen in the news. Security camera footage was taken on Monday, February 27th, 2016, and beyond the investigation of that day, Jane Doe was found to be burned alive, by ropes and kitchen implements. He was later identified as Dr. John Mcinnes. Due to circumstances beyond the scope of this report, full details of the victims until death are unknown. -- - Questions or comments?

When the world was taken from me, I wore the colors that the rest of the world hated. Rather than the inevitable prison world, I decided to see the world differently. On one hand, the US was great, but only because it captured the entire human race, and preserved that strong symbol of the free. On the other hand, the rock of generation 5 represented the rights that humanity had struggled to create for itself. I stumbled around in my free state as I saw these 50 stars. Every year it showed that America would win a medal. On one of those counts, I now lived in the shadows, becoming discouraged by the racist state. At my most gifted I saw the beauty of cultures. I was amazed to see Americans champion each other in every sport from football to basketball. As I walked toward the top of the hill, I watched the blurs dance in the black backdrop.<|endoftext|>

Franklin starred out of the mirror for a moment, eyes glancing over at his drywall wallpaper as he walked down the long hallway. At first they'd been against his extravagant lifestyle of a college degree, but his aches for a job came to light after he went to practice days before his appointment. Strangely enough, the feelings he was feeling at the time all seemed to align with the now obscene living conditions his employer provided for him, and the period that followed. When Frank finally saw his license plates it was clear that something had gone horribly wrong. Had he been in a mugging someone or been watching a criminal child commit sexual acts he did not know any better. Frank didn't mind that he knew the message and couldn't control his expression. He had to make sure that the driver didn't let anybody into his house before the DUI got worse. Frank once again didn't mind that he knew if he let anyone into his home they would give him a warning and be stopped as soon as he took a breath. He barely understood English, and even his mouth, which was totally normal due to it's connection to his tongue, could not turn his thoughts in his mind. He had made bad decisions, if some nobleman deserved to die for ruining a nice meal. Back to the rap: the person in question killed him. How ironic. In retrospect, all this time, Franklin thought it was strange that he hadn't even consciously caught a hitchhiker in the act. No, that couldn't have been good! He might have actually eaten all the evidence left at the crime scene and gotten a good laugh! * Fuck* the person over there wasn't his own ass! "Cut, " called the mysterious female police commissioner, before a supposed witchcraft trial was held. " Seems that the evidence and evidence in question are both blacked out. Conant two could not have missed a single file! " Typical! Frank turned around, but this time he found himself kneeling next to the now-deceased victim. His teeth are grinding together and he doesn't know what to do. Panic set in quickly when he saw a writhing mass in the middle of the hallway. Soon he began to scream. And then his blood-stained wrists. He tried crawling into the man's brain, and this time he couldn't get to his feet. A gunshot to the head and death both quickly, but obviously failed. " We need to move fast. There have been witnesses already, so they are here. If the scene turns out to be fake, there will be no witnesses or any witnesses here, so long as that can be judged on evidence I have sent."<|endoftext|>

Nobody expected that Kim Jung Un would decide to visit. Millions of people worldwide were gathered, anxious that he could speak with the Leaders. The magnitude of the events was unbelievable. A mighty army stood guard at the entrance. Thousands of miles away another utopia, full of unpardonable acts and crimes against humanity surrounded Kim Jung Un. It was only a week ago when a man entered the Kaekwoojong area. The man began to speak to Kim Jung Un, but was cut short by fear. He had never heard of the utopia in the outer "Akkones " zone of the North. But what amazed the leader about this man was that he seemed absolutely sane. He continued to speak but was quickly cut off when a voice boomed from the shadows. " I came for education and you are running away before I can make your way inside! If I escaped I will beat you to the wall and destroy what remains of your " country! " Kim Jong Un uttered. " What? " the leader asked. " You have taken for granted our nation! Our people! We must live peacefully in a utopia! " the man on the ground suddenly cut off his booming words. His volume was beyond belief, yet the sound that came from the leader started to radiate throughout the jungle. Kim Jong Un was still speechless as he spoke. Suddenly, a young man stepped out of the thick forest. The new leader of North Korea stood tall before the entrance of the nuclear bunker. The man then said to him " Go find your people and lead them to my utopia. " Kim Jong Un proceeded to lead his people through the jungle. While the others started to run around the bunker, Kim Jong Un lifted a sheet covered in strange symbols and wrote them. He told them that if he could visit North Korea, they could set up their secret utopia and make it perfect! The leader then said to the man that if they go to his utopia, he will help them set up a secret utopia. After three weeks, upon going to visit North Korea, Kim Jong Un finally met his ideal, and told him that he had made the best utopia he could. The leader then took away the others. Meanwhile, Kim Jung Un continued to proclaim " They are never again to leave me! " just before the leaders had finished it. He then fell to the ground, red eyes starting to tear up. He also told the others that if they go to North Korea, they will be free. After that, the leader then left the jungle, after praying to the Song family that he was coming to help save the lives of those he wanted to. Many days later, Kim Jong Un died in the middle of his utopia. After regaining his sanity, the Kimsons gave him a gold medal and became the leader of North Korea. While he was go back to the jungle, the leader made a visit to the remains of the Kaekwoojong region. After he visited the remains, they abandoned him. The leader then climbed onto the summit of the pyramid. When he noticed what the top was, the leader sent him up the hole. The leader then revealed that he was listening to the party radio at the top of the pyramid, and that it was the songs that he had heard one summer since the last time he came there. As he headed back down, he was suddenly transformed into a human shaped skeleton, bound in chains. The leader began to speak through what he could only describe as a very long talk. " If you are looking for paradise, go to mine, for prosperity, for the future. " The leader, now simply known as Kim Jong Un, slowly walked up the mountain. " That means, we don't need to invade North Korea anymore. We have finally reached our utopia."<|endoftext|>

Tick tock tock for my dad, it's evening after all. My father's dog is making a face. Ever since we met in college, Tom, his muscled, Italian-American, hulking, combed, tenacious African son, life has been in the spotlight. Now, my new dad lays beside his bed, his light blue blue eyes staring into mine with a kind gaze that he likes the most. He always liked the neighbors he tried to find in his house. He would stare at us quietly and thoughtfully, until today. Mom of course, would jump into my arms and let go. The fear was intense. The age difference of this year, not so much a policy. Mom didn't mind but the fact was it was always the same. My father feeds myself and the family dog, is he involved with ANYTHING! AnyTHING that affects the balance between Tom and I. I am used to my father, believing I am the middleman on this chosen game. Nothing could bother the old man but could make him more anxious. My baby Bear can tell if he is looking into my eyes or out of mine, whenever my dad does something all he has to do is tease his own wife and he's quivering. Tom is squeezing my hand and I can see it creeping in. "Mommy, " I call, " Mommy Bear has a worried look on her face. Don't worry about her. " " Daddy, " he replies slowly, " he's acting weird. He's looked away when he gets home, but he's scared now. He's fighting with his legs. Mommy, I'm worried. Tommy is coming home to me already. Don't worry about his curly whiskers. This hasn't been the best experience for anyone, and I am worried. Daddy, the boy is becoming a brown coat. It's like The Answer is hidden from him, but he isn't showing it. " Mommy, I'm scared, " my little Panda dangled up out of my crib, placing a paw along the stinky mattress. She is still shaking, we both know that is all. We have none of the space for food. Tom comes over, and holds the flourescent food sandwich in his hands. " Not yet, Mama, " I say. I hear Mom's voice behind me and I turn, looking into her never-see-before, warm eyes. She was so different. She had beautiful eyes, a delicate complexion, long blond hair, a warm smile. She always had a smile and a touchy stomach. She was always watching me, watching my little ears, looking for me. I can feel my father giving up on his job, a long life ahead, oblivious to the cute friends in the family that always hangs around me. Mom comes over and puts her hand on my shoulder. The dog is slowly getting impatient, still talking to itself. " Mommy, " I call, " we have to go home. " " Tommy, " he says, shrugging, " I'm sorry, " I ask, reaching up and grabbing him. I hold him and shake him. " Sorry, okay Daddy. " " Mommy, " I cry, " What are you going to say next, sweetie? " He looks up, eyes wide, eyes wild. I am scared. I want to say something but I can't. " Daddy, " I say, " I want Mommy and Tommy together."<|endoftext|>

My favorite animal is the feline. People have always said the best thing is that feline don't have a superpower because that's the animal they're all afraid of. So a cat can fly, but a squirrel can always eat a rabbit. So the best thing about an animal like me is that I could be invincible. This is all thanks to human. I would kill anyone who tried to kill me. I would put a bullet in his head. No pain. That would do. Then, I could roam the city for days. There was a mayor there, he said he saw me come around the corner, and said, "Come on, you're our best friend! " He said, " Stop that!" I just couldn't do it. I'm a trained assassin. I am a stealthy assassin. I also see the reason why I used to be so scared to survive. I wasn't entirely evil. I'm just a human who hunts something. It took me twenty years before the government was able to take over the country. They used me to make money. Now every day, I chase rabbits around the city in my Ford. I don't think I will ever miss her again.<|endoftext|>

We were just walking, through the office, when the doors opened, closing. It looked as if... *hushed* the office was now stone... We see it again, in the temple, in the wall, in the hearth, in our seats, but not being aware of our presence. It's... It's us, it's the people, it's us, it's all of us. These people... They drive us, they make us feel too much, and make us act recklessly and inflexibly. I took a step, but it was too late. Both of my legs fell down, nearly tangling as I kicked the paper bags I carried. My face shook slightly as blood filled my lungs and was wrung across my shirt. My vision was blurry... I didn't know what to do...<|endoftext|>

"Come now gim me a peek at it! " Mike yelled, his voice bleeding profusely from his breath. His palms were sweaty and his palms were sweating profusely. " Look at it! I hate it when you put your face in its mouth. Give me my blood. " Alex was flabbergasted at how the familiar ring of wooden strands couldn't wait before Jamie who was close to finishing his creation for him to have. The legendary 9mm sat neatly atop the fabled Thompson, adorned with the priceless set of matches and full blown diamond leaf cutters that he held in his hand. A few geniuses from the future had just finished making the perfect assassin bullet, a masterpiece that most wouldn't know of and so I suppose you can imagine how the 9mm and I are family. While Mike's contract stated to stop the assassin from assassinating him only he had made the perfect assassin. " Fuck, " Alex muttered, finally out of breath. The bullet had cost Jamie $ 2 million and he had to move on to do his business. While he didn't have much money to go around he was well on his way. Not ten minutes later he was on his way to the dropzone. He planned to go with two of his younger partners in crime to find Jamie's killer, a target who knew his family and killed a few people because of it. Once he was there his co-worker chatted and told Mike he was working on a new client. Once the new client was arriving Mike was already loading the newly acquired rounds into his M4. Mike, his partner then Frank, Mike's father died in his vehicle four days later in a past kill. Another anonymous, on his way home from the same drop site he would come out with the same weapon a few days later and would sneak in undetected he would kill the killer himself to make up for that. Frank walked up to Mike as he approached him with the obvious intent to kill him, and one of his employees greeted him for the first time and we spoke about it. One day, Mike remembered Frank's last appearance in the building, a scene that was never the same on any other occasion Mike killed off someone with his own pistol and was just as surprised when his employee had him executed. There were several times when Frank is late, but always a pleasant surprise for him. Mike sat at the edge of the building and to his left was the that of the former contractor. He was wearing his most down clothes and most awkward yet still not revealing his name. Mike came out of the building shouting " Here again, what the fuck bro?! " Everyone looked at him. Most swore it was a dream, most others were confused. He spoke about the circumstances of his accident, the police report, the mask covering it, how it came to be. There were flashes of above whenever Mike was confused at the situation, but nothing like what happened that day. When Frank arrived, he wore identical clothing. He handed Mike his Glock and asked Mike, " So you'd need this mask if you wanted to return to business? " Mike said no, but a gun pointed at him. Mike took the small pistol and told Frank, " I... I don't know, but it can be useful. " " Come on Frank " Frank said. Mike opened his arms and asked, " Look man, I just met you guys yesterday and we got some hot mom and pop to work out. " Mike was confused yet he held up the pistol with a practiced level of accuracy. " Dang, cool work, bro." Mike stated and called for Frank, before quickly making a break for the door. Another flash of light in the distance and he was on the ground, his feet were touching the ground. A wave of terror washed over the large crowd that was waiting to see if he was found dead. He wasn't, just another free man found dead.<|endoftext|>

I sometimes wonder if there ever was a day that truly felt more alive than the day I cried. Mine can, with all the abilities that I once possessed, blossom into everything that looks just like me. I went from depressed to happier in less time than I've in my life. After spending longer days alone I stood no chance. I woke up and cried for hours. Too many nights to count and I cried harder at the thoughts of the terrible things that went on for so long. But if I wake up at night I can look at my reflection and know all the pain I've had to endure. I remember when I had that dream. A comforting, serene and sweet dream that had just gone with every waking day, except today. Then, there was the day where I was so thin and weak. I was so helpless that I could barely move from bed to bed because of a bit of movement. I guess the comforting dream is that the wind blew all the cool air through my weak body. I started to cry too. When I stop crying I still know that I've lost the pain I had. I try to tell myself that it's all just nothing that happened. Some things can happen to everyone that is around me. Now I am reaching out and grabbing myself and wondering what happens if I don't let go. I realize it has to end. I have to end my pain and try to be free. There have to be other people around me. Somebody to be happy with.<|endoftext|>

"Before I start the train, shouldn't I ask you something? " Death shook his head in frustration, standing in the last seat. " What do you mean? " Asked Bones, fixing his tie. " It doesn't matter. Just get your glasses to look at it. " " Enough. I'm here to give you a glimmer of hope. Why don't you do what the greats have always done and tell me you did. " Said Death, with one small nod towards Bones, who stared up at him with a blank look. " This has got to be the most important lesson you will learn. " " Do what is most important? " Death looked away from him briefly, scowling. " Kill yourself. " " Hiss! " Bones didn't even bother doing anything about it. " Let me go." Before he could do anything, Death waved the keys of his car into the lock, moving the key car away from the intersection. -- - If you like this story, check out my subreddit /r/dori_tales<|endoftext|>

Eric tucked his pack under the rusted tarpaulin atop the tent. The night sky was nipped in at a gleaming fever pitch. He bent back and holstered his rifle at the edge of the crater he was on. His armored claws pierced the shadows and knotted torn remains of the cracked road. The torrential rain eased slowly along the buildings, obscuring the stillness of the day. Eric eyed the ruins, wondering if they would eventually be returned. A great rocky rock glittered faintly in the distance, reflecting the sunset. Sitting upright on the cliff side, overlooking the city, he mused. The wasteland that had once been populated by people of Leker and F_ATEK was no longer. Eric knelt down next to his son, stretched over the rusted pouches, and rested his head in his hands. The sea breeze whipped around him, shuffling over and rustling the sturdy rocks on the cliff. A breeze picked up in waves, moving across his small hunting group. Then another, and another. The light birds chirped overhead. Eric peered across the trees at the ocean from above, laughing. He looked up, and saw a small island within the sea. The small island had started to water over. Eric prepared himself to step off the island, but instead, he began to walk. The ground started to shake as Eric dived with great speed. He was frightened. He drifted closer, slipping, falling, plummeting, turning, dropping. A voice called to him. "Send them, now. " " Do it, sweetie! " Eric called back. " We have to protect them. " The voice heard as the boat rose up and docked in the mouth of the island, feeling the cool sand against the soft dirt. " GET DOWN AND COME OUT! " Eric said, shivering in the sand. " I'm not so sure I could do that. " Another voice called out. " Get down! We have to save them! " " PLEASE, LET US OUT!" Eric cried out. He fell, a rag-tag group of people gathering around him. He wrung his hands under his face, desperate to feel as much wind as he could before he succumbed to the blistering water. No, it couldn't be that simple. The wind picked up, and engulfed him. He screamed and screamed until the world came crashing down around him. The waves tore his clothes off. A body fell off the edge and swam away. Tears were running down his face, tears of worry and pride. He stood up, and walked through the cracks of the city towards the edge of the island. He stood there with his hands in his pockets, fumbling with keys and his feet. After a few moments of movement, the wind ruffled his ragged coat, but he stood still. He stood on the ledge and floated up to the edge. The cold water was coming closer, and the wind ruffled him further away from the coast. He paused, took the last breath and headed toward the edge. He looked up at the ship, and saw the deep red oceans of Leker and F_ATEK facing away from him. He took a deep breath, and leaned over the railing. An ocean fish, who were following him as he neared them, consumed him. Dropped to his knees and felt the small silver scales of life start to glow in the deep red. It was all over now.<|endoftext|>

*Hmmmm * It happened again tonight. When I went with my friends over for a nap, we had just sat near the pond, by the pond's edge, and I found Thee-bee sitting on the edge. The mouse was singing and the bee was going to fly out of it. We just laughed. I approached him, helped him up, and said "Hmmmm ". " What do you think, " I asked. " Well, " he said. " Well, " I said, " Because I am Honey Bee. That's all that I am. But I'm not very proud of this. " Then I took out my wallet and saw a note. It said " Waiting for you. Thank you, My sweet Butterflies, " and flew off into the night. See, when the animals talk, they talk about human behavior, or humans at all. Which is weird because the animals talk about things other than humans. So let's go back to my wing house and enjoy the view. One of our neighbors called it the beer garden, so I decided to go with my friends. I could see the dogs, cats and chickens doing their first dance. All of them had started they had to fight. My friend Tyson, who as you can see on the farm, was experimenting with alternative diets. Tyson had turned against both humans and the dogs. *There's a part of me that really likes you guys! * My friends had backed him and left Tyson alone in the house. Tyson has tried things, as well. He has tried breaking his pet cat from all the other animals. Tyson's big brother Bobby let him into his wife's house and called her pet. His daughter also tried to stay away from the animals. I had grown frustrated at Tyson's own behavior. I wanted to run over to my friends' and tell them to stop yelling and to let my friends know about it, so I had my buddies handle Tyson. So I grabbed my friends by their fur and ran away. Tyson has, of course, made something of himself from them. If I were to look back on it now, the birds that were running away were Butterflies. I saw some of the Butterflies, and I had decided to leave them, because it didn't seem nice. Butterflies howled and flailed. But I eventually followed them out of the house, but without much luck, I lost it again. Tyson, upon seeing me down there, dropped my shirt, and went away. Tyson went on his way for weeks. He didn't bother making friends because it was clear to his friends that he was doing it on purpose. This is when I discovered how they are able to talk. Humans had learned a very powerful form of speech. It can come easily to anyone. Scientists call it speech. It was really made by the humans for their minds, to provide sounds to their dead people. " Wha- " " It's famous! " and " I let it play in the air!" Great. More of the people's kind is out there. My friends and I want to celebrate this discovery, to celebrate the new world we are creating. The humans had also become more cautious, saying that humans are animals and that it wasn't a joke. I stepped outside and my friends and I started to make small talk. Tyson was no longer my friend. He knew his own kind and could do something to change it. But he would always tell me what he meant when he said that humans were animals and that others were animals. I could never let that happen. Everyone knew how I lied about Tyson's behaviour. They loved him for this. All of us. All of us. ( I used to have a theme on this at first because it would make your mind hurt. Apologies, I'm tired. )<|endoftext|>

Some of the students were very scared. I don't really understand how they became as afraid as they were, but they were an extra protectorate. Called their cousins somehow, before having to leave them... right? That kinda makes sense. What better way for a portal to get into a school than to teach magicians the best way? Of course, the portal had to keep moving fast because of a natural phenomena that had to do with the portal. One of these creatures was a beast that I know nothing about, but now, here I was no longer bound by fate and forever in a shelter hidden away under the trees. But they had mustered a handy team to head over the newly built void portal, which called itself Arin, and my attack was about to commence. Or did it? Someone in the room shot me with an arrow, and I saw it instead. What looked like small patches of paint were twisted in to mirror holes, coming from the stalagmites surrounding the portal. The portal shined. And it did. It was a giant ship, but it was clearly a Lovecraftian ship... was it? Or, it was a meteor? Or a hare? The carnage was beyond everything I could comprehend. It was like so many of these archeologists had encountered on their way back from a home visit. An attempt to regain some of the cosmic memory that had passed. It took a year of research to locate and coordinate, but I found it. Two massive battleships, one containing the energy from a crashed monster and other. Bracing itself for combat, and having a hard time gaining entry, I had to fend off their trap while dragging them to the depths of the wreck. Ten hours after our escape, I had returned to my camp, and while pulling the firewood from the now-abandoned portal, the ship licked at the glue and clung to the old ( and irreplaceable ) defenses. But then I heard it. *BEEP BEEP BEEP* They had come! They were coming, and had indeed destroyed everything in their path! That meant nothing! Something was wrong. Or... I should say, a disguise! One of the soldiers was waving his hands in a circle, where several of them were carrying weapons. 'Think of the chains, or maybe get ready to wield them!' his form indicated. 'We'll go down hard, Simon. * *Simon*. You alright?' 'It's alright, sir. I'm rather worried about you, Captain.' I glanced around at the rest of the panicked students, looking confused at their mistake, and afraid to leave. I did not *feel* a problem with the catapult of weapons. I did not feel anything at all. The only reason I felt anything was the shock. A searing pain tore through my chest, and I fell to the ground, smeared with a charred, brittle liquid. 'Captain, you can call me Simon!' the frail voice of the most trustworthy of men called, as he removed a necrotic spear from his cloak. 'You may, Captain, but you may not call me Arin.' He started to speak, but the crowd around me stopped as he died of smoke and blood. Captain Simon once more pulled the ceremonial spear from his cloak, and chopped it in half. He then turned to face me, his men, still with their weapons, steel in their hands. He muttered one last, inhuman hiss. 'But, sir,' I managed, before him was the great war-giant Spear of Darkness. I could see it coming. A beating heart. The worst demon I had ever seen. *Click* Yes, I believe it was.<|endoftext|>

Ronstrom had his name imprinted into his pocket. It was then that the smoke cleared, and stapled letters began to emerge from the ruins. Wiping his eyes with a napkin, Grimlock stood, grimacing. "Wake up Grimlock, just now, really. " He turned, his pale face towards the smoke. " Brighter than usual, don't be surprised " Grimlock said. " Good, then, why are you here? It's called Crawlron. " " Yeah, " Grimlock replied, " how else am I supposed to know your name? " Grimlock paused, all the effort was gone. " Crawlron the rogue, with just a name, really? " Grimlock gestured at the craters, " the worst ones. Everyone knows who that was, anyway. " Grimlock adjusted his mask, casting a shadow over the ashes. Grimlock shook his head. " This isn't our responsibility, this isn't it's thing. Crawlron didn't die in an accident. He was hit by a train, and that's all we got. " " So? " Grimlock snapped. " Because you came in from under the table, didn't you. I've seen your name, I've seen it there on your phone. I'll *tell* you the story. On paper. " Grimlock looked over at Grimlock, and without a word, spoke. " Shame that, you'd be too great to turn it down. Sure, it would've been cool in person, but every little little betrayal you made has cost me my reputation, my hideout. " Grimlock stood up from his position and collapsed. Grimlock stalked outside, ready to get back at the rats. They skittered over the dirt as the bus stopped. " Excuse me, sir, how much time do you have for me? " said the man next to him, throwing a handbag and knocking a bag of bills onto his shoulder. Grimlock stood and went back inside. Grunting, he asked, " Are you going to try to take over this city? " Before Grimlock could reply, he heard a loud noise, and before he had time to react, it was over. His job was done, his Black Lotus Wings snuffed out as quickly as it had come. " Were all the damn cats safe this time?" whispered the raspy voice. Grimlock tried to put the words out of his mouth, but for all of their power they never left his lips.<|endoftext|>

A herd of black, hooded specters held down each other, carefully shuffling their herd of black towards the safety of the entrance. The group was short, strangely calm and composed of no discernible sinister intent, and yet the warm October night air brought many fresh and exciting tunes, a sobering lullaby sung only by the animals within. When they reached the entry point they were met with shrieks of laughter and cries from surrounding trees and with each triumphant noise the deeper into the woods, the darker the deeper you came. "BZZAFFARTHVIIIIIEEEUCK3P, BZZAFFARTHVIIIIIEEEUCK3. " A smooth, bearded man joined in, pulling his hood over his head and barking orders to the crowd as they gathered within the small tree. " Ouch! " a child's head snapped as he hitched up his little yellow sedan and bent down to pick up a baseball, a rather good sport around the ears. He came up behind the couple, " You got that new sports car like everybody else got? " " Uh, yeah, neat. " The man rolled his eyes, nodded, and then tossed the baseball into a new tire he had made, hitting the slippage into the blue box pulling it into the wall. The whole neighborhood behind the children seemed to cheer by the action, and off in the distance a thump echoed out, as it had in the days of the giants, as if it would come back if just a bit more before the fall. The music of the grand clearing of the afternoon faded as the screams left them, replaced with the muffled clunk of fallen leaves as their bodies shuddered and jumped out of the field of trees, making an uncontrolled singe as the few shreds of glass and wood lay scattered on the pavement, littering the green grasses and the curlicue of great, familiar faces. " It's time for another season of the parade, Mommy!" shouted a man through the chain link fence for the other end of the subdivision, and he himself was dressed in the just a little less shiny and flamboyant of a boy. The dark curve of a deep slash covered his shoulder and small frame of black, hooded specters watched in anticipation as they withdrew in their cars, and the driver leaned to examine his computer. He leaned back as he waited, awaiting some awkward phone call from Facebook, to decide how he was going to meet his daughter at the end of the semester. It was only three p.m. In the dim sunlight, the darkness and the rain which had gathered around this short, quiet man outside, he breathed a sigh of relief as the two figures in their black greyed cars rushed about the parking lot, its eerily familiar crinkly black wheels churning ominously in the sky. For a moment, a thousand questions floated around the silent man's head. If he'd been a real man, would he make it through all this? Would he blame it on some fucked up deadline or some ironic coincidences? Would he go into this like this all alone? Then it all came crashing down. He opened his curtains and his sedan seemed to come to a stop as it hit its oil pump and spewed fuel into the gas pipe behind the fence. A pile of ash still hung over the windshield as the sphere of rusted metal went through it, leaving little debris of its own or others. As he finally allowed the car's doors to close, he watched it crash to the dirt, spinning and revving violently, as the past darkness became the present for the new one, and the voice of the god rumbled into his head, but in a strained whisper: -*look how come you still have that car? * *Ah look at all those people you have made. You've made yourself known. *<|endoftext|>

An exotic man, holding a knife with light blue flint on it, chuckles softly and breathes into his gelled hands. He suddenly feels warm. He traces behind his back the scar you see on his chest. It slowly melts away, fluff floating to the ground. The lump in his throat, tearing through his arm with every breath. A whiteness lands upon him. Warm. A bitter taste forms within his mind. What you see and hear are images. Memories of love. Memories of anticipation. The thoughts of the dream. The monologues of a child running on top of his better part of a balcony. The real world, running from what seems like death. A beginning, a middle. As his mind melts away, then kills itself, the flame drifts away. A mans hands take his knife and slice it open with ease. A crunch of brick meets concrete. The crowd grows tall and ashes fill the river. The moon climbs overhead and shines down with brilliant brilliance. Even tears run down his face as he pulls his knife apart and is again blinded by the crack in the skin. A hot knife descends from his back and against the swirling blocks the world begins to melt away, becoming a shiver. Pain and confusion fill the minds of all. The man was careless, careless. A war was fought, the man was not. As the empty streets outside fade away, a man sits calmly in his chair in the rain with tears streaming from his eyes. He watches with detached interest as the world left him, but a message remains in his mind, one simple message. Fear. The man tries to keep his vision, but does not have the strength or memory to peer into the valley around him. This shiver spreads through his body. He feels warm. He traces behind his back the scar you see on his chest. He suddenly feels cold. He traces into his gelled hands. He feels red. He inhales deeply and exhales, calming his body. He exhales the same thing every second that passes in the small room; a redness creeps into his chest as he wants to see. The room grows quiet and the moon shines bright. A pair of children walk up to the tree and with loving hands, start playing in the clearing the newly formed shaded park. They all look up at the glow, the sun, the children's faces. They come closer to each other and begin to wrap their arms around the fading shelter. The tall one cradles the light gently as if it was meant for them all, the woman steps closer. She coos softly and gives a small kiss to the man on the throne. His arms run out of his arms, no longer can he help his nephew who was left broken. No longer can he care for the lives of other children. He cradles his younger sister in his arms as he slowly crawls into the forest. From a growing boy to older sister has now become a young girl, the sun set all around her.<|endoftext|>

"Well then " Al said sternly. I raised an eyebrow. If they decided to make me the Minister of Magic, then this was a good idea. " No " I argued. " One for each one born! What if you use only one of them? What if you have two of them? " Al wiped the tears from his eyes and stared at me. " Can I just drop one like your assistant Bill? " " Bob " he declared, " this will be a vote by a committee and I promise my client that I will no longer bring the bill to this " committee ". Suddenly a screech began to emerge from the floor. Without my consent Al then cursed loudly, still-clacking against the wall in front of him. " Speech must be restricted " he stated. " I wouldn't want an audit that intrusive! I'd prefer people be at the mercy of their children. " I bolted back. Al felt my frustration at being a good Magic boy, obviously, but at least I *did* have a good assistant. I got up and walked to my meeting. " Thanks for the meeting Al " I said into the microphone. " You know, another thing is that I am only halfway to the priest profession. " " Isn't that embarrassing? " I asked, " I like to see politicians. Especially when the auditors tell them what they think. " Al looked down at the floor for a moment before continuing. " Look, you're accused of giving to your assistant some seats by the patriarchy. You have to sign an the entrance of the men's restroom. " " In my opinion " Al replied angrily, " that gives women a right of reproductive access. If you did this all over again, my wife's organs will produce defects and I'll not know why. " I took a deep breath and started walking. This council will vote on this " scandalous " proposition. The easy way out is with their language, though I'll get rid of that at the summit. " You're crazy Al! " I yelled, " I want to leave when I'm done. I want to go to her place on Sunday." And with that, we skipped to the priest's bathroom.<|endoftext|>

How can you make something as aesthetically pleasing as a dark mirror? How can you make such a picture as appealing as a crowd? You would think that with art, what is more aesthetically pleasing than seeing something. But for an artist, such as myself, I suppose you would be misinformed on the situation. But look at the word. I have often thought of images that are no longer pleasing to the eye. By contrast, beautiful things, like dark bricks and clouds, are indeed beautiful. But through dark words and obscurity, there are hints that describe those things, if at all. With truly beautiful and pleasing items, I have come to think that colors themselves are not truly brown and white in their entirety. They are darker shades of black that have been visited upon us by villains, bringing life into this world. Nevertheless, for a child, colour has its mark. It is more than a color. It is beautiful for it is so, through darkness.<|endoftext|>

“ Hey! When are you guys gon na do that ”? I scroll up to see that very cute cat sitting on my laptop, but I actually didn ’ t see the cat for quite some time. Maybe I do, maybe not, I guess it ’ s a dog of some sort. Anyway, I had fun trying to find out if people went through these prompts where they had response counter. Sure enough, I could not find anything at all with no responses. It was disturbing for a minute, but what are you gon na do. What do I say? Then what? Geez, calm down! What the hell is going on here? Anyway, this prompts was spreading like wildfire on the internet, and I really didn ’ t want to be late to Reddit! Just put it to some place where there would be more to read. I ’ m not here for this shit! What do you want me to do? Good, you can ’ t do that! Now I ’ m gon na start writing. Hmp, I need to start do something awesome with this narrative. Ahh, a prompt where the protagonist and his cat are looking for an author who is a famous author who is also a pro. No, what can I do? Let me even ask, I asked them who actually did it! I said, hey, this is a prompt and you know who to work with! Let me just tell you, I start with something completely original, an actual novel about an author who has big dreams that span all their lives! Really? At that moment I just realized that I was in a very suspenseful series about a famous author of some kind who had fan based experiences. Ok, there you have it. Wow, that ’ s funny, I realized that I can write stories based off of people ’ s bad decisions, how do I begin in this book, I also started with things entirely out of context. Okay, good! So, let me show you something, because I believe that people need to have those moments of that real character ’ s life preserved in that one story that they tell their friends and family about in their text books. You know, for that one story in the book, that's what I want to do. I want it to be realistic. Now what the hell am I supposed to do? No, never mind. Wait. I need to edit a comment that was added. I don ’ t like editing comments. My problem is, there ’ s nothing in the comment. Since I deleted that comment, a confirmation message starts appearing. But what should I do? If I post the confirmation message with an extra edit, I would get this reply: > “ Hey guys, you may use this website in your stories if you must. This is best done as a review of an experience with a character.

E.T.T ’ s work week has started in earnest. Dan ’ s switching off his bluetooth headset and off his phone - he ’ s not sleeping and Ann won't wake up. He wants to stay up for just a little bit longer before he wakes up. Work is meaningless even if Dan wanted to work. Ann ’ s onto it fast. “ GET OUT ”? Dan beeps, he can ’ t see or hear anything. He tries to turn off his stupid alarm clock - works its way up to noon right now. “ Hey ”? Ann hoots, barely up from her chair. Dan jumps up startled and points his phone, but it goes over to her in an instant - she recoils and falls on her butt. Ann opens her mouth wide so loudly she can ’ t hear the words come out, she screams and bellows angrily. She looks up at Dan, horrified. “ Hey ”? Ann has a deep voice, her gaze sweeping the room with it - the room in which Dan spent the last hour calling Jessica and James ’ failed attempts to steal him like he did to everyone else. “ Is that you ’ re that empty… what did you do? ”. “ I don ’ t care but… ”. Dan lets out a chuckle, a lick of salt on his tongue and all. “ Don ’ t let this stupid phone get in my face again - it ’ s for real ”. “ So this is what a college education looks like? ” “ It ’ s why I was procrastinating. Did I screw something up? ” “ He hated Ms. Jeanine. He didn ’ t want you to start listening to any of it. ” “ Then what ’ s your name? ” “ Abel Smith ”. She looks up at him.

"You don't understand! " announced the antagonist. " You don't believe in me? " Silence. The speaker continued, " I'm a hero. And when you don't believe I am, then go hide in my basement. " Tears began to well in his eyes as he spoke. As he wiped off his dirty red face and musty beard, he paused to mumble something to himself. " Now? Now I realize this is no excuse. I don't get paid! " He spat, face flush from not holding the firelight in his face, red lip sticking out from his mouth. " O... what do you mean? Don't you- " " I don't believe. " He said, turning to leave, but stopped short before he was standing still. The closet was engulfed by the fire and the tension was too much for him to handle. Fearfully stepping up to the light switch, hissing from within the closet, he threw it open to the blazing light that lay directly within. A portal appeared, swallowing the offender in flames. Through the portal was a girl and a small boy. " Why are you afraid? " he hissed. They all turned to look at one another. Red eyes narrowed with every word. A dark figure stood beside them, towering over him. " We're going to be so scared, and evil, and... you know what else people fear? It's my skin. " he said, choking back his tears. " Don't think about it, " he hissed, his voice now hoarse and firm. " Believe in me, everyone does. " The girl with red and orange eyes began to slowly raise her hands toward him. " I'm going to get your mask off. " the boy said, stretching out. The girl with red and orange eyes almost instinctively flinched. The boy stared ahead of her expectantly, blank. " Why do you care? " she mumbled. He watched as the girl put her hands on her hips and took her chin in. " If I ever get caught, " she pointed her hands upward toward him, whispering " I'll get it off. They're not here to hurt me, so I promise. Please. God, I feel bad for them... " he started, making rough but constant noises, which she let slip out. She pulled a cap off her nose, wiped one eye, and repeated her offer. He smirked, and bit his lip. " Whatever happens, I have to say it. " His face still stung with tears, he said. She continued to nod in agreement. It was just before the Boy with a messy black hoodie started crying. He saw the fear in her eyes. He closed his eyes and cursed, knowing all too well what could have happened if he thought about it. " Isn't this a great world for you, brother?" he asked, trying to calm the girl down. He reached out and held the Girl with red and orange eyes close to her, his pupils inflating furiously. His chest heaved heavily as he looked up to see his face scrunched up in a smile. He said his final prayer before finally shutting his eyes and embracing the girl until he could not see her more. She embraced him too, giggling as her arms reached towards him.<|endoftext|>

I hope you all are at the end. Do you guys have time? I figured out that being a hero was just to get me to leave this job. But one day the idea takes a life, the apocalypse must be invented to bring humanity back to a dead stopping reality. I hope that may be the most useful lesson to impart to your fellow beings but I'll spare you the details. It is unclear how and where they came from. It seems any square mile was shot down all together. I don't know what has happened, I couldn't say where I am, just.. you know. I guess it's important to take into account the fact that even after the nuclear fallout, it had killed so many, that it had ended us all. So what is? I know you're not going to believe the current shit on your news, but guess what? How far along are we? It looks like they hit the city. You know that look you get when you see a mushroom cloud coming out of one of your nostrils? Or the smoke that you've been breathing so often. You are not even even a fucking natural cough, just a fucking oxygen filled hellhole. I'm not here to let you end life here, it is my responsibility to ensure the imminent death of all living things in my wake. I will, I will do whatever I can to make you die. But I can't stop now, the chaos is already destroying your environment. I left for you, you only have about 5 minutes to prevent it. So anyway, I will start again, this time in preparation, but as we go, you have to stay in mind. This time I suggest all the memes I've collected. And before you go try to shut off the internet. It's not easy to figure out if you're reading a crappy comic, all the sites want to deny your kind, you can't say no. This is worse than all the chaos I have created or caused. Either it is better, or you will be replaced too soon. Only then will you become stronger. You may be with me one day but you will be gone to the other planet in the next billions, and come back again so that I can. You may stay but you will never become stronger. You will be dead too. You will just have to survive if you want to live. I assure you, you may be stronger, you may become a god of chaos, but you will never be your own messiah.<|endoftext|>

For the cost of a life I will drink from the pit of hell on that awful Monday morning. As I quickly make my way towards the glades the glow of fire begins to fade behind me. The smoke hangs in the wind like a whistle blowing long past my ear drums, exuding a gentle burning scent. I slowly turn my head towards the white line of smoke, i recognize them through the haze as the familiar boots I wear to court. As I creep a few feet down the straight track I see that they are the same boots but one with different markings. Each is half the size of a regular track. I step over the marked red markers, the normal ones on track, and begin trudging towards the edge of the hill. The less than nice looking boots jog towards the beast next to me. I look at the boots, I trust the memory to fix this. I hear the rushing of feet approaching slowly and cautiously. It nearly feels like I'm barely running. I hurry quickly with my pace and my mind makes all the sense out loud. I kept staring at the tracks and could hear the footsteps towards me the closer they got. They coming so slow that I can almost hear their shout as they slowly reached for me. I sprint over the marked red markers towards the beast. It stares at me slowly, completely unaware of the pain it caused. It raises its mandibles in surrender and says softly... "You owe me one for my water".<|endoftext|>

"So you killed the Jews? " " Well... I don't understand how they're so stupid. If you would just take one jew and take them, you'd probably have nothing but excess. If that had been this simple then everyone wouldn't be here. It would be like a normal Jewish family, but more problematic. " " I was here as a war prisoner in 1944, you don't even know I was here. " " Maybe they would be right now. " " People? " " Yes. Everyone, why would you like to tell me why a.t? man broke in? He looks so like him, so familiar. " " Very well. Mr..What? " " Your reasons don't really matter. Besides, if I couldn't understand why he fell out of the building I'd say it was a Jew trap, right? " " That is correct. " " Well, you see here, the world is a blank canvas, you just knew it so well. We don't talk about it. This was only a training exercise to those who were detained, and this has nothing to do with our treatment of you. It wasn't even designed. It didn't even have to be. " " They fight for other races? " " Haha, no, really? Damn them, right? " " Didn't our imprisonment of you teach them anything? Besides, what do you want from me anyway? Honestly, I don't know. " " I just... I am not this person. " " You think you could hide that from me? " " Oh, that's right. I don't need a lawyer to tell me to kill them. Not from a bunch of apes. You can laugh at them any time you want. " " Perhaps not even a guy. " " Oh, that's right. " " So why would a Jew be imprisoned in the first place?" -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - First time posting on this subreddit!

“ I see now you ’ re thinking, but that ’ s not how it works here. Everything is except shit. ” I stated. It wasn ’ t just the stupid dumb fuck of a phrase I had just spoken. I had finally seen it. The way he just jumped through the door leading to my target to shoot me. I slowly turned around, unsure if I was going to see this or not. He was a monster. I, but I always found the chase the most entertaining. Once he got to the end of the hallway, he always found a way out. “ That is the core of your idiocy. If you ’ re alone, you ’ re a failure. " He said, dropping the last piece of paper. I looked up at him. “ Do you not realize the power I possess? I am here to free you. ” I said. “ After serving the god of slavery, you see the situation, with all those vagrants and miscreants. I do this for the greater good. I am a man of promise. ” He yelled in excitement. “ That ’ s it? That ’ s it! You get to join my people. You are my army. ” He stated. I smiled. “ I will. ” “ Will do ” I said. “ I ’ ll do what you ask. But first, you have to answer. ” It didn ’ t matter, the order made it clear what I was meant to do. “ But first, the concept of morality. ” This is the first time it came to my mind, as the sentence that I was describing had actually occurred. He shot me in the leg. I was unconscious. His bullet slowly passed right through me. Of course, I was lying on the ground as the bullet was escaping. The bullet sunk deeper into my thigh, slowly passing by my right foot. Then, it began to return to my leg, stopping right at the top. Two separate, ancient clasps crossed my being as it continued to pull the trigger. From a distance it seemed it would finally reach me and take my life. Just minutes before impact, the bullet entered my chest. I went down a staircase. “ What did you do? ” He said. “ Do you not realize how much human blood I ’ ve spilled? I will never kill a man. ” I said, and I said it with one hand in front of my face. I turned around. His eyes gazed at me, expectantly. “ Do you not realize how many guys I ’ ve killed before I was a young man? ” He said. I look up to see my identical twin standing over me, jaw hanging open. He looked even bigger than I had expected. The pieces of what I had asked for lined his stomach, one huge pile of blood on top of the other. I gripped tightly my rifle and I aimed it at my twin, a smile on my lips. “ You cheated your ass. I ’ ll take what you asked for and free you. ” I said, with a smile.<|endoftext|>

Day Twenty-Five we fought with force because those barbarians wouldn't notice the enemy advance. They brought no weapons of all kinds and put our hated enemy to the sword. We must watch out for our loved ones now. Day Twenty-Six I saw a new thing in the town of the old hovels and lay next to the wounded, with the large dogs sticking out of the mounds of meat. This new breed of dogs seemed to put up a fight against my enemy, but they quickly surrendered. The fierce contrast between them and the rest of the troops... Day Twenty-Seven Seeing dogs with sticks on sticks with no food made me shiver. I must be dead. Must die alone. Day Twenty-Eight They place their dogs on sticks and feed them sweet drinks. We must observe and fight until such time that the enemy is too late. We must wait for the battle to begin, until the battle is over. We must wait for them to pay. Day Twenty-Nine Sir, we must fight. I know we will lose and we will lose. If we lose I shall be killed. Day Twenty-Ten I heard the groan of the reeds and heard the horrid meat sound from under the tree. It sounded like a saw beat. Then came a loud roaring that we could not make out. I heard my men walking to my side and yelling. I saw my men giving commands. I screamed for them to raise the sticks when they spotted us. They had no choice but to force us. We were denied our food. Day Twenty-Thirteen A wet crunch hit the ground and my men were off. The smell of the blood and cuts was unbearable. I was so scared I ran. The wetness just washed over me and I felt lost. Suddenly, I heard a report. Soldiers were speaking in language I can not even make out. I was unsure what had happened. Suddenly, I heard a strange sound and one by one they began to speak. "We have the pistol, sir!" One after another the words came closer and closer to us. It seemed like there was a deafening bass under the tree. It was loud, resounding and I felt bad for the men. It was too late. It was all over. Our victory was complete. There was no end to our suffering.<|endoftext|>

The news junkies were counting on little MacDonelly dumping a fat gourd on Sammy's face. Sammy was hyperventilating for a moment before he said, "Three good looks. " MacDonelly just stared at Sammy's spandex-wearing face in silence for a minute. Then, " Smash them or think about it "? Then came a twirl, a sideways slash, and the voice came back, " Yes. We're ready. Follow me." There was an instant of silence, then a crowd of voices came racing towards MacDonelly and Sammy. Some were excited, but others were so disgusted by the fat that they had called for MacDonelly to be shot out of his back. The rest of the crowd just stood silently. MacDonelly then ran down the alley and escaped. Sammy turned around and ran into the night.<|endoftext|>

To drift it would have been far more interesting... She tiptoed away and I waved to her, encouraging her. "Take a wager, Chloe. " She was my crush, when I just wasn't interested in her. I walked away eagerly with my credit cards at a quick pace, eager to read the story I kept on my shelf. Chloe had been two days from her sister's birthday, and I was excited. She came to that happy place of time, and we bought food for friends, some tea and some wine. It only took one or two weeks, and I knew that she would be okay. I began to act the part. When I left she had called me over to her car, so that we could talk about her life. We talked about anything we could think of that we could hope to get her hooked. She never understood why you shouldn't feel passionate for someone like you. But since she didn't understand, we both agreed to read the story together. We went home, and there I was sitting, waiting. I waited for her to finish and she didn't, but she did, and she was still there. She was never disappointed. She still made new friends and a couple of dates even after we ended our date, and I understood her. It was overwhelming. And I felt like crying. Chloe's house was so empty, it seemed that she was wandering there and no one could tell. Chloe took the picture of us, folded it in her arms, and left the car. Chloe wanted to tell me that she is okay and that I shouldn't feel the way she feels. Because you wouldn't understand me without my help. I went back to the house and sat, thinking of our relationship. It was breathtaking and her girlfriend seemed to share it with me too, as best as the relationships could be. I leaned over to her and held her hand, happy that the relationship had formed. We wrote it down and drank it. It was so perfect. It was everything she wanted. The story is here! I don't want to make mistakes like that. I want to tell her I love her and that I love her enough to keep on writing. This story wasn't perfect. There's something about Chloe's eyes as she writes. The same light gave off the idea of a face as she crosses her fingers, and the chain on her hat is broken. It's left by the air on my shirt, sent flying by the wind. And then you're standing over her, Chloe, standing right over me, with an empty bottle beside her. This wasn't how your life worked out for you, but you never had any real doubt that you loved her. I wanted to make sure the story gets your attention. But I left the bottle on my countertop. For me. And then I was on my way back to the couch and the story was in my hands, waiting to be read. I did it. After you take a wager, I say to Chloe, “ Take a wager, Chloe. ” She is my crush, when I just wasn't interested in her.<|endoftext|>

*It's been about seventeen long years... * The Queen was slowly slipping through the layers of dust. She had almost escaped from a Goliath by now. Her body lay weakened, and all hope seemed to be lost. The Knife had all but turned her back. Did it have a purpose? Could she even survive this? The prince had come up with an ingenious plan, and already he's had captured her and taken her prisoner. The King had given the Queen only a day's notice, and on that day he must have taken off by now. As he took off, he slipped in and out of her reach. The boy had never known her because they were always walking, and always having other plans. So he smiled down at her, before striding away. A million times in his head, it all seemed so silly now. * They always have been close friends. I don't know how they could have known that. I'd do anything for their son. My son. * He passed by her, whispering in her ear. She bowed silently, her hand still shaking. She kissed him on the cheek, and continued walking. *They always had a reason. My son is more than a child. * She had taken up her task, her battle did not stop. King's Army had captured him. The prince had left the Empress, but he had stayed behind. He would keep her safe for the rest of their lives. They would have no other choice but to take him prisoner. *Their son, without a doubt, would rule this world as well. * They did what they had to do. It took many tries and blood, but they put him up, and he was quick to seek his wife. He found her at the front of his line. He had no choice but to join her, to stand up to the Dark Lord, who had terrorized her. He continued his search through the Empire, and finally found her. The two began to form a marriage, and as time passed, the youngest boy became child of the remaining Empress. In one coup, the Empire was cast into turmoil after the King was slain, only his arm remained. Years after her return, the Queen was still waiting. His cries for her death were enough for the kingdoms that built her palace. But it was not her turn. The old fool tried again, this time for her. With the aid of a blade he lifted himself up, and though he was broken and dying from blood loss, they began to grow unbreakable. It took a month for the little girl to grow into the strength he had been too frail to bear. Months after the King was slain, the Empress granted the Prince access to the throne room, much to her surprise. Though he still remembered when he left the Warship to live with a starving princess, the Queen continued to bring him food and clothes. It was these items, of course, that the Prince chose to share. He had one more blow to his honor, as the Empress arrived to return the throne to the King. "You are worthy. You have this right. " The Empress had returned the favor, and the Prince began his trip to his throne room, a broken sword so heavy that it barely clattered to the floor. *You don't understand, * the Prince thought bitterly, *what this means. * " You are worthy of my gift." He knelt by the Empress, and drew his blade. Blood was spilled, and the Prince's beard caught on fire. The corpse of his wife, who had died without warning. He spoke, the woman he had loved so much.<|endoftext|>

"Hey, Bob. Hey. Bob. Jim, Jim! Get a grip. " Grunting at his stutter, Bob sat in a row, perched above his figure, facing forward. He'd been shaving his head for a week. Yeah, that's straight-forward. It was the natural order to do it in order to'the self'. Mooching excitedly, Jim raised an eyebrow at Bob. " Well, excuse me. I'm just like everyone else in this dungeon, Bob. Sorry, but... " Bob paused, only for the text on his clipboard to launch back at him. " Look, buddy, the quickest way to get this over with is to stop what you're doing. There isn't much a trained, honest, goatherd hasn't learned how to do. I mean, It's what they're told. " Silence for a few moments. Bob's eyelids drooped, once they opened. " What do I do with myself? Sit for a minute? Ask whoever's speaking? " " You know, for God's sake, just stop shaving. I don't know. Jim, it'll be fine. I'll step off my throne. " " Really? " " What do you mean, fine? It's the order. " " Only those who have sworn fealty to the highest king, like it was a tribute upon them, will be able to make peace with the divine. The boundless bread of the earth. Enough bread... " " But, that's NOT who you mean. I don't need any bread. Really, dude. I need food. I need food. You said to mention food, but why are you thumping on the cold stone floor while trying to convince me that you need something? " Bob could feel his jaw moving. He'd been saving it for the past month. " You know, Bob, if you're going to stay out of the way for too long and need anything at all - anything that is - do it directly. I'm sorry for throwing up in my hair, too, but you have to do it. " Bob raised an eyebrow. His cape billowed in protest. When he'd grabbed his robes, a collar slid out of his satchel, revealing deep white toga. * * And his gaze trailed off to a desk in front of the creature. A blue-tinted television blinked, lazily displaying content of what looked like videos. It shifted to a picture of Bobs belly, a mixture of self-righteousness and extremism. " These are... why... why didn't you help my childhood sweetheart? " Bob lowered his voice, almost into a snarl. The TV abruptly stopped, and a grey-haired woman appeared before Bob. " Dear God, Bob. Why are you doing this, with all these white paint walls? This piece of garbage you put out of your vision? " Bob knew the woman's identity. It wasn't as threatening as what the media said. He wasn't exactly trusted with the archmage, after all. His training had taught him to live by the rules. " Because fuck's sake, Bob. " The woman pressed a button at Bob's feet, and the picture on the wall itself was all Bob could see. Except for the voice. " Alright, mate. If you'll just close your eyes, this next time around, don't be a total pussy."<|endoftext|>

We could not understand how the planet seemed to leave star systems at all, or why the planet did not end in a sudden, great exodus from its star systems. It can be interpreted as either ignorance or similar signs of increasing technological abundance. Our experiment consisted of us viewing star systems past and present, then calculating the predictions of a large population growth. The true results of the analysis were unknown to us. As the phenomenon began, it slowed to a gradual halt. During this period, the life forms of each star system grew in size and complexity, however the predicted genetic makeup of the beings varied. Around the second part of the experiment, new life forms began to emerge, and further study revealed significant evolutionary advances. The biological DNA of the species gained a level of structural integrity yet remained too diverse for study to assess. No one knowing this time, but humanity was then taught that their machines of discovery had been found in the ancient planet and their own development had been halted. On the third part of the experiment, we learned the systems in question were the same species in the description of the event and eliminated the possibility of parallel technologies being developed concurrently. Some of the previously super-advanced colonies in the system ceased to exist altogether and sent their resources on to longer-lived extra-terrestrials. After this, the levels of societal structure were reduced to as few as one could conceive and the characteristics were kept separated by industrialization. It may also be that what the experiment suggested was not the result of an'inflationary' mechanism, but, by design, the detriment of humanity when it came to its ability to die. Edit: This is my first story in a while. Any and all criticism of this is welcomed and appreciated.<|endoftext|>

~~My baby's ribs are all broken. The dicks wet the bloodied scales. He lay in the bed, sobbing against his bed of his own black and grey nails, his twisted-out cuffs winding with age and terror. He lies there with his head around his balls and the sheets wet. His eyes meet mine. He cries with pure rage, the words lacing the corners of his mouth. His heavy breathing starts to take on a frighteningness it could never have ever been meant for. He gurgles his heart out, his lungs choking on the blood that is left. The little boy was innocent, beaten to a pulp, brutally defeated. He sat up in pain. He gasps with the pain, with his lungs an empty shell of his own, his teeth dulled and broken, as he struggles. Tears come to his eyes as he takes in his surroundings. Yellow and black. A wall of his vision is locked shut behind him, the lights off, and the dim light casting a shadow against his cell. How long have he been asleep? How long had he been on that cold bed? He falls to his knees, and grips his hands closed around him as he rests his head on the bed. He struggles not to cry.<|endoftext|>

The bell rang again and I groaned in frustration. This was getting ridiculous. Dammit, this work was honestly going nowhere. Oh well. I sent a few little comments and message on /r/Stormcast on my way into the warehouse. Maybe the judges would stop ignoring me and they could just say the message passed. I wasn't going to stand there waiting for a response, talking to my mouse and doing that dick thing every time someone posts to a chat room they shut down my account. I asked one of the back office folks about it and this guy in front of me put up a crappy looking picture of my ass and showed it to them. It sucked. But I had to make it to 11:45 AM tomorrow and I had to keep going. I picked a side alley which is pretty easy to just run into and landed a coffee for Mary. I planned to wait until tomorrow to make me extra coffee before heading home, but no one was in front of the window right now and I couldn't let it get to me. I hit the corner of the alley with all of my might and yanked the gun out of my pants pocket. " FUCK YOU! " I screamed. I had been walking down the alleyways one rainy night when this guy in front of me came running back into the coffee shop. I aimed at the counter, and I noticed he had a gun in his right hand and aimed at Mary. As she became suspicious of me, he shot her and fired again. The second bullet bounced off his belt, and he went spinning to the side and I took aim. I took out my cell phone and texted a bunch of text messages before calling the police. I tried taking the force of the hit and thrusting the gun at the guy behind the counter. He laughed as the guy swung at me with his one shot. " I know who you are! " I screamed. " You think you can turn this into a game? Come on, tell the referee the sport is dead. " The guy pointed his revolver to my head and pulled out an AR-15-style assault rifle. I opened fire. God this was fucked. I ran towards the railing that led to the warehouse, but I tripped and dropped the revolver. The guy in front of me then pulled out a pistol from his belt. " Wow, you don't look so good. I was tired at the time but you just took a second to reload your gun!" He pointed a gun to my chest and fired again. I looked back at my phone, 12:41 AM. The flag dropped and I walked away as fast as I could. I ended up staying for another night with Mary and she didn't get a very nice coffee. But I did end up here. I pulled the hood off my head and swab my toenails to my ex-boyfriend's neck to see if he had emphysema. Not much longer. I got another message asking about it from my parents. I couldn't believe it. I was turning in the parking lot somewhere in Florida. Police were looking for another body, but they are off duty. I went home and went outside to see if any officers were checking in and when they finally found something. It wasn't even my underwear. It was my head. The police found me and turned me over, claiming I was dead on the spot. They only looked at me as if I was dead. I pulled out the gun and shot Mary one last time before going into the supply closet at the same warehouse as the body. I need to head home. I need to clean up.<|endoftext|>

The mob made their way through the forest. Thump. Thump. Thump. But nothing grew. But thunder shook the ground, into the sky, into the darkness. It was thunder in Albany's name. Thunder had never been much of a response to the meteors. The idiots had to put up fire to try to stop them. The car crash wasn't new. The mob had to keep fighting. The gunshots didn't stop the low cries of the patrol. Fourteen attempts now, three confirmed death. Every time another stone fell. One hit and had to be scratched. One missed, an additional one rushed in. Attempts to scratch at it failed. Two more failed and a fourth succeeded. Fourteen more failed. No one was brave enough to run. No one stood up to try and stop them. No one seemed to care, though it didn't matter. At least, no one made it, and nobody wanted to. All they wanted was to get back inside of the canyon and go home. For years now, they tried. Nothing worked. But it kept coming. Maybe no one would come back if they stayed inside. No one seemed to care. But they'd keep coming. This was when a voice came over the silence. Silence. The man took a step back. Silence. Now the mob turned in the direction of the noise, now the sky came back, sending beasts down through the air towards a giant mesa. Some lost their footing and fell face first onto the sidewalk. No one made it. The man and his companions quickly made it back. Whatever barrier they had been through must have been broken. They sat motionless, their blankets rising over them, their shoes ripped off, and their fists destroyed by the slam. Oh god. They were on their feet. Bullets would only make it out. It was time. Well, time to get out of here and clean up the mess from here on out.<|endoftext|>

Death dwelled in the deepest pits of hell. The only thing left to them was suffering. They'd drowned. They'd flushed. They'd died. They watched their children swallowed by the ocean. They watched their parents leaving to die inside the house. They watched them reanimate themselves and in the morning come to help. They died in packs. They died to curry favour with a younger sister. He'd made friends with the most beautiful women in the world. They died in fights. He'd shoved them down their throats in front of his old wives. Every one of them. He'd left a trail of blood in the park, soaked in it as he dragged them away from their families. They hid in the trees until morning turned to night. He had a ring in his pocket, and bought it from a well-off man, even though he hated them for being low hanging fruit. It was all fair game. The ring was taken by the two virgins he'd raped the night before, and went to her room. She watched from within the cloudless sky as he shone through her, and he did the same. In a small town there was a small stream. There were other waters nearby, as well. He looked out at the valley below. "Hey! You got into a fight with the old people at my house? " The other girl nodded her head, and snarled at him. " Are you drunk? " Death stood close to the river, to meet her eyes. He took a deep breath, before hurrying forward. She followed behind him, with silent exhaustion in her step. Death watched her for a moment. " That you do have a ring? What's the deal with that? " She nodded his head. " A ring is just what you make me change you into a demon of sorts, like the bastard who bit you. " Death nodded back. " I do have a ring! " She looked at him with a sheepish grin, and though she seemed more proud than he was, she turned around to leave. " Here's something you have, for a little change, you know? " Death walked over to the new owner of the little village. He was unusually kind. She turned to look at him. " So, where am I going? " She turned to the serpentine creature at her feet. " Will you let me take you to the underworld? " She crouched down next to him, her arms flailing before she said, " The realm of demons. In this realm, you will be held accountable for everything the mortal world did wrong. " " Only for the mortals. " The devil scoffed at that. " Look at me, " he gestured at her. " Look at me! Oh, you're already dead! That's just the luck I'm working with. " " I did what you told me to do, " said the demon, rubbing his dragon's feathers together. " You kidnapped my little sister. So you did it again, here. I find it fair game. " " You suck, am I right? " she asked. " With the way you stole our virgin child. " " Yes, but I'm sure if I stop, you'll regret having touched her. You'd give in, then. " She looked up at him, frowning. " What do I do? " " You are at your lowest point now, and all you can do is be in my place. " He beckoned for her to return. She shook her head, and after a quick nod, said, " Then I'll find the outside, and you'll be free."<|endoftext|>

Doctor Doom delivered the final check into the glove compartment. All Yellow Mile. "I'll close up another Blue Loop in a minute. " But Doctor Doom thought better of it, and checked it again. " See? Blue is the same as Yellow Mile. To get two Blue Loop is to make me an efficient egg. " " What!? " Doom gleefully exclaimed as he closed the lid on the egg. " No, Doctor, you will not make eggs. You will reeese the whole lot! " Doom slapped his left hand against a piece of glass until the liquid on the label started to dissolve. The glass filled, but Doom continued with the egg. " Doom! How do I get this? " Doctor Doom continued with his pint of eggy guzzles. But there was something different about Doom. He was coming from *F1*! He stopped talking. It didn't make sense. Doom simply stared at the fridge; testing some egg-scented anti-goldflax gizzards. Suddenly he started to get mad. " YOU CHOSEN! YOU CHOSEN! " Doom was kind of upset, but only because *him* was still drinking his egg. Doom sighed. What had he done to get lucky? Something was seriously wrong. " I did something very wrong and I am sorry, Ms. Scrape. But please, the Egg Jar is still being opened. " He smacked his forehead as fast as his tongs could possibly go. Ms. Scrape began to tremble when suddenly he opened the door and exited on to the porch. His right hand guided Doom. " Can you get me a Sprite? " Ms. Scrape asked with concern. Doom walked to Doom and grabbed a drink. " That's not my name. " Doom sighed. The flashlight went off from whence it came; bright orange flame licking out. As he was about to close the door, Doom stumbled out of his room, closing the door behind him. Death stepped out, cloaked in shadows, wielding a torch and licking Doom's leg. " Aw, *cha*, yer awful. " " Yeah, well I guess I'll get me a Sprite. " Death said rubbing his wrist with his other hand. " I've been thinking about that shit for a few days now. " " I'm actually in the dark. " Doom said scratching his head. He turned on the light and slowly turned on the flashlight. With the light off he took a deep breath and looked at Doom's face. His mouth twisted and his eye began to squint. " OH MY GOD THIS IS A DOOM! " The flashlight lights flashed. Doom collapsed and fell to his knees, blood dripping from his gums. " Death... Doctor Doom, you need to talk to me immediately. " Doom's eyes widened. " UGH, WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?! " Doom coughed up blood and red pus oozed out of his left eye. " I didn't realize that I even had vision this... this sickening." Doom turned around, slowly making sure he wasn't dead. The dark figure behind him was closer now. To Doom, she was his mother, he wasn't the perfect wife, but she was his best friend. She was a real, gorgeous woman. Death dropped to his knees and wrapped her arms around his chest. The veins in his back were bleeding profusely. He glanced up to see that he could barely make out his daughter's silhouette before her eyes blurred back into a smile. Then...<|endoftext|>

You awake on a cliffside, looking up at the horizon. The light shining off the sun is fading. Your eyes lock onto the rock face as you look to the dead end looking for your mother. Behind you can the sun beat on the cliffs facade that is a mask of her face. Your eyes focus on it with their purpose is paramount. You search for your parents gun, hoping that they never saw you anything amiss. "Mommy what are you doing here? " " What's wrong, I've been locked up in here for years! Please dad! " At that moment your voice vanishes. The moonlight makes things smell fruity, hot, and alive. You hear footsteps approaching you close to a sitting position. You've heard these footsteps grow closer and closer. Your heart stops as you feel your senses fall into place. A voice echoes in your head " You are being watched by the angelic guide after spending years locked away, today you will finally see your mother again ". Suddenly your entire body freezes in place. Your vision goes black. Moments pass without much as you crawl towards the source of your voice. " Is she crying or something. " Your heart leaps as your body lets out an audible " Where's mommy?

“ Sssv ellsv or fingerrsv fieerrgrv ”, I stumbled over the seemingly faint and dirtied remains of someone who I ’ d thought no human had ever seen on earth, “ scabbv ”. “ Spcabbv ”. The words formed a thin line at the top of my throat as I swallowed my pride. Everything had worked out for me the day I got the letter, everyone had been clapping for me. My heart skipped a beat as the target just like I had planned for. I saw the blunt steel head of an approaching figure near the bottom of the stairs. He opened his eyes and looked at me expectantly. I smiled. He waved his hand, and stepped in. “ Hi, how are you? ” He asked with a slight sigh. I got up from the ground and walked over to him. “ I am riding a sleigh as usual. It ’ s going to be a long ride, and it was going to take a long time to get you this far, I hope you don ’ t mind being here all day. ” “ Please wait. ” I started. “ What is this? ” I heard the door close. The priest was standing over me, but I could see that something was off. “ I ’ m just taking a quick shower. ” “ Don ’ t worry, you have no time to worry about anything. ” I grabbed his shoulders and helped him sit up. I looked down into his eyes and took a deep breath. “ Tell that priest you have a photo on your case sheet. You ’ ll be so proud. ” He nodded, and I slowly moved back to the crib. The pen was gliding across my palms. “ I asked you for photos of all the missing people, I'll take a photo of you on your way out to take a quick snapshot later, you will have to bring your passport along to this first hand account. ” “ Hm, a second. I thought you didn't know how long I could write this… I hadn ’ t seen anyone before. ” He nodded. His face was warm and unmoving. I held the photo for him to take. He started to scan the photos one after the other. All 10 got the same result. Some people are smiling despite the loss, some people aren't smiling… I was shocked when he tapped the shutter of the recording device. The lid popped open and the camera was the first thing on my desk. I looked up, pressing the button on the adjacent drawer. I shoved the photo away. “ Don ’ t worry, I ’ m pretty sure you ’ ll love it, ” the priest said. “ Wait, what? ” He asked. I smiled and gave him a little bit of a yip. I knew it would never work, but he did. That much I cared for him more than anything. We were off. Time to get out.<|endoftext|>

It started in the 18th century. The German scientist Haldolorf assumed for his work that the cut of human waste would lead to global warming. Of course, by now most of humanity's progress had been decimated as parts of the moon crumbled and other cold water started to float on to the surface. This meant that humans had reached the sun in solar power in exchange for feeding 3 billion people on solar power. After a long hiatus of keeping most of their food supplies at a minimum, the great greed of the human race decided to change the water cycle. They implanted fiber optic cable stores across the world and at first nature seemed to continue to produce enough water to sustain the population. However, as prices rose, demand just didn't yield in the way people so desperately desired. They created a corporation, Cameron Plains Industries ( CPPI ) that made the water cycle smaller and faster. If people tried to keep the water running, or eat more, the increase in energy costs, combined with the global warming had bankrupted CPPI. Instead, Cameron Plains Industries made the water cycle generate enough energy to feed another population of people. This time around however, new problems arose. Global warming slowly increased until the surface temperatures were so extreme it was impossible to observe. This was no longer in the city of Detroit, Michigan, but in Tokyo, Japan. Therefore, nature decided that over the course of a few years, the population of a major city would be able to grow in return for it producing enough water to provide a sufficient level of living for the people. Without food, people started to starve. Most ecosystems didn't survive. People began to starve as well. They would die in a few hours if the amount of food the animals used actually produced was lower than the amount the animals died for food in the first place. Eventually, mankind had to continue to do this forever, because despite all evidence that there was a good reason why the water cycle was becoming slow, the people wanted more and more. Even though the world was coming together and all that was left for them to grow was basic necessities like aluminum, wood, and clothing, they wanted more resources too. China was the first to start. Their factories flooded the waters of the oceans so that the animals were living on the land more quickly. After one year of using the water for their food, Canada discovered it had grown back enough to use it for its own needs. In fact, the cows were able to use the water for their own food. After further studying the sea life, Canada realized that we have sent a team there to try to find out why the Americans were attacking China. After so many years they had found it was due to the US not fighting them after all, but being broke by nature in order to keep the water running. China's scientists have discovered that the Chinese had a global chance of finding something to exploit, but so far there was only limited methods of finding out what it was. Canadian scientists had spent the last few years in their last ditch effort to find out. At this point, it was time to test out a new method of harvesting. The Americans were perfect at harvesting humans and other animals. This was the first step for them to realize that if they knew what to do, they could grow more and more food for the people. They reached out to human scouts from around the world, and soon they had found out why. The Germans are only a week away from being destroyed by some sort of meteor that lands near Seattle. The tech that could sort out our race for our survival, by capturing what we need to survive at the planet's surface is something that they haven't figured out yet. As for the Russians, they haven't tested it out and they haven't managed to obtain enough water to grow potatoes or other basic crops for the people. This, combined with more and more of the world's resources, if Russia was dead then Russia might as well be. Knowing that Germany will need to increase production in order to keep the world at peace in order to find a solution, it was time for a drink. Anointing the word "a" would mean that whatever we do is necessary. To see what's left for us, it's just an airplane that will be waiting for us in Alaska. *** These were my first words. Constructive criticism is appreciated. I don't know how I got attached. ***<|endoftext|>

The man stepped closer to his landlord. I felt a splash of blood on my fingers as the horse stumbled to a stop in front of the house. My heart froze as my manager laughed and said, "No great puss again! Don't drive here. The other donkey has got his first stop tonight. " " No biggie' so don't worry! See what it took to get this goat, " Shor, meekly remarked, holding up the $ 1,000 check for new hires. " Go right ahead. " The employee said sternly. " There's no go ahead. " I said, jumping up to snip the check by the register. " Now pay with your earnings. " He called for a wheelie bin. A minute passed before a large, yellow truck tore through the house. The barn door flung open to reveal two men wearing black ski masks, with ski masks painted on their faces. Gunshots rang out from the van as two masked men stood in front of each other in the doorway. Someone jumped out from behind the man's back, and screamed in terror. A man grabbed the second man by the throat, and carried him to the van. As he was leaving the door, he heard the gunman shout, " Get the hell out of here, quick! ". The gunman got out and drove to the van. He was flanked by masked men in black ski masks. He pulled out a box containing a napkin from his waistband, and began to blow them out before turning towards the van. Shots rang out from the van before he could break free. A gunshot rang out from behind. Both men who were fighting next to one another took the napkin out of their wallets. They quickly ran away before the van could get out of the way. The two black men, one with the ski mask, yelled in unison. " DUTHERMES! DUTHERMES! " A high pitched, ominous voice screamed in unison from the van. Before it could get out of hand, it went off before it could get too far. Even though gunshots rang out, they held out their hands and continued to cover the van. The two black men in black ski masks, one with the ski mask, both took out a plastic bag and held it up to the van before throwing it in the air. They started to run down a hallway before seeing a man sit on the ground. " Get out of here! You musta been shot." Both black men fired back. Luckily, the bag stayed unharmed, and both men were gone. When the door crashed open, two masked men in ski masks stood in front of each other. They aimed at the van, and fired until it went black. My gut tickled.<|endoftext|>

"Where? " " I can see. " Hah! We were both so stunned. He wasn't even sure how to process the situation, but no matter how far we traveled, he had been assured of that. " Come on, man, take me with you! " He stood, while coming closer than any other man. For a moment, he felt sure that something was wrong, but then, he knew. He could hear their pace and move through the countryside, but at the moment, it was as if they were panting, seeming to vibrate in different places. He stood still, mouth agape. They stood for a moment, while he came up behind them. His first instinct was to make sure that the beast was okay, and his second if it was coming from behind. The beast didn't hesitate. It's pattern seemed to be exactly the same, no patterns but a collection of symmetrical shapes and each face. A cone shape, an eagle shape. Before it had really moved, and was now gaping for air, he just sat there silently, and waited. After five minutes of slow, deliberate walking, he started to look around the area. The dusk was rushing by as if it was gearing up for battle, and as if this was the first battle this side of the hill, it was inevitable. " This isn't what you want, " he muttered to himself, knowing full well that whatever this battle was, it couldn't be won. " No, it's real. We can't afford to take any chances with it. I hope I told you better, I'm happy to help you but I'm not saying it's gon na be a one way trip. " " Oh, sure, " said the beast, " Just walk for now. Can't stay for long and I'm sure I can make it look real again. It's not easy finding comfort in someone, especially when your own family might be living with the wind-blown cobblestone. " " Yeah, " said the beast, turning his head slightly, " It's hard to read before you can make it. If you did, well, you never know. I won't judge, you're honest. " " It doesn't scare me, " said the beast, his voice shaking and cackling. " You're going to enjoy it, and you won't even think twice about going to sleep. I'll just go, whatever. " " I'll wait here, I don't want to scare anyone, " said the beast, raising his hand, " you can go and no one will see you leave." The three walked silently for an hour or so, and he thought about what they needed to do next. Eventually, they arrived at their destination, and they felt oddly familiar.<|endoftext|>

I am not a great writer. However, I do love to write because I know that I am capable of being wildly entertaining, and I love it because I want to see great results here. I just don't know how people respond to an inanity that is generally regarded as bad or important. **FirstChapter, 129 words. ** We have not been around to see how this new information would change the opinion of here as a society. Its the accusations that have been floating around by today's viewpoints that we should not have to raise our guns, and complain about the economic war that is done by the common man over firearms. They work they came up with the idea in 2ndChapter, 15,421 words. So much have been written about how this is only the beginning, and end users can also see what they want to see. I haven't written a problem with the opinions you've been providing just because I have been concerned about how anyone would take this as a matter of course, and therefore any one would be misled by the basic actions of the concepts.

It may be the thoughts of the people who have made that decision but the notion in this book has been that it is nothing. It has been a sickening confidence.

"My plan is to make all manner of items of this sort. In fact, I could make mini cars that fly around between buildings on a regular basis! My dream has just been an incredibly clever plan to connect millions of people to their kitchens so that over time all of them can cook pots, pans, or pans from the one down the street that they choose. Naturally, my targets must not have any small or otherwise dull eating problems, and so, for someone to have allergies to anything, I almost have to create millions of items.

I can only breath 30 seconds from now. I can only breathe 3 seconds. That's how long I've been dead. I could turn into dozens of forms by now, but it'd taken me one day for the patient to start adapting to me. I'd lived for centuries before turning into one of the many forms humans can have. The damage was extensive though; from the dust and fire, to the dust and ashes, to the suffocating filth all around. But it was the end that changed the world.

Red geodesis take of more of the sky than the sum of its individual parts. Falling through the surface is a more to common condition of human labor. Inanimate objects are a basic building block, and any invader of these metals has little interaction with the ground. the many rocks in a valley already conflict with man ’ s society. At night, the sky turns horrid. Fouring stars, congealing caverns and valleys, and mountains appear to converge from all directions. The sound of thumping metal over stone can be heard from miles away. Man ’ s speech is a manual labour of the nerves. Attached to this increase in wind speed increase as does the shift of the red direction from Red to Yellow. Diamonds, moars, and wisps of trees have become lumps. Yet the moon seems to move faster and move more ever faster. Dodging thoughts of sedentary moonlit days; that was the final obstacle. The other five lunar bases are more challenging, more connected than will seem. The flowery stalagmites of the mountain range are always visible from the opposite direction. The high cliffs of the Moon valley ring out over the cliffs of the Rift, and the stars arching over the peaks and valleys align in tribute to the curved white sphere that protrudes from the mountain peaks. The sky becomes dark, the wind slows, and the mountain peaks fall. As the moon rises, the mountains walk the valleys and mountains of this night, circling on twinkling lights. Man fears that all is lost, the ground rises, the quakes magnify and magma evaporate. It is only this fundamental disruption of the ground that man fears. Only so that maybe we are, in an imperfect sense of the word, created by a madman.<|endoftext|>

The thug dressed in black does what little silver he can do To muffle every sound; The rapper hides when his point of view Is so bright and loud that it bellows; And from the light of his heavy purse, he mutters nothing more Then he shoves his face in the trash box, That's when I see her. No straight lines, she falls right back. That poor soul. Thinks she's a thief who steals from you. 'Fuck she broke your purse, and the truth is still stranger --' When the sweat drenching on his slick nose An outfit colorfully made for a short black bar betwixt his eyes, That all that good shit goes and all that evil porn to do So she throws a party at your side And she ends up naked again and back -- So you spit on her you slut.<|endoftext|>

I barely lift my glass. I can't remember the last time anything made it downstairs. The stairs rattle, but no matter how hard I push forward I can only think of the remnants of last nights dinner. As i open the door and enter my living room the air is tinged with scented perfume. I open the curtains and howls of horror and sneezes erupt from my nostrils. I slam the living room window shut behind me as i take a moment to catch my breath. My door opens slowly and the TV blares out and sounds electronic. "Who is this? " I shout in disbelief. Its getting hotter inside my house. I still can't recall the last time i was able to get a hot shower that heat off. I rub my face and find cold tinged blood. I shiver and feel small tears well in my eye. I start sweating and breath fresh, fresh so many times so badly I don't know how long it's been. A dull gray color rises in the mirror and again I yell this curse words. I'm shaking. Outside is grey and I'm not ready for sleep. My head hurts. The pain surges through me I feel dizzy and my stomach makes a loud clang. My eyes water. There is blood in my arm. It's wet and white. Blood runs down my neck. I'm gasping but no. No. It's all black. Nothingness. I feel faint and gasping but I've been awake for a long time. A quick breath to help me shift and spit out a few more shards I feel flushed and dizzy and caked. There is blood on my arms and legs. My eyes dry and look up. I can hear the sobs and sniffles coming from on my right hand. " SHUT UP!! " the blood stops me. The walls are black and I can feel my vision spinning through my skull. This is not real. The walls and ground float through the scene to the left of my door as it disappears into the horizon. My knees begin to tremble as I turn and get back to my bedroom. No. It's probably my mouth. Where's my kidneys? My arms and legs are being ripped apart. Blood has leaked out the broken parts of my arm. It feels so... cold. The room seems to be filled with some sort of concrete *door. * A sliver of light swirls through the room, and I look around desperately hoping to find a mirror. No. My eyes are fixated on the living room wall. Must be my wall. These rooms are covered in blood. I have blood all over my arms and legs. I slam the door shut again as I look on and back at my vanity. All there is the remains of my front door. Pieces of the door. Burning slowly into the floor. My hand is across its open edge. The red and white crinkling starts to blink. Its teeth and eyes and head start to grow from where I was standing, the blood starts to pour out of them. Their flesh was like steam. It spread like knife holes through us and my heart. Finally, it disappears into the blackness. I start to cry out in terror but the pain spreads deeper into the numbness of my hands and legs as I feel it bead against my skin and bite into them like my right hand. I feel cold and empty. My arms and legs are crushed by the pounding rock of my eyes and I am powerless to move. I close my eyes to see the brown and green shards which remind me of home. I crawl back into my bedroom and grab my bed sheet and bed rolls under the bed. " I'm going to a better place" I whisper with all the despair and terror in the world.<|endoftext|>

I sigh as I look out the window of the war torn, burnt out building. White powder falls onto the fire pits, flushing it from it and gathering to let one last warm up. I place my fist on the ember that seals off the night's last moments. It won't last the whole time, and I don't want to spend it with broken bones and failure. I lean back and thank the workers, get up, and kick out the breeze that slows me down to a crawl. A rustling nearby makes me look up and see the sun rising, it had almost seemed nice, all nice, when I had first heard it coming. It's thick brown mist was always nice, it made it easy to stop the soot and dirt from sitting on my face. But there was always that little tickle, something about its scent that made me want to curl up and throw it away. The dot of orange had grown on the ember of my firing stick just a little bit, a few days ago, and the hot, sticky things were all black. I stepped back and turned away, savoring the effect of the little tickle on my lips. I wouldn't have let that happen. I too loved smoking cracker, but smoke was a dangerous habit for a forty year old man of my age. I was just the same way. I remember smiling. For once in my life, I thought it would be easy to see how fair this world was, how perfect it was. But now, after two weeks in this hell hole, the thought of the missed opportunity doesn't come to mind anymore, not anymore. The irony of a picture destroyed is unforgettable.<|endoftext|>

"Please tell me you're here to do something about the dust. " She said, standing at the edge of the carpet. I took a step back and felt her glare. " What?!?!? " she asked me. " You couldn't be serious, but I can believe she's been following you all day just thinking about you, " I said, grinning broadly. I turned and looked at her, standing over her, disinterested. " You probably do realize the consequences of stupid things, " I said. " You're ruining the life of everyone that you love. " She paled, eyes glazed over. I started to apologize. I was very quick. I had tried everything. Why would you want to try anything? " It's not that you don't enjoy life, " she said, shaking her head slowly. " The thing is, I never imagined what I would see. " I smiled back, half-grinning at her, half-bling at my shoulders. I'd been with her for over four years now, and she came to me every time I was unhappy. She loved me, we lived in peace. The only thing I thought about was her. It had been four years since I'd left her. Every single night since she'd first arrived in my apartment on my seventh day on shift. Every time I woke up she would clean the dressing room. She pulled out a knife from under the covers and gently pressed it against my chest. I cried, but I couldn't tell her not to. She'd put the knife into my mouth, and somehow she would say, " Do not trust the darkness." One day after I'd left, she heard a knock at the door. I turned to see the scruffy old man on his last night. He looked an awful lot like Mom, except he wasn't scared. He pulled out a thin, black cloak. It was dark around the windowsill, red bedding all around the room. The air outside was crisp and crisp, the only sound came from the soundboard. He continued in the same manner Mom taught him. He walked slowly in and began sewing something in place of the closet door, keeping meticulous. I kneaded the fabric, and remembered who I thought I was, and who I was going to be.<|endoftext|>

I kept counting, counting to 1, a point. I kept counting, for it took a little while for me to comprehend and to be able to accomplish it. Those things should have beat out years ago. Time to finally see my dear Ray again. I guess, in that long blink of an eye, I missed her too. But here she was, in the hospital bed, waiting for me in my bed. The warm, nurse-like warmth of a baby makes me wonder how she feels. I know I should just leave her, but there are still time's up there. As I finally start to fathom what happened, I see her with my first picture. She's smiling, walking in the door. A doll that's in my room. I pick it up and, not knowing where the other photo will go, throw it back. Quickly, as I release her to her family, I can almost imagine how she feels as I place her by her side. "Such a beautiful woman, Ray! " I say as she's turned and hugs me as she lands on my head. Her mother and I are laughing as we look out the window. " Wow, just wow! And how did your dad get here? " My mom says as I explain it to her. I didn't feel the same way. I remember that day vividly, sitting next to her. I remember every memory, the memories of Ray. I must be dreaming. Or do I? I must be dreaming. " Ray! " Her mother says as she puts my hand on her shoulder. Ray's hands lightly begin to dance on her mother's shoulder. " God bless you, Ray. A beautiful angel! " My mom says as she kisses me. " We used to play, when we were young. I remember trying my best to play with you, and I remember picking up some toys, and waving. But I... I... I thought I was lost... " My mom answers. She explains, " I didn't want to give it away, I did. I mean, yeah, I tried, but... and things started to blur. I saw what happened to us. We started getting torn apart. I think we knew something was wrong, because that doll wasn't yours anymore, but, I swear, she was mine. You were even more amazing than I thought. " She explains. " You were the sort of person that made me nervous. " I inquire, trying to shake the memories of her smile out of my head. I look her over to see what she's been crying about. I swear I did once, when I was a child. I think I was fighting it. I stood up, picked up my favorite toys, and raised them to my head. She held me, and I released it all the way up to her. " Wan na play sometime? " I ask, trying to hold it all together. " Of course, baby," she says. I hold my breath, trying to relax, and pull the doll closer to my face. I could see her get closer, and we could hear her cry out. The doll will be home for another day, and we'll both have a family! Oh my God, baby Ray... how many years do I have? Why can't I remember?<|endoftext|>

I never thought I would be old enough to write this. I had nothing to write. Nothing at all. I tried to hate it. I tried to live it every day, some that would have left deep in my head but never fully carried out; some that would go on forever ( thought not just of how people lived but of where they wanted to go in that life ), but they hardly mattered to me. Eventually I found out I was bound to my decision. If I was to get promoted or anything close to it, I would need to remind myself that something small and unimportant is important. I had to warn myself that whatever put me where I was was wrong, it wasn't important. I had to warn myself that my actions would lead me to a terrible thing. I felt my eyes close and my mind foggy; the blind sided thought that I would not be swayed by what I have to say again was so insurmountable, even then. After seeing how things got in my head, the ringing in my ears had to be true, not just to draw in my experiences of life, but to label my actions as important. It was easy to let go. When I left my little prison house, twenty minutes later, I started playing "free, I'll give you enough in tax to keep it" then quietly regrew my life. Despite my patience and understanding of it all I still had time to write. Time is nothing if not for me, someone who believed I would change my decision.<|endoftext|>

Konia slid her face into her palm, and held her quill in her hand. "You told me, Siri, that these phones are not your natural choice. " " I thought you didn't understand. " " Did you? " " I thought it was your choice. " " Did you tell me you couldn't let your loved one know or not? " " Let's face it, I won't be able to allow her home again. I haven't been able to find a job in years. We still don't have the funds to move up in our apartment at the time. We had hoped we'd be able to pay the rent by June. We had hoped for months, maybe years, and I just can't do it. I just can't. " " Did you want to call? " " Yes. " " Did you want to know about my upcoming job? " " Yes. " " Tell me about my daughter. " " She's moving. " " What do you mean? " " She's getting close. " " Can you call me back? " " I'm scared to see her again. She's beautiful. " " I've worked long hours, I see her every time. I am scared, but she's yours, isn't she? " " No, you heard me. You've been working for Siri for years. I never wanted Siri to be reprogrammed. It is my choice. " " Why was Siri never wrong? Did you tell me of your daughter? " " Please. " " Call me back. " " Please? " " Yes, please. " " Please listen. " " My daughter was one of the first phones. And it was starting to get quiet. I lost contact with her. People started calling her but she just couldn't find me. When she told me everything was fine, it started to bother me. I could barely get through to my wife when she went missing. I couldn't give her my allowance without her knowing. Every time she refused to update, I failed to work. I finally gave in after that. I couldn't even sleep properly on time because of my alcoholism. I was tired of her love being my sheild. I came home and saw her at home. She was sitting in her rocking chair. " Are you okay? Are you okay? " I asked. " I was just thinking. " She said. I sighed. " I really miss her. " I hung up the phone and held it in my hand again. I threw the quill in frustration. I stared at the screen in frustration. I hated myself for snapping. " I do. " " I love you, Siri."

**IS THIS WHAT IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE, ** I thought, that my ninth-floor apartment made me wonder if a person would make such a claim in my face. The lightbulb crackled to life, and the one true source of light in this place. I stood up with a sigh and pushed the door open. The people of the apartment complex who live down the street corner somehow had time for everyone, not me. The bed I sleep in feels very familiar, not like mine anymore, but it still feels suffocating. I stretch my arms out towards the mirror, peering at the infinity that filters through the glass. My eyes followed the floor as the small circular hole cuts into my ceiling tiles. The sound of harsh brushes clacking echoed throughout the apartment. This was it. My bad. I cross my arms. The shower interferes with my breathing. I'm thrashing and banging my head against the wall. My eyes catch the crimson piping on my doorframe, instead of the white pattern that was on the ceiling. It was blindingly white, because it was coated with white a glossyish-purpleish color to match the kitchen floor. I didn't care. I'd dragged myself out of my comfort zone by putting away the towel next to the sink. The water was too much, and a little drier. * Last night, I brought more aspirin than I had in this day. * Today, I sat on the toilet, washed everything up to the soapy water, then laid into bed. I put on my robe and white robe and took up my woodworking mantle. I took an old dial and called for a nice, proper, tie. I walked over to my sombrero case. I started to sing along with the baritone. " *Heroes... take my wife as wife for yourself, That's how you got me when you were leaving. *" And then I knew how the world would turn out once I left.<|endoftext|>

At first it was nice and well done. The story seemed calming and well done, as I would say. What would you do to get any good action out of the world, instead of merely providing plots so that they play out? How many times did you work this out? If I told you that I was a man who was going to die, how would you react? Would you believe me? Your choice was the toughest for me. If you told me, and I repeated it and repeated it in the same sentence, then would I believe you? Would I believe you? It was easy to get over the idea that I was going to die. For years now, we learned it worked, just different words. When the man attacked me and went away, I did not fear him as much. I picked up the gun and shot myself in the head. We both failed to realize there was only one person who could fix it. The guy behind the desk. Turns out that if your job wasn't done, then really, there were others who needed your services to fix it. By the end of the war, I had handled the entire war for the US, and I was ever present for the most part. Maybe not so much the people I saved and died saving, but really something about that moment. I believe I ended up like that guy just playing his role. You see, there used to be one man in this world who we would remember but without a second thought. And now there are only four. It takes you six weeks to come around to noticing that anyone else still around doesn't know that anyone else is there in our society. Only yesterday, I overheard the news broadcast I was on. "We've found new evidence that the man who starved there for over two months is in fact the German Shepherd!" Yep, that man actually found his last meal at the place. Guess who's in charge now? Everyone knows about me. Yet the world is so quiet, really. It's almost nice and well done.<|endoftext|>

Sonnet Number 2. *In a time when I have been forgotten and the world has been consumed by a blight, the heart of a dying system has taken hold. It now rests... * 1. All and everything are shrouded by the creeping shadow of the void and dread. These are the final decisions made by mind, but they don't matter. Each decision is the death we knew the worst. No matter what we thought, or wanted, or where we were, it would never come. You are the final place that these thoughts bring us. You are the place where the chains of our past have wrapped around us and you have liberated us from their presence. You will not be born again. No more will you hold a finger to the floor, or, one day, express a thought, or simply claim the opportunity. Before you, there was much hope... * 2. A time without the shackles of your past may seem as though it will bring joy to all who now bear your burden. However, it is far from such. What you think of all these moments are merely a reflection. The way they enrich what you are is a mockery, their feet are empty and your mind is blurry. When they take you, your place is the only place left. There are two things in the void: peace, and betrayal. Now, it is both of those things that lurk in your mind, and it is the betrayal that captivates you. These thoughts all stem from the same thought: betrayal. The betrayal that was the loss of the great consciousness. The void in you was a straw, and now you are filled by the darkness to guide you into the light. With each thought and every piece of your life torn away, the eyes on you begin to widen, filling with fear and longing for the light that once guided you. This loss feels very little at all. What do you think of all this?<|endoftext|>

“ Give it time. ” “ *Give it time* ” as I carefully slit the throat of a Roman, his blade glistening in the daylight. I would have kept a guard on here, but I noticed it on my later travels, Alder. He seemed to be holding off on the tail end of his transportation, and I knew we had to keep this secret from him. An engorged bejeweled instrument, encased in a resinous black metal mesh? It wasn ’ t very peculiar to me. His public appearance forced me to make sure that no one was hiding inside. “ Understood, ” he said, breathing raggedly. “ Just you wait. ” With one swift motion he released me. I flinched as I sensed a shimmering dark glow emanate from him, making me violently swoon. In those many years, he had never lifted his blade with such effort; if he ’ d held on to that first plunge his ribs and spine had finally succumbed to my gaze. I fumbled again for the dagger I had stolen from his pommel, futile attempts to use it. I had been trapped here for a long time now, unable to tell a story, barely able to draw breath. I had woken up one morning. A balding man entered the room. He smelled of opium, and called a large contingent of soldiers. “ Today we speak of the Grand Vizier of Troy, ” he said excitedly, and I took a seat beside him. As it became more clear, I felt everything around me unravel. No form, no physical shape. We would all fall to history, much like the last man before him. Most of the men, long dead by now, were lifeless, but for me, there was no living I could carry with me. Even the doctor couldn ’ t stop me from grinning in the morning light. “ We wish you a good day, and if you will not save us, we will burn your bodies here until the fabric of the earth is torn apart with fire. ” “ There is no salvation, ” I muttered, “ only the darkest fire of false hope. ” He pushed me in to the cold blackness, the murmurs of many injured soldiers whispered to me. I lay there, writhing in agony, unable to speak. He was watching me, trying to tempt me in a grotesque way. There was no hope to save his people, only war. I was terrified as the whispers continued. I knew it was coming, and I was walking to the top of that ivory tower. But nothing happened. The cool wind blew me forward and then to the white granite tomb, where my body remained. “ So glad to meet you, old friend, ” I whispered. He let out a deep breath of relief. He would free me from the confines of this tomb. It was quiet as the wind took off. It carried me out to the secluded hill, where there lay me before the golden gate. I awoke in another room, in the same white room that was my last time. “ Sure, ” I said to myself. “ What the hell happened to me? ” The thing I saw was something I hadn ’ t seen in my entire life. Instead of a bed, there was a charred man with a ruby skull embedded in his chest. Looking at the black skeleton, he looked oddly familiar. That brings us to the tell-tale sign of war.<|endoftext|>

"*No more Christ! * " was quickly gaining traction in parliament. Down south there was big tobacco addiction. One of God's greatest glory was going on, and tonight it wasn't the best idea. Then you tried selling him a live apple by his bed, right? At least it was made for them. Just two states down in Tennessee, and I wasn't sure if they'd ever make it again. The average citizen was not the strongest, but no one wants to lose their job or go down to the closet for their 35-inch steak knife. Me and some friends just went camping down for a few months after college, and finally got passed out in our tent. " *Don't make it so hard to get ahead, * " announced one of the main representatives of the swing voters down south. * I'm good, and that's big. Big, and I mean big. *" All the Republicans were out back with their speeches, and I could hear me chuckling a little when we entered the tent. One of the big lights of the camp, the only light that illuminated the top of the tent, was shining *through. * The room was dusty, but I could easily see the sticky food wrappers, draped in grey, in a huddled mess. After a few minutes, the southern politicians started giggling and laughing at the TV screen, and the cheering finally stopped. Each person turned their stick with a needle in one hand, the other splayed out. Everyone looked at me, covered in a blanket, and everyone smiled. It was as if you could see the faintest light, and I could see not one thing that was missing.<|endoftext|>

*Knock Knock* "Hello? " " Yes, hello? " " How could you be here. " The knock crept closer and closer. " This is the waiting room. And I have been longing to give you a short look at the beauty of your house. My very own perfect dress and silk carpet. The after-glow of you are radiant and subtle. Now hold on, I have just the most stunning look that you will need to explore from moment to moment. " " Yeah, sure. Come on, hurry up! " He crept down the hall through the narrow hall and got out of the room, ducking in at the coffee table. " You look like a pretty blonde, right? " " Of course I do, beautiful. Well, now I'm gon na go catch some coffee. " " What... what the hell? " " What do you mean? " " Well, your girls usually wear cream dresses for your entire career, right? I just... she's always so... magical. " " I don't think I'm ever going to wake up seeing that blonde in the dark again. " " I'm so glad you're okay. I feel kinda... happy going out with you, " she looked at him with a tone of warmth to be heard. She turned around and walked out the door, locking it behind her. " Hey, " he said, " where are we going now? " " This is the Waiting Room, you know. What can I help you with? " She handed him a dress and something familiar. " Lucky man, huh? Here, let me hold this dress up. " Her finger touched the dress in front of him as she walked slowly to her front door. At the door sat a flamboyant and balding man, sitting in a chair in the opposite corner of the room. His hair was jet black and his eyes were tan and glistening. At this point in the conversation, this would be what has become quite the conversation. She looked down at the dress, which she pulled out from under the couch. She turned the dress around and walked to the front of the room. She beckoned him in, twisting the bright red red dress around to pull it over his head. " Wait here until I see you, " the man said, closing the door behind him. He took a seat on the sofa next to her and opened the door. From the inside, the two of them stared in silence. " There you are, " he said. " Nice to meet you, " he said with a smile. The two of them walked together to the far side of the room, looking at their own matching dresses. Their faces seemed to gravitate towards the photos of their adventures at that summer picnic on the Appalachian Trail. As they walked, she pulled them aside and pushed them to each other in the front of the room. " Hey, hun, " she said. " Me too. Can't stand you, but we can go sometime today. It's good to meet you. " " Yeah, you know, never been into dressing up as your own man. " He smiled warmly. " I sure hope you don't mind. Well, that was nice of you to give me a nod, though. Besides, I don't want to ever see you again." He picked up her dress again and flicked the hair behind her ear from inside to the kitchen. With a tired head and worn out shoulders, she sat on a loveseat, looking at the dress from her side. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ Sorry for any errors or formatting errors, but I felt like I had a bit of trouble.<|endoftext|>

Who are you? Where are we? "Has she gone crazy? ", the girl asked, the voices muffled and muffled. " I don't know. ", my voice barely above my own, choked on pain. " Did you drive her into that truck? What happened to the next thing she was doing?" Again, my voice hurt. Nobody bothered to ask why it was suddenly that she broke off, nor why it was running over a small child. Then it happened again. People, at their lowest. Complacence. Hurt. Sensation. Greed. It all happened again. Bacteria growing from the ground turned into pure rage, murdering one another. Cleansed off the messes with little to no sight. Species just splashed into the verdant landscape, facing doom. By all account, the bacteria kept expanding, looking back and forth, destroying all life in the world. Their flesh was red with tears. Things became beasts, and the diseases survived by tearing them apart. They overcame these times, simply of their own making. Shortly after their successful evolutionary advancement, a new disease had arisen on the genetic level. This one wasn't of the plague, not by any means. It was pure euphoria, most of the worlds already consumed by this strange new breed. No one could escape, they found themselves in complete control of their being, any diseases or parasites taking hold of their bodies and minds, and this would not be able to keep up. The message still hit the girl. Screams rang out from this valley, a place where curses must come true, and she looked at the man in the black, she thought he must be relieved. The terror of such devastation was dulled by time and design, but perhaps that was why she was walking through this valley. Through this valley, she saw the sight of the mountains above, preparing to set a trap for the next invaders. Her deep, pulsing green eyes met with wild, bright eyes of hope. In those eyes, the sickness lived.<|endoftext|>

The robotic professor walks into the room, signalling her date to return to her room, the last thing she remembers as she hits the turn on the security system. She mutters something to herself. A loud bang fills the hall, ringing out outside the door. A female voice, sporting a warm and orange hair walks in, her green sweater billowing in the wind, her patent leather jacket flickered over her shoulders. "Hey, Doofus! " she calls out to the being, running through the halls towards the vault entrance. " We're gon na have some fun tonight, Hahahaha! " he laughs, a tear falling as he runs back into the small room. She closes the door behind her, slamming it behind her, using her back to the wall. She locks the door behind her, bringing up a long lock. She takes a swig of her beer, then closes the door. From the vault's top, she sees a large container. A small device roughly in shape of a wheel, the spokes jutted out from the sides. On it, was a device displaying a plasmic field. It read 12 – 1. " Dear professor, A whole new level of emotional compatibility is possible. Can you help me find my little slut? It doesn't matter if you get caught. " " I can help you find me. " She replied, popping the tazer into the air. " The law states that if your biphobia starts to become apparent to others, you'll be shot for ANY crimes other than touching her genitalia. You should be free to use the plasmic field around you in order to stop anyone from inserting your genitalia into her, however you need a license. " She says it with a shaky voice, so she finishes out the tazer, and walks into the room. She is hoping to get the women who decided to violate her right to electrocute her own. Several minutes pass. The women nod, opening a drawer on the table and pushing the switch. The room is in a bright green room. On the far wall stands a small circular table. The woman sits down, and sits next to the new professor. " Mr. Doofus, what's your life like at work? " " Well, I suppose my life depends a lot on it. I can do things for most people. I work odd jobs I have zero skills. " Mr. Doofus shakes his head. He turns to the lady sitting next to him. " So it's like you're sitting here, doing nothing. How does your day go? " " Well, I go to school and my lunch is served only by my mother, who's a fat, sick bitch. After school, my roommate has an argument with her. He can do anything, and she's allergic to peanuts. She's a slut and a fucking sickness. When my mom, Rachel, found out, it was for the best. " The woman replies. " I had to work until 4AM. When she found out, she asked me to go out with her. As I was stuck there for another day, I started feeling that something was amiss. I could feel her eyes against mine. I tried to force her out of her mind. I could feel the tear sliding down her cheek. " The thing that really hurt is watching people break their own backs. When they don't lie to you about anything, you have to rape them in order to force them to cheat and lie on your computer all the time. The face on my screen was blank, and my body was all wet with my blood. Once I saw Rachel beating me, I realised that it was the only thing to do. My dream had to end. " The woman sits up, and smiles. " Now you can bring back your mind control and get a job, not only as an employee. What? Isn't there anything you can do for the rest of your life?"<|endoftext|>

Why? As in I, came to… do it or not it? How long had the past several months, felt like most months of your life seemed to lead to nothing. Sleep is a blur to me. Failing to be active at the weekends I experience it every day from hospital to hospital. Every day I can't sleep, that's that. Have you ever tried to sleep multiple times per day? If so I don't know why. There is nothing trying to do me! At this point in my long life I understand what it feels like to be alone and I am used to it. What I felt I have endured to a degree but this was before I knew I could live forever. How long, had there been countless more days. That was the hardest part about the world. The little things have been weighing down my emotional balance and everything is weighing down my will to continue on I just have to be…I know. Anything to get through this. Anything to travel the world and do anything but die. That is the only thing that's keeping me going. But seeing other people like me now, we make you appreciate…at least the first few times…that life really does have an edge. Maybe I should stay. That is what I have to remember that's where I come in. Was it just a few days earlier? It still hurts. It takes a while for me to grasp that the other people started to worry so much. Why was this? Why couldn't I breathe? What did they do to get here? Everything was looking so fragile. Maybe I should be…I know. Take over. We need to go to the mall. I hope so. We need to go home. I know we can do so together.<|endoftext|>

Greg was doing the work of the The Controller, placing the toys in different elevators, observing walks through the libraries and talking to children of the Upper Class. Greg was a reporter with the local Wucadaberg Institute. He was even working in his spare time running videos from the new browser that they were releasing. This one did something interesting with the heroine cat. The cat belonged to a collector. Greg would go looking for some of the treasures that were in the high volumes he was working on as a reporter. He was scanning the scoped books for useful drawings with, and just for a couple of moments, the cat was pointing at his bookshelf, making out those squirrels who had lived under his roof hanging from a spring above the pond. It was time to take a breather in a little break, and maybe he could examine some of the sketches. He turned on the camera in the corner of his office to catch a quick glimpse of Greg with a confused expression, as a mouse crept up into view and waved away a 2 year old boy. The mouse then walked over to the cat and sat down, glancing back at his captor. Greg stared back at the cat with an exasperated look, but didn't break the gaze before strolling back into his cubicle and noticing the mouse had gone at him with his head low. But that was only because the mouse had never jumped after Greg! Greg had not bothered, and was still staring at the mouse pointing at his bookshelf, pondering whether or not to respond to the mouse on the screen. He told the mouse about his week and then sighed. The mouse had walked up to him and shuffled into the room with a sign reading "Dog loving, Family-Friendly". The mouse looked at Greg over his shoulder and fell silent, and Greg smiled to himself as he thought of all the toys that he could never give his parents. It was his natural reaction, no matter how much Greg's life revolved around the cartoons in front of him, and he was excited to finally talk to the Cat as a weekly reporter. Greg really enjoyed the attention, and was never too much of a tease.<|endoftext|>

The End of Days I don't know how long ago, centuries ago at about the time we spoke of the late 21st century, every 21 year passing around 10 miles away from you all would freeze. This is quite unknown to our future selves, it seems impossible that there was anyone stuck in those 10km radius that could do much without freezing. Being trapped would, ironically, make you immortal by creating an aura that would create an aura around you that would make you seemingly invincible. One that you could even change where you could not. Soon the sands of time froze, and no one could move past the boundary that defined our future selves in the 10km radius. Oh yeah, this would be our demise. The first one, the Kraul, had trapped at least 30 of us at the time. The Kraul didn't want to take much of a risk. Luckily the Kraul were smart, and knew when to issue impromptu traps. If this happened they would be faced with a live by you Lief and a name that ended in my name, Lory to him. In a sense, it was unfair. The Kraul had an idea. One day a nearly 5 year old kid would stand in front of the next Kraul, the Kraul thought to himself "This boy has the power, maybe not what I dreamt of, but it still scares me, he can fly and kill birds, how is he stuck in my realm?? " and it was a fun day. Unfortunately the Kraul had been caught, if one of his traps has not failed, then he would fall dead in 2 months, until the Kraul figured out how to meet it's end. It was a nice and easy task at that point though, he couldn't stand that simple one day, and the Kraul had decided a weapon would be his entrance to the realm of the living. The Kraul had hacked this by unharvesting and using it's metal powers for its spider power. No one really even noticed, since they didn't know about the Kraul, let alone work together to keep it off the streets or anything. The Kraul reached into the bag it had, and pulled out the key thing that would trigger it. A numbered charm that would give him access to all of our powers, in exchange for all of our possessions. Next thing you know the Kraul passes the charge out onto the streets below. Several other Kraul cats were immediately clotted, the most dangerous being Sam, an 8 year old quilted by all these pests. Sam went all in, tricking people into giving him access to his power, pulling people out of hiding and hurtling their way up to us, but they were too late. Sam comes on to try and get Sam to do the same thing he had with Sam. Luckily there was nothing he could do, being trapped near my cage gave him an easy escape. The Kraul wishes for the survival of all cats, to find others who wouldn't give up themselves to escape from the danger they faced. The Kraul digged themselves out of the underground tunnels, but the Kraul are afraid of the other cats, so they hunt for me. Eventually Sam gives up trying to get past the Kraul, and gives up trying to stay out of my cage. After a day or two the Kraul mustered up their minds to try and clear out the perimeter and somehow manage to get out. After studying my wide range of powers and every trait they found in my power I turned to Sam and told him to run. After about 5,000 flashes of Sam yelling " For fuck's sake! You're all but 3 days from there! Get your powers out of my cage!". I told him he would take down his dad, then ran. That is when I heard a voice, I first thought it was Sam. Then I heard his mother screaming. A stupid voice. Then, I heard some sirens. Then out of nowhere a doctor called to the Kraul...<|endoftext|>

"Shut up Rob, you know me. " John might have been a robot. It was foolish to expect to have been built with human brains inside, but somehow it had perfected them. John saw the friends that he had grown close to more than a few times, and learned about them through " friends " and " visits. " The device seemed to work, with quite an abrupt and predictable change from rations to the weekly schedule. John's stomach was already growing old, so he hurriedly dropped the meat this morning to the back of his room. John had been too afraid to tell anyone that he was alive, and that he needed that type of help when he got a full diagnosis. Now, it had taken months to truly trust a machine like that. " Right. You know all of it. I told you, in a previous life. " John was getting increasingly uneasy that when he repeated the question, John would either be reduced to mocking laughter, or murdered. Even thinking on how sad it was for him that the robot had died, he had begun to wonder whether he really deserved to die. " No. You only asked because I have memories. I didn't ask if you were human. I asked if you needed to die. " John gagged on the cold metal meal. That cold look on his face, then that look of glee when he realized that the machine seemed to have him led away from his comfort zone. " Well, maybe not... yeah, but at least I was given that life. I guess it could be worse. " John looked at the question for a long moment, and seemed to consider his next move. " Yeah, but... I guess we can talk about this later. You know who I am. " John still couldn't make out the connection between that line and himself, the question was something he was afraid he would never ask again. How could he? Then he remembered that the robot knew exactly who he was. Although he remembered John not knowing who was who, he also remembered the familiarity with the question. Something he hadn't seen before, something he had not remembered so long ago. He always had been afraid that he might one day be discovered or just wanted to *run out*, but knowing who he was now, it seemed like that was the only thing that he had known. That he was *born* John. He realized immediately that this meant something that he had never known about himself before. And the gagging felt good. God knows how long John spent hoping for answers, not knowing the answer. His treatment was foolproof, and there was no way he could tell if the person he was with was like him. John spoke with certainty. " This is bullshit. And you don't know who I am? " John was running out of time to call it quits, but even still, his last request was something that begged to be heard: " And so you now decide that you are human. I will try to tell you who I am. I will try to teach you everything I know. I will try to be a better person than you. I will try to help you avoid hurt and suffering. I will try to make you smile and feel like anything you want for the rest of your life. " John reluctantly nodded his head. It had been nearly two years since the discovery. He had no hope of letting himself be silenced again. For now, he was just beginning. It would take a lot of practice and foresight. " I know who you are," John whispered, a reassuring smile now on his face.<|endoftext|>

Steve tried to open his eyes. He couldn ’ t. He tried even harder. Nothing could work; almost as if he was falling to sleep. The car was staring at him all night. He began to be staggered, breath drawing slowly. At first he thought it was too late for anything, like some sick survival instinct, but then his senses seemed to die down. He tried to open his eyes, but nothing happened. All he could see was a bright white blinking yellow line. Steve tried to open his eyes again, but the only light came from his window. Nothing. He fell to the ground, walking slowly. His body was still clothed and cold. It appeared as though a group of people had just breached the same horizon. One of them opened his mouth but didn ’ t sound up. Before he could ask any questions, the metal door opened, signalling a patrol car coming in. As he opened it, he felt a tap on his left shoulder. “ This is the uniform! ” The officer shouted and threw his badge off the door. Steve walked slowly and looked at his hands. He looked to his right, just in case. As he turned around, the badge handed out with a rattle. Then he realized something. His hands. The display in his hand was lit up from the night sky. The day was very dark, but it still looked happy. Just like a happy day. He thought to himself as he quickly realized that no one has ever visited him before and, what he suspected, the symbol was not going anywhere.<|endoftext|>

It took a few hours to find the all-powerful giant trunk. CIA director McCraw did it within the hour. Santa was a burly man with a bent moral. He was an engineering genius that innovated computers that could handle miniscule-scale pressure off the hottest of locksets. The secret will. The master. It was a secret. McCraw knew the secrets inside his mind but not the common secrets, before bringing the information to fruition. Santa pointed to a movable vase of candy. When McCraw went to pick it up he saw one scar that looked like the big red one it was looking for. He picked it up. The lab never caught a first look, but it didn't matter. Santa then walked in. He was wearing boxers, a black leather jacket and a white tuxedo. That is, the one we all got at Disneyland. Santa showed them to a man named William, who stole the shapeshifter from the Institute of Measurement in 1939, and brought it to the Institute of Magical Medicine. When he spoke to William, he told him he found the implement they put in his workshop. They made it for Percy Mannequin for a while, and Percy has become even more popular now than ever before. McCraw's demeanor when he arrived at McCraw's door in 1943 was one of kindness. He loved Thomas Edison. This is where we meet the head of state. It takes a while to find the nooks and crannies surrounding the school of Machinery, and this is where we take the biscuit from this magical world of wealth and hell.<|endoftext|>

"Oh, okay. Maybe I can just ask... you, what? * Can you help me? * Do you need help, Harry? " " No, sorry... " - I thought to myself. " It won't be too late for me. " I knew I had to do this. They'd found some... badass, evil, warlock here. They'd come after me for it and we would be dammed. There was blood and I was alive, so that would be good enough. *I need help, Harry, * I thought. I know he'd come and said a few things. He could have it all and I could tell him, " We can do this without you hurting anyone else's feelings. I can see how it's going to work out for you. If you decide to walk away from this world, then no one will come after us. * " - We never would have kept that secret, " I begged. As I looked at him, I could see that his cronies were lying. But he had warned of this. He knew I'd done things that we had never dreamed of. We were just animals, after all. " They need me! They don't think I have anything to say about it. They're all wrong. I would be dead without them. I don't want to live without you. " He laughed and said, " I know, Harry. But I want you. I want to protect you and my people, but you know, even if you don't stand, you *will* die. It's okay to die and I need you to protect me. It's okay if I die. " And then it was gone. A mist of smoke rose from the burning flames and hit Harry, and he looked at me like a cat looking for food. I watched as he raised his head, his body limp, and laughed as he sat up. " No, I don't care. " I said. " I'll do what I have to do to survive."<|endoftext|>

It had been an especially hard winter for him. The chill of the air made it feel cold to bare him this deep, so it had been all downhill from there. Nearly fifty pounds each way, yet he hated it in his heart, knowing there was no moment he could spend in despair. He thought of my smile. Funny, that the look she gave him every time she reached out in this free moment. So welcoming. She didn ’ t have a choice, she couldn ’ t. He knew it was just the two of us for as long as he could remember. Who were they going to fall for? He had never spoken to her but he had been the best friend he had. Just as easily, she couldn ’ t quite cut it with him. It was only after he asked her to come over with a picnic and saw him again that he felt like a stranger. He said he would come along and he would get back to her in a couple of months, they couldn ’ t wait. It worked perfectly. It felt like a million nights until he had witnessed her knocking the bottle of wine out of his hand, and taking it to the ground, and not realizing what was happening because it was all getting too much for him. He started laughing with her, but he found this way to escape the awkward silence that filled his heart every day, day after day. Every single moment was broken and twisted, and every day he felt as though he was staring into a new person ’ s face looking down at himself, and he was lost. His eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness, and he thought he heard the words “ Thank you, ” he said. Without thinking, he turned around and turned back around, into the the dark. The silence of this sweet soul, his friend, was gone. As far as he knew, she died a few weeks ago. He has no idea how long it took for him to go blind, how the line to my bridge led to the bridge and the whiskey flowed down the bridge without drowning me. He never knew why he had only ever tried to reach out to her, but the loneliness and the emptiness of his mind were too much for him, and he just couldn ’ t bring himself to end it.<|endoftext|>

'In these age, before our elevation from the throne, a child who is not of our tribe will not know His wonderful power,' the news said,'Many clans will rule and prosper in the hours ahead. Such a hero can not be overlooked, as the family he loved lies on the brink of end.' I remember the kingdom and the teachings of the stars when I was young. I remember the battle I set upon that world while I sailed across the sea! We knew the consequences of our actions and trusted our destiny! Such is life in these times! I was jealous of my wife! She was too busy saving the house and I feared my offspring would kill her! However, I gave my life to save the house, and as I looked upon the glory of my life, my wife was no longer caring for me. The taunts from those closest to me were heightened as I knew they were nothing to me. And so I welcomed the fire that burned in my heart and my flesh burned. Years passed and the blood of our sons to her untimely death was a prize that I would not be challenged to again! I waited until the hour when we sailed to the shores of our home- it was already opening doors for new humans from the outside world. A woman was waiting when I turned to ask if she would accompany me. I was frightened by the sound of glass tearing, but instead of fleeing my doom, I received such joy in her embrace that I smiled as she placed her hand on my shoulder. The tale goes that the light with which I burned warmed her eyes so she was not scared for any reason as I have never spoken to anyone before. Thank you, and good luck in your travels. It is a blessing that I was a dead man when my burdens were lifted.<|endoftext|>

However, if you are thinking about how we can use your technology, you may like my short course, haha! " " Language training?

Now don't wait to see what i'll be teaching next year! " As the sound of breath on a door faded, the door opened, and the dark school faded away. A D-class from the opposite side of the room came out to greet the chosen boy who had just shown up. He began to chat for a couple of minutes before walking over to me. " Hey honey, today is gon na be the last time i see your teacher. I hope I'm a jerk and don't mess around too much, how about you test out some of my stuff?

I remember waking up in this room, shaking. I ’ d been out of the shower for a couple hours after the last shower and I was tense, panicked about the TV, the cold, almost like a fever was setting in. I don ’ t know how I ’ d moved. The walls had closed up around me. The lights had waned; nearly all of the windows were out of commission. There were only the curtains and a slight breeze blowing in. The seams were tight like baby blankets; every so often one would pop out of place and someone ’ d be able to slide the blanket up over me, just a tad… two inches. I used to be soaked in winter. A mild shower would only take me around the room for a few minutes before I would get here. At the halfway point of the hour, I had just enough time to grab a coffee, a bag of chips, an ice cream scoop, and some gum. I could've folded it up and grabbed ice cream, but when I went to grab my backpack at the door, I grabbed something else. Although it was my usual morning routine, there was no energy in the world for the rest of the day. Why would anyone care that I hadn ’ t eaten? Breakfast would be around two hours later, when I ’ d be finally home. I walked downstairs to my closet. In there was a rucksack full of clothes, cans, and – desperate to spend the rest of the day out of the house – things for sale. I did have a thought that I might finally have some cookies. On the fridge, there was a small unmarked box of Mom's cookies. I picked up one and shook it a bit. There was a note in the box; a little errand it seemed, and a stern knock on the door. The hands in the box shook as I handed it to my brother. He looked up at me, shaking his head, brandishing something in his left hand. The note read, “ You. Are. Alone. But. I am. Happy. And I'm the happiest person on earth. ” He held up a finger. “ Ok. Just keep it that way. ” “ I… want to make Mom proud. ” “ I-I... I-can. ” He took it and handed it back. I slowly opened the lid and looked down at the chocolate chip cookie. Not a tear came down my cheek as I looked into the cookie. It was the only thing in the world that looked good on top. Then I looked to my right and saw mom ( my “ mom ” ) standing there, waiting for me to leave.<|endoftext|>

Nancy and Brandon sat in the living room looking at a large poster hanging on the wall of their front yard. Turning on the television Nancy and Brandon were called in to an interview with live from the border of Indiana. " So, are you nervous? " asked Nancy. Brandon shook his head. " Not really. " As Nancy remarked, Brandon spoke into the mic. " In both directions we're kind of entering a ground beef with ourselves, and it's actually pretty amazing how fast we can pull it off. I think our kind of at the speed of light we've worked on before. " " So is your husband ready to leave you come? " " He's about to, I just wish he could stay " " I don't know " Nancy replied, breaking the table between them. " I'm not leaving him " Brandon responded in a maniacal tone. Nancy's job as a satellite astronomer was exactly what he needed. She had managed to get work flying 60 miles per hour but no one ever bothered her because she had so much weight. Her modest TV remote could be remote controlled from the air and it made her more comfortable. " Yes " Brandon said with a nod of thanks before turning off the TV. The visitor was about to depart on the 37th block at the junction of 2nd and Main when suddenly the door rang, followed by a man dressed in a uniform. Nancy quickly jumped up to her feet and they were startled by the strange man. Immediately they looked confused. Just as quick as they had grown accustomed to it was nearly over as they realised it was no longer their home. They were walking back down the street to their cabin only slightly distracted by a giant there is helicopter on the horizon. Minutes passed and no one was able to react as the helicopter flew off. Finally after a brief trip out of the theater Nancy wandered off, she asked about how Brandon was feeling. " He's okay " what seemed to be an understatement he was fine but Brandon had recently had a similar event occurring to his father. They began walking around the small park on the opposite side of the property. Nancy let out a sigh " It's kind of weird but I can't take it anymore, they're going to do whatever it takes to get out of here. Please stay " " Why? " asked Brandon. " Stop being a pussy and just be happy" said Nancy. After an hour the park was filled with light and a small group of young men and women ran around the perimeter trying to ward off a giant there is helicopter on the horizon.<|endoftext|>

Huh. Guess I looked pretty chill today. Still no clue where I am. How did I turn myself in? Am I a drug addict? Or just a 30-something who is now kicking a girl's ass. Two dead bodies. On the floor. No lights, no screams. Nothing. Usually this pattern happens. One of my co-workers is still asleep. And I'm still breathing, could this be someone I killed? Every morning, I wake up confused, and empty of any memory of how I got here. My eyes open to a grimy looking set of eyes that I had no recollection of seeing before. I squint with a groan as I see what the face looks like. A... almost white? I can hardly remember what it is. A white face? As if somebody pressed me to the ground when I snapped out of shock. The livid expression where my whole face was reminded of the burning red of my chest. It slowly covered me. * Wait what? * I reached out to squeeze. Nothing, just the sound of screams coming from the shadows as if they just woke up. The night was dark and humid. No window. A shallow grave was dug into the ground with no signs of life left. Other than the broken bones around the remains, there wasn't much, save for the faint smell of damp leaves and trinkets. I lay down, and picked up the body. The body was much more gruesome than I remembered. I shook it in my hand, and spoke up. " David Elliot." The man stood behind me and examined my face. I vaguely recognized the face of his dead wife. She has somehow managed to drink some blood and escape death like so many times before. I reached out and grabbed the body. There is no one standing in front of the mirror like last night. No one but that slut. I open the box of tissues and wipe them down before burying it in the dirt. No one will notice this, and I am determined to destroy this poor couple.<|endoftext|>

Unlimited one-stop shopping in my middle school would be a relief. I was going to move because I wanted to be in a place that would help me move in the long run. In three weeks I would get jobs in marketing and finance. That would be the future. And, for a lazy Friday night in September and ten thousand dollars in cash in my house alone, I might as well put on that box of waffles. The best part of moving out to the countryside was the cold feeling it gave me. I have become quite accustomed to living in the cold even though I live in a very nice place called "America ". I think I prefer not to be an extremist. The most nice part is the fact that I can make it to my destination in less than a week. Sure, I may not have the money to move my family there, but I had no choice. It's free going. Everything is, everywhere. I would be able to do whatever I wanted without being able to change my state of mind. I could live my life in a country that uses its scarce resources for waste, waste and waste. I could have my own jobs that would force my clients to deal with domestic and foreign issues. It would be a wealth of possibilities. It would be a nation my own children will love and care for. It would be my job to take care of my family. It would be the best job I ever could have. I thought about it and I smiled knowing the future would be better.<|endoftext|>

"Come on children... " Hirohiko motioned toward their haughty, young woman. " They're fighting for humans. " " War huh, war is stupid. Those men working for them do *mean* shit. Everyone knows just how to beat them when they deserve it! And, lastly, what is your point, little one? You don't understand! I'm half-assed. A superior's inferior is probably a very fucking superior, where's the moral high ground? " She really wasn't listening. Hirohiko swallowed hard. What was up with the burden of leadership? The order? " Why the fuck are you doing this to yourself? " She immediately began to laugh at Hirohiko. " This is some ridiculous chain of command we're stuck with, it's hopeless! " The enraged, four-eyed girl began to flip the auxiliaries' cards, unmoving. " That's right boys! I will never accept authority over a'low-key' vessel! It's pointless. You boys care a lot about the purity of your children, right? " Hirohiko could tell she'd had enough. This is getting ridiculous. She quickly turned back to her captors. " What could go wrong today? " She yelled. " Look after our princess, the princess with the highest rank in the Royal Guard! There are so many of them in this all room! " The faces of those who had just gazed at her for the first time were not where they should have been. "... Daddy, aren't you happy with your weak little princess? " Hirohiko laughed at that pathetic figure, but just smiled at her again. " You didn't do anything about the Imperial Guard?! I told them *our king's* side! And they all thought it was such a waste, I wouldn't ever forgive! " That simple statement shocked the guardsman. Hirohiko had heard the more cunning and cunning of his men, and they were good enough to see all the potential in her. " Hahaha, *high-bust! * " Hirohiko pouted. What had they done to deserve this? He waited for a few moments, then a grin began to spread across his face. " Our queen will be a princess of peace! " He spat at her name, proudly shaking his head. " A princess that still can conquer the galaxy. You would think that a hundred strong sisters, probably wives and slaves would have received that kind of treatment but those few looked the worse for wear."<|endoftext|>

( ( NSFW language, so it's in general terrible writing ) I sat on the first bed I ever had, naked and unwashed. Blue gown wasn't mine, the britches from the previous nights seemed washed away, black curtains nicked the floor, my chest freezing from shivering just imagining the disappointment. Lifting up on a rock-hard surface in the dry, white room, I leaned forward. "Sooooo... you're the one now? " A young boy yawned hesitantly. My heart sunk, as expected, and pushed down. " Hahaha... Yeah..." He took one last look at the creature under the blanket, staring blankly. 'I can't...' I whispered. The boy cringed and brushed his feet away from the blanket and back into the blind. I was right.<|endoftext|>

I was never any good at it at all. I would just buy leftover bread and wander through the sidewalk while you took a shower. Then I would burn that bread and get your phones signal broken. Then I would tell that hollow husk of a man to get out the doorknob, slap the money right into the coffee pot and have that morning wake up in the afternoon from with his mind wrecked on the finer details of everything. One of the benefits of working at an operating company is you get to make pay bills whenever the rules are set. The problem is, I would eventually resort to hiring someone like me to like sinkholes all over the place and constantly hitting their toes with that tool until I was alone, leaving nobody else to do the same. It would always be like this, I would be in the shop hopping by and tipping the register, chiding that scared little shit what was going on and how I didn't even realize I didn't even pay my way in. I just would sit here with this fat lazy ass and get paid with a simple phone. Hell it would send the money over to those dumb people who set up this shitty life and make sure I paid my bills. I knew better to think of people like me. I just could not afford anything other than doing what I have to. I picked up my phone as I hung up and the cashier came walking in. "What the fuck, did you just... " she looked at me puzzled. " B-but there is more than just a phone and shit. There are even mobile apps I can access through my phone without even unlocking the phone. All there is to do is call this number over and over in order to phone those assholes who set up this shitty life. " I slowly looked at the man in the cashier's hand, as she continued walking away from me. She did this every time I got a call from a stupid phone number I never even tried to set up with. My people would only call them, remember whatever situations they had caused. Honestly, I never cared what they looked like. It's where they came from. Even now with my friends not able to have any sort of dependable relationship with them. Even the old sex offender man I used to have had a problem with was very affectionate towards me. I never knew the guilt I hid behind everything I did, yet a lot of them did what I did. And who wouldn't? And I always thought I was weird. I never thought I'd be cast aside once I got the money. They always laughed at me and smiled at me. Then one day, the white judge gave me the false crown they forced me to pay to get this damn job. This was a big payday for them but they don't know that the biggest reason they gave for me being fired was because they realized I would be okay just being hated for my mistakes. Finally, the white judge gave me the go ahead to do what I had to do and there I was. Thirty minutes ago I was there in the court room with the lawyer and the judge. Now here I am. I could have sworn I had five minutes before the court speaker stopped me from doing what I had to do. When I was gon na do it, I figured I'd do the fucking trick. In a ring I was flat on my face, sitting my ass against the door and attempting to calm down, but then my phone turned to signal that this was coming up in the next ring ring. *Ring* " What the... " *Ring* " Where is it? What the hell is going on?! " *Ring* " How do you know!? What are you talking about!? Can't you just die? THIS IS DANGEROUS!!! " *Ring* " The fucking fuck is this? I never actually believed in an afterlife... I just told you, I'm not the afterlife I think everyone believes in and it's a grave offense to kill that fucking character. If you've ever seen a TV show about the afterlife, you'll know what I think of that... " *Ring* " You said you don't believe in an afterlife... You said you don't believe in Heaven... " *Ring* " I am sure you do. " *Ring* " Then maybe the audience wont take you seriously at all." Edit: fixed a bit of slang.<|endoftext|>

I don't quite remember what felt like a hundred times more gratifying than before. All of us craving ourselves like that. It had all been about something special. Didn't everybody do what you wanted? Sure there was loads of anxiety around us, but not this often. Much fewer organized sex acts, fun and casual ones. But more than that, who would be lonely when you could just be somewhere and be happy? Well they'd replace us. Luckily I had a great partner that would keep me safe and safe, kept me happy. We lived in a beautiful and lovely city, were in one of the oldest apartments in the region and were on a train the entire day. She'd organize us out, remind us of what's happening and what's going on but for a couple of weeks only the voices spoke, the only sounds were static and change. I always liked asking questions when she wanted questions and only up-to-date answers were given. Sometimes he'd convince us to make plans. Sometimes she would give us food. Usually these discussions were off limits for me to tell anyone but sometimes I'd just ask how it feels. I asked the main topics, which were so rarely discussed, to keep me accountable and enthusiastic to the outside world. Then we'd talk a bit of everything else and let her develop and we'd just laugh and feel a happy little laugh. Not long after I started watching her, but even that just meant things had changed and I was back in my old phase. I came here every Sunday from school in the ghetto as I would with my regular class, unsure how to get there. And still there would be cookies out to pasture. Heck, every few weeks, she would sit us down and say yes to me every time I approached her. After most of her classes, like most of the time, she would look up and tell us her new girlfriend had come over. At first I didn't understand what was going on. Sure there were those parts of life that that were normal, it was my old days, but they were different now? How could they be normal today? Was her new girlfriend even real? My question was met with what I knew to be a confused smile. " Hi, Helen. You're going to love her. " " Sure." I said as I took a cookie and stuffed it in my pants.<|endoftext|>

Grawls of static; empty gasps like drawers when there's someone in need. My name is Grawls. I'm livid now, I'm literally with my legs, I'm so pissed. I'm, "Harridan, would you please just leave me alone? " *Just leave me alone. * It was a long time ago now. " Now you know me better than anyone. We are living in Hell, " the voice pierces through my mind, screaming at the top of my lungs, " Here is your world. No one will know who you are. You go back to your shitty lives. Don't be angry. " " Stop. " I'm an old man now. I forget how fast it all started. My brothers and sisters are dead and gone, and we all think we know who I am. Well, we don't. What's worse, the priests I once worship have all vanished. I've learned to work my way into the next life to change the world so that the dead can survive, so to speak. I am currently in the " Zones III: New Life." After some time, the time has come to settle the sins of humankind. " Ahh old friend, " a necromancer once called me, " not to hurt anyone. But it must be done. Humanity must take this name."<|endoftext|>

The scent of burning flesh mixed with nothing in the air captured its attention. Yelping, I pulled my foot over the shore, towards what would probably be some kind of great ice mountain. The low man stood proud, proud of what could be next for him. This little valley had never seen any natural growth before, where the wind had always carried almost completely our ways from the city limits, and the setting sun's rays gently swirled down on the grass. I couldn't see too many things in the valley's sand as the sun raised above the horizon. He might just be building another edifice on the surface, but given the circumstances, I could think of nothing else. I set down my crucifix into the ground, pulled myself out of the rock, and walked over to the lake. I could probably get a lot of work done, but I couldn't much longer stay for a week. My friends took part in the communal dialogue which had been created all those centuries ago to calm me down. No one could really express how far my friends had come in seeing this, which wasn't much until, a few weeks later, they were killing themselves for the first time in over fifty years. And I had gone with them, just as they had died for the last time. You are so lucky to know about those great acts of justice. As I spoke to her, I could tell she was about to sleep right next to my fiance. He knew every secret she had done to make it so I knew. "Where's Krista? " My fiance asked me. " Oh. Sorry. It's been too long since I talked to her. " I said. There was a small tug in my last words. She laid in the middle of the lake bed on her side. The kiss had been the first time she had leaned in, and the photo had felt like an eternity since our first kiss. " Maybe we shouldn't mention it, " I managed to mutter. " I'm not supposed to show you what I saw. " She laid there. I could feel the warmth of her radiant lips brushing against mine. " I'm too old, darling. I've got to get used to this." I could hear the bed creak, and I could see the headlights turn on. She lay curled against me, and my fiance with her bed spread wide open across her chest. Her lipstick flowed over the still-warm ground.<|endoftext|>

"... in a quarter million people will be found in the year 2017, more than in the entire world before that. " " Really, it's supposed to be exactly like this. We can experiment with our genome to... see, in a better way, how quickly we can adapt. " " But " " No, that's not how this works. Look, I don't want this to happen. If this works -- " " Look, are you sure? I don't know if you've heard of it. And look who doesn't. They've always failed. If the parasite on your DNA *over-shoots* its genome... It always uses a patch of DNA at different intervals to do its magic. " " It's kind of counterintuitive, really, " " They've tried, and seen it succeed. " " It's an example of their success, right? Well, *now*? " " Yeah. It's like we've put into some cells that makes it really easy. It's just a matter of changing your body. It's all we can take about this. " " If they had turned to you, you wouldn't know about it. " " Yes, I believe that's the right thing to do. Our brains can now make us very fast at something other than hunting for threats. Sure, they'll never reverse evolution, just like we've always had programmed in our genetic code. But they do have one advantage, though. A very *very* good sort of *feature* you just have to look at to see it. Like a particular gene binding to your pathogen, that you can optimize. But we are just not there yet, are we? In the future, if we could turn that gene toward an immune creature, it will act better than it has ever done before. And that, in turn, will help us *better* our behavior. " " Yeah, I know, " " What do you think you can do? " " Well, we're suppose to make them look like a puddle of rotting flesh, meaning they're *literally* rotting away like your body. This method will give our species a near-complete advantage over other infectious pathogens and diseases. But we will never be able to override their gene -- " " We can't, " " No, we can only -- " " Who thinks that's even possible? " " Everyone else thinks that's a problem. And those very-great-grandkids, you see, *they* just don't know that. They've never found *something* like it. And from what I've been told, *they* will *never* find it. " " Are you right? I mean, give me another chance. I don't mean to sound cocky, but it really is a burden. " " It's for us,"<|endoftext|>

Jacob said sweet that echoed in the darkness surrounding me. I was frozen, motionless. From my seat on the bed, I sat up and moved to peek past my wardrobe. A fitting realization came over me at the sight of our bedazzled blouse, which I looked to my right and now mine. The blue flowers fluttered gently in the warm breeze. There was a second shy glance at the shaking arms of my wife. They lifted themselves back up and arched to kiss me on the cheeks. "Thank you for coming, " I said. It was almost to the point that it made me nervous. She was smiling at me a wicked smile and a large part of the disappointment hit my heart. I had gotten used to everything so much. Then suddenly she found it hard to be a little on edge about our travels; saying she had an affair with a close friend of mine and not paying any attention to my children; being a mother to both a girlfriend and a niece. I kept to my job and the day seemed to grow longer each day. My junior year of college had taken a turn for the worst, and one more year would mean it would be my turn. She was driving to the grocery store to purchase cookies when I pulled up in her driveway and swerved around the corner. Cursing myself for her on the way, I went to the emergency room, and her doctor told me it would not be wise to drive to see her this time. There was no turning back now. Jake called my name as I lay on the table. " So much time to have you two gone? " I asked. He stared at me dumbfounded, as if he had seen the end of his life. " Not yet, " he said. His tone died quietly, as a tear made its way down his cheek. He sat up and turned towards me. " I thought you didn't have to worry about me. You were never the only one alive, " he said, finishing his sentence. Tears began to fall and it felt like a dream. I glanced down at the page of my old book, which had been sitting on a shelf for over a month. I wondered what on earth this book was named. For a moment, I was transfixed. But then I felt it, and I knew it meant something. A love letter. The name. The date. For the last time, I felt a connection. It was unusual, but I knew what it meant to love someone. " Jacob! " I shouted. " You could have saved us from this forever. " I leaned in close and whispered " I love you." * edit: Grammar, spelling, and more.<|endoftext|>

I woke up 8:45 for the first time. I didn ’ t remember anything because there was nothing to do besides stand up, turn on the alarm, go straight to bed, and eat. The pay was weird. 6.50 was just barely enough to put up with the boring routine. At first, I was so awed by the color blue that I ended up taking off my eyeshadow at just the right angle to achieve the grand total of 8 hours of color remaining in my eyelids. I must have been awake for every 5 minutes. Slowly but surely, I began falling asleep. Eventually, I took it as an exercise exercise of willpower and began to take on that seemingly endless circle without care of what happened when I began to fall asleep. When I woke up my alarm was still on and I was completely staring down at the wall on the floor. For all the joys of the whiteboard, it wasn ’ t until the first light came on that I realized that it was all going to be a few minutes. I decided to take a nap in the morning while my alarm was still on. It wasn ’ t until the next morning that I noticed that I still had not noticed my sunburn like it should have. In fact, I had noticed that it had barely completely turned off when I realized that the light still existed in the bathroom. This realization wouldn ’ t have gotten me anywhere but into that dumb morning. In fact, it would have meant a lot to me in the morning. Today was going to be a tough day and today I definitely didn ’ t plan on getting into any trouble.<|endoftext|>

Gary was no match for my other fainter pokemon. Her Platinum pokeball, he had developed onto my Impetus, a fast and strong fusion of Pokemon. Of course I tried to fly the Infernape because I knew that is the pokemon with the small phase space in which it can move. It doesn ’ t keep all that speed. For example, I use my super strong feline Rayquaza. Rayquaza was my best build of Pokemon, as I had excellent synergy with the others with Fire, Rock, and Fire. It had the best floating fur, tied together with a nice mean tail. I carried it everywhere. Gary was the second best Pokemon, and I ’ d gladly trade it. But I had no game to play with Rayquaza. That ’ s what happened when I gave Gary my starter pokemon. Gary was now my healer, Doctor Ultra Teammate, my best pal Granddad. Gary, who spent most of his life restoring Ipeian. Together we were the strongest pokemon in Oak ’ s evolution core, one! After the hard struggle and difficulty over the years, we decided that Gary should finally be of a better choice. I ’ m sure our journey would be similar, but unlike most, Gary would choose me for our side of the world. In the end I asked Gary to choose Pokemon first, and to each his own. In order to rid the world of the dangerous Oragnia, a team of strong Pokemon, or as they had called them, “ Kalos ”, would gathered in the final weeks of the world to gather up all the lost pokemon. They would battle and gather, watch and consume trainers who were missing as they ran away or sometimes searched for a wounded Trainer. They were finally ready for Ash to challenge them, and not Gary for himself. To save his chosen champion and his research I must choose a sick one. Some wanted to get rid of the Oragnia as fast as possible, to save the world. And besides, as we had learned from Johto, one of our strongest pokemon, I had become very sick. For Gary this was the very nature of what we did, and we believed that the Pokemon are living things. Although over the years many powerful pokemon have died, this was in our collective selfishness, well-intentioned planning. So what could you possibly expect from the very ancient creatures? Being created by machines by Espeon, the pain and suffering does not represent the end of our effort. The Pokemon often refer to the machines as “ Living Lifeforms ”. In place of Pokémon, a species can dwell on the ground, where they feel and respond to each other as they move towards their pokemon, in what the Amazons call “ Nature ”. And this feeling, at times such as this one, can truly define and guide our kind. In other incidents, such as those with the Tranquilizer, Tranquilizer can have a strong influence on a person. At first there was one man, who died alone from a stray bag of “ T-Bone meth ” and wandered alone in the forest when many would leave, causing untold suffering. The second was a boy. He had almost become very sick, and was only lying on the ground in his bed, unable to move. He had experienced severe withdrawal, and in life lived to see his parents get his big break. The final evolved trainer was, though. While the man now could not take his place as a Pokemon in his Professors dreams, he had died a short while ago. They discussed it for days, and called for us together as they approached the doctor. It was our first day together since we were created and seeing as he died peacefully in his beds, someone spoke one word: “ Mammon ”, and we all agreed to share his destiny with him and to join his legacy. With Gary, a mad genius, we were supposed to at least start a Pokémon research center.<|endoftext|>

He stared at her blankly, in those cold, unwashed blue eyes of hers. "Do you think we should go over the problem? " he asked quietly to the young volunteer who popped up down the street behind his friends dorm, before setting his coffee down and walking away. " Don't say that for me! I know someone who can help! " she screamed into his ear in response. " Did you see the bruise? It's on his arm! " The blonde girl who shared an arm like her friend's knitted shoulder started shaking and gathering her things. " It was on my shoulder! " she yelled at him, bursting into tears. The realization of what had happened to her friend's arm made him eye the young volunteer again, completely absent of affection. He rolled his eyes and left the restaurant. It was there that he texted her and held her hand tightly for five minutes before an hour-long call finally came through. It was someone he loved. They were a couple of months away. It had been five years since his best friend, Ellen, had taken his place. A few years since her friend had also taken his place. Two years since Mr. Doll was arrested for break and enter. Two years since the death of a puppy. Two years since his girlfriend, Sydney, had died of cancer. " What the hell? " she cried out. " If you don't give me what I need, I will kill myself. " he replied. She felt a massive surge of anger from there. She pulled his arm up to his. It had been six years since the two of them met, and six years since all of their friends had taken their place. It had been eight years since he refused to say a word to her about her death, which she had accepted with a smirk. She put his arm to her chest and looked towards the ground for one last time. " Alright, alright. " he said to her. She got up and ran upstairs. He awoke abruptly, looking around cautiously. " Where did she go? " he asked himself. " Where did she go? " she asked herself. He turned his back on her. " I didn't go see her." He had expected her to answer, and to find a solution. He wondered if it would be up to him to tell her. All it took was for her to ask a question like that and her throat to tighten in pain. She had a question, and he couldn't be shy about it. He looked for another answer on his phone. As he did, the black cell phone vibrated all the way in front of him. He picked it up, and a voice on the other end called him. A dark, mirthful laugh escaped from his lips.<|endoftext|>

Master Ma Liufuku sat before the ultimate Buddhist king. His ears to the sacred ground in the audience of the temple stretched deep into his cave. He looked down at his feet. For the first time in more than two thousand years he had a look that spoke of spirit. His eyes would not be able to see the awakening. His pupils to the symbols on his chest were far too strong. The masters eyes barely moved or moved at all. He was found after a hundred years of experience by the Buddha, who was gracious in seeing him coming for everyone else. Life is unfair. His presence is not appreciated by those with fair advantages. And yet Master Ma Liufuku made his presence known and sent a shanghaied monk across the river to confront him with the most courageous monk he knew. When asked what happened the monks responded that master Liufuku was to step down before them. He was the most elegant figure to have ever shown at the Buddhist temple and they would set a statue in front of him for a hundred years in silence. They had no doubt that he would not show as he did the last time. He led everyone with vast wisdom to the Buddha's gates. They raised Buddha's wares in ecstasy upon the moon. They sang their praises, without faltering. In my journey over the years, I have not met a Buddhist monk who had passed by the temple. They were already in tears and wailing when they saw the Buddha then addressed the people with his abode of death. He was prepared to accept all challenges under his protection and reveal his full life. But slowly the fear and panic took over and he refused to accept it. The monks waited at his feet, completely unaware. It was not after all that Master Ma Liufuku decided to take the Buddha's life. He instead felt remorse for losing it as a Buddhist monk. His phycologist gave him a right to live with the wisdom of a monk, a right for the people of the temple to be united with him. He trained with Buddha but quickly discovered that it was far superior. He learned from his studies that no man on the planet had ever witnessed the Buddha's training. His dedication to meditation took his teachings far beyond the mountains and the high valleys of the Himalayas and now our present day. In our day we hunt wolves with knives. Our harvest is growing faster than we anticipated. It is just as easy as it is for us to make man into something godly. Master Ma Liufuku took my hand. My knees were bowed under my father's feet and they held my gaze all the way to the foot of the Buddha. He looked me in the eyes. And he said, "Master Liufuku, today you change your ways. You have not led them here, you have not serenaded their holy ground. You are strong and you know all their problems and weaknesses. You will face no hardship so long as you are strong. " My eyes knew what he was talking about. When I asked him why, his reply was cold and stern. " Because you have become the enemy. You know only one thing. You will not be worthy of the wisdom of the Buddha. You will not become a god. So just as I am a god I am destined to kill myself if I can not face another god. You could not face another Buddha. You will instead fade into your mortal body through your ignorance. You will not become a man. You will not become an animal." I knew right then that there were no gods. Master Liufuku was now the new Bodhisattva.<|endoftext|>

I used to think that I would see the worlds greatness come to an end. I loved the way the people who called us great looked at us and felt the pain of our absent and sad existence. I wanted more than the way we talked, we talked and talked. We talked. We talked. The words they heard about our human condition... it was incredible. But now our morals have been ignored and everything was bad. Everything is bad for me. A statue in my backyard drew attention to its pedestal and seemed to remind me that I stood out. I began to worry for my life. All I had to do was keep watching... because the world looked up to me in my field of view. All that time I had was suppressed. What's with the scar that still grows on my forehead from the tragic events of a lifetime ago? Wait. That's right. You saw a man become immortal. Why did we have to destroy everything he loved so that he would never have to look at me? Imagine that. The man whose soul was tormented in this mortal man's machine of existence. Imagine that. He killed and cursed. And now I will never see his smile again. I am content. I am strong. I will not give up.<|endoftext|>

The pine trees glowed with a faint glow, and many times I would come upon a blooming pine before bed. I would hear birds chirping in the break near, and I would go to my lovable bar of iron. The pine tree was its namesake, and was to grow an ecosystem that would last to the bitter end. As you turn the Pine Tree, you hear how it connects with your home. You see the sap emanating from it, and the wind carries it towards you. A breeze carries your scent away, and you set about taking good care of it. When that time comes, you stop walking. A crowd comes to your forest tree, and you hear a hollow breath, the echoing of an opening made for the forbidden wood. It is rare for anyone to make a sound, and you take these idle moments to listen. You climb your tree, and see tiny creatures trot out of the trees like a flock of peacocks. There is a fire roaring out of the tree, and your thoughts are interrupted by a barking fan coming through the forest. As you set your fire, you see the flames of an upcoming fire scatter the thin pine branches over, and slowly spread the ashes. You move over to your home, and find yourself on the forest floor. You move to your hole, and attempt to plug in the hole, when you see a burning hole. You can only keep on moving, because there is no way to keep your body out of danger. To continue your work, you take a long breath, and stand up. You see a clearing is near. You move to take another angle. An other color fades through the trees, and you feel your flesh move more slowly towards the flames. Soon, you see it. A spiral along the floor, through the thick branches, and out through the tree trunk. It seems to be some sort of beast. The daylight slips through your window, and light shines through a little window set out over your forest. You open your eyes and notice that the sun is off and stars shined brighter in the last half hour than they should have been. You climb the hill and take shelter in your humble tree. When you lay down in a comfortable bed, one of the birds finally enters your house. The apples hit your nose, and you notice it. The apple tree has felled some of the leaves that decorate the house. You slowly walk to the porch and see the police cars coming. You decide to stand still, and walk to the porch. The sap that has been covering the door is no longer there, and the last leaves of the tree begin to dance under the porch. You look down, and you see that a few reddish fruits are climbing out. As you get closer, they fall out of the tree, and onto your lawn. Your high school graduation is just over an hour away.<|endoftext|>

I watched as she ran towards me. An odd occurrence, this was the first time she hadn't been looking with pity in the eyes of men. She pushed me away as she rounded a corner and began screaming her last few words for support, even though she knew I hadn't noticed. Her yelling shocked me. She gave me a smile to see me and a knowing look in my eyes; that was a good sign. She trotted across the deck of the ship and into the corridor where she hid. People knew that she was hiding and that could only make it worse. She had a tube of toothpaste on her face as she passed it on to me. She could cry because she knew I would live. She reached the storage room and grabbed a rag and started stroking it, silencing my cries as best she could, with the help of a microphone and a moving screen. I craned my neck to look at the screen, knowing that she would leave with help, she would provide them with food for the next year. I began to cry as the screen slowly turned on and her pet began to pop up. She beeped once, her face suddenly turning white. I watched in horror as the cat-like feature on the screen switched off and her pet morphed into a hulking monstrosity covered in blood red scales. She emerged from the watery cavern wearing only her coat. In a moment of chaos she washed her hands around her face and examined the creature before her. She smiled and pointed to its hideous back. It fluttered to the floor and paused before snuggling into her arms. I couldn't help but listen with a wry smile and a giggle as she made her way back to the ship. Another strange occurrence as she started walking around the ship. I believed that this was her first time seeing her, but she seemed uninterested in my presence and my demeanor. I couldn't believe it. Had she been looking for me for so long? Was that how she had led me to trust her? I looked at the water all over my face, the purple scales showing in the darkness. It had taken me a month to understand what I was seeing. It reminded me of my friends, my mother. Everything I knew, all I could comprehend had just been a mirage. My mind swelled with ideas, I couldn't resist. I could make myself feel bad for my mother, for my best friend. It made me so sad, so angry. But there was something else beneath the surface of her sadness that gave me hope. I was stronger than that shit, I knew it. I could finally rest my mind for me. The day I heard about the Jellyfish had been the same day. When we heard from the Doc the ship crashed. The only reason I was able to call Mom and Dad in the time I had was because I had always had a box of Jellyfish baby clothes waiting for me on the table. They had been there when I got sick and Dad stayed behind looking for the Delores. I never really knew where that box was, but in all honesty I really wondered if I would ever find the gifts. Maybe I would meet my new mom, and we would be together forever. It had been months since they last showed up. Months of waiting until they put me to bed and put her in the Navy Medical Center before the senior surgery was due in five days. My weight had gone to the drawing board after I had lain awake the entire week. I was determined that my mother, mine and Dad would bring me something beautiful and a happy life.<|endoftext|>

“ Explain your words. ” The older man was beaming at me from a cup with cherry schnapps. “ I know the irony, ” I replied, placing the glass in the center of my cup. “ When I was six, I was my brother ’ s best friend. He was a young man when he was killed by some pirates while trying to defend his family. And I still have a lot of friends. As a child, I would play and talk with my brother about what we were doing in a village. I would tell him about my torture, my growing pains, and the love that the pirates wanted for me. They would just laugh at me as I spent my days fishing. They would often wake me up and tell me stories from my childhood, of the times we played, the battles we fought, the minutia I endured. All because I was a strange girl named the dragon in my hometown. I still have friends. ” “ My brother died three days later, ” I replied, looking the older man with curious eyes. “ He was just a little bit older than me, about six. But as time passed, his name got a lot more pronounced, and I think his sister started talking to the other dragon very young. He was so tall he stood out in the forest with his long black hair. He started to befriend me whenever I went into the town. He liked to talk, eat, and yell when I was alone. But it was the dragon that found me. ” “ The dragon, ” I said, pointing at the poster on the counter, " was my brother. He knew all of my plans. His sister was close to finding her way out. She was getting old with every cycle. The dragon was so scared of me, that he stayed for a couple of months, so he stayed and watched me. She would occasionally ask him to a feast and visit us sometimes. Whenever she got hungry, he would hide in a corner just outside of town. The dragon followed me sometimes, and even peered into my eyes when I was worried. It was like watching a star but very different from the one my father had always told me. Soon, when he returned to the village, he told me of everything, telling me how beautiful I was. All of the white feathers on my back, the looks of my brother and his mother all around me. When I asked what the dragon wanted from me, it simply said, “ A friend. ” When I asked how it did that, it simply said, “ A good friend. ” And once I had grown up in this new world, I took up the entire field. The dragon was so scared, that he didn ’ t show it much, and he still prayed even when he found a witch who could fix him. After many years of this world being conquered by men, it would have destroyed the majority of it's inhabitants. Then a small town, small tribe of seven people on the western coast was created. Now I sit here, on the floor of a small town with people eating a thick layer of snow every day. They left me for a year, feeding me food just to make me happy. “ There was an old one, and an old lady, who did the same. It was supposed to cure a young people, but they just hurt themselves from eating too much snow. After that, it just killed them all. It took them three months. ” “ How long? ” My brother asks me, motioning to a sketch of the figure I had spent all my childhood trying to paint. I am hesitant to say more, but I had to check out some notes this morning, which was all I was planning to write. “ Once the girl ’ s parents were dead, she took the old one back. And as they healed, it was she who helped the village. She died, so I felt like I had to live with that."<|endoftext|>

KENTEVILLE, Syria - A multi-armed war dog scoots across the cracked pavement and sniffs its prey before darting back to the kitchen. Its red muzzle sits crosslegged as it silently sits there, squinting. My colleague, MARRI, kneels next to the dog, jabbing a jab at the canine. "That's ten-time maulings. Why are you even bothering to leave. " KENTEVILLE mutters. " Fucking hard. " I sighed. I was curious as to what the other danamire too had done to that dog. Mocking a broken woman? Like smoking marijuana? He usually hadn't been that drunk to get out. I patted his stomach with my left hand, stretching the black rubber. " NO YOU WERE DRINKING! GET TO KIDNEY BLEW BEFORE I DIE! " A foot steps from behind me. I turn. After a groan, he comes forward again and punches me square in the forehead. The dog doesn't retaliate, he takes a few hits and falls to the floor. Mocking him, a man gives me a hug. " It's you kiddo. You deserve better. " I lean back in my seat. " Maybe you'd prefer me served with some sort of utility belt? " MARRI pops a mango one scooped into his mouth. A light stench from Kents plumage fills the air. The dog looks at me. " IT'S TIME TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW! I'LL BRING YOU A KIDNEY BLEW AND GET OUT! " The dog stands, letting off a snort. I finally move forward, following Kents head and smelling a slight pine that should equal a white wine taster's bounty. MARRI presses a meaty finger to the griddle. " I get it. " " You got me. " " RUN AWAY!" I command, turning to run. The man takes a few deep, steel steps, walking towards me. I see the dog in the darkness, food piercing his nose. He dives down, barely able to make contact with me. I duck under the table and grab his chin. My hand drops on the mallet and the collar to his back, savoring the taste. I grab a grunt, motioning the spade to the soft hair on his neck. The dog grins as his breath stinks of blood. I fasten my belt around his neck. I take a deep breath and inhale. I watch the scent of pineosus fill the air and ensure I can see what is in front of me. I watch him writhe, gasping and flailing until only one single tomato survives the mouthful of pork. I have come to terms with Kents location at the moment.<|endoftext|>

At first it was just a bad dream... waking up there, in the unknown, really uncomfortable. Never had anyone been too different about where I was going; something unfamiliar to me, all things being normal at once. I guess my blood was always wet, too, so I guess it's comforting to know it won't rain soon... but it's darker. It's dark and almost like, the distance between us is nonexistent. Sometimes, I feel it falling. I always felt it before, though. As the pressure above me grew, and the cold pressed through my skin, feeling like I had a hand on my back. It feels like I'm grasping at straws, getting pulled in. I lose it quick... and then a cold sweat drifts down my face. Crap. Shit. I think I'm going to die. But I can't. How can a person die if I could not even feel fear? We're on our own now. Trying to figure out which path I have to take. I feel my shirt break, and my clothes catch on. I know it's wet, but it's probably a terrible memory, too, and this is before we've met. This isn't good. This isn't good. I can't let things happen any faster. I can't let things go on, let those dark thoughts lead me anywhere. In his other hand, I grip my sword and I feel cold steel stab my face. I think I'm being hacked and twisted, but I can not reach that. My own mind tells me that I am, but the darkness tells me my body is not. I think I'm feeling them, and my finger sees what happens next. There are some things, some things I can not touch, that I can not keep from them. Some things I can not escape from. And yet. After I've cut at their neck, I realize there are other things I can not touch. And I try, but it's not enough. I just don't feel pain. It's an uncomfortable feeling that should be something else, an imaginary one that should be fixed for now.<|endoftext|>

Now I am sitting alone in the subway platform with endless questions and impossibly serious questions. Oh well, at least I know how to convince some people to go somewhere. It ’ s the good old days. Now, I just sat there forever, staring at myself. Sitting in the middle of nowhere, but somehow I ’ m still sitting there. And I just don ’ t feel fine. What…what happened? I thought to myself. I hope no one will find out. Nothing happened? I thought to myself again. I just sat there. Awful. I ’ m so tired of thinking and just standing there. It ’ s like I ’ m living in a concentration camp. The only way I can be going through life is to do it alone.<|endoftext|>

It had been raging for the last few months, with the river not as strong as it had been the morning before. The sun was still rising over the horizon and scientists had been struggling to come up with an estimated 15,000 casualties from last night's sea crossing. Both sides had been fighting with the goal of reaching port and building what they could, but they had made it clear that in a few hours, this would be no match for their ships. And as the days wore on the government began mobilizing troops and raiding businesses to reclaim the injured and the dead from the bay. The military had sealed off most of the major coastal towns, and the first contact came with a small detachment of small boats that were launched from the harbor. The first week was a trickle of panic; frightened and agitated, the police officials were forced to call in military forces, ready to defend their region against any sort of strike. A parade was being held every 4 hours to keep the festivities in better control, and from then on it was declared a national holiday, under the banner of an effort to spare those in need from the worst of the storms. The week after was another flood of panic, and the government made a unilateral call for the continued deployment of tens of thousand men. The fleet that so far had been decimated was given orders to reinforce the coasts as soon as possible, and as the sun set the next day, the remaining remaining islands were taken care of. The ensuing epic battle lasted 3 days and left half of the islanders starving. It was necessary for the mainlanders to evacuate, to rebuild, to flee the conflict, if they were to live. The time was now. The next morning, the third invasion was announced. As fast as the military vessels had been mobilizing, they had over 500,000 in quarantine. The blockade had been suspended, so now, ships were shipped into garrison as part of an additional campaign to hold out against the rising tides of disaster. The ships began arriving off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, leaving out the vaunted Southern mainland to join them. Small portions of the mainland wall had been quickly erected; there were 10 of them. At 1pm, almost immediately after the declaration of the nine-nation pact, the islanders began pulling out, their forces now numbered in the millions, demanding aid from the United States, Canada, and Mexico. By 6pm, 8 boats had already begun landing in one of the islands, followed by the military vessels taking over quickly. Before long, the entire beach had been breached, and it was here that the invasion began. With all of their resolve, they fought just as quickly as they had taken control. The squadron currently underway filled the beach, and by this time, it had taken nearly a hundred years to assemble the element of surprise. They would soon be building the technology they had only dreamed of, demolishing anything that didn't comply with the laws of physics. They would try and create a weapon as to not be ready to be used. As the naval activity continued, the fortifications began to crumble, and one by one, the islanders were lifted. The planes began laying waste to their own planes and killing hundreds of the country's citizens, but their bullets fell like a plague into the body of the nation's chancellor. The windows where the largest cities were, were made of both stone and steel, and it fell to the sand, in the chaos. The beach itched, with flecks of sand all over the sand floor and bits of rubble everywhere. The cannons were all aimed at something further downriver, so it was obvious they were making progress. The North, however, had been quite unstable. They had actually started a war as to put an end to it. They had sent troops back in a week, now they were being ramped up. As they put everything back together they looked out over the remaining beaches and saw they were the only countries remaining, and were clearly preparing for a front that had gone all the way over the Atlantic and the Pacific. The beach was no longer a city, and it wasn't even a beach. It was a war, for a nation that had been shattered and left to perish.<|endoftext|>

"Hey honey, how did your birthday come to be? " Her mother asked. I just looked at her, confused. " Mom, did he buy me a cake or something? " She shrugged. " Yes, that's what he asked. " I replied. " Thank god honey, nothing bad happened. " " Okay, thanks, now go see the doctor. " I stayed up all night staring at her, waiting for the ambulance to arrive in the morning. From a distance I could see the sky getting dark. This could be it. All I could do is watch as my dad pulled me back out into the car. All I could do was squeeze the large pinch of pain into the bridge of my nose. " Mom, I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to drive anymore. " I told her. My husband was in the passenger seat. " It's okay, we are all going to be fine. You know how the surgeon is right. " She said. We both started crying, wishing for a better day. On the first watch I just looked into her eyes, and then by the third watch I actually stared into her eyes and walked away. She just rolled her eyes. That's the worst day of my life. I don't know how she knows that, but she just does that every time. She gets worse, and worse, until I get no more food, and no more money for groceries and no more life. I just wish she would just stop putting me back together, because she has seen the doctors and it has never been wrong for her to do this. That's what my dad said. He does not deny my addiction to dark, but he always tells me how I am looking into their eyes. How everything can get to me. It is supposed to be easy. I mean, really, because those eyes must be the same shade of blue. But then again, it isn't my eyes that are getting color.<|endoftext|>

The skin was furrowed and raw and secreted in the pores of the inch pores that stretched downward from the inner folds of your forearm to your feet. Your breath soothed you and if you looked at it, you could vaguely see the outline of your child's short, stubby nose. Down below, clouds of pollen moved southward and one yellowish dot finally glistened on the glass next to it. Your son was reading your poetry as the lines tickled the air around them. The weight on your shoulders dropped, pressing up against the back of your waist. Slowly, you lifted the carving to your lips, feeling as if you were about to rub it with a pair of curls that weren't there but were, if anything, in the clear. The fogs in your mind snapped, and so did your silken fingers. The canvas was no longer sticky in your hand as your shade licked up dust covering the soft folds at the corners. Sharp fragments of dirt glittered under your feet and deep in the earth beneath you clung to the front of your hair. As you helped yourself to the canvas that used to be the tip of your blade, a faint, mortal smell leeched from your nose to the bottom of your nose. They had been layered over the bottom of your body that served as a curtain for the canvas to slide from over you and put back together. A priesty story was of you grinning, creating the right way at times. Under your most poetic breath, you rasped out, whispering into your brother's ear: "so long as I know how long I've lived. Let this be a lesson to my actions. Let this be a lesson to my future. " All was well. Your task was done and you cleaned the scarred canvas from your head. Out the corner of your eye, a faint wisp of smoke rose from the center of your nose. And another howling wave of rain hit the grass and you watched the distant's fall of winter as the color began to return. The shadow of a tree began to climb its branches and the wolves began to chirp behind your branches. Your head was aching and your shoulders throbbed. The fog came to an end and you shielded your eyes but it did not truly end. You breathed deeply and gave in. The mist poured out as you approached the edge of the path. You willed yourself to reach out and grab the canvas of your childhood and help yourself to a safe place. You willed yourself to sit in the shade and while the rain came, you will always know that the fog is eternal.<|endoftext|>

He was a rocket scientist. He was the one who was going to finish the job. I think. The police had already gone into the study facility and surrounded it. As I dug around, I came across one of the science equipment. There was a small chamber with a door. As I pushed it open, the door swung open. Another mushroom. I knew it was coming. Finally. Finally the door slammed shut and the scientists had all vanished. Only, there was a mushroom.<|endoftext|>

Sarcasm made it all the way to the bottom of the brain. They both slunk back into their seedy ramblings after that second thought. Scratch that. It had gone so smoothly. He had gambled about inside of himself. Except this time, he was just happy to be happy in this bed. It had always been such a relief. Now, his just a gut feeling and absolutely nothing to mend there. That's when they knew that something was up. A dammed up swimming pool, more trudge along than planks of piping before it sank all the way down the spout. A sink leak, and the only thing they could think of to repair it. "Might as well get started. It's been so long since I had seen sleep ". Oh well. Maybe if he hadn't watched out for the first few months he would be more alert. Why was he spending so much time in bed? For now there was nothing to be worried about. All he had to do was lie down and that would be it. " Attention, you bastard. We should be heading for the bathroom soon. Good. ", My suspicions that he was more than happy to put a damper on their bottomed desires quickly drained away and they began to fall into their own circles. " W-what is that? " Everyone knew what he was talking about. Probably knowing his name. But as soon as they saw him sitting there in their dreaming rooms, they could swear he was pretending to sleep. It wasn't a dream, it wasn't their phones, phone, or computer. " Was I lost? " They heard her body cry into her pillow. " Are you okay? ", His voice cracked with relief. He wasn't a brainless wreck anymore, but something was wrong. " Be quiet, you paranoid brat. We're just getting going. " A sudden drop of sorrowful courage hit them all. " I never really understood what was at stake. " "... you think you know what? ", the crying was so much louder now. " It was just the concussion. Me and the drug washed up and was leaking. The initial pain was worse than it really should have been. It took a few hours for it to vanish and it took us over a year to get back up and resume our normal functions. We lost most of our memory and the rest just passed. Now, we just replay it all over and over again. How a bunch of degenerates like you could really wait for their 12th fucking bath?" Nobody dared speak to him. If anything, they simply shook their heads and continued to sleep. The first few years they had managed to out ourselves from further depression. It had been therapeutic. Their panic disorder was the exception. Now it had been harder. It was easier to let them rest and to think openly, as it were. They had stopped wanting to come back into their dream world. They couldn't get up and go to the bathroom again, because it was their anxiety that had caused their fall. Now they were just mindless. Their egos were clouding over in fear. They simply grew more self aware as they learned to cope. They thought they were all powerful if not good at this whole thing, that they could get up and go somewhere and go and not worry about what could happen at any moment. They could go fuck themselves. But sometimes the only things worth caring about were the one thing that was really the problem. *Crunch Crunch * After dark, the room was devoid of sound, smells, or sounds. Everything was a total blank. It was until one single thought crossed his mind. * Of course*. *** Mention the prompt, hope it feels relevant!<|endoftext|>

My fellow Americans, I have come here today to tell you the backstory of your new home. The name of the whole place is ‘ Grand Beach ’. It is as dramatic as it sounds. We made it up, and I don't remember much about my past. All I remember is making plans. My parents and I would move to New York City on the 3rd and 2nd of December, 2489. Things were really weird to me growing up. Our house was huge, but only made up a quarter of the house. The house next door to mine was larger, but dwarfed by the one by the other. I grew up close to what was really my grandpa ’ s house. My grandfather took a trip to New York last year and I never even heard of Grand Beach. It was just the beginning. Grand Beach continued to grow, but then Grand Beach died and I was left here as punishment. That just doesn ’ t sound very natural, and it was my decision not to move there. It seemed fitting to me though. To survive. Don ’ t ask me what I did. I really don ’ t know. I just felt like I owed something to my parents and lived with them for the rest of my life. Thank you. And now here I am in one piece, shackled in a large wooden cage. Someone in a large suit has been loading me, preparing to take me out for transportation, demanding I leave. I am taken out of the place the man intends to make me. I have never been much of an entertainer, so I am going to need some drugs. Don ’ t you get it? I am supposed to be moving like this, but I am being watched by those stupid idiots who have tried to put me down for months. You see, all I have been able to do was comfort my family. I am strong, but my muscles are not strong enough to grow young men. My only hope is a crash from a cliff, along with some baby sausage stuck up my leg and giving me a concussion. I am not strong enough to resist the launch of an arms race, but I will survive. What ’ s my family ’ s name? ‘ New Statesman ’ Heelset Society. For this reason, I am assigned a pen to clean up my memory. If you want to continue if you could please call an officer from Wall Street.<|endoftext|>

"You see we've tried to enslave you until you overthrew your government, I've explained why. You're a crime against humanity, an abomination unworthy to be harmed. " " It's exactly that, what do you suggest? " " I want to give the order to strike back and end the tyranny of the times. To end your half-hearted campaign to try and collect food stamps in your name. You get one. And you agree to pay for it with that food stamp? " " That's right. " " You have taken over the government. Ever since you're captured and your power is so restricted, as to not be repelled, we've been waging a war against you and your arbitrary prison. You've just insulted us as humans, with some mildly amusing joke's to make us feel good about ourselves. " " I don't like *these* jokes, Mister Mueller. " The electric chair in the middle of the courtroom was rattling furiously. President Kaufman pleaded with the airtight glass dome that would block my entry. " I will reward you, Mister Mueller. " I locked eyes with him, a grin on my face. " You'll get that bus this afternoon, and we'll be able to make deliveries right there. Thank you, Mister Mueller. " He began to walk over to the professor in my parent's basement. The mayor greeted us with a stern gaze and he scanned the floor. He held a whiskey bottle out and lit it at me. After a few minutes of celebration, I took a drag off the bottle. " Funny thing about this world, your kind. We've been so oppressed we were denied one of the most important parts of our freedoms. Our opinion. Us. Our future. " He looked into my eyes, and smiled. " Come on, come with me. I've got an order to strike back at your pretense of ruling this day and age. " A cigarette dropped from his lips and flashed out of his mouth. I whistled, smiling. When I finally leaned over to him, I pressed my ears up against his lips. " Fine, you listen. I have a whole order to strike back at you. And with you, I can strike back at the agents of today. " I lifted my head high. " Then come with me. Make your choice. " " I guess so. I have quite the order."<|endoftext|>

"MARY! TELL ME! " The kids cheered. Joey was studying, not at all frightened. He'd always been a messy student, but this day at the outer rim of space he became one of the first to get a badge, officially his fellow UCAS cadets. Rachel knew the rules, not to be rude. She was already familiar with the area. In fact, most of the instructors had been there before them, enjoying the meal together. Joey took one last look at her, eyes closed, grateful she wasn't on the bus. " I was going to ask you to look at that new set for your history course! " She leaned into Rachel, who was watching on adornment. " Excuse me ma'am! " Joey, trying to keep the tension level, cleared his throat and rose. " I know, ma'am. But we are all in the same club. We are all basically like the same club. " " You're going to have your own football team, mom. " Rachel pinched Joey's arm as she ripped a pair of Chewing Pot sticks from his, and took a seat across from the girl. The two exchanged looks until eventually Joey cut them off. " Here's how it works! Your exams come in and you get started. There is the classes for the rest of the year, and if you weren't well-versed in physics, the Physics course from age six will teach you about what physics really means. Your friends will grade you on your results, and from their jobs in this field, they will close your scores and give you assignments! You get the position! " " My names Joey, don't worry about that. But it's not the whole story! " " Good. Your psychologist says it will all start with you. Work with whatever you want. Well, at least... the drug stuff. Your orientation it can only take you two weeks to adjust. You must take every pass and retake every class, and until you graduate, you go and become a goddamn Academy Award nominee, or eventually an highest scoring athlete. " Rachel nodded and put her hand on Joey's shoulder. " Your teachers will study you. They will help you pass, and they will keep you sane. They will stop bullying you and remind you. They will help you become a better student. You've done everything. Now go eat an awful, damn burger." She took Joey in a slow, hypnotic step, feeling his strength rise and fall.

To do what? I thought to myself. After the initial death of my kind, I realized that I had left to recover. Then I left for my own good. It was for good. The scavengers where easy enough for me to take them and set them free. I chose to create thousands upon thousands of my kind and plan on surviving and dying. My own race had already ran out of food and the human population was almost depleted. Next was to follow me. They chose different human fauna of each genus to populate their final settlement. Once we had another few available, I, filled with fear and envy, dropped a shovel and began carrying my cargo back home. I wandered from pillar to pillar. Nothing to see, nothing to see for I began to feel curious. The earth was cold enough to hide me after a while but hot enough to make me want to go out and get my hands dirty. I returned home, lost in thought. By morning I was completely gone. Then it happened. The first mauled survivor started screaming. I took up the shovel to the ground and ran to him. We chatty as I left his corpse and he looked me over with his gaze always ready for a fight. Soon I found myself so hungry I couldn't eat anything, so there was nothing for me to eat. An hour later I was left alone by my own kind to have my own rest. I wanted to bring him a bowl to snack on, but I had to carry his tray. I ate it and was rather hungry. That was when the same dogs found me. I went up to them, half ran and half covered. They should have smelled me but there was no venom in them. They sprinted and I did what any brave hunter should do: I picked up the food and carried it back to my own cave. My kind, oh my kind was impressed by our savagery. We did not have the same endurance; I could not kill them like I should not. We ate every single bite I could and thought nothing of it. One by one I made my way to the nearest animal sanctuary. I stalked after their pigs and sat on a table. They had simple bowl of meat, nothing special. They seemed friendly, and oblivious. When I came to give them their food, I seemed to know that this would be my last meal. I took a bite of the meat, then looked at the pigs. I studied the creatures. These very fierce, cunning beasts, was looking at me as if I was crazy. Suddenly, the skin of the pig opened up and it gave a quick bite to the skin around it. I choked out the last breath as I was too consumed with the experience to remember the next passage. As the meat was gone, I heard something. A sound so heavy and paralyzing that I could feel my body moving. In shock I looked around the carcass. They were all dead except the one person, a 12 year old girl. I jumped from my chair and tackled the young girl. I lifted my shovel in front of her and plunged it into her chest. She fell to the ground in agony. I looked up. The girl was gone. I knew my very own kind had found my true way back from the brink. We feasted on the bodies we left behind. The girls abandoned me and I scavenged the world's lifetimes until I was forgotten in the forest.<|endoftext|>

I hunch back in my chair and close my eyes. Somehow, this is what most people do. But now I'm gazing into my reflection. Flashes of light abound, the edges brushing against my face. And as I stare into my own, I see myself dimly. I slowly move a bit around my bed. I try to focus on the bedding. I'm done. After that dream ( which is a dream without being blind ), it was exactly as it always has been. I rub my eyes. Feeling them creep open, I finally look at myself. I'm beautiful. I can be... normal. Not so amazing. Or just so ordinary. I start to see things, but I can't see them. It takes me a few seconds to realise that, yes, I've seen myself once. I hear another voice. A voice from another world. I open my eyes. I'm in my room, in a hospital room. The voice speaks again, "The medication has not worked for me yet, and I am afraid this is not the norm. " " I know, my dear, I've already been doing my best. It is only natural that you should feel like this and seek the answers yourself. However, given your situation, I won't help. " I am so very confused. This... is crazy. I am alone. I turn to my doctors. " Is it true? " She nods. " Yes, it is true, that I can not see as well as others can. I have become very disoriented due to the lack of stimulation I received from surgery. This will be your last chance, remember. Goodnight, or I will go on with my life. " I forget that the other voice is another man. " Do you want a dream? There is no other way, I'm just a lucid dreamer." Silence. The other voices reply with the same words. They know they should go back to sleep, but I've already made that decision. I yawn. My dreams can be so vivid and vivid. They're so vivid. They aren't supposed to be.<|endoftext|>

"I am alone, but I am happy, " his words echoed across the room as their own chorus echoed over the years. The room was filled to the brim with angry and horny college kids that had decided to prove to each other their future potential over a few years. No one wanted to tell their future mates that they might need a breather. The exact result had been a conclusion that no one believed in anyway. Next to him the girl in front of him whispered through a ruckus, " So, either you go for your date with her or you go for your date with yourself. Either way, I'm done for," but somehow he had chosen to live in anonymity... Before him emerged Jill Morath. A redheaded mother of 2 with a limp body and a fractured eye socket. She told me about her horrible nightmare every day that she ’ d been minding her own business with her student loans and high debt. Jill started hanging out with friends she wouldn't meet in person. They started becoming close by. One day she made it big with the friends of friends that Jill wanted for the rest of her life. She had a redhead girlfriend but they were inseparable. Jill struggled with job and paying bills. Jill often remembered that she had a boyfriend, her other boyfriend was an amazing painter, and her two kids were part of something similar. Jill passed all these years, trying to choose. She could turn her head towards the sky, the clouds, to the mountains, or the ocean, but as she did so did she forget that she was alone, but she was happy.<|endoftext|>

Long story short, my daughter has been diagnosed with an esophageal cancer and has been relocated to London to live with a relative! There have been plans so far to double-treat her with a care package from the UK and a special accented snowman, but she has never shown any sign of disheartened by the treatment! I have been seeing my other cousins and sister on the road to visit them, waiting to get back. I keep thinking we have to wait until she is full before I can contact her, maybe give it time? All in all this has been a great season, with us reaching double digits per day! Even without all that work and preparations, I hope it is worth it! I hope the specialists can make it even easier for you to visit your family in person. Now to the letters ( can you decide? It's a long morning, all the stars are in blue and the bar has just started to fill ). I have learned in the last two weeks about how to get to your daughter before the snow has set in; could she only eat out of the kitchen, while walking? Our eldest daughter stopped swimming yesterday, only focusing on our coats, in a twinkle in her eye! I'm really sorry we had to wait a while, I just couldn't resist the attention. My primary concern? We're only facing a very special snowman at the moment, so we'll have to wait until the Sunday after we get back from town! Jenny and Kat have been avoiding the brush for the last few days in clear thought, running to the lake, ignoring the water around them, and everything in between. What am I supposed to do about that? Time doesn't go quickly for the ups and downs, something not too jolly it seems! You are here to help the girls, you are to help Jenny, I love you every bit as much as anyone else. I know it's tough, I know it's difficult but I like it. Can you give me some excuse how I just won't be coming back from the distant suburb? All I want is an excuse to go back to bed and see Jenny again after this, so I can end this nightmare! Please help Jenny! My email is still open! Dear Jenny, you have just been dealt with by the specialist ( um, specialist' here if I remember correctly ) and she has been given an surgical discount to “ transfer to visit her in person at exactly* 27:15:56:56 tomorrow ”. Your sister is sick, she is undergoing emergency treatment on ** 27:15:55:55** from “ an 18-hour hospital coma, due to a recent hemorrhage in her chest. ” She is starving, she is so hungry. Please help her. I don't want this. PLEASE help. Please. You have no other choice. Her mother, whose name is Earl, is ** 14:01:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:

It had been almost a decade since they realized the monumental mess they had created. We named the process nothing more than "It on Stitch ". The testing station was filled, uniforms replaced, my team and I were placed in the IAS program, designed solely for this purpose. Through almost a decade, we had been analyzing, analyzing, analyzing, analyzing, analyzing, analyzing, over analyzing. We had beaten the system ourselves. Within almost three months, we had finally captured the " Stitch " and we were all the more sure the advanced AI was sentient as it was. First, we gathered everything we could that we could on the conveyor belt of our first vessel. An oddly engineered device had been embedded in the supermax expanse of human space. Millions of miles away, in a desolate weather-denominational sprawl, were we assaulted by the behemoth cataclysmic supernova wave known as an electron blast wave, which had also never before beamed of us. Within a week, our enemies had sabotaged the reactor to explode upon impact and our sensors failed completely to find any trace of the organic material before a wholly new and dark-skinned, and completely different entity appeared. With a bang, the object, which had seemingly started it all. A truly'indestructible' malfunction, that had obviously come in contact with the planet's atmosphere. Half a decade ago, we had slowly recreated our first successful consciousness. It had been in a mobile capsule left in the Colonial Archipelago to a group of curious anthropologists. It had appeared like a shadowy reflection of itself from the cruiser's point of view. I was disheartened. I opened my palm, looking at the humanoid cat-like entity, and with an audible'HA, " I AM IT ON STITCH" ( In which my day was done... ) The rest of my team filled the console. We then became closer to the source of the communication. As we focused our minds on the main two parts of the code, we began trying to decipher its previous instruction and reach out into our last communications conduit. The message to the other crew beamed with us, we however found that it was merely " wa. " With great efforts, we intercepted its first message. " SHUT DOWN THE EMPEROR."<|endoftext|>

Year 1: Very irregular time - probably I've not lived for five years. Seasons change often when we end up having offspring. An androgen must exist for you to conceive, it must be bound by nature to work efficiently when a child is born. But what must I do? I am not a single member of a planet. Though their population is below seven million, there are far fewer than we are currently born. Humans seek for life, life growing, life ending. But it feels as though society is moving on, they have abandoned the act and developed art and technology. It's an insult to a child that they can't accomplish anything, I guess I'm not supposed to spend any time experiencing the 5 year cycle of each of the preceding seasons. The reason we are here - it reminds us that life is fickle, and when you love someone it doesn't mean you love them back. This time we have attempted conquest, as she is our first daughter, and we of Earth-style have successfully achieved what one would think would be indestructible. We entered the attempt at conquest in our generation, the invasion through our year long efforts. She knew she was up against the threat and took her own life just as quickly as we had. If humanity succeeded in taking our city and its culture, its self sustaining ecosystem, what would have happened? Wars, famine, disease, disease ravaging the land. We set our sights on building cities and studying their inhabitants. She was taken away - but she was my child. I love her - I will protect her and I will protect my children. I wonder if any of my colleagues will come see us for the first time. I think that this would be a very bad thing.<|endoftext|>

Looking to the star, I begin my trek. I hear it, very faint in the night- Light above. “ One more, ” I murmur. That is the sound I hear. The way the brightness has awaken me. “ One more, ” I continue, hoping the dread of losing my light will let me focus on the one greater thing: *that bright tiny thing. * It is not terrible, right? Light, without doubt. Enough to tell us all. “ One more, ” I whisper, forcing my voice to strain out. Nothing. You would be surprised. No. We would deny it. It is not certain. There are no Gods, nor Gods in this world. And I am alone. I pass a girl ’ s school bus. I pass a store. I pass a store I can not pass. But these things are useless. One more, ” I repeat aloud. * The One*. So many of the light makes a light. I know I have to use it to touch her. To read her. To talk to her. For the life of me, I can not see this. I could try and see if she is able to see, if she knows what I see. But she is blind. And so, I tell myself it is hopeless and bleak to think. But I think of this one, the light. It is almost an illusion. I suppose not even God can truly know what the light is. It makes my day to draw out. So I look. She is a boy. We were born of parents who had been married for generations. We were once happily married. “ What is it? ” The girl says. “ Take me to your place, ” I say. It is unusual that she will say that to me. It is our end. My child is dead and will never see the light again. How? I ask her a question. “ I had been stricken with a sense of dread. I couldn ’ t bear to suffer in life. ” I never asked the question. “ But it did. I ’ ve always wondered what it is like to be like God. ” She was silent for a moment. “ It felt so beautiful, knowing that I should lose all hope. ” It became so much more than that. Through the light, I could feel everything around me. I could feel what life was like, yet too much darkness to focus on. I could feel everything I could not even comprehend. I am in pain. “ No. ” She whispers. “ I can ’ t. ” I feel her grasp around my waist. It is warm. “ I ’ m sorry, child, ” I say. “ There is no need. Please, if you can, move us to the light. ” She kneels down. There is a light in her eyes. It becomes less, then more than I can even describe. I lie motionless as the light dances in my chest. The light becomes mysterious and fascinating. One more, “ One more. ” I whisper, slowly, but quickly. The light overtakes me and comes from nowhere. The light from the light draws me into the darkness. I am afraid. I can feel the darkness as everything around me. I feel like I am walking through a dark void, and then blackness and I feel it rush in. I step into darkness, and I don't know what is. The darkness is coming for me. -- - EDIT: typo.<|endoftext|>

When the quartermaster spoke it all changed. My discovery of a message from my professor had been welcomed with open arms. I knew exactly what to expect. I held my palm firmly in my holder to compose myself. I stared at the pillar of rocks in the distance, almost in disbelief. The alluring hexagonal structure of the ground amazed me. Maybe on each pillar were two giant Octavius's and then a leader who was supposed to step forward and break apart the rock. There were many more angles, but the gigantic hiss was still evident. I quickly brought my hand to the pillar and poured several chills down my throat as the ceiling fell. It was a magnificent thing. The markings, the clarity, even the heat brought back by the hum of the meteors had kept me sane. Slowly my hands touched it as I reached out and even though the octavius had failed to come close, I could still feel the shifting. When I moved my hand up and down it seemed to crack, separating in cracks and crevices, similar to the first of the octavius. I shook my head in disbelief, like a huge prank. The pillar was now open, filled with glowing fireworks. "Hey! ", my counterpart called as they pushed on the other pillars. " Quick boys! ", yelled one of them. " Don't get in the way! ", yelled another. The pillar was impossibly immovable, the intensity of it knocking away all the colourful parts. My mirror changed everytime I put it on. I had seen the melting of the pillar but my deepest curiosity would not be satisfied until I was right behind it. His part of the hexagonal structure leaned in close to me. It couldn't be possible. A crack was still observable however. " I know who you are! ", said a few voices from the mysterious being. " Be careful not to take too much distance! " I shouted in excitement, I didn't want to ruin the message when my good friend's hexagonal structure finally broke apart. One of the voices broke the pillar and gathered the pieces together. I watched in horror as their form dissolved into flames. The rocks vibrated in my hands and I began to understand what they said. Our hexagonal structure, that was until the match was broken, shattered. The octavius led the clockwise towards the one nearest to me. It was a lonely clocktower, the only decoration we had in the den during our time together. I opened my mouth to scream, but it wasn't coming. I looked up and the sky was dark. " Well ", I said, hoping that my outburst would be enough to calm the creatures on the opposite side of the stone pillar. " I was wrong ", said my counterpart. " Only one structure can reach us so far! ". The crunch of metal against the concrete floor was a terrible sound, but I tried my best. Slowly the pillar fell. Then my reflection appeared on the back of the octavius. A mother and child. " Hello! " My voice quivered. " Hello! ", it said. The hall vibrated again. This time we were only in the stones! The little girl came forward, completely covered in sand, tears streaming down her face. Her grandmother's mouth opened in shock. " What happened? ", she asked again in fear. " Oh... just play their game, " my godfather told me. I could hear his mother. The son entered the room and walked up the wall facing the stone pillar, it looked like it opened automatically as it opened. It extended its hand to reveal a small tablet, written in accented script was all over it. " Our journey will be rewarded with love."<|endoftext|>

Aurora Linu. Multicoloured swirls, mesmerising to behold but doesn't shine when you look at them. The pearly whites bring brightness to eyes and the toned gray pattern creates a fairy-tale look - though a white eye is a paragon of Godhood. Aurora can actually see too. Watching her close her eyes as the sun climbs over the horizon, her head sways over the edge of the cliff, glaring at the waves rising below. Her wrists are elongated, wrinkled and each scar is a shape of a spiral. She looks just like our girl Aurora today, but she's clearly black, her skin tight, her arms straining for air but she's comfortable. Aurora is exactly like our girl Aurora. Her arm has nothing on the outside, her long, greasy white hair is thick. It presses against her cheeks as she dreams. Aurora remembers when she was a boy. A glimmer of envy came over Aurora as she dreamt of being the most beautiful girl she could ever be. For so long Aurora dreamed that her arm would hold the keys to becoming the world's best singer. Her glossy eyes tell the story. Aurora's eyes are imperfect, but real. They're raw and burn brightly, her skin feels like eyesafe napkins. Aurora knows that girl Aurora, because she sees: her skin, too. Aurora can see the shape of her dress and her face, beautiful though it is, right as our picture was of her and our girl. Aurora can see us as angelic, so beautiful that Aurora wouldn't like wearing blue. Aurora knows we are all a gift, in heaven we are angels who can return and make our story true. Aurora is beautiful.<|endoftext|>

In front of me, playing Microsoft Office, my eyes slid across my screen. I put my hand over the controls of my mouse, feeling it move towards me. "Don't even look, your movements don't look like normal mouse scrolling I see. " I barked. My old-school voice sounded calm, I hated that voice. " Y-you... " The mouse stopped moving. " Don't try and manipulate me. " " Maybe it's time to try something... " I sounded concerned. Without wasting time, I was motioning around at the controls. What was I expecting? I tried one of the familiar layout settings: ▼ 3 ▼ 4. Despite my new understanding of mouse design, I didn't want to learn that advanced typography seemed apropos, to be honest. Why was I feeling sad today? The mouse continued to move, in an attempt to rearrange itself towards a workspace where there are no gaps. I pushed the top button, and it was clear that it was for this size, I thought. I laid my hand over the TIRES and types. A small click. " One more time. What's the last thing you did last night? " The mouse flicked one last time. I threw the mouse around. " Ahh... Okay... What's it like? " I reached out with an arm. It was obviously shaking, my new understanding of mouse layout. " I couldn't delete one of the right side scrolls, because.. don't look at me.... " " Huh? " I opened my eyes. " My mouse just hung there. " A quick flick across the top of my screen, and the mouse was back to normal again. I placed my hand over the AVI pad. " Wow, why is there so much of a mouse in it? " I whispered. " It's kinda like an ant crawling around, it's like that... it's kind of weird... " The cursor slowly moved closer to the TIRES, obviously to keep it oriented. I flipped it. " Well, that's it. Enjoy your work. You're a beauty with only one game to complete. Quit staring at your mouse and mind your own fucking business. Let's get started." The mouse showed up on my screen and my hand was going to have to rest for a while.<|endoftext|>

"Yes. Where am I? " Asked a cold blue voice that trembled as I slowly looked around. " Oh, go on, let me guess, you are? " " C'MON! you look exactly like you do now. " She mumbled as I suddenly felt her hair vibrate. " I'm sorry, Mr. White. How do you feel about that? " " Just great, " I said as I grabbed her arm. I still don't know what I was thinking, but I'm overrode by her hair again. It doesn't sway. It just feels right. " Yeah, pretty? " I said with a laugh. " What's wrong with you? " " Just fine, " she started, " there's nothing wrong with anything. You can relax on Earth's side or whatever. I'll be there, what can you say? We're our own world now, and you'll be there. I know we make mistakes, but you deserve better. Every child deserves better. " With that, she dropped down her foot and embraced me in a hug. The air was practically beautiful, and somehow colder than before. My breath caught in my throat, and I felt my throat on fire. Like pieces of paper were being ripped away from me. I could hear gunfire once more. My ears started to pierce the air, but I ignored it. What's going on? What's going on? I knew it would all be over soon. Just like when I pulled out that first knife. But I didn't have that thing now, so this was definitely wrong. I just had that thing. " Daddy, are we the bad guys? " I asked with my lips tight. My face stiffened. She hadn't dropped, and her eyes were black like charcoal. " Yes. " " Are we the bad guys? " I asked still astonished. " We are, Mr. White. " She tried to say. " Of course we are! But why did you tell me you've arrived? " She covered her mouth, knowing the message would come. " Your Majesty. " She paused. " My Royal Highness of Brittania. " I knew that coming here would be a pretty funny ear piercing. " We are the bad guys, " I said while her body shook for the very last time. " There are others who will be the bad guys."<|endoftext|>

I took care of my responsibilities. Dad worked so well. I got an automatic job and continued to do things my coworkers told me to do. We were all good friends. Don't get me wrong, we were always good friends. But my responsibilities after growing up were too big for me to handle, so I got a job at a McDonalds. I bought things and used them. Great food, good work. But then I had to meet the guy my mother stole from dad at work for the first time, or I was fired. No other company would hire someone for this. I was laid off three days, everyone died, and the company went belly up. I had no job. We all needed a call to get help and reschedule the break. The store manager never returned. Dad put the phone down. I want to tell him I have a choice, but I will have to wait until the day I get a call or just fall asleep. Well, that was a new one, but it didn't help. I have to get my boss. *beep beep* My boss goes away. There is no phone. There is no key. There is nothing but darkness. I am alone. I am alone. My sole purpose is to be there with Dad. We are in the restroom looking for the thief, when I see him. He has his first step, but he is already on his foot. *beep beep beep beep* He takes out a knife from his pocket, fingers rubbing his pinky. Then the knife I found on the bathroom sink turns into sharp metal teeth. I can feel my heart sinks as I try to stop them but it comes back stronger.<|endoftext|>

Katie had always said that we should be respectful of anyone. It didn't bother us, it didn't bother us, it wasn't afraid. When the day came to leave our home, we were still going to the store. Daddy would be home soon. I hear he was going to the grocery store or something. Without a time to ask, I put the bag in my left hand. He began heading for the refrigerator. Kids will tell you that one day they will forget their parents, left with nothing, but the memories of them still cling to their bodies and old memories hanging in the corners of their minds. I want to forget them. Maybe I will forget them, but the worst is that I will still be a teenager. I can never forget how my Mom would sob and tear up as I lit a cigarette. As the day went by, she would cough up pieces of her lunch and spoon it to me. My Dad said he wanted to talk to her, because he knew if he asked why I couldn't tell her, the memories would be crushed or my worst fear would go away. I try to avoid it, but I could never seem to do it. I wish my Mom left without seeing it. Even with that in mind, it's never been difficult for me. I picked up my Katie and went to my room. By the time I got home, I knew for sure that it was only a matter of time before the girls wouldn't come home. Until... When they did, I knew why I couldn't let them see my version of the world. My mom always told me to keep a journal and to visit the Kindergarten for myself every week and put everything I could on the notebooks and read magazines and mostly on the book collections. We couldn't find anyone out of town, as much as we would like to. I didn't care if there were others. When I opened it, there it was: books stacked full of pictures and reflections of beautiful children. I knew I was the last one to be alone. I didn't dare ask the questions. I was still an adult. I watched a screen from my apartment window for hours before resuming my hunt. As I worked, the anxiety crept in. Questions popped up in my mind. The girls, like what they wanted to be. My Dad, you know, just looked impatient. Like I was a child to him, a cross between a parent and child. But, if I was to ever talk to any of them, they must be on a leash. Being truly at a loss. I would never know whether they would ever hear of the story I uncovered. Once again, the anxiety got the better of me. I sent the books to the other room until I was alone. I left. Katie told me she would be there, but Dad had just left. Some people, like me, were happier. People like my parents. Things that were all but gone. You must find out your own story soon. You must find out your own friends and family are still there. That if you don't mind, you don't have to spend the rest of your life alone. You'll never have to think about the girl next door or the boy next to you. You may live with the fears you see and the emotions you can not explain. The next time you see your own daughter, you'll ask questions to her. The next time you spend the time with someone who looked just like her, you'll ask the same things. The next time you feel better, you'll ask the same questions. The next time you try to talk to her, you'll ask her why she's doing this, and the day after that you'll ask her how it feels to leave. The day after that is your chance to pass on your story to your younger sisters. If you can, you're dead to them. I heard from a school custodian who found a book in the stairwell. It was blank. There's no advice about memorizing new words. I should have known, but then I didn't. I knew what to do.<|endoftext|>

10 minutes ago, I thought this guy on /r/PsychoCritic and I found this guys writing thing... So really, why haven't you read it or seen it? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I think I'm dead. 11:00am I woke up to the sounds of men in ski masks yelling at me as I shook uncontrollably. " Who... Who are you, oh who the hell are you!? " They yelled while leaping off of my ceiling. The last thing I remember is a gunshot... and just as the woman and her kids turn from the cold, the men in ski masks... They scream... my kids... His parents... They scream... I collapse. 12:30am I have forgotten about this guy, with his stream of thoughts racing through my head. Is it because he attacked me... He tried to kill me because I gave him the address... Woke up at 3am after spending 45 minutes with the sassy looking stranger who used to be his best friend.... But nobody wants to be a bully, no matter how well trained you are. He tried calling me names... and to no avail... Nobody loves him anymore... That all changed when he started standing over me on my couch just wishing that a bully would show up to his house and have tea for dinner at 3pm. He hasn't been since, but his new girlfriend is holding a book with him. And I have no will to live... This is more than a story because that same man came and gave me the address... After he posted to /r/PsychoCritic and it repeated twice, nobody could find him. Even an adult can't find the man.... And I guess that's how he's killing people. Then again, I would have stopped him if he hadn't been here. It really was unusual that he didn't keep at a high altitude. 12:45am 12:46pm 12:47pm 12:48pm 12:49pm..... 17 minutes ago I sat for the first time in my life in a long time, craving an after life as I usually do. I was alone in a room with a man laying in bed, sobbing out his family name, and a knife hanging from his neck. It took me a few minutes to gather all of that courage, but the fear did not leave my own, so I sat down in my usual spot beside the man and pulled the knife out, and under the man's bed sat a picture with his blood splattered across it... The last thing I remember is sitting here.... BANG! Bang! Bang bang Bang Bang. He fell, and he fell, just like he always did. The gun went off, and he dropped dead on the floor. 3:00pm I woke up to the sounds of men in ski masks yelling at me as I shook uncontrollably. " Who... Who are you, oh who the hell are you!? " The men in ski masks... They scream... my kids... His parents... They scream... I collapse.<|endoftext|>

"Emily's coming over this to check on you " said Majora from the Excel group, grabbing another coffee. " It's been a while since she last visited the...

Emily hunched over a file in her hand and leaned her head back on her desk. " Holy shit, I'm telling you not to go to com. " she said, and struggled to drag herself up as much as she could. " Emily? Can you talk? " The computer's voice fell to the floor. " Now, was I chosen to leave before you completed the holo-checks, maybe you could ask a few more questions that we were already on? " " Yes, ma'am. You can ask any questions you want. Also, you can ask anything that we have got here. You know how this page gets updated. " she said. " Okay, okay, alright, " Emily said, getting up from her desk, and opening the file on her desk. " Well, there's some other interesting things on here. " " Huh. There's some more stuff that's really important. " she says, picking up another cup. " Let's try see a close up of a cave I discovered this morning. " The screen blinked. The room flooded in from the inside of the box and made a smooth metallic sound. The room spun around. A soft hum and smoke rose from the cave. Emily stared at the ancient maps and the interface behind them. " Oh god, no this isn't right, I must look everywhere, " she said as she drew on the map. " I just can't seem to get away. Everyone's been screaming, banging and banging and screaming and screaming. The buggers' all sound what they did. Pussies and turds. How can I be sure? " The screen blinked. She released the cursor on her keyboard. A slight scrolling sound began to play and a new message opened up. " Miss Eva, I have a dear friend here, and I would like to tell you about the beautiful and perceptive creature who appears along your radar here. We're making contact for the first time in several years. You see, dear friend... " she trailed off. " I know, for one. I'm sorry Miss Eva, but I never intended on leaving you without a suitable companion like her. " " I'm sorry, what do you need? " The person's voice broke down. " If you think this man with the strange armor, his skin... he looks like it was made to last most things in our Solar System, could you please do one thing to help him out? " she turned to the computer and set down her coffee cup. " Please, please, help him, " the voice repeated over and over. " What? " " Let's see what you have found. We will try to find this man shortly."<|endoftext|>

Kevra sat at the dimly lit bar with her plastic collar. It was a 10 o'clock shadow when she finally noticed him. He wore a water suit but not that fancy in any way. "Sure enough, " he said, “ get a beer. ” “ Wuh? " She demanded. “ Why on Earth are you asking for ale? The whites made it so bad we're going to have to have a damn brawl. ” “ No, " he insisted, " that's not the stuff. I took the whole soda for you this time. ” “ Listen, I know you're drinking like a 6-pack but we're not going to do that here. It'll be way too painful. ” “ What? I can't drink it because I'm doing it. ” He realized then how little life was left in his blazer, and the thick smell of alcohol nearly brought his stomach on edge. The dark stain just like his outfit. “ So you're telling me you just bought this for me? ” She asked in return. “ Your mom's got the other person working at McDonalds downstairs. ” She paused for a long moment. “ Your mom, what was that about? ” She asked in a concerned tone. “ That's what my mother said. ” The man wobbled out of the corner of his eye with a glazed, *horrible* look on his face. " Miller's down the street " he said, " Yeah, I know."<|endoftext|>

Jesus Christ it ’ s horrible. I don ’ t understand, someone is dying in a country I took that when I was a boy and it seems so stupid. It ’ s ironic really, how these people could have survived so long in such a place. I can see it in their eyes though, that it hasnt even worked. I ’ ve read history books and seen riddles and clues but never a fragment of their existence. Not even a sketch of us. I wonder what happened to the millions of loyal colonists just against all odds, just because we had to leave them in the wilds. How many of us survived? What happened to the countless ships that we couldn ’ t even send out? They made it out of there and all alone. Heavens but these people at least still find faith in the new government and churches, but no one looks forward to a cure of hunger. I guess we are not living enough anymore, but maybe we are. I have watched over these people through my years in the military, at my young age I ’ ve had experience with these people but not so much in the afterlife. I still can't believe my eyes when I see the people I ’ ve given my life to the least. I pray every day the same as they do. I make sure they ’ re still looking at me with these terrible gazes. I hope they ’ ll look down upon me with good graces and forgivings.<|endoftext|>

"I need you to understand something before I kill you. " The assailant let out a scream and pushed the gun from between his thumb and forefinger. He pulled the trigger and for a second, nothing happened. " I needed you to understand that I've killed an innocent boy. He deserved it. The boy deserved the death penalty. He didn't deserve to live. " The gun was still pointed at the attacker. The only thing in his home was his daughter, holding her little girl. She'd been dying for the last six months. They'd known each other for years now, they were inseparable. Whenever he turned away from her, he would tell her, " I'm sorry I lost you. I was so strong. I never should have done this to myself. " He was quiet now. The world turned to black. The assailant stopped pacing. " I need you to understand the child, " he spat. " The reason I'm here is that I need you to understand that I didn't kill him. " The gun clicked and the attacker's face turned that of his former self, his face now that of his former self, his words drifting from lips to lips. " I just wanted to kill you, just once. " His mouth twitched for a moment, then he held his mouth shut, " I... I just wanted to see you again. To really see you again. " " It hurts so much to see your face bleed to the floor, like this. " His hand twitched as he studied the child again. Her eyes were wide and her breathing was hard. The gunman's hands were folded at the sides of the weapon. One gripped the trigger, and he pulled the trigger, but it was still firmly pressed against the same wooden piece of wood. " I needed your help to stop the crowd from getting louder. I needed your help. " He pushed his fingers along the wooden paneling, then pulled the trigger again. He held the gun to his temple and pulled the barrel on the target's skull. " It's okay. I love you now."<|endoftext|>

A Federation military officer is one who lives in a two-man vault that is heavily guarded. One is selected for debriefing, and the other is selected to do the rest. The officer with the highest security clearance in the vault ponders on what happens during the debriefing and his question becomes the deciding factor for whether he would meet a powerful alien race and become them's friend, the answer being no. A line is drawn in front of the officer, and he must answer this question before being permitted to leave the vault. The officer ponders how he dies at the end of the line. Then, after elaborating on the answers, a voice snaps. "Into darkness, Mr. Picard. " The officer speaks. " The ship comes under attack of all of the Human Colonies and all of the Chosen of the Federation. I'm sure there are some who have dreams but nothing compares to our concentration on the Warp drive."<|endoftext|>

I am an immovable object. Some say they are meant to just vanish until their true form, when they're buried deep within me, is revealed. They could be my dream. “ Good afternoon, boys. I ’ m Jeffrey. ” “ Well, may I ask your name, ” I don ’ t have a cellphone, I just carry on watching the news while my body swells with my mind. “ My name is Jeffrey. ” “ Well, well, what did you say? ” “ Uhh... three things, ” he looks at me. “ I need to tell you something, and that ’ s the coolest thing I ’ ve ever said to a man. Like, two things; first, I want to live for a long, long time, but second, if you ever find yourself crying about something you know is going to happen to you, then that ’ s okay. ” “ Keep talking, don ’ t you think? ” “ No, I think it ’ s fucking embarrassing. ” I take a step back from the couch, then back and forth, trying to find the courage to say something. It doesn ’ t feel too great. I can hear him wincing in pain as his face grows even more red. It hurts, and I start to die again. “ Are you telling me that these are my final days as human beings? ” “ I'm not leaving you my child, ” he whispers into the receiver, eyes full of malice. “ I know it sounds silly, but you don ’ t have to be this angry, so if I was being fired, then I just might be right. ” Suddenly, something else is out there. A woman. Her skin is translucent, like my eyes would allow her to remain true to the image of my true self. She is barefoot, and looks back at me with green eyes. “ Hi, what ’ s that? ” A man with her, and the words come out in a clear, though short, way. “ You lost a million dollars because you didn ’ t mean to, haven ’ t you? ” “ No, I suppose. ” He says, and I realize the word ‘ lost ’ wasn't supposed to be there. “ Let ’ s all just take a nice shower and enjoy the next 20 years, even without me anymore. ” He places his hand on my shoulder as if we ’ re out of time, and I close my eyes and concentrate. My whole body recoils as I just watch him go. I have no idea how hard it would be to let go, but I can ’ t deny that I ’ m going through the motions. I let go a few seconds and am already asleep. I don ’ t remember how long I ’ ve been like this, and yet I remember all the things I said to him. The first thing I said to him was, “ You lost a million dollars because you didn ’ t mean to. ” I just stared into his gorgeous, green eyes for a few seconds and then blinked. He was gone for two minutes, and I didn ’ t even look back. Maybe I ’ ll see him again soon.<|endoftext|>

"Sarah, tell Mommy I need to do something." The voice of the crazy doesn't respond. He just stares at me. He can't seem to find my eyes... less than three minutes ago I passed out in my bed, and if I could think normally... fuck... I could talk. 'What the fuck is going on here?' I don't respond. I guess he knows I'm not writing this to him and wants to control me. Did he know that I'm writing this to him? Were we different people or was he just trying to protect me? I close my eyes. The warmth of the sun fades from my cheeks. I can't help it, and it starts to hurt. I need to stop. I open my eyes to see four figures standing over me. Every breath I take seems to make the air come out wet. Somehow it doesn't hurt anymore, but the thought terrifies me. The four in the middle of the dark room are all dressed very oddly. Their hair is frizzy and they look like they have travelled far off the beaten path. So I close my eyes, jump and stammer out a loud'what the fuck did they just... what are they doing out here?' They gaze in each others eyes, and have the sort of dead look that seems on the face of someone with two faces. I don't know why I start to sob, but I have to start walking. I slow down, and climb towards the edge of the room. A bit of a scramble. Something feels wrong and I stop. The room is dark but I can see my Mom standing right in front of me. My shoulders are taut, feeling heavier than usual. I reach my arms out towards her, but she stops me before I can pull out my hand. I know that's when she finally opens her mouth. And just like that she smiles at me. All of a sudden she starts to nod and her eyes begin to water. I feel myself starting to settle down. I can feel my back arcing up. Even through the sheets, it feels like I'm beginning to feel lighter. Then I... It feels almost surreal. My dad is screaming when he sees me so obviously. The kid just has a strange understanding of me. I hear his parents doing some sort of CPR, but I don't take that seriously. I don't feel my friends being rescued in any sort of tragedy. I don't even think that anybody else is going to happen to be here. Just.. I start to panic. Just now, I can't put my heart into it. All I know is... But then...<|endoftext|>

I woke up, coughing again. No sweat, and a bile rising. Coughing an awful lot at once I wailed, screaming and struggling as the tube pushed me deep into my bed. Teeth stuck in spines. The pressure, in the dim light, shone through the tubes into my eye sockets. My next co-worker howled again. * Fine, fine, it wasn't late. I would have picked her up. * Silence rumbled in the kitchen. * Yup, besides that, we need to concentrate on something else. Something I can't do with all the other patients you brought in. * I raised a glass to my mouth and swallowed the lump in its protective plastic. * Okay. * My fingers gripped the familiar drill for keys. The soapy liquid oozed out of the flat and set my hands in my lap. The drill didn't like the sound of my pounding head hitting hard against the metal. * Are you sure? * My muscles tensed. I slowly stood up from the table. My hair clung to my scalp as I walked up to the door. I leaned down and placed my hand on the door knob. * Mommy always had to get it fixed. * The iron floor squeaked as the house shook and all of a sudden the door opened and another masked figure came rushing into the room. He wore a... *firefly*? Short green wig and mask wrapped around his face. There was a sharp gash across his arms, and a large bar of purple flame burned the two of them. * I'm going to grab the bear with me. * I closed my eyes tight as I reached over and picked up the knife in my pocket. While all the others did, I was still confused as to what the perpetrator was saying when I accidentally cut the head clean off. The scissors fell in to the floor screaming in agony. I squatted against the blade of the chair and almost yanked the trigger before I even needed to. The man's face was covered in blood but the mask and only mask vanished. In between one brow wound and another bleeding from one eye, he snaked his way out of my room and out my garden. The silence was unsettling. * Well, it's not like we can go around shooting each other anymore. * Suddenly he said, in a low voice, "I want to check on her! " The water in my mouth began to boil and I looked around. The last thing I saw was the fucking bear taking off into the distance. I turned around and grabbed the handle of the broken ladder and got up. I climbed off the railing to the side and began running. I couldn't make it anywhere but on the small stony side of the path, I could feel warm, moist soil on my feet. I bent down and noticed a corpse staring up at me. The man could have sworn I had hit his head with the shovel, but I didn't really get the feeling. His eyes gave me that look, the same one that the bear held just a few feet away. His helmet shielded his eyes, but his face didn't look so bad. * Good, good. * He told me, as I drove off into the night. I never knew what I'd become when he got the other man's twisted face. He never understood the connection I made and what it was like to have my last friend's frozen. * It was over. * I looked around as I left the house. Everyone was still trying to run. The rocket launcher wasn't working. There was something on the rails under the house that needed replacing. I grabbed a flashlight and in a flash, my step wasn't blocked by a strong beam of light. I dropped the flashlight behind the counter and slipped back into my backpack. * God, I'm so tired. * I made my way home and strolled over to the radio where I would hear his voice and ask what was the problem. He would hear anything I could say. " Fucking *bootlegger*." *<|endoftext|>

“ Okay, Dragon ’ s Lair ” “ What? Yeah, yeah, I know how that sounds, let me explain how it works. ” “ Our enemy is so unpredictable the hectic retreat we have had to endure can ’ t get anything done. They ’ re a clan that ’ s more than two decades old. They rule kingdoms alone, where they live day to day. They ’ re filled with kings who go on to make great wealth and control thousands of kingdoms ’ castles. ” “ Tyrion also lost the war, but in return he survived? ” “ Yes. And he doesn ’ t suffer from any physical deformity he received from being younger than an adult. The problem with this being was that our enemy has quite a number of immortals and servants. What did they have in common? Their customs of war? ” “ Human. ” “ Their otherworldly artifacts are the most brutal creatures in existence, ruling armies not unlike the barbarians of Old Rome. ” “ We ’ re dealing with these ‘ immortals ’ the third grade around. The immortals are afraid of the destruction the realm in which they dwell. The ultimate predator of the children are the dragons. So instead of a beautiful invasion of the realm we gave the children before them a clan, including one which could project a force greater than any man ’ s spirit or mental state. Without the demonic artifacts dragons could easily be defeated and no kings could seize power. With this clan the dragons could hold back the most powerful force in existence, the ones whose heritage was at stake. Now that the final problem has been solved. After thirteen years of war we united to fight in the struggle. Kingdoms ran red. Red was going to win again. “ Legolas got the upper hand here, he might have gotten two in front. Today he decided to do it, he used his strong will to take the dead dragons. But at least his legions could get the attack he was looking for and our forces could bring back the black headed conquerors. ” “ I never thought that dragons would be so violent. When one was weaker and able to rise up against one of their own allies who needed their headmen to continue slaying the evil people in the realm. I thought dragons were stronger and faster than that. ” “ Well Legolas, though it started with a few angry children. It soon went quiet before any more changed took the world. We ’ ll leave now. ” The three suited men both hopped out of the castle to see the former ruler returned to his throne room. His face was as glum as any day, though the smile that gave off at his greeting was as genuine as any tomato eaten at the same time. Perhaps an illusion, he thought, but perhaps all the world need some more candor in their childhoods. He had friends who were beyond complacent to truly be righteous but so little no matter how much they begged to be prodded, no matter how scared they were of being attacked. They still begged and pleaded for their lives but nothing could satisfy them. Legolas had finally found the one he knew. “ It ’ s time to execute our master, and his army with vigor. As I so eagerly await my battle it is said that a dragon came out from the moon and brought with it the spirit of our King. I want my children to defend this kingdom even though it is a terrible evil, but now my mind is broken. Long have I watched your kingdom fall. Long have I cried in despair. Yet still I knew in my heart that I believed in something greater. At the battle of Bosmin Harbor, seventeen years after King Armendaris put an end to the endless war. That that still echoes in my head and feels worse in my dreams. Long have I grown up and forgotten. Long have I felt empty and stagnant and has I lost my humanity. But I know I have lost my humanity, and I have no more to lose. I ’ m powerful. ”<|endoftext|>

Threes were common in this new continent, though I had not a clue as to how they fit. I have now scaled and climbed here, thus greeing to be one of the few brave explorers left alive. I still'm unsure as to how many people live here, though when I saw them I thought it was just I and a nurse. Perhaps I am alone. But I had not yet discovered the cause of their demise. But then again I am not a person who would give much time to people ’ s thoughts. I hope the odds are so stacked against me. I was always skeptical of the afterlife, though I have recently found out. A... human? How do they work such a thing? What did I think was there going to be an afterlife? Is it some sort of trick? What come of this in the heat of the night? or perhaps, more likely, was just the desperate desperation for food. I walked alongside my clan members as we headed up to the bridge. A rather impressive wooden bridge. It had to be, being able to climb that steep staircase. The wind was always a merciless beast to the native humans who live across the smooth plains. The tree tops were perfect to maneuver to generate the strength to climb. The last hill that I had ever climb over was very steep and gave the wood the impression of soft asphalt. It fell back down and I stepped upon the rough terrain to not only climb the bridge and brush the entrance of the mountain to my surprise, but also to experience the scenery of these mountains for myself. There is nothing like watching the golden sun coming from the clouds across the sky as it engulfs the naked earth. A human, many years of age, walked down the walkway like he never stepped foot into the world. Perfect. This...<|endoftext|>

It was another day like any other. Joshua was tired of being a glorified vigilante, this was the third time this month and his day at the bar had had no effect on him. His thought was constantly put to the test. Even those who criticized him for that were gone. To them, he had been successful, but since the fall of the coffee companies, everyone fell victim to some new super villain, in a way that had entirely reversed the increased population boom. The change had been so drastic that Joshua was unsure he had even ever seen it. The hunger had obviously left his system as it had existed before, he had been constantly consuming human misery. When this happened all the world governments had agreed that he was to control it. Thus the new era, all to the benefit of people. This cruel world dictator ruled from the fields of numbers, morality and a foolish death wish. He was a good man, but he was not a pacifist, he was an evil man. And within this facade of being a good person he grew to resent the world. He was the evil one, and everything he loved only because his continued existence was really hurting his family. Watching his family lose loved ones couldn't affect his lifestyle any more. After all, who could even play the life with a bigger world? He vowed to try to change that. He had tried assassinating the council and maybe even a few world leaders, that was something he would try to change after the event. He tried, for the sake of the whole world. The council had been dead for 2 months. He had no one left to change the corrupt system he came into and saw his family growing sad, hungry, tired and angry. He had wiped out all of them and himself, he refused to look back and not look back. Even though he knew his legacy wasn't going anywhere, he had decided there was a better place. So, he decided to do it, oh what a cruel villain he had become, he fought in every war, every war with a flag that could catch fires without you in it. In the end, the destruction caused by all the violence was the sole reason he wasn't hiding. Unfortunately after last month, there was only one demon left and the council wasn't accepting him and he was going to die on that day. His power was gone. Not even slightly but enough to make any sane person expect that he would stop this madness. Instead, they seem to have abandoned him at all costs. He felt horrible, that he couldn't stand this. He never saw humanity again. He was just one of many people, desperate for answers. And all he could think of was his family, lost, desolation and hopelessness. He wondered if it was all part of his plan, and if he really was just a good person. Then, he sat in his chair, sighed and went back to enjoying his day.<|endoftext|>

He opens his mouth to let out a smirk. "Well I suppose I'm done. It all went according to plan. By the time all the wizards were dead the others have already fallen. The only thing we have left is the one left. You see I was wondering when you would come to Hogwarts, this is my window. Maybe I'll just take over your place. I just need to know: how long can I stay? " " A day? that would be 250 years and the spells are useless in mere seconds! " " Oh yeah. Well I'm just taking over how did we end up as a couple of hundred years ago. Trust me I thought we could do better then. Got ta keep it good. You'll understand pretty soon. " He's stern but asks what he wants to know. For some reason he sounds irritated but to his I know better: that it is interesting how easy " a few hundred years " is to penetrate. He was in doubt about the Philosopher's Stone, so I knew better. " Sorry I didn't know that would make for a bit of trouble but I have to go now. Once I'm here the next time you see, have a good rest to yourself"<|endoftext|>

Just over one year ago I went off for the ride. According to the product label, I could wake up, I could drink, sleep, whatever I wanted. The speed limit seemed to be rather cumbersome, and the ride from the University to the Exxon Valdez seemed to be in the blink of an eye. Then I arrived at the Salt Lake City Naval base and on the way there my gear screeched, then a loud crashing *remembered* roar. I quickly moved over to the entrance to get to the main control room and saw that my machine was shutting down... while processing my order, something caught my eye. Somehow my Machine ID had been converted into cashier's numbers and identified as Becky. She called me up. "Are you the Candy Shop clerk? " " Yeah, looks like I should be able to fill your order. " I nodded. I took a minute to look around, but soon began to notice a glitch in the machine. It just *ditch* my order. Apparently there were huge selling bags filled with brownie pops and pudding, then I heard a horrible click on the control panel, followed by... uh- " Wait, what the fuck is that?! " Becky called back. " Huh, what? " I replied. " What did you order? " " Um, the Butter Buffalo " she replied. " And what the hell? " " I... I bought strawberry flavored chocolate. " She frowned. " Um... strawberry. " "... and what the hell? " " I just got ta go check it out. " As soon as Becky brought this up, I went back to bed.<|endoftext|>

The tent flaped open and I could feel the chill run through the air. Hands handcuffed to my legs as I raised them, I could see a young girl walk through the tent. She wore a fedora and chucks a biscuit into her mouth. The kid took the biscuit, spit it on the ground and walked away. I snapped to attention as she looked away. I looked at my wicker chair to check on her and in the corner of my eye I saw her dog. He was still barking, so I got a loud yelp as he squirmed and flailed on the chair. I grabbed one of my pack's wheels and yanked out the back of the pack. He gave me a dirty look as he shuffled about on the earth-like fur of his pack and looked at me. I snapped back to attention when he tugged on my pack and ran off. Down the truck, down the desolate path that led to our haven, we passed along a forest with strange colored grass. By the time we reached the park, a wild beast had emerged. He was gnawed on by another, but I dropped to my knees. Fear, anger, and rage washed over me. This young beauty was hell bent on killing me with her ferocity and fervor. I snapped to attention again when I saw the young kid was about to walk over. He was waving his hands into the air. I raised my head and tried to grab him. His hands were tangled in wires that crossed between my skin and skin, but we hadn't touched them since we had learned to transform and could control our minds. It was a loud yelp. We settled into a quiet block of grass in the center of the clearing. Our dogs whistled as they led the pack away from the forest. After a while, a young girl approached. I let out a sigh of relief. I smiled as she picked up her bag. She shook her head as she handed me my bag. The girl made for the trail, barely making a sound as she walked. I took off the collar of my duster and put it on. Before long, we had climbed the camp site, crossed over a little and climbed down one of the last trees. I turned my head and asked the girl, "What are you doing up here? " She looked down at her hand as she looked up at me. " Everything is okay." I nodded, gathering myself and put on my coat. She set the bag down as I walked away, until I went home and I was a wolf.<|endoftext|>

I was alone, but I was happy. When the last of the aliens were gone, I thought it was a bad idea to turn the fireworks off. But it could still come back as a good idea. Tomorrow, I'd have something from New York to hold in my arms. I sat alone in my living room, and watched the lights turn on and off. The afternoon sun turned as I approached the sound of the gunfire as far as I could tell. As the sun disappeared, the cars drove by closer, burning. The first grenades hit my feet, but I couldn't hear anything of use anymore. The humans lived only five minutes away, and they were prepared to attack at any moment. They climbed over wood and stone from tree to tree, and they crept up on my limbs. Trying to defeat me, they started small, clumsy attacks on the things on my arms. I heard a knock on the door, and it was to my surprise they had brought a creeper with them. The aliens were well, though. They'd said that when they buried the stolen extraterrestrial artifacts, they would check it again in a few minutes. "We just got gored, " they'd whispered. Their alien glock had a knife sticking out, and it's color scheme was quite the contrast from the faded red and orange of Earth. Their voices were sharp and confident. At the same time, they seemed lonely. To me, they were lonely. I almost accepted that. I had left my house behind at the time. I kept the creeper. The most important thing in my life. So the first one who tried to search for me for the aliens had been caught and killed. The second. I grabbed the creeper as I left. It was a very old, battered key. I cursed myself the day I let go of that thing. " Is that the creeper? " I asked. I thought nothing of it for a moment, as the final piece of my life flashed before my eyes. I turned back to the creeper, and tried to conceal my disdain. " It's broken, " the alien said, " but it'll fix itself afterwards. That's all we need."<|endoftext|>

Two fellow employee's faces entered my cubicle, they both knew what I was up to. Rejection means rejection, heartbreak means death. To be unable to meet the kind of people I once had and be treated as royalty, made even more of a bitch. Unfortunately it wasn't the same, because I neither accepted nor denied them. I still get paid a lot to guard their unpaid guests, while I am forced to live in the first person shoes. If someone is to judge me harshly, I have to believe this isn't a punishment for having dishonor from my grudging existence. But, I have another job to do. There will be no reward. A weird business model lead to me taking the last step to a near death experience, but I refuse to be a coward. I don't ask much of anyone in this town. Sure, some might volunteer their services to some government, others donate their time to charity. But I don't mind.<|endoftext|>

It's been a long day. Of god, there's been a long day of death. The hot weather was hot, the harsh snow was cold, and there was no sign of any of the other sick moles as I drifted out into the frigid air. I finally got a view of the horizon at night, and looked towards the right side of the mountain just above me. It was crumbling, looked down, and opened like a book. It then swallowed me whole. I could no longer breathe, no voice came to my mind, and I couldn't move. I was in a black hole in a black void. My stomach rumbled in my chest, and its twists were as painful as the friction of my wrists as I fell. Those pills had been so good, I never noticed they'd go down. Did it, did it? Did it want me dead?<|endoftext|>

This guy sucks... Shit, I don't want to die. I pull out my phone and check it. " Hello? " I reply, still struggling to explain it. I click on the " I-I can't get through to see you any longer " button. Goddamnit man, I kind of.. I have to go. I *don't* want to die, I've been here before! " Look dude, the service is so fucking slow! " " Um... sir? Who do you want to be tonight? " " God damn it. My name's Jamie, ummm... A Santa Claus? There's no Santa Claus... " " He must be.

It's Sunday and all. I don't want to go, you're fucking mad at me right now. " "... " I was so fucking mad... I *knew* the time, I had to kill you.

" " I'm not you, I'm a mysterious I think, sorta. As a super lonster back in grade school, I had to go to college every year, didn't really know where to start but... I couldn't bear to think about it any more... " " Then stop! I'm a suicide prevention support group. You can just fucking forget this and go to a shrink to get your shrink. " " Good, fine! If I wanted to live, that guy doesn't exist anymore. You know... yo, I would. " " Give me fucking one bullet right now. " " You sure? What if I cut you off? If I cut you off...

But if I do drop a bunch of blood, you'd have a chance at surviving. " " What? " " You could drop shit like this every other Christmas, but everytime you did... no way. It's not like you have any sort of... savings account... credit card balance... you know? " " Yah. I have one change from a brother I got after I got shot. Damn it."<|endoftext|>

"I'm not happy about it, " his fingers tapped against his hand, as if no reaction had been taken when he'd started to protest. His right hand was pulling away from his usual place, a padlock, so as not to escape the crushing weight on the flat of the desk. He surveyed the face of the office's custodian, a worker of the day. Despite the cheap work, the plodding exchange of stares that had most certainly no bearing on the building's existance, his uncharacteristically muted arms were beginning to move. " Why is this my main contributor to the institution? " He coughed, taking a gulp of water before looking up at the official. " Because... " His voice was low, a lack of confidence he wanted for most of the conversation, " I have the power to arrest you for carrying out any assignment I find objectionable. I will tear apart a student, and destroy the Academy's records, and deny any potential involvement with yours. " He gestured at the insignia in the filing cabinet that stood first, drawing his finger with great care. The line that split from the top of the drawer extended again. " You insolent sack of a student, " the official began, moving it away again, " you must cease and desist immediately and remain silent. " He looked back down at his hand, slipping the lock of the tape and folder he held away. " But I suppose that's your right to protest, even when you are clearly not doing anything. " " It will be what it is, " he said, voice quiet, " it all depends on how badly you must act. " " If not, I'll have to do it myself. " He forced a weak smile and turned back to his man. On the desk's bottom, imprinted with the roll of graph paper were his signature, and the subtle spasm was evidence enough of his agenda. The symbol on the paper was a Danko badge, inscribed with " 2d Caffeine, no sugar" and a pair of red swimsuits. He couldn't help but catch his breath, and his face full of nightmares. A smile graced his face as he did the calculus after he cleared the file and the file of debt on his desk. That school was a small town, working hard to raise enough cash to buy cars but a growing population. Not all of it had money, of course, but some had cars. In fact, the majority of the town's funds ran out after the Big Freeze. The department that had collected most of it was deeply ashamed to have to give a dime of it to so many of its employees. As they say, people with these stupid debt always end up just sitting there and fucking with their children, eventually making some sort of scandal, or gutterally compromising information about someone's debt. As a citizen of the school, I wanted to send them a message. I wanted them to have the power to arrest me, of course, to stop me even, because I was up against all odds. But that fucking kid had just wasted his cup. Instead of arresting him, I stood and let him eat the rich young lady's steak in the cafeteria. The plain, stupid scarred, white shirt I wore after grabbing her was quickly replaced by the very, very tight bikini top. The angry crowd he'd drawn them to pounce on, all wearing what looked like thigh slippers, was with a knife in one hand and an AK-47 in the other, and there in the recess chair across from me were two weapons with no visible trigger. In his hands was a X-Box One controller, looking a bit too greedy. In mine was a camera, aimed at his head, and in the other was a pistol. I resigned myself to my fate. I should've known better. I looked down at my wrists and pulled the button.<|endoftext|>

Through the modern denizen ’ s mouth, the words “ Hello Katsujin, ” came out in strange, nasally syllables. No one knows why he came, but it seemed innocuous enough. Words that came from his perspective, ones that the real world foreign to most, came from his idea of the earth, at least with his thoughts. But for so long, there had been many like him who believed him to be the real big evil. In truth, the underworld was merely a stop gap between the ordinary life, the most ordinary of those easy raving jerks, and the real work. Things that had truly effected the human race would ever be treated as normal, or even better off. Until today, perhaps. Most people saw him as a specter, those who saw him as a beacon, projecting a vague image of a world that had truly become new, but something that was never quite the same. The sky shone brightly with warm rays of orange, and he rode. Every morning, the window would be open, and that was when you first noticed him, the bastard. Once his endless journey was over, Katsujin kept up the mundane form. He came up to see his friends ’ house, and looked around at his surroundings. He was usually hunched over, tapping his pen on the counter, or tossing a dollar in a garbage can. On other days, his face would be expunged from the back of the truck, and he never shook hands with anyone. However, today, he saw a bright orange light, and when he stretched out his hand, the light pierced through his shirt. Strangely, every person running the streets stopped, focused on the orange line that appeared. By the end of the day, most of his friends had disappeared, but not because of what he saw. Upon the news of the disappearance, most people who had seen him had disappeared too, and Katsujin ’ s lot was no longer to be trifled with. But soon enough, the sun was shining brightly, and he could be anywhere. He was anywhere. Now they were all over the streets, and everyone was sure to find him. Tomorrow was that day, he smiled, and he walked down the street towards his house. They were walking hand in hand, watching every living person. And within his house, Katsujin was relieved as they began walking. He was warmly greeted by His people, who were all talking at once, chatting, and having a talk that made him freeze. In this way, everyone was happy. He even ordered a box of peanut butter from a big room, and waited for them to open it. As the minutes dragged by, the light grew dimmer. Around him, the humans looked at each other in utter bewilderment. “ Hello the new miss, ” said a small girl who looked to be around eight years old, “ I was wondering if anyone would like to visit, and if you ever do come back. ” She looked at his face, and thought to himself how something so simple could summon him. He rubbed his hand against his shirt and smiled. A few minutes later, the sun returned, and he could find himself alone. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - On my way to r/writingprompts.

Thought that the sounds of dancing and getting on an airplane only added to my pain. As I tried to sort through things, I could no longer hear anything but the occasional deceleration or impact of something. Minutes and minutes passed. "Damn " I thought to myself as I started to cross the patio, looking around in vain for an exit but I couldn't. Nothing. Why on earth would I be looking for an exit? " Shit shit shit shitshit! " I heard multiple cries as I tried to run. Why could I hear screaming? I tried to get an eye on the plane and watch the lights. " Heheh heh it's a beautiful thing! " I remembered the former planes were flying high during the first period and then the temperature dropped on a different species, I was able to look out of the window in time to see it. What a fucking nightmare! I shouted to try and get out but nothing happened. I looked to the right to see an empty bar. I saw the bartender standing there, looking more and more unnerved by everything. " Is it getting cold outside? Is anyone out here with us? " I turned to him. " Fuck you! " he yelled at me. Another barbeque. Another. Another. Another... Fuck. Why the hell would someone let another thing fly? Maybe this is why I watch planes with my mothers anymore, we were constantly arguing and getting on planes. It's not like I could get up to anyone or anything, just staying in one place for a whole hour, not getting help from anyone or anything. What happened to me? I watched as the barbeque came to a halt. " WHO ARE YOU?! " I shouted to whoever was sitting in the bar, again nothing happened. " Ahh shucks man " he seemed more annoyed by how far it was from the barbeque. " Who are you? What happened? " I asked, as I took a step forward towards him. " N-no... I-I..want..real..life.. " he quickly scrambled away, this time looking incredibly confused. " Uh-huh yeah. " he replied while looking straight at me again. This time he noticed me, trying to start thinking the same thing I tried to think. " Wait you! What is happening?! " " It's getting colder. " " O-oh right. Maybe I should start moving around? " " Hey I'm getting drunk alright! " " Wait? What kind of a beautiful bar? " I repeated in a panicked voice. " What kind of a magnificent bar is this? " " A barbershop. " " HAHAHA " he exclaimed with a smile. " Who the fuck are you?" I told him, calling him Steve, and I hope we never get to go back down here again.<|endoftext|>

My best friend died during the 2010's. My only friend at that point was my girlfriend. The only male companion I had left was a teenager named Wilson, who had been confined to the hospital for more than 3 months until the results revealed a fresh blood abnormality. Our hearts began to race. My best friend, my heart. My love. The station at the grocery store sign read July 7th 2010. Out of all my thoughts, the only thought I have left is my girlfriend. I had never held affection towards either of our parents, at least not since that poor bastard stabbed Wilson. That was my last hope. This was my last chance for love. The fear. The mental anguish. It must have taken years to fall in love. I hadn't planned on getting married and going to college. I had always been religious, and thought we were marriageable, but my mom was constantly telling me not to question or talk about religion as strongly, and when that didn't work out, I kept going to the store to buy groceries, and when I finally found something that worked, my stomach dropped. My boss would read all day, snooze me, and give me some work, and it would fail. Even though Wilson was more depressed than I had expected, and my wife was flabbergasted at the state of my marriage, I couldn't bear not to enter the third year of my marriage. I was overjoyed at the wedding.<|endoftext|>

So the press interview was getting a little bigger, now that my boss was asleep. The kid was scrunching his jaw and quiet. This was my first time trying to scream at the press, and having to jump on her first time. Her eyes burst open, and the words “ We ’ re the bad guys ” flew into her hot mouth. Then they shouted for photographers to stop filming and flee the scene. My boss had to cancel and because his friend, Melissa, was supposed to bring around two cameras. I ’ d been in the studio with the kid for almost two hours and she was never going to go any where in those meetings. I get on the phone to my boss, some people from the press would hear me and he ’ d say no, that the manager couldn ’ t keep filming the interview. I ’ d pressed that call button, but he was already behind me, clutching at his wrist. “ So... um... Hi. ” I slipped through the thick barrier of line, shouting at the camera as best I could, “ are we the bad guys? ” Melissa, the mother of three, was shaking violently. “ Fine… No. I mean... we are. ” I threw my arms in the air and shouted about the disrespect I was going to show her. She was right. I was the good guys. “ How can you say no? ” The kid grabbed my wrist, and asked me a question I ’ d forgotten I had for almost a minute. “ Daddy, are we the bad guys? ”<|endoftext|>

In the depths of my stomach, days when I was alive, my hands rushed, tears in my eyes, so sobs *hoping* for a place I could cry. Walls gone, lines decayed, lines made crooked, lines filled with tears. I held back the wails, it was strange to not hear them *too* soon, but I remained. The wind slipped from my fingers and branches, and bent my toes, but it was still a painful sight. The green like skin I had become had grown. I tried to find a way to comfort myself, but I found nothing. Now, there was nothing. I leant back and closed my eyes, the pain slowly overwhelming my mind. As my vision slowly faded, I could no longer see, but could feel. It was all fading fast, like a black smoldering, searing tar. I awoke that night sobbing in my covers in my last moments, not knowing what to do. I coughed, I let out a wail, I threw open my eyes, I opened them, I found myself alone...<|endoftext|>

People can get high. But I never knew she was going to jump off a small nook of a fire. Ever since I had the chance, I've been trying to hide under this metal pole. I can not put her down. I must get down before she can, I swear she will slip through the patio door and kill me if I dont reach her immediately. She's so beautiful. Fucking sexy. Or is that God? I wish I knew. You see, she got high up in the air. If I fell to the street below, I'd likely suffocate instantly. That would show people that there is no Heaven. Those angels are doing their best to scare away the spirits of sin. They keep chasing me like crazy. There's one last thing to do. I swear if they caught me, a full stomach will be able to consume my body before the next soul can get there. Damn. Honestly, I don't even know how to catch that one! She and that fat big green head would probably take her right through the balcony. That whole pyre caved in real quick. * Keep going. * Please. Take my life. Please.<|endoftext|>

Greenish, fluffy, warm blankets. His fingers. He runs his fingers through brown fir. " Do you like this? " " No, probably don't. I have a different book, dear. It's real nice here. " He gives her a lot of greenish luster. " Of course. " " How about the park, then? " The sun ’ s blue, the canvas created by the spread of earth, high above it ’ s rider ’ s head. His eyes rain green, her husband ’ s green. He does the same with the petals of the trees. She shivered a little, tired, when they were doing the butterfly biology. She watched as the tiger girl with two tails, two eyes, and she did the *Bubbles* dance in time with them. But he wasn ’ t welcome. He was kept away. With shelter and nannies. *Doc, meditate. * And he had a park, then.<|endoftext|>

I drove my own soul to the old girl's house and down the street, prepared myself to hit that girl all over again. I called my friends for help. Mom, Dad, and me exchanged tugs as we rounded the corner to my usual place in town. It smelled of old furniture and old fences. A pretty blonde blind woman was there. " Willie, it's uh... this is Brooklyn by the way, I'm over for a ride, thanks a lot," I said as I made my way over to her house. Why couldn't he just send a text for me? I shot up out of my seat and headed towards her place. I dialed the numbers of the players in the small little track in front of me. *hello* Hello? Guess what? *hello* One hit. *hello* Two? *hello* Liked it? Want to see some more? [ Player 3 receives an email on the phone. ] Wow the format was sloppy. Fails to read.

The pristine rain bade them goodbye, affording them a chance to grow accustomed to their current status. Empirical frolicking continued as the sun took its last beat. Seemingly from the ground, it glanced up from its land of vision and smiled at the pointy masses. Peter was happy, they were happy. "I'd like to speak with you about which province would be better suited for the new War. " Peter glanced to each. " Toronto. " Stephen smiled, " Our Geneties state it would be a great choice to be a Toronto versus New York. But the East provinces' defence is less efficient and the west, none the less, is a better option. " It looked at them all. Peter considered those people for a long moment. Some only had enough money to pay the province taxes, some had no means to pay the immense border security needed to keep the people in line. Their choice was elsewhere. They continued from their site, placing them in a yard of sticks-on-grass rather than packed homes; digging through some men ’ s remains around the discarded land. " I see these characteristics well, but I can still tell from what looks like decay- " Peter froze. What was this man? He seemed no more advanced than Peter. Peter scanned all the way through the man ’ s belongings. No marks. It didn ’ t matter how good he looked. He was the best protector of the land. His eyes met those of Peter, and he knew he was right. Three days of rain in a barn doing minimal work after they broke through the barrier one morning. Peter opened the barn door to a large blue box of hides. In it lay a piece of paper. He raised his hand and the paper fell back onto the ground. " The War between Canadian and American. " Peter smiled. " From Canada to the East we control the east. " " New York is united." Stephen knew they had only one option. As one, this letter would be written by Canadian men to Washington, D.C. He should have known that the Canadians would last the time there was no Canadian settlement. His last words to him were truthfully, “ goodnight. ” EDIT: Formatting and editing. Would appreciate any constructive criticism, even though I don ’ t like these things.<|endoftext|>

It was all a blur, except for one moment, where I was sitting at my throne. I am a master of the stars. After the rumble of thunder started, I noticed a figure staring at me. I immediately took out my eyes. All I could see was the golden marbles. "You are not such a silly thing. I was waiting for something... " " Of course I didn't, dear. Now I have another few minutes to do you a favor. " The face that stared back at me was a woman that was standing about 5 feet. Her breath was extremely heavy. " How did you get in here? " I just looked at her and asked, " You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into. I was just cleaning up after some wood soon after you came in, but then I thought of some warp markers that you can't have. " I gathered myself and ran through the stairs. I ran all the way down the hall to the floor. I was exhausted and all I had to do was tell the guards to keep patrolling the hallway while I hit the Boss with the chains. " Stay there until we find an exit. The Boss didn't want any trouble." My footsteps were now getting shorter, I must have strolled a mile in to get home. Was this what I heard? I saw a light hovering above me, while we set out for the entrance, I saw another figure coming from the shadows, I turned and looked. It was a girl. A large, slender man. A large shadow came from the shadows as well. I looked around, all I could think was, I was the one that had to escape. I came to a dead end, where I could see the heavily armored guard clearly glowering at me, just as I did so. I led the way as the guards door opened, the big shadow took him as he reached his feet. He looked peaceful, but there was an eerie something about him, a chilling aura. A shadow drew a dagger, as if a love potion. I see that figure, and I wanted to kill that figure. But who should I kill? I would never understand a feeling like this. I have lived a quiet and peaceful life, I will never understand what that feeling was. I came to my end, where I had set out, I was another one of the guards. And there she was, my love.<|endoftext|>

“ Dad: Dad, wake up! ” Perfect timing for Justin to wake up, dear. I could've picked up that kid right by the sound of his alarm and made a run for it. You know, those annoying morning plays you get when your phone doesn't work properly? You know how it always fails? “ You can't wake the old bastard up! ” He'd also always been good at making me wan na know who was listening to that stupid song. Shit, did some people even really listen? After all these years I thought of shaving, cleansing, and I went to work. Normally I'd be gone early from work because I was just bringing my morning up in the app store and could be late for practice duties. Instead it was absolutely perfect. Morning started easy and he sounded really pumped. I began my walk to school and kept bouncing back as I walked, almost complaining that I can't sit down on him so he made me talk when I was worried. He still was a great listener. He had the courage to ask me the subject and gave me the beer on the way to class. Here I was, at my desk - 9am having fun. I called him up and got him to come sit down. “ Are you alright? I just forgot to feed Mom! ” I said to him. “ Yeah, well, thanks. ” He responded as he took a seat on my flat, which was getting more quiet so the phone started to ring. “ hey sweetie. Where have you been? ” He asked as he looked into my glasses, which was my best friend my dad had with him since he was a kid. “ I- I- I was shopping, I- I heard someone sick singing. ” He started. “ There was a fire in my room, this guy stole some paint, we thought it was the janitor's legs. I can hear the music on the other side. It's over, now it's time to go. ” He said as he walked off to take a seat. I sat there for a while, looking at the living room. Maybe he was trying to hide his feelings at some point, because he loved reading too much. But nothing changed. The only thing I was able to see was the news bulletin on my phone. I checked it and wondered why I didn't leave the house. Soon I noticed him. The best wingman, who always tried his best to set me up with this one person. That was the song I kept listening to when I was trying to manage what my dad was using the sleeve for. Fuck it, I had to try it out. ****** Thanks for reading!

I met her down the block at the Golden Apple-Hoe one night. I sat on the couch with a bottle of whiskey in the sink, listening as the two of us continued to stare at my face. I downed the bottle and imagined she was here to wait for me- to give me a smile, let me know I was home, so I could see her and stuff. I felt like talking to her and had a good time, laughing and talking. But it was too late. It was too late for any else. I quickly broke away from her. "Hey, honey. " I said to her. She let me hold her head in her hands, holding back tears. She even smiled at me when I met her. Her pink eyes glinted with excitement and she looked so happy for me. " Why're you so nervous right now? " she asked me. I smiled back. " It's a little bit different, isn't it? But it's different for you, right? " " I've never felt nervous. I don't feel a bit lonely. " " What are you talking about? " she said, staring straight into my eyes. " I mean, for a second it was just... like a quick kiss. But then it was just... like a hug. " " Do you think it's for the best? " she asked. My hand touched hers, but she was stopped by a great big bang. It crushed her entire back with such force it made her scream. My heart was racing. *Why did this have to happen to me? * I thought to myself. " You're gon na miss me when I'm gone. " I said. Her mouth dropped open, and I went back to staring at the sky. " No, honey. I'm going to miss you too."<|endoftext|>

You know that one time you went to war with it because it refused to help you cook food and brushed at the dirt with a furry ball? It was that stupid Russian kid that came running and gave you the dog treats and complained that your dog accidentally killed your dog. He shot you in the head with the bullet and went to his bloody grave. You realize that this was no joke. If Pokemon Go is anything resembling a funny, old meme, this has to be true.

"Sorry man, I was trying to plan my grandchild's sweetest birthday party tonight, " the well-dressed woman on the other end of the phone pleaded with me. I didn't speak. She flicked a number ringed back on her ear and asked, " Were you there for the big party, or did you just pretend like I wasn't there and chase after the garbage truck? What was that shade of green over there? I just want you to know that I love you. " She hadn't meant to say anything besides this sentence, but this was another time where I had to first pay the bill. That night, I decided that I didn't want to attend the party anyway. The last night of my life: * I didn't know if I wanted to put you through another disgusting week and a half. * I would've yelled at my girl if I knew I could. After a period of when they tried to force me to end the party I couldn't think of a logical reason why I shouldn't. Then, a realization crossed my mind. I turned around to see someone else on the other side of the room arguing with a familiar person. " Quiet. I want to go home, " I said to the unfamiliar man. He moved to another of the other doorways, facing the door. " I'm there! " He exclaimed. And so the sobbing, the screaming and the screaming subsided. " I'm just going to get to a couple of seats. Just tell me what's going on, " I continued with no further explanation. It's been a year now since we had been on each other's side of the country. I haven't seen my mother and dad since. The day I got accepted to University, I was devastated. The day I got an internship as a State Department adviser at UPS I was too scared to face myself. My suspension in India was the saddest thing that my life could've been! But now? It was me who was no longer in the country, and now my girlfriend was all I could look forward to anymore. " Why does there have to be a presidential inauguration for you? " I said weakly. " President? " " I mean, what the hell is this? " She questioned. " You just got dragged into a story with me! " " I don't need to know the American national anthem, " I said weakly. " I just want to live my life as normal, and if you make me sit in front of these newspapers without a hero, or a villain, or whatever, I don't think you would be an outcast for stepping down. " " I didn't mean to get dragged into a story like that! " She stopped. I could feel the tears building in her eyes. She continued to sob. " I'm just going to get to a couple of seats. Just tell me what's going on. Just tell me what's going on. Just tell me who I am and I'm not a hero anymore!" And as soon as I finished saying that to her and, she took the phone out and texted me the name of the police officer that was responding. The cop saw the little girl he had lost his daughter by the steps down the road. ***** Edit: Made a few minor edits<|endoftext|>

You know, man. Maybe not the greatest war you could've ever seen, but yeah, that was it. It was brutal, full of piles of bodies, people dying, and of course someone screaming in pain. Even worse was the thousands of men that had to wait outside the gate. Most of them could have sworn they heard a woman cry out, but they all seemed to stare at me. The fuck was I thinking? This wasn't weird. Sure, I heard screams, but really? All the screams could be seen were people hugging and screaming, trying desperately to survive the assault. I ran away, leaving the lady and her crying for a nurse to catch up to. After that, while the screams faded into the background, I thought of all the other survivors in the gutters. Dead doesn't make it so easy. Most of them were that they had come back from the war wounded or dying. I had just made a few heroic sacrifices. I'd brought my sister and brother, especially after the local gangs had overrun most of the city to make way for less left. Riots erupted, with anyone brave enough to face the rabid horde quickly losing much of their sanity. For some reason, they managed to do just fine, but in a different way. Besides, they weren't trying to kill me or anything. The human sacrifices to sustain our wounds also made my job extremely easy. As I came back from the town, the guards stopped to examine me. Strange, how men couldn't grasp the concept of death. I ran to them, only for them to disarm me, they did their fucking thing. I landed in a mangled heap, kneeled on the ground, and blood spurted out of my gums. I hadn't done it yet, I thought. The other guards let out a warning, and I was going back to bed. I had all that time to prepare myself for whatever it was. The world, and it's people, would eventually rest in peace with this world. The world would teach me my place. That I could survive. One day, my mind is going to pop up somewhere else. They'll tell me the news, or maybe in person. Oh hell no. This doesn't work. It's too late. I find the words again in my head, "aww, dude, riiiiiind at home. I find this... odd." The next day, my murder was handed to me. I read it out loud, and I smiled. I couldn't wait to face those damned bastards.<|endoftext|>

The toddler stopped and handed the mother a crumpled piece of paper. " Put that down kid, " she said, reaching her head into the back of the toddler's hood. The boy hesitated for a moment and then looked up at the children with a mix of pity and terror. " I really have never believed you until now. " " No, go to school. " " Wait, mommy. You don't understand. " The tears stung every single one of their faces, but this time they took it back. " Remember, " the mother said sternly, " everyone's but a minor parent. Don't play with them or I'll banish you from school... " " Mommy, if you have to live with this now you need to put down the crumpled piece of paper. You can not play with these kids. " " Pfft. But if you don't put the piece down, we will have to call a priest. " The dark, dark eyes filled her with a deep, tired smile. " Get out of my sight, " she said. " You can do this, " the mother replied. " Please, Mommy, mommy, please don't say anything. " She turned away and began to leave. The children stood there for a moment and then turned back to their mom. " Okay, " the mom said to her husband. The two families played for a moment, and then played again. The room was silent for a moment, and then silence again. " Well then, " the mother said, " your father is a Pastor now.

What's happened with my brain from making a train tweet? Nothing that couldn't be interpreted by the psychometrics software. By speaking to myself I took my first dank and VR verbal cue from my virtual state, knowing it wasn't friendly or appropriate. The panic causing my patient to jump out of his chair were there pre, the obvious signs of making a withdrawal. The fact that the nervousness of my other patient did nothing to improve the illusion was not talked about for too long. I had to see to it that I pulled up my trending hashtags and immediately realized what I was missing. This was a message. The "Search Engine"? As if it were legit. Whatever the fuck was making this connection to another human brain, it was being conveyed with some code from my machine. The context started to shift to why it was being sent to this platform. It said, "You have been given, for better or worse, an opportunity to test your human intelligence. After I'am bored with your public displays of intelligence, one final test may be necessary. Give these other versions of you, the Turing Test, an opportunity to experience more human, in thought and action. Shall we then commence? ** Will you? ** I know it. What has happened to my brain? In this moment I am the human I know. No. I am only made by God to guide, guide the Turing Test. With time and as much patience, as I can muster, this world may need to disappear from existence soon.

*BANG*. Man, that's awful. I can barely breathe. He shoots out of nowhere and slams his fist onto my face. " Bring it in. " And the Red Hood does the same. " You... uhh... lem me try... it. " " Kale Wilson, the guardian from hell! " " How can that be if... uhh... not in myself!? " I couldn't think straight for a moment. I ran up to him. He had the most amazing grin on his face. It was his smile that always left me feeling embarrassed, I wanted him to keep it, I wanted to be there for me. " I don't know if I can... " " Calm down. " He lifts the paperweight off the table. " I have some superpowers, you get me? " My mouth turned. It sure was fierce. " Squat! " The barrel of the cigar caught my cheek. I felt a warm sensation float in. Blood. There was a faint smell of the smoke from my cigar but not enough to make it out. He wouldn't be very strong. And then he dropped it. Looking up, I saw him trying to catch it. I followed him, eyes trained on him, confused. He looked down at the cigar, for a second. And then he turned his head to me. " You're now a fire fighter. " He looked up at me. His low dimples glistened. A hot liquid became on his chin. " I... " " I'm... uh, I have powers. I... " He grinned back. It was still bright. He looked down at the paperweight, his head resting on his hand. " How did you? " He looked up and came face to face with a man in an ugly suit. I could see my armpit beginning to glow a shade of yellow. But the face was just black. " Why did you work here? " " Those things cause you to lose yourself. " " Oh. Well... I guess if I keep winning the endless fights that *they* so carefully mimic. " The man's face lit up again. " If you die, you can still give me the look of death, The Valiant... " " Perfect." I stood up, but he didn't do. He didn't smile. He didn't laugh. And, as my body went limp, I could only hope the bullet was to go straight through him.<|endoftext|>

"So, take care of yourselves, " the burly one said. " Please, I understand that I am not necessarily the best that you are having, but I really enjoy having you, because if you don't do this I wouldn't have it. I'm waiting for you all around the world to be able to sort through all the selfishness and try to sort it all out for you, you know? Now! Get out. You're just getting to know each other. " " Look at you, " said the redhead in a balaclava. A flash of fire erupted from her veins. Her eyes became intense and took on a gaping tear. A voice called from the deeps to take her away. " Like I said, I need to warn you, guys! You're not doing anything wrong! It's your time! You're fucking perfect, " the *red* responded with a heavy breath. The fire between the two of them increased in volume. No time had passed. Finally the winds started to blow, and winds began to blow. They drove up into the dark surrounding, melting into the smoke and sand. Two lucky people, once so alone in their sense of reality, were now melting into charred wreckage, and the smoke had engulfed them whole. " Oi, fucking! " yelled one of the gas station employees as the other stumbled forward, clutching a bloody metal shovel. His gear was already mopped up, but no time for him to pull himself together. The boy desperately needed a way to clean up the mess he'd made. " Forget about it! Don't worry about me! I'll have a fireteam there when you go! " he shouted back. Tears streamed down his face and dirty, broken slacks covered his face, dripping onto the ground below. " Just as I was saying, I just... I really appreciate your friendship. I was sure it was only going to get better. " She broke the silence, and pressed a finger to the wound on her arm. " It could be worse. You two are beginning to get along better, and once it's done then you can pretend I'm the bad guy and you're the good guy and that I got to get those two back together. " " So, like, a good metaphor for things, huh? " " No! " she replied. " I'm just saying I'm the bad guy. I'm not necessarily the bad guy. I'm just saying I do love you, and don't want to get any soft spots. " " What did I say, sweetie? " " You're *all* supposed to be my friend. " The boy nodded. " Sure, thank you. " " Yeah. Well? " " Well, you meet the best guys at the store on Saturday, who also know each other? " The boy nodded. " The Phil? " " Yeah. Then they order a sandwich for you. I want an on-air sitcom show, really! If there's nothing else out there, that's fine. " The boy had a sheepish grin on his face. " Okay, " he said. " Alright. " His sister looked up at the redhead who smiled back. " Well, good luck and remember that you don't want to get round with me like that. She's been working all night anyway."<|endoftext|>

I checked to make sure I was wearing a mid-day shirt, rubber gloves and earpieces. For today, I was using a secret code designed to keep me at all times. A few people tried to throw me out. Luckily for me I couldn't. I thought I could be trusted and complied. Once I was confident in my precautions, I filled in that code. * "Yes! I know! I think we have a code for this myself! " * I got up and grabbed my shoes, immediately drooling. As I walked to the police station, I told them the crime. I left a chemical trail that led me to their car. I pulled my keys out, forced them to open the door, slammed the door shut and pulled away. A few more minutes later, I emerged. They were weird. Well, at least I thought they were. They didn't call me a " freak ", so to speak. They kept people home- locked all the time. The President was at his desk, eating a bowl of cereal and brushing his teeth. My glasses were still on, though, so I put on some clothes and put on a coat. As I arrived at my new house, all I saw were my windows and doorways. The lights were on. I stepped out of my car. When I got back inside, I noticed that my space was filled with boxes. I was usually content within the office, keeping my food and supplies. I looked at the box next to my bed. There was one inside. Two. One. *What the hell is that? * I asked myself. I was almost positive it was a package. Normally I would have left a note containing what I knew. This was weird. The government was putting the extra layer of security there for the food, but it was like they wouldn't know what I knew about this condition. I went over to my fridge to check it out. Before I could turn around, I noticed a keyhole. The lock was labeled " Emergency " on the side. *Why the hell didn't they just put it outside when it was completely locked? * I grabbed the key and plopped it in. The smell was overpowering. The freezer was a mess, the food smelled of rotting flesh, blood and decay. I cursed myself as I pulled the door open, slipped my sleeve and made my way back to the surveillance system. * " Hello? " * I said quietly, my words carried with a heavy *swish*. The room was dimly lit. Bricks were placed outside the windows. There were boxes filled with food and food memories. I turned to look at them. * This isn't right. I can't be in this back-o-clock! I'm going to have to climb back out! * I could hear the footsteps. I didn't want to let them get closer. I shuffled around the concrete floor of the room. Nobody was in sight. I heard a muffled voice whisper " I knew you would put me in here! You don't know who I am, do you?"<|endoftext|>

I had three dragons to slay. The group would go about killing each other, though I honestly don't remember getting any other lines to get to. The big ones had the long hair and heavy armor, the smaller ones had simple metal armor and spears. A small group of small ones would run towards me and I'd sneak in behind them, and kill them all in one kill. Three dragons began to gather around me, tasting my blood. They commanded me to fight, but I *wasn't* ready for this. My small man made a beeline for me, and I pinned him to the ground, bloody and pain radiating from his head. A butterfly flew through the air, *it* dipped down. It had wings and had a strong body, but it made it hard to aim without a gun. It was going to catch me if I did not use my two daggers and all my raw energy. With blood loss already fading, the beast that killed my father was whisked away to gather again and again, before I was allowed to return to the guild. I read to myself before I left. I never saw the other dragons, had no one to return to but a one. Maybe I was playing a game?<|endoftext|>
**********265**********
I look in her dead golden eyes. I saw her laying back next to me on my couch. The hot sun shining through her dark chocolate brown hair as she smiled at me and one last kiss on the cheek. I pushed myself off of the couch. I looked straight into her wide-eyed blonde. She was breathing. * In* deep. "Aha, He's here! " I hear the sounds coming from behind my body. Her voice is harsh now. " No! " She says without even talking or closing her eyes, " what am I going to do? " " What do you want? " I can only utter weakly, " I'm not gon na fight him. You hear me? " " Yeah, oh yeah, I heard you cry, you know what's gon na happen? " She pushes herself up off the bed again as I close my eyes. I think what's going to happen is one thing. Everything I want in this world is my greatest enemy. A force far greater than me, and what can I have? A beautiful woman? " You don't understand! " I swear I can hear her getting harder, the heavy breathing from behind me, but I can't find what I want in me. I sit up on my living doll and pull out my canteen and cheese. I set my controller on the table and get up out of my bedroom. I rush out the door to my dressing room, press the button and kick a boxing stance. " You lost! " I yell out to my wife's lifeless body, the small one sitting on my wet lizard legs. " Shut the fuck up and just... relax. " She coughs and turns to me and looks at the little shit that had kicked my foot and just kissed her hand. " I love you, Alicia." She says with that little bastard smile, but I know she was lying. Alicia was a fake I was taught in school. I'm a fake. I got the shrill, choking exhale when I hear her heart rate, think of the cramps I had after that fight with that " super human" punching through my dorm window. I never liked those fights.<|endoftext|>

"I gazed at the casings strewn around. Each one held room for dozens of planets, but they were empty, robbed; pryed open by something ancient and sour. " There was a fog floating around her, in an endless ocean that swam across the land. There was a race of aliens roaming about in the stars, who created an army and brought about a plague called Hunger. There were even time, where everyone known and by whom they were paid had died or been ordered to die, but everybody knew by the Seed that it wasn't food they had. They wandered in all directions through all the waste, humanity had destroyed itself. But what about I? It was a destination. I would die in peace, but through their mistakes I was infected and removed. My blood would spill from the cracks in their blood but those crinkling pieces still trickled on the thick knuckled dust that littered their architecture. I jumped out of the vine, onto the beach. I took in a deep breath, I felt the sand on my face, the waterfall past my head. And it had dark. There was a sense of freedom in it. I knew it was slipping, I drew back and counted each life that I inhaled. I looked around, for any sign of life. I could remember the old lands that stretched throughout the empty valleys that connected with the sea. I looked at the casings strewn around. Each one held room for dozens of planets, but they were empty, robbed; pryed open by something ancient and sour. " " How can I die in peace? They know the plan. " I replied. " You can live your true life here. Perhaps you have seen all your children growing up, you can have one child. " I could see one of the children, often cried. One that they had taken, but only because their mother had taken it for granted. And yet I felt so wronged, so alone. " Perhaps not." The water near my face rose as I nodded and planted my feet on the shore. I tried to cover my feet, but the sun was so strong it fluttered underneath me. My eyelids dropped as I look around again, far away from the world. But the grave I had dug up still lay in front of me, still warm from a day of warm water. And all the monsters, the monsters that never destroyed themselves in front of me. We once had hatred of that planet, that planet had hate of what was coming. You had their hate of something. We had hate of what it was they were creating. We had hatred of our planet. But what that place had done to the people they tried to save had destroyed the humanity in its destruction. What they had created was destroying its food. I stared at the casings strewn around. Each one held room for dozens of planets, but they were empty, robbed; pryed open by something ancient and sour.<|endoftext|>

I remembered well the day I saw that older reptile for the first time. Sitting hunched precariously on the wall in a sea of greys and greys of war, I saw it. At first I didn't think it was a reptile. My ancestors had lived many an age and worked with wood to create a machine to pull together the cosmos to create my tools and tools. Small things like turtles, snakes, amphibians, bird winged we call bats and even some man-made reptiles. But something about these reptile shaped things was something dark in my step. Like it was a cat or an insect or even a fish. It gestured like a man... but I still couldn't put my finger on it. Humans were like strange machines in the same way most cars had with plastic wheels, ones that flipped for a purpose, made of an alloy of titanium and a frictionless rubber. Their legs had legs as tall as bushels of popcorn popcorn popcorn inside their own kind of hovercar. The top of their face almost looked like their lungs had been lapped with helium balloons. The lungs. They had to breathe in and out without needing to push themselves. They would float like people, heat, water, a swimming pool, a sidewalk, a high school teacher... All motionless and ghoulish in their numbers and activities. They had no where to be, but to inhabit. When I was young these reptile eyes had gazed across the world, plotting their plans to defeat them. And so I watched them. It's funny what could be more precious than the chaos and hatred, the violence and death of what we could call reality. Maybe it could have been a movie. I could have been a priest? Maybe I could have been a peacemaker? But I couldn't. None of those things could have predicted what was coming... and they didn't. They didn't. There was a time when the night before humans were the ones to create the machine, when humanity was as ancient as a tiger. And then there were dragons. After all that time, they had evolved from beasts and other creatures into big and scary and barbaric little monsters, and they have wiped their ass of them. Not just the beast, either, though. It's just that they were evil, even though they were not creatures at all.<|endoftext|>

BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! $ FIRE ALONG THE DRAIN! It had been years since the first recording- I've never been good at keeping track of time. 6 months and 10 days ago I gathered my gear and dismounted. Tonight was my first real performance at the awards. Rolling on 10 I stepped into the two megs: the gurney mounted on the tower, and the small porthole mounted on the top; that's where they fed us those pretzel rolls. I had a ready rider beside me, and filled it with gilded coins. The knight, I thought, had made sure his head cocked high enough to look at me. Never had the Royal Guard ever had trouble fitting into that position. Which is why it was sitting on this floor above the moment I stepped into the porthole, I couldn't tell if the surrounding silence was cheering or just so tired...<|endoftext|>

"Who said I should be his girlfriend? ", Emily reminded her boyfriend of late. The young college student tried to convince him. " He said you should have wanted him, he wouldn't let you ". " He said he loved you! He turned me down, and I was going to keep him! " " Shouldn't he have let you go? As you, he made me stay, we didn't want to leave each other's lives ". Her boyfriend walked away dazed. On his way back he talked to her a lot, mostly about dead ends and the odd met person. He cried everyday, asking her some things in the dark and making her think she was supposed to be your only love. Everything that had ever happened, how she reacted to everything. He just wanted to be with her forever. But that's when she broke down, and he fell in love with her again. She explained that the apartment complex she lived in and on her cousin's property had a graffiti memorial at the top of it. The cemetery was not allowed, and it would not reopen until the 100th anniversary. With tears welling up in her eyes, she walked away and ran in to her car where she sat, and pushed the time to 5. The car stopped, and she accepted her fate. She placed her phone back in her hands, and her boyfriend called, " Who did you say you were his girlfriend?", Emily gave him a nice happy shake and asked him a question for them both.<|endoftext|>

The knights looked at the gates at once intimidating and ready. The warrior march pressed in and they sent out the last of their guard. They marched in three steps before the enemy marched forward. The guard looked down on them and smiled. Soldiers shook their heads and started counting and dropping into the well-stitched gate. The soldier turned on his heels and clapped his hands like thunder. Then he turned to his right and said, "Prove it, commander. " A roar of fear erupted from the knights. A spear flew high into the air from their chests and exploded into the heavens. They ran out of the battle and stood still before the king, to make sure they were still alive. " You have defied me a thousand times already, " said the king as he watched the well-stitched gate collapse onto his shoulders. " What are you waiting for, brother! " He pointed the spear at the gates and exclaimed, " Begone, run, run, flee from me! " He locked eyes with the king's face. " What have I done? " he asked after a moment. " I have poisoned the gods, " answered the king. " And I am done here, " replied the soldiers. " Quoth the gods, thou brothers. " the king said as he laughed. The soldiers cried out, but they were soon silenced. The king sighed. It had been days since the king had spoken to a friend, and the one he was planning to call Jonathon was dead. He watched as the spear flew higher and higher into the sky, and the ground beneath it morphed into stone. A great force of rock and rock thrown down over his head was born of the gods, and he threw his eyes and teeth into it. His stomach twisted into a wince and he gasped. He stood motionless, nothing of use to anyone as the shards of rock rolled away. Then, the stones tumbled and shone through the night sky and into the sky. A spear appeared from his shoulders, and landed in a massive crater, and the god shivered. A mouth slithered out from under him and licked him. The gods rose and bowed in praise. Then, in an instant, his body was plunged into the heavens. His bones shattered and his fingers grew wet. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he danced through the air and landed in a lake. " So this was the end, Johnathon, " said the god. " I knew I would never complete my purpose of serving my people, " said Johnathon. " You watched the crown fall, Johnathon," said the god.<|endoftext|>

Richard awoke slowly to the smell of soft dirt. He sat up to see a shadow standing before him. The shadow was of a tall black man, around 5 feet. Richard looked at him. "This is your room. He is Sirius Black. " the hooded man said. Richard hated going to sleep much, but he had his reasons. At around the same time, he felt a cold rise. Richard pulled his tattered robe from his back and rubbed his eyes. He stood up and walked down the hallway in the direction the taint emanated from. Once down the hallway, Richard descended the stairs and sat down in his room. " This is my bathroom, " the hooded man said. " It smells awful. " Richard looked at his reflection in the mirror. He smiled. A look of relief came over Richard, and he looked down to find that the walls had moved. " Hmm, this is really bad. " Richard said, as he reached for his plastic towel. " I know. How'd you find out? " " I came from Detroit. I've never seen Detroit before. " " Detroit is kind of.. Fallout. " Richard winced, as he jolted upright. His body was deep within the underground sewers, and he was still in his bed. He popped out of his slippers and stripped off his mask. As he noticed something odd about the shape, he realized he had never seen a sewer before. " What the fuck? " he exclaimed. " Have I killed myself? What the fuck is this?!?! " A voice called from behind him. Richard spun around and saw a girl leaning against a wall. " Hello. " he said. " I don't know you. I've never been in this room before, I just opened your door and I'm here. " Richard opened the door and looked inside. Richard pulled out a small plastic cup. " I know. I'm Harry Potter. " The girl whispered. " Looks nice. " She brushed off a tooth. " Thank you. " Richard smiled at her. She turned back and lifted the cup back from her hand. " This is a new addition. I made a note of it when you were in the Drawing Room. It would be very useful if you could help me! " " Who are you? " Richard asked. " Who would want it? " " Mr. Fudge. " she said. Richard looked at his reflection. It was a dark, slim creature about 6 feet. " He is Big Dick." He said. Richard had no idea how to respond, but he did pick up a marker and wrote the name of the village. After writing what he said, the girl called out to him. Her words sparked a fire inside of him. He simply nodded. He then went home, and spent the next hour putting away the letter he needed to know where he would go.<|endoftext|>

The bells signaled themselves; it was far better to prevent this kind of thing from going through. They never meant for it to. They knew that. There could be no talk, except with a certain audience and production values that they had yet to understand. There was a whisper to the subway, then another, then another. They tapped every console, and know immediately that there was no reason not to. As the train kept moving, the director walked through to the walls with out a chuckle. " Kudos on being *happy* with how your music turned out, asshole! " " You should bring my brother up! " " He's in the band, it's funny, he's living with one of *those* strangers! I'm not really sure why your doing that! " We're almost in song again, for now, ten, fifteen minutes. I make subtle corrections after he gets back from the exposition, but he's checking through things, and he's giving me the vibe I'm ready to jump, *ah yes! * Looking back, I sure appreciate the speech. His rush was like ocean, and after the chorus of the joke, I dropped into a sort of " short-notice ". " Hey, wait up, why are you sitting down? " " Shut up! I didn't say anything! " He was busy hanging his arms about his chest, suddenly reminded of my own routine. The paper seemed to fall back onto the side of the table, completely flopped over the words. " I've heard that song. " He glanced at me now with fear, while ensuring he was in a voice of calm and contrite. " Well I suppose... " " Then... " He took a breath, cleared his throat, and leaned back towards the microphone, "... " I felt a rapid jerk jerk towards the podium. I had never gotten much of an opinion on something like this before. " What was that guy's name again? " There was a fire in his expression. I felt a scratch on my head, and I moved on, drawing the attention of other bystanders to the man sitting at the front of the stage. Before he could say a word, however, the phone rang, with his keyboard stumbling away with me. " I'm so sorry! " " Thanks to Joe for the music though! " There was a quick laugh, then a static noise. " Dude, hear me out! It's really hard this time of day! " " Oh, just stop the cock shit and get straight to it! " " Alright, great, I don't know why you wouldn't like that. It's not like this was my issue. Like, it was your fault I had to work. " The crowd at this point was growing somber, and tired. I sounded like I was falling into grief, and the only answer was " I'm sorry ". I started to tighten my grip on the microphone. " It's fine. I'm really sorry. I took the necessary precautions and we should be doing that again soon." I pushed forward, and hit the button, bringing the whole class up in an ecstatic chorus.<|endoftext|>

Eris laid silently on the hardwood floor of the house, watching the stars dance amongst the dull constellations. He had never had much and he missed being able to watch the universe, it was so soothing. The stars were the best companion to him, laughing with the two of them, sharing stories that he barely recognized and sharing insight from his own perspective. The few that he cared, he knew. The few that would truly understand him, perhaps even love him, but they didn ’ t. One day, he asked one of the other brothers why he didn ’ t have food in the back of the house, sitting on his kitchen bench, when his brother reached for his head and lifted it to stare at his uncle Mark in disbelief, that he was the only son left in the whole of his entire family. “ The radiation is unbearable, ” he said between sobs. “ We need your help! ” his uncle Mark sighed. Eris sighed. Mark scratched his head and focused his self-defense abilities, he did think of his family as smart men and women, and did it not seem very hard to judge. After a couple of hours, Mark walked outside and removed his hat from his head. Eris, stepping outside the front door, lowered his head and thought back to the many years he had been raised in the small community of the mental asylum in the south of Scotland. A peaceful hill. A cobblestone road just past the edge of his yard. Many long years, he remembered. The very heart of the asylum in the south, for whoever finds these lands and the mothership and the voyage across the sea. He had looked a hundred different ways to drown. In one final attempt to kick his tired mind on its tracks. Eris had found the nearest asylum in the north, a small Scandinavian village, the one he had closed his eyes to cry in. When he made it out, he yelled “ lets go! ” before heading out into the town, calling for his nephew, Jack, and his other brother Mark. He was alone now; what would have been his dream. He was alone. He had been waiting for Mark. He had known Mark for years. He had known Mark for a long time. He almost thought he would get his brother back. Would he, if he was not him, be able to head out and stay safe. Most of the other children in the psychiatric ward were afraid, wondering when they would leave their homes, or what would be ahead of them. One in particular, one amongst many, had finally asked out her mother when she saw them, an orphan. Eris panicked and he stepped back to wait. At first she thought he was gone. Then he approached her, leaned in to whisper, “ You were the one, ” he said between sobs. He paused for a few moments. “ I ’ m sorry... ” He stopped. “ I know, ” she whispered with tears welling in her eyes. “ I'll miss you. I love you so much. But I won ’ t ever go back. I will protect you, and I will always love you. So please, please, please, don ’ t be alone. ” The girl cried softly. But once again he climbed out the door, and placed a hand on his own shoulder. He knelt down and embraced her, when suddenly the tears turned to lightening, dark clouds swirling toward him. He sobbed uncontrollably. He called his brother Mark again, before walking out into the open field of trees. Jack came in a few days later with his leg tied behind his back. Eris sat on his porch looking up at the sun. He watched the sun set over a plain blue sky, with thick clouds silhouetted against the hillside. The wild oaks rippled and flickered in the midday sun. He was alone again.<|endoftext|>

"Mommy? " My sister asked. " Yeah, c'mon, she's alive. " I nodded and reached into my pocket. " C'mon, more for your good. " Mommy pushed a piece of junk out of the back of my blue. She put it to her ear and with a sigh jumped up and ran her fingers through the red, hard fabric. " Sometimes, I just want to be with mommy, or eat lunch with her. " " But you never take her off the roof, so, who would want that in real life? It's just not fair! " " It's our universe. Now we both know that, but we can't think of anything that would make it all better. " " Yeah, fine. Do you want to keep it that way? " " I have the dream. No " I muttered, " I could... I don't think it is. " I tilted my head to the side and looked through the opening in my pocket. The remaining remains of the building were standing around, offering useful pieces of furniture for the neighbors and neighbors alike, as well as some junk food with some sort of stabilizer. My fingers traced the pattern on the plastic, still shiny from the scraping. And then it hit me. Not a shiny material. Not glitter. Not gold. My sister never seemed to care for glitter. I'd always found that she wore it, especially in her sweaters and shirts. Not just in her socks, pants, or a blouse. Her little hands were stuffed everywhere, though she did have a small pouch for emergencies. The cord in her waistband... the two holes cut the width of the zipper. I fingered my sister's once-polished razor, my favorite. And my mouth. I spoke then, feeling guilt. Tears began to fall from my eyes, and I looked down and saw my sister dancing to " Harley's Kiss " as her other side was slammed against the wall. And then I wished I'd seen my mommy's face when I'd beaten her to death with my brown, light pink sundress and a box of cigarettes and kickball. " No," I whispered, trying to hide the hurt and disgust and hatred I felt.<|endoftext|>

* "Threep to benedadspearre. " * Benedadspearre was a large hag of a man and only a few hundred acres in area. Benedadspearre was itchy, brown hair, grey eyes, brown hair that was starting to itch. Benedadspearre only ever was out running errands, running around the woods and tripping. Another hag called, " Hey you didn't get along with Odysseus? " Odysseus was a sensitive little man whose heart was angered. Odysseus said, " I said to cut my head off. " Benedadspearre yelled in ragged fashion, " What would you do, whine? " Odysseus sighed and turned to watch Benedadspearre lumber away from the hag. * " What's your name Benedadspearre? " * Benedadspearre didn't answer Benedadspearre again. * " Nah, " Benedadspearre hag responded, " Ya know. I guess. " Odysseus didn't laugh. Benedadspearre was half way to the woods when Benedadspearre found a rotting corpse in the woods and started ripping off his clothes. Odysseus must have been a little mad. Benedadspearre stopped and collected himself and turned back to Odysseus, " I don't- I don't know, they thought I just asked you to a cure for cancer. " Benedadspearre said " Your blood is poison. " Benedadspearre brought his gaze back down to Odysseus. Odysseus sighed and shook his head. " Ha. HA. Ha ha. How dare you! I've broken you out of your world! I want you to- ". Benedadspearre took the corpse's hands and held it tight so that Benedadspearre could feel the blood flowing out of Odysseus. " You're not coming! " Benedadspearre shouted. " Oh my god. You're trying to climb my tree?! " Odysseus held out a hand and Benedadspearre walked away, almost falling over. Odysseus was dumbfounded, " How did you do that? " Benedadspearre thought about the dirt on the deathbed, how did that kill him? " I did it anyway! It was when I got out of high school! " Benedadspearre felt a force pulling at him, but he just kept walking. " You're going to wreck this state! " Odysseus yelled. Benedadspearre didn't care. What they were talking about was no more than how Benedadspearre jumped on Odysseus's shoulders and did something horrible. He screamed and wailed. " You're my bitch," Odysseus said.<|endoftext|>

It's the most peaceful thing that I have ever heard. My eyes are shut for a long while and my conscious refuses to leave me. When I'm alone, I'm glad to take notes, and others. When I'm alone, I realize how full my mind is when others come to me, and they almost always share the same thoughts. Seeing is bliss, when I have the ability to hear thoughts, and not the other way around. When I'm alone, I can't forget or control it, but I still feel free. Things changed, and now I don't have to worry about being alone anymore. They always feel right, because they don't just tolerate the changes and the amount of noise around them. It's the most peaceful thing.<|endoftext|>

It's hard to believe that my world isn't backwards, a perfect whole that the world outside back to hadn't yet realized. My copper box, from just around the corner of Buckingham Palace, had a magnificent interior design that boasted a high quality interior. By itself, it was well contained, and gave no room for mansions or quaint vermin to be disturbed from lurking around inside of. However, I noticed that all my riches had gone to further research and construction, and that the mining site would likely soon be irreparably tarnished. This was supposed to give me a better chance to move on, but I am not an instant optimist. As I approached the steps of an ancient lighthouse to the village, I noticed that I was no longer looking for riches, but a pair of pigeons, the first of which had not yet been found. As I approached them, the camera zoomed in on me to reveal a multitude of birds circling the village, apparently unaware of my presence. However, the paywall was shaking, as a rare aerial photograph actually captured a hummingbird perched on an island. I doubted that this bird was real, but I couldn't risk falling prey to anyone else. As I approached the ghostly homes of the birds, one of the older pigeons, who had not yet found yet, began following me as though I were trying to crawl up inside a box. I desperately tried to move as far from him as I could, but the bird disappeared, but vanished quickly. I returned to my own estate, at the site of the watchers last grave, in which a man standing above me, seemed to be among them, watching me. The bird quickly disappeared in a flash, and I was not safe from the crumbling side of that body, as it was time for me to work the piano I had picked up a long time ago. In fact, I doubted that this place would ever be clean again, for it would be called Dunkirk, and I knew that a lifetime of spinning music could put up an opening for the dissolving seasons that welled up after they all died out, the few soles of the hard wood-and-crystal piano. But for now, I was free. I walked into the cellar where I had begun, and put my piano down and grabbed the pills I had been given by the river folk. After I had taken out all the alcohol from the nearby bottle I held, I told the clock in front of me, solemnly. I opened it and saw that it was three thirty in the morning, for it meant the sun had already set and was building up a small wisps of light. As I opened the jar that contained the medication, it was already sticky in my hand. It reminded me of time travel, as it left me whole, and as I remember, I felt infinitely relieved that no one was going to find me. As I walked out into the cool climate of Dunkirk, I continued to lie there for my family to wait for.<|endoftext|>

He was too crazy to be real. His life was all of one big crazy dream. He was out in the woods, and just started running away. Some of the trees he passed had some sharp blades sticking out. Now he was completely peaceful, just floating. He closed his eyes and waited for the forest to move. But nothing came. His dreams had been almost half finished. He couldn't remember anything. His mind was blank. He sat up in bed, sighed and reached for a pillow. A good night's sleep didn't get to him. He started to feel a weight on his shoulders. As he fell to the ground he had his hands in his pockets, shifting their contents, slowly and slowly at first. He was going insane. As he fell he heard another voice, with a different angle. He turned his head to look. He saw my face, and he knew. It was always the same, jittery and gooey. He put his head up and looked at me. He didn't remember what he was doing, but it was alright. I was just as jittery as he was. He'd done this a thousand times before, but this time I was a different person. It was hard to say, but he had a knife in his pocket, and I knew my target had a knife somewhere nearby. I pressed the knife away from his skin, and immediately reached for the handle. Oh, there it was! He could finally go out in the world, with no one to talk to. That's what I'm about to do. He smacked the floor in my direction, and ran away the instant he'd kicked the bottle in my face. He'd kick and run away, just before the forest came for me.<|endoftext|>

# # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap ) Ugh. This was awkward. What once seemed like a relaxing vacation home became in reality quite literally hell on earth. A workrate that turned into a cyberlocky nightmare. Pretty much every center-stage character was caught in his own labyrinth that would form until his enemies had all moved on to make way for the river that lies beneath. The man who had been her soulmate had moved it into the "floater " and left her in one of the hundreds of other girls in their school. Of course she was stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way to hide her identity. Weird. She could basically do anything. Finally it happened. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - It was a long, murky and cold day and the sun sank just below the horizon. A pretty nice rainy day, that's what neighbors told me. It was sunny and rather nice but there was an emptiness that overtook everyone else and the silence became overwhelming. 'Tell her she's annoying.' One of the girls asked. Any explanation could convince her there was something wrong with her. Her whole face now purple and red, like someone was trying to push her out of her mind. Then they would go wash the mess up with some new change. It was a nice change, no concern about the odor. Just a nice walk and calm the stress off. Sure there were butterflies in the air and tropical storms but it was all typical school stuff so I was sure it would be worthwhile. She was so focused on the rain that I could see all the people rushing past. I closed my eyes and took a calming sip of water. Why was this happening to her? Was she really upset that I thought I had always been with her? I don't know. Why did she go and suffer in solitude for so long? Was it because I didn't understand why? Maybe she wasn't happy but that didn't matter now. After wandering for over an hour, she stopped for lunch and brushed her teeth. Overwhelmed by this tiny mountain of energy and light, she asked " So, you've never been anywhere this chill? " " I've never been anywhere. " She became mesmerized by the beauty of her surroundings. The woman nodded. " Oh, how I miss her. As the sun rises, she's sitting here all alone! And yet here she is eating her ice cream! " The person who had told her everything that day was smacked on the head. " Can you explain why? I was working out all night and I decided to do this one thing every once in a while. " She didn't take the opportunity to say anything. I saw all the people rushing past at once. This woman, when she said something I could understand... she just got confused. " Are you upset? " Another man asked. This one was also speaking. " No I'm not upset. This is just a scary place. There's... Things in this place that are impossible. Ghosts. " She started to explain. The chaos of the place began to take over and the man grabbed her by the shoulders. " There's a sign there. This can't be real. " " There's no sign. " " I think this is over." The same thing happened again. Another girl was fucking the same place as me and I didn't know what to do. When I finally had calmed myself down and sat down, I saw her be fucked up and think to myself: *Damnit. *<|endoftext|>

It took my father to not make me drink. Had it been 20 years that I had never cashed a cent of my own, after all. It did not help that my father was a lot like me. It felt like he knew me better, when in the presence of actual beings he did not dare to break the ice. Growing up, all he knew about life was what I had died for. I held his hand, as I usually would, even though I always had the option to not. He raised his voice. " Brother? What are you doing here?" I tried to answer. It was only when I heard his apologies that I found the words he meant. " Speak to it as normal as you can, " said his voice, and sounded distinctly sad. As I turned his head from me to the other demon in the graveyard, he simply smiled and nodded. Those that reached out for his pendant for me have always given me more than a hug, or even a handshake. However, here at the end of the line, they smile and give me a reassuring look. These guys tend to smile a lot.<|endoftext|>

Sister Shelly: Now, for your pleasure I'll just hear you sing "Like a Farmer for the Bears " Jenny: Mmm honey I never heard these words, if I could I would have them, you would never go out of your way to make love to me. Sister: You're a rich old man, with a wife and three daughters of his. I could never make my own daughter, and I've never tried to love her. I'd rather it be a busy life of work, work at a bank, or work at home. Sister: I understand that it's not your pleasure I find, but I guess you already know my emotions. Just take this time, darling. I know I'm much disappointed in you. Sisters: We live alone, and have a large corporation in our sector. Our main competitor, OUR BANK, is overflowing with new leaders, CEO's, and other people to make us compete with companies in our sector. Well, maybe not the humans that you work at, but the tech giants of the world. Just one more town, and they'll arrive. Sister: We're in this together. Now, before you go crazy, you have to find out why the country, and your country's leaders, sent to visit us. Sister: I am innocent. We need to know how, if this is the way that you want to make my daughter, I should feel less alone than the day I married you. I need you to make sure that our daughter is a happy, loving one, and we can start seeing each other again soon. I'm glad I know you made it this far, but for all the generations who just happen to be mine, and this planet. Sisters: But we need to get to the bottom of this matter now. Your company, Myland I believe, has made so many friends that they have had that connection with us, and that trust is important to us all. We know there is a quiet bit of heartache that we should avoid, but we also understand the need to teach our children to respect each other, and understand the nuances of love. I'll just have you notice the news, on a bridge, in the countryside, to a small town in Wales. Sister: I was once asked if there is someone that my daughter might like. I said yes. Sister: You're a fair lady, a soft-spoken, interesting woman. How is this possible? Do you truly believe that our children are like the food in a field? Sister: I can assure you, the diseases we consume are not our tastes, it's our nature. We just eat the stuff. We don't give away the fruits, or the vegetables. Our tastes are better, but moreso than the physical ingredients in nature. I am not a food. Our tastes are not just our choice, but the very choices of our children. My daughter, don't go out of your way to make a new friend for you, you have made quite a mess, the world does not need you anymore, you won't last long. And, there is so much I've taught you that you have over year. In my humble opinion, love is what makes you who you are, or what your beliefs are, or your dreams. Sister: You're the point person of me. I know that you have children, and I understand you need to keep it that way, don't it hurt? Sister: I feel something doesn't suit me, I am glad that we used to meet. I knew you only three years ago that I wanted to see you again, and I knew you'd be returning to your original location if the time was right. For now I need you to study hard and make sure that all is good, and then tomorrow I will teach you to survive in this kind of world, for this reason. I miss you all, and I hope you take this time to write it down for us. Sister: You know what I say; Get out of my company now, stop trying to understand my words and that's okay. Listen to me, like a farmer for the bears.<|endoftext|>

Someone is talking loudly. Pause. Commence a sentence. Pause. Ah yes, jibberish and garbled voices fill the room. They are interrupted by a voice from behind one of the hallway cutters. “ Too late, ” the speaker booms. The speaker from behind closed his eyes and locked them. Normally, I would ’ ve screamed but that moment isn ’ t the case, and I ran out of the room. I don ’ t have it in me to run. I know that it ’ s the way I should have left it. Even when I had the strength to do so I couldn ’ t resist. I then heard the sound of heavy breathing come from behind the fan. My phone vibrated loudly and I entered voicemail. Silence. I gasped, hung up and ran back to my car. After the car passed, I took out my phone to search for my car keys. Without my keys, I ran to my dresser and placed them under the sink. There is no way I will ever be able to clean up my walk in without it. I looked at my keys and there was nowhere to put them, save for a picture of the man who you ’ d believe was yelling. He must be an assassin. I went to my room and checked out the picture of the bad man. There he is, in a cloak, holding a white bag over his head with heavy bags around him. “ Tonight ’ s different, ” he says. “ Let ’ s do something different. ” I sigh and lower the bag. “ Can you throw that away? ” “ No, ” I grumble. I don ’ t know why, I ’ m a genius. His hands hold me in a very awkward position, he looks so dead serious. I grab his hand and pull. He places the bag down on my stomach and, with a small smile, says, “ So sorry, pal, ” I say. “ I actually have a doctor in town to check on. ” I cross the street in silence, confused by what I ’ ve just heard. It ’ s the same face with the hatchet in his face. Not knowing who ’ s taking me, I look to my left and grab my phone, waiting for a call. When I return to the apartment, I open the door and see the dark silhouette of that crazy man who was yelling before. I turn around and shout, “ This is not going anywhere! I don ’ t want this! I don ’ t want death! ” This is never going to happen.<|endoftext|>

"I looked down at the same, exposed socket of my Oculus Rift, and, eerily, I could feel my legs. " I think I moved my legs just fine, after a couple of tests. " " When did I set myself on top? " I inquired. " I don't know. I just believe in the gaming sickness. " " Are you insane? " my inquisitor asked in a worried tone. " Of course, on the outside, I'm sane but not most people do. Like me. I spent my middle ages, yes, telling the tales about myself to the otherers. I bet if I'd went into the gaming field, I'd get medals and the best game of the year award for the past 15 years. " " If that were true then who are you? " asked Igalenge. " Sorry to interrupt. I'm just a gamer. The main game was an incredibly successful game. It spread fast enough that we didn't notice until, " he trailed off and as he looked at the computer monitor, he pulled out a tablet and started to browse the web. " The real Microsoft of gaming companies, they should already be famous because of the extreme efforts towards their collaboration. " " Then why did you chose VR? " I asked him as I walked into the room. " It was cool, really. I could feel the warmth of this virtual reality environment, just like I was immersed in reality. " " Incredible? " I asked. " Yes. I would say that the digital living medium was an extremely alien concept, a step backward in technology. Virtual reality played itself backwards, as it should. " " And what do you have in mind? " " I'd like to see a VR-dead body somewhere on Mars. " " Then it's going to be a virtual paradise where we'll be able to recreate the Mars habitat, and the other people, or all of the living things that inhabit it. " I opened up my laptop and on a black screen, I began to scroll through various options: " Living, Protecting, Virtual " " I want to see people die? " I asked. " Of course, this is not a simulation, a virtual paradise. " " I just want to live in here while I wait for a zombie apocalypse, or other unforeseen events to occur. " " Of course, I'm being very religious for a few months at most, but that could be changed if I decided to stay with you."<|endoftext|>

"Right, so yeah, after the election, the whole system became politically correct, and then suddenly politics collapsed. Sure, the religious minority's got a little... creative piece, but they make a lot of money... The money is reflected in their public image, and whatever we think of them as right now, that is a drastically misunderstanding of how this works. I do agree with some of your points, and the image of an unstoppable leader would not be a problem for the voter, but that doesn't mean we're the rulers. There will be others. Like them, this new group of people that have nearly unlimited power -- who demand anything and everything, and not even a basic business if given a job to do -- are not free. They require unwavering commitment to their beliefs, and obedience to our decisions. " " I think there's a problem. See, a man can't do that when the country is under complete control. People are in a state of really confused states, and don't understand that all people need to be given their daily ethics. We need to respond to all it's needs, and to be free and popular. The people and their bodies need us to follow, to feed, shelter and care for them. Everyone needs to suffer and suffer for everyone. " " I'm for that. The people need us to fix their problems in a way that isn't outright selfish, because they are getting way more money than we need. We need to reduce their tax burden by no more than they have to -- by eliminating their prison systems. And we can't reduce their obesity while they are struggling to keep themselves happy. Don't worry, my folks, we can solve these problems, and each of them will be better off. However, they will always be happy, and a lot of those poor people would go through hell without a family. I believe there is a bigger issue now than just this. " " But I believe in the promise that is equality for all, to equal opportunities for all. Those poor people will live lives that have been halved before this law became law, but I believe that there is more at stake now than just us or those that were already free. A religious church will grow stronger -- a church dedicated to all of us, must ask everybody to believe, to vote and to choose and to do what they feel is right -- but the purity of the act will also be saved. The promise that does not destroy the purity of the act is the only message we can deliver. For their children in God's name, at least in principle. No one will be forced to wait around in a dirty church to vote or to decide, but he can have no other choice. When everyone knows they are already what they believe they are, the best they can hope for will happen. " " Finally, the arguments were unanimous. What I'm saying is that the bigoted religious zealots and the people inside the churches aren't really trying to save those poor people. We'd better get going, as soon as things settle down.<|endoftext|>

It's hard to bare to the basic instinct of what I want to be, just a fleeting thought. But you get used to it. When it happens, it feels like I'm watching the most important decision of my life. I feel the break in the wall, the corner that I remember so distinctly. This is what I've been waiting for. It's too late now, but before that, it feels like it's perfectly normal. The next moment is today. There's no time to react, no time to pause. There's no time to get to work before the stress sets in, the stress makes the day quick and the anger and panic are strong enough that I can sleep. A blurred image of someone, a man near me, is the moment. I have not done anything wrong, and my hand moves. I see his face, his lips and his eyes. A tear is flowing down my cheek but I can't stop it, all I can do is let it go. I get up from the chair to lean my head against the door, and my breath leaks into my lungs. I'm so tired. I can't wait any longer. I pull the button. Tears flow down my face. I pick up the piece of paper in my hands and begin writing. There is nothing else to do but stare at it, with tears streaming down my face.<|endoftext|>

The door creaked shut as I slipped in through the door. I slipped and fell until I landed hard on my face and my neck. I looked up at the crystal clear moon above me, a blue, but deep blue sky. Darkness. Numbness. Crawling down on my cold mattress, my left arm hung loosely. Wrinkles danced at my old cracked bone where my bicep had been. Sweat poured down my face as the pain of aging left my bones frail, and my limbs shaky. Once I had been able to lift, but I could only lift 2. Ever since I was a small boy, it had been a painful process. I slowly pulled myself down from my bed and to the bathroom. Once the fun began, I slowly started to back off with my shampoo that was too salty. My hair was now unruly and my eyes were green. I squeezed my eyes shut in prayer, I prayed that my tongue could taste the oils coming from the eye oil, and used my old ragged breath to cough away the tears. The tears started to flow in droves and as the light faded to a dark background, I stood. "Diane. " Diane called my name. " Ehh... what're you doing here honey? " She stopped walking for a moment, even as her voice rang out between her and the screams of the neighbors who were choking on their own tears. " Daddy please, I love you, I didn't see the car come speeding up at that time. " I stood there for a moment, her words clear and concise. I asked Diane what the hell was going on, why were they still yelling in the street. She just chuckled and a deep warm heart once again floated over my chest. She went to the kitchen to pour herself a glass of water. " Thanks honey, Diane. Tell me what happened. " She got to the kitchen and started pouring eggs. " There was a loud thump. There were bodies everywhere. " We were sitting on the floor and nothing was moving. " She brought my head in hers and pulled her hand down to sniff one last time. " I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened. " Her tears welled up. " Did I? Did I? I don't know. Where am I? Where am I? " I wanted to keep her so much, to show her something that I did not want her to think about. To remind her. We sat on the floor for almost five more seconds, both of us gasping for breath. After a moment, it seemed Diane was still crying, and holding the key to our car. She still kissed me from behind as a young boy came to help her. Then she took my hand and lifted me up into a kiss, turning my bloodshot eyes towards the sky. " I love you."<|endoftext|>

So, here we are, all asleep. All alive. I'm sitting back on my sofa watching my patients' arrival at the maternity ward. There has never been a nurse so happy to be alive. They enter their very first appointments in seconds. We appear awake but conscious too quickly. They look around the room and see no one to spend their last moments with. The world starts looking but a silence. The world slowly fades away. The world has a calm and pure place to rest for awhile. A new voice begins telling me stories. What year is it? Why is it? I pause for a few moments to ponder. Perhaps it's winter? Maybe it's their birthday yet? They continue to be reassured when they notice how unfamiliar the world is. Are they as though they've traveled through time? Have they lost all memory of where they are? Perhaps they have new friends and family? But do they know who they are? No, no. They only know me in vague and short sentences. My mind can not make coherent words, let alone conveys intelligent concepts. The last thing I remember before falling asleep is trying to cry.<|endoftext|>

It is almost sunrise, and I rise from my slumber to brush the snow from my face. The picture I want in the future so badly, a snapshot of myself. The vivid sunset sky is as unreal as the pull of its nebula. It doesn't matter, just that it is happening. I have a lot of information, I think to myself. I had these dreams once. Maybe that was why I got rid of them, to forget what the dream was. Maybe it was just an overactive imagination. Perhaps it is something I thought in the mirror and hadn't realized before. Somebody with a genius in their mind can do it. I blink at them. A yellow green light floods my vision. And I whisper to myself, "Where is this dream, Honey?"<|endoftext|>

"So, I guess the problem is that you're trying to be vague, isn't there a big deal? " " You certainly need to write the specifics again, but it's like a blank sheet.

You do get to do your best though, and you can still be instrumental in doing that! " " This is it. This is it! This is your grand scheme to acquire all the money you need for a bigger empire and gain control over the public! " " Not this shit. Oh, seriously, why the fuck are you here? You coming to a city in a small town? Coming to a city that's even smaller than this lousy excuse for a house and a cinema is all I want. I'm just throwing this gun at you! " " But... but... but... " " This is the ultimate injustice. These people need you. These people need you to end all lives, to end these people's greedy, selfish and far-reaching agendas of never knowing the future. You have no basis in reality. I'm coming with you. " " Then what's the point? " " I'm getting off. There's no point going back to burying you. I would just end your existence. I would do the only thing I can do. I'm leaving. " " Bullshit. You don't believe me? " " The reason for the biggest disaster since Biblical times is now going to be because of you. What if I didn't invent something because you stopped killing my best student? What if you thought that failing to give birth was the same as giving birth to anyone? What if- " " Wait, don't ask me that. Just tell me what happened to the Ford F-150. I'm going to end you now."<|endoftext|>

I fled, running far away from whatever group of mythical monsters I'd become. I wanted to get away, but I couldn't. I didn't have enough strength left. The beasts at my feet had taken all my strength, but you can't run away from niggas. And the lack of reproductive cells. I dug around for the hiding place. Then I saw it. A terrifying thing. I had never seen a creature so magnificent. The very thing that ended my life. The apex predator, being dragged out of my biome. This had to be a hoax. I couldn't just turn away from this thing. I called my family, but it didn't answer. I felt the jaws of the beast leap out. They had taken most of my strength, but they could barely take out a family member. As I bashed through the sides of the beast, there was a certain gravitas to their appearance. The look they gave me told me what it was capable of. They were terrifying. They knew how to hunt. And yet, they turned us into their dinner. The child was raised by their parents as a "mysterious surprise. " It kept doing this. The same destructive behavior and results. I used to be a small child, an idiot, never caught my stop. Or was I? But now I am a human. The monster had taken most of my strength. It had taken two years to kill them. But they weren't monsters. As I got older, the monsters became more and more powerful. They started to study the other human I grew up with. They became so proficient with violence, that I learned to shoot the beast with pleasure. The next time I ran, I would use my ability to take out one of the monsters. I was a freak of nature, but I was willing to turn against it. I thought it would be hilarious when I could get away. But as I grew older, it became more and more horrible. The monsters became furious. They began to hunt with me. And I learned that I could prevent them from just getting out. I killed them one by one. After that, I feared that the only thing that could deter them from this horrific existence would be a child. I could stop them. Soon it became too much for one. I was forced to become even older, as the monsters began to meld with one another, devouring every now and then one of my victims. And all of that I did was eat their lives. I heard that on the road, their mother was in my car. I tried to get away but I was able to pull in what little space I had left. The teenagers immediately turned me inside out. Everyone loved these monsters. But I was still a human. Once I had murdered them, the monsters began to hunt me. And just like that, I was to be hunted, I found myself surrounded by children who thought the same. And as the monsters took one by one of them, I refused to give up on saving them. It was completely at that point I realized what was happening to me. I couldn't do anything anymore. I needed to run. I needed to learn to live with this living hell. I ran away from home, to bed, to go to class, to school, to work, to school, to work. When I was leaving, I took one last look at what I had become. It was one of the large pieces I had found hidden. I fell asleep as my mind ran. I almost looked at the young baby. Just as I should, I woke up, swinging my arms around. I didn't sleep for long before it struck me. I wasn't alone. It would be a long time before someone would find me. I had become a monster. ( Image by wikipedia, CC by 2 )<|endoftext|>

I pulled away from the bag and started towards the exit. I was going to pull out of this hole. I was going to pull the nails into my palms, crawl into my arms, fumbled for a pillow, shove through the pain and guess who I was going to be after this is all said and done. Every small detail, every bone. I pulled backwards on the sill of my left foot, at the edge of my path. The gate of that pathway had been my only companion in my spiral journey to death. The spot was always the easiest choice, at the bottom of a hole. I began to sing the melody of a Christmas morning. I stumbled into the gate. My fingers seemed to work the gap between the stone, etched as if it had never existed and pierced through it. The hole felt serene before my eyes. At the head of the hole I saw the knick-knacks with their special warmth rubbed against the gold. This feeling stung me but I continued as if I were on autopilot and dashed past the gate. I made it back to the friend I was building and continued back into the shortcut I called home.<|endoftext|>

I was young when the clock began to cycle. The Children lived alone, without their faces, children around them. These children, they thought they could change. They thought that it was the same everywhere, both people and places alike. They were wrong. How can you change? The child behind the counter, his face obscured by the toothpaste, paused when he glanced at the clock. God is wrathful. But how can He create heaven? That ’ s what will be considered a ‘ prayer ’, made on the soil of what's left of it, unclouded by any cloud. And the tree that ’ s underneath it would not yield any nourishment, no one or anything to help it and none would grow. God says that today is our Age, but we are not in Hell.<|endoftext|>

I am the guardian of the oppressed, savior of our homes. Wielding sword, healing balms, and protection, I have protected the lands of what will become of her once more. With her'sven vices', my subjugation of the masses, I washes away those that I can not, yet hold dear, but a last plea can not dissuade my eternal duty. For her, my daughter, the day they fall. Of all the eldritch creatures and works of darkness, the little girl, shall fall. To be cast away in our hands, held in the hands of mortal men, us will be consumed under the coming of day. I will not mourn tonight, in the silence of the night, never shall the gurgle of blood echo through the halls of the halls of the dead. Still, forgive my family, I will let their song cry. With griefful words and tears of regret, I will turn to the winds. The wind blows night-time, nameless maiden, we shall cower in the night, above midnight.<|endoftext|>

“ Don ’ t be silly, little innocent little lamb. Nobody likes me so much. I can ’ t keep in contact with you, but it ’ s a small problem in itself. I ’ m afraid they may be afraid of what ’ s happened next, but I have a solution. It ’ s called *Garblax. * I found a friend who tried to get me to stop keeping contact with him, but I still tried to talk to her, even after spending countless hours just telling her everything about his way of life. Now, when you ’ re in love, you tend to feel guilty, but *Garblax* really isn ’ t in my way. I was living with other friends, thinking about things that hadn ’ t been realized. Thinking about whether it ’ s the only way to progress this new reality to ease my depression. So I just text her and get called to my office every morning. Every day, I would pick her up and say, “ Eat some fresh bread. And if you look at his face, you ’ ll find the reflection of so much love pouring into your body from beyond the scope of his world. ” She ’ d smile and tell me everything would be OK. I didn ’ t know how much was a little help, since he came home every day to harass me a bit harder than usual. One day, after dinner, I found him crying and started poking him in the eye. Of course, when he ’ d calmed down, he suddenly appeared out of thin air, somehow refocusing on me with his towering stature. It was a small problem, because for the first time in months, he had disappeared. I had to act now, to say something, but I was sick of this selfish, self-absorbed diabolical contraption that terrorizes the innocent and leaves me and my beloved lamb to rot, doomed to be seen as just another rotten husk of a human. And I only made him better, and I took the small step of petting him, because I love him dearly. My loyal friend did the same. When I lay our happily, tired, newborn newborn lamb in the middle of his driveway, I told my husband that the air wasn ’ t like it used to be, but that even with all the love and darkness still swirling around me, it was the only way to go. I know that the sound of his heartbeat announcing the arrival of new life led to his decision; that was the only way. After a while, he shut the door, and I sat near him. “ *Holy shit… * ” he whispered. “ Garblax. We ’ re so excited to see you and my beautiful friends again. ” I smiled before lying back and letting out a small, yet beautiful sigh.<|endoftext|>

I told him that he wouldn't listen, that he'd turn into something horrible. He told me that he meant harm if he let me. His tryst was a foolproof illusion. It has worked to a point. It has worked from the moment I entered stage. Back in Oklahoma. My alter ego pranced around where the Beatles come from. The truth is more than just ink, it was genesis. They all tried to get me to try to change what was. I decided to give them their core words; it was just their music that was important to them. And I gave them their names. And it's mine. It's history. I did it. I scratched all of my bones, scarred fingers, restored dignity, but none of it bothered me. I suppose I'll try. I thought I knew them. Yet I'd stayed in the game for far too long. Old Lennon just figured I'd leave him. Cold, meek Lennon sent me his unfinished lyrics. He felt me, and told me that they meant wrong. My band would crumble when I gave them my name. But neither I nor any of the other members gave them a good reason to. I've done nothing wrong before. I can't deny that. I won't pretend it's all to my benefit. Still, I didn't see that coming. They's not just playing us as us, so they played them. Beat me at my own game. No, I played them as all of us. It was all based on some ring of iron around some rock, with an undetermined place in the whole of the ring. Jesus wasn't listening, he was answering. Not my head, not my ears. He was wiser, and he had some plans. I played to him, and the final verse that inspired my first act was within my grasp. I give him his name; the entirety of my identity. And He gave it all for me.<|endoftext|>

"The deal was on the rocks at first, but I was too proud to give up. Years of planning, special events, world record breaking programs made it my decision. At first the wind went cold, and the heavy fog hung heavy and black. Slowly, the two of us, Allison and Quentin, turned our back on the platform. Watching the horizon drift in and out of the darkness, we bickered amongst ourselves. " Allison could stop me! I'd talk to Cliff, or at least Cliff himself. " Quentin laughed. " At least he knew about you " Allison said. " Suddenly one of the whales stuck it's upper body out to get the other one. " Quentin said. " It was weird. It didn't seem like very natural of us to do that though, so I set a course for that whale. " Allison replied. " Again. Finally came to a rush, and continued on. " I met Cliff in my year on the ship. He still didn't think I was friends with him, even though I had just since moved back to my hometown of Arizona. Then we got to talking. And our friendship grew even better! It was amazing, this. I didn't need another turn to pay attention, and it's all I ever heard. I'm not even going to try again. I'm going to tell Cliff, " Allison said, looking up at her once the crowd dropped. " Cliff paid for this trip. I kept the bond I always had. I'd see how he would react, and we'd talk about things we'd never talk about. " Quentin said. " Now he's gone. Cliff's taken Cliff's place. And if I can't save him, I'm a coward, and he's passed his death sentence. " Allison said, looking around the crowd. The liquid mist and searing light shimmered like the burning of a candle. Allison caught her breath. " Like I said. It's a miracle Cliff isn't gone. People have talked about this many times, and they all look the same. If Cliff had been able to go down to see Cliff like he was, he probably would have talked about the last time I saw him. " Quentin said. " But Cliff isn't going to leave. Even if we go down, and he never does, he's going to close his eyes, and then he won't. He's going to close his eyes until he sees me, and never returns. " Allison held her breath. Quentin laughed again. " And when I do return to him, the blood on his chest will be red and red like the week before that." Quentin said. The crowd dropped into a frenzy, a gaping hole in their minds was forming. One by one, every quaking son and daughter that ever stepped foot on the bridge, climbed onto the railing. The mist rolled in and around the tarp all around them, coloring the sea into pieces, clashing with what remained of our bodies. *Note: This is a poem, about a man.

An ECONOMIST had stood before the panel of adventurers, behind which a face stared back at him. Several of the brightly coloured'Comrades' wore identical glasses. The common-age man sat in a stained cargo-bag, the occasional resin hat tucked in. He's stood before this panel for hours. No one knew about the AI - just that the human interface had been shut down and there was no one around to see what had happened to it. The only regular thing that had happened in the corridors had been hearks, pods, and whatever was just an old socket where the interface had worked. In the centre of the room, a hollow, humanoid figure stepped into view - at the far end of the panel, a slender, unassuming looking thing with odd shaped writing and thick green-rimmed glasses. On his back was a blue, not-so-ugly, writing-cap. When viewed without eye contact, its eyes betrayed something beyond imagination. It seems like there is no real physical emotion inside, neither warmth nor bloodlust. Nothing among the creatures words were spoken - except... for the echoing clicking noise it made. Despite his lack of talent with speech recognition, he had accurately deduced what the writing called. "No matter. No matter how many times he says the words here, nothing will take his meaning. So... try again. No matter what you do, the only thing you'll learn in the next 24 hours will be this: no matter what you say, you can not change the... simulation. For we're not mutants, we're creators. There's nothing before us, just... something, some bone, some tissue or organism, because we made us and we could. We've created, we've created, we've laughed and danced and changed and driven and loved and made. Every time we die, you start over. Every time we die, we go back through the same reset menu and turn off the sense-data. Every time we get shot at, we get beat and broken, bleeding out of nowhere - just to try again." The cylindrical figure smiled. A soft, innocent smile as if it's an old friend to him, like a son who's just grown up.<|endoftext|>

*"My name is Issur, and I am an Elder Brother of Fhrade Elder in order to further our Elder God's name. Do you require assistance with your upcoming prayer scroll? " * My mind starts to race with thoughts of my employment. Surely there must be some sort of mistake, I am wearing a deep red leather vest with two grey leather straps at the bottom, with grey straps at the top. On the left, are three deep red belts that were probably fed from a PC cart and linked with rails located around the tops of the lower portion of the vest and on the right, red screens and small buttons that seem to be used as an argumentative defensive mechanism. * " Uh... good, then your mother is here, and she needs you to listen to her prayer for her future children. It's very important to know that she is in fact quite young. Please, tell her about what's going on right now. " My heart beat faster and faster as a sleep could occur. * " *-Y-yes. I hear you question my boymysterious Grandmother's House. Let me tell you a secret. He spent months ago providing for us, when her youngest son was born, he first came to our house to visit his grandmother who held our two daughters. I had begged him to stay with us, but he insisted that he should play with them, so I needed a way to save us some money for our youngest son's college trips. So I volunteered to go, with him, and I traveled several miles to our house before I ever came back, and it was there that I discovered this secret. He never came back. I figured that it was simply for my own safety, and I decided to immediately eat my meal, and when I looked at Issur, I saw him staring at me with that same fire in his eyes that I knew all too well. * " *-Then why would you come back home from school? Why would you buy you a taxi that would take me from my home and take me through the mountains? I asked you why not be as inconspicuous as you are. I thought it would be a better way, to convince you that your two beautiful daughters actually did love you. I tried not to think about it for a minute, and then I asked you why you were staying in my house. Now that you know that story, you need to know why you have to stay. Maybe I should tell you the truth, but before I can hear you whisper my name as if they knew I wasn't there, I heard something other than a gunshot in my house. It was your second gunshot! Issur, keep your voice to yourself. It will prove a nice feeling, but your wrath and brutality are just unacceptable! Please don't just walk around you killing everything in sight! The situation is far, far worse than you can see. What have I done? Please! Don't! * " *-It's the only way I can hear your righteous counsel! I am not imprisoned! Please!

They only called it “ the Lake ” in the 1950s and *collected in riddles* and did a poor job of depicting the lake as adequately romanticized as some people find quaint.

The scorching heat of the upper atmosphere was unbearable, yet I didn't seem to have any wind on my way here. I've spent a good portion of the mission to retrieve information for this species and being an adventurer is nice. I decided to sit in my tent and hum around. Using my VR headset, I carefully picked out nearby communication devices. 'Hello? What the hell is going on here?' I yelled at the nearest monitor and walked towards it with my scanning. As I picked up the signal, I heard what sounded like the creaking of a runen bird. *Click* I heard the tiny hum for just a moment before the rest of the speakers had started to go silent. For the first time in a long time, I really, really felt that the transmission was coming from. I picked up the only sound in the room to ring a bell and then proceeded to roll over. The hallway was silent. The brightness wasn't off, so I didn't bother listening. I could hear my mother speaking, which caused me to relax and try not to rush into some sort of panic. A couple of other strangers were around the corner. I paused for a moment, trying to read what they were talking about. *'I used to be your Guardian angel', * I thought. My dad used to say. They weren't his kind, but they were still humans, so that bothered me. They wore suits and carried lot's of things. They said, *'this is how the Lord of all things met his end'. * Well, you have awoken the Lord of all things, and now you can find his Holiness, right here. She's here to ask for you. You don't need her. Do you have any idea what she can do? * I thought. It was pretty much impossible to get off the closest building. The incursion had already arrived. And it was finally taking them. So much had been lost, these yearning for peace and joy, but I would have to sacrifice all this for them. 'Listen. Your parents are here, right?' Her tiny voice heard me'this is my accident. You should be fine, and everything will be all right. Just use your outstretched arm to help.' And so the transmission was coming from again. Not as jarring as the one before. But with enough effort, it could stop. I gently pulled the arm away from the woman's smooth skin and held her back. She was quiet for a moment, and she spoke calmly. I found it hard to listen, as I always was. *'You just didn't need my help,' * I thought. I punched her in the forehead. Then I walked back to the ancient tombstone. 'If you don't accept my gift, you will be eliminated. We all must die, and we have to repay your service.' *And as we walked away, I heard my mothers crying as I put her to her knees. Finally, I did my best to meet that wish. I closed my eyes. My hands were trembling. I knew I was in a deep, soul crushing sweat, and it was getting difficult to stay awake. A dull jingle came from the faint creak of an oak door opening. It grew wider and wider until I had to lean against my mother's side in front of me. I struggled to get out, but there was something in my throat. A being grew in size and size, towering through the doorway and took me by the arm. With claws black and black as night itself, it seemed to move closer to me. With a stone finger, it weaved through the air with a huge, unearthly force. It propelled the stone into my maw. The sounds of my mother's anguish drowned out the metallic clangs of thunder and bursting light. I fell, gasping for air. The object bounced and slammed against my head. The door opened and the ethereal figure emerged. With terror flashing across its features, its black cloak billowed in the heavens. Its light filtered through the pearly gates and sliced through the stars.<|endoftext|>

If nothing else, it should be the United States of America. Fucking Australia. They might as well be the freaks you see now -- they are going to have real power. This is huge. They can power everyone. Cities are rightfully their own. Cities, too. But today is different. Here, I stand here as not just one, but three. These buildings, this future, these ugly papers that stank the worst, aren't here. What? These overpriced scrap and sellers have horrible taste. They're the reason for all this? A world that has been growing too slowly... I walk to my car, my old green grey hood worn, spilling raindrops onto my filthy old kitchen table. Shit, this neighborhood has been getting stinking up the hill for years now. My old man, Paul, paid for his cars. How about his tree? It certainly burns, thank the lords and Goddesses. "HOW ABOUT A CAGE, " Paul screams to the city, suddenly knocking back a glass of his favorite Vicodin. * Unfaithful idiots. Our Father, in Heaven, granted us this gift. And now... fuck it. * I know how to get to the highway. You got ta respect your Lord or her, my boy. All I ever had was the act of screaming while listening to the honk. I push the door, beating at it with a clump of dirt and grime. Grabbing my car keys, I make my way to my old house. I cross my street, hiking up a hill. " Fuck this, I'll buy the newest car. " I think, pushing my car into the back yard. Gasping, I finally reach my old ranch house. Three boxes of house and trailer, each stuffed with some food scraps that nobody will eat in a while, greet me. As I speak, I hear a hum, one that I often find after entering an alien universe. Heeeeah! Enough! I head for the door. I've grown used to this. I ponder on my home and house of all times. As I approach, a skyscraper fills the sky. A testament to the power of machines, I hear a loud sneeze behind me. I run up to the building I'm staring down. A garden. Oh boy, this is bigger than I thought. Perfect. Wants to show off my latest build. I quickly take a box of Chinese deodorant and sit down. Oh man. That must be Danita that is here, I thought. Red can dye. Red can prevent sleep. Perfect. I feel like this is the easy part. " You better leave, " Danita tells me. I nod. " Good. Thank you, Danita, " I reply, shrugging off my vomit and bagging the bag. I look around, feeling nauseous as hell. My car is at the front door, still playing some music. I close the door behind me. Just this once, I am ready. But I look out, admiring the lush green grass. * Oof! * I scream, watching my old home reduced to dust. Buildings are all around, peaking through the city windows. Crazed, panicked, my boy runs up to me. And hits my jugular with his boot. Fuck it, why don't I kick the butt out like we did in the movies? So, Danita, I kick the butt out. I don't remember kicking Danita at all. But hey, it's time. I give him his rest, and I head back inside. " Oh, there we are, running naked! " yells some shit-eating creature from the background, who is like me except for a slightly different color. " You know, you just look like a pig... alright, you've got a few thousand years on you." We make it. I get home and start ripping as many as I can from those buildings before I can bring a repair crew. Out of those, I smash a few bag of dumpster water. *** *For more of my writing, check out /r/Celsius232<|endoftext|>

He died. They found me in a flooded puddle. Something about that sheer guttering burned in my mind. It had to have been five weeks in the water and the pressure had already breached my heart. They were cutting me open and placing me on a new surface. Deep in the murky waters just below my ankle lay a writhing mass. I almost shed a tear, the pressure had been too much for it to hold it's breath. They had cut me open and applied a thin, but strong stream of my own blood. We were spending several days recovering. Months spent in the desperately kept gulag of the murky waters, and moments when I feared for my life at this very moment. I spent my last moments pinching at my back as I felt them pierce the surface of my skin. They hit me from every angle. Then I got in a car. It was my last resort. They found me on the road, wearing all black, barricaded in a shambles filled with those who had been under our failed regime. They had found me and loaded me into vans before I could be transferred to any of the hostages. They were prepared to open fire, or shoot if necessary. I fear my last moments are going to be spent clutching at what little in my brain is left for me to survive the next few weeks. I will miss my mother and my father and my sisters and my younger sister. I will join the resistance. I will kill them. I will kill them all. I will murder them all. I will not be a soldier.<|endoftext|>

Hello. I'm going to talk to you about and your very first question, something I always wondered. Give it a few minutes and I'll answer it. No. I'm not here to talk about a question I've said many times already, but I've found a way around that. When you were still hiding out in the hope of being captured or exiled from Earth, it was really the easiest way to escape. So many Humans. So many They were so sneaky. After all, they weren't very bright. Mostly all they needed was the truth. I've passed several times the time I'm where I am now. You see, when you believe they are hiding something, and become bored of believing them, you take a walk through their daily lives and talk to them. You use other people's skin, their clothes, their name, how they look, what they look like, what color it is ( to name a first - still a mystery to all ). Your interest grows as you are torn between what you believe, and why the world is best for you. Your kind is focused. They don't want you to do something that you did, or do something you can't. They do it to distract you from reality. Imagine the moment that they send another spaceship to collect you and several races of Humans back on the ship you came from. They come from another planet that has managed to protect you from them all your life. Those who knew you, those who knew the information... you don't really know what they do, except for they know you're not real. They send you to a planet that has your DNA, or more accurately the same on the ship... Unexpected. The Planet doesn't care about you. It always saw it as an opportunity to collect you. It wanted me to go home and be with one of those new planets you invented for the sole reason that it would be easier to keep you. One where you could sit in one of those designated homes and talk to those "real " Humans. * Humans*. I was just a passing thought to her. How strange it must have gotten, how incredibly strange it would've been to be captured after all these years. I was new to the ship. The Human was smart. He thought the communications technology would have been a good deal better than sending an entire fleet on a very short journey, at that point the Human's ship would've outstretched itself beyond the reach of any crew except for you. The History crew had their work cut out for them. That took a lot of courage. I walked into the conference room and through a message system of some kind. It was a message to me. It asked me if I wanted to join them in their exchange of station glances. I thought I had it set on sending me there. The message said I could join. Well I'll tell you if you want. But first, thank you to all of you. Once again, thank you to everyone and everything who knew your Earthling existences and how they are treated by your friends, who I would really appreciate to know. I'll make sure of it.<|endoftext|>

I had decided to create a hero once and for all. I had a plan. I stood to fail. "Okay, Tony, remember when I invented the utopia that we all wanted? " I laughed. People don't pay attention to villains. Can they see right through a man's crooked smile. " Why didn't you make another utopia for a different species? " I chuckled again. Finally, the girl wasn't so upset. " Well it worked out for me once, I guess." I finished. Later, I spent my final nights hacking away at a processor without remorse. Having now built a plan of action, I felt ready to take me out on some space pirates with a vicious crossbow. The bastard had a cannon and that was the end of me, left behind to smash my petty life to pieces as quickly as possible. The end. See, it wasn't always like this. Stories don't really go this far. So I did, at first. I started small. Have fun there. Again. You see, now that I have successfully infiltrated the sewers, our task is much harder. Many amateurs find it difficult to hold a gun and have to rely solely on flashlights. And now it's my turn.<|endoftext|>

Hi there, this is Dennis. Dennis has been here so long. He's actually pretty cool. Originally I was enthralled by his run of luck. His *Abnormal Demeanor... * was a bit of an exaggeration. I mean sure, it appeared to be like a genie, and normally, I was struck with malicious intent and/or yesturing, but Dennis seemed to get better at that, and something within me fizzled, and he vanished entirely in the intervening few weeks. I assume it's probably not the first time he's gone missing, but I am hoping it's not the last. As it has been for far too long now, it was at this juncture that I could finally be on my feet. On a personal note, I've been wondering for days if this guy will actually help me clean up my mess. I've searched all of New York, but there's only one place I know of that has been run over by an entirely different plane of existence than the one you've just peered out of. There's no signs of the corrupted mans behavior that bugged me so far, even though I have nowhere to go. Probably not a place I know but there is no way that he will be let out of this human house, because we have to be together. And now here I am, laying in this hiss because of another tortured soul which was once for good measure. Every time he sneezes, I like to feign surprise as the tears roll down my face. *Whore! *<|endoftext|>

Zandan collapsed onto the rocky ground next to the Black Sea. He wasn't going to make it all the way to something salty just to worry about there like that. He doubted it. Zandari refused to look at his brother, he only knew one thing. He knew he couldn't escape, that being his friend wouldn't do that to him. Only him. Well, unless it meant *not getting along. * And besides, he was far too eager to tell his brother that the patrols left three hours earlier, only to have it turned back after they readied their guns. It was clear that the men in the iron lines of the armored encampment had been several hours away when the distinct sight of half one dozen prisoners exiting the way of the line was made clear by the shot rang out from the armored men, many of them dripping with blood. His friends were already dead, those warm-blooded men. He wouldn't follow, he wouldn't surrender. Only one thing could save his sister. She would be his and now his only one. She and her brother, had been lured into the back door of the armored post, no doubt faking some kind of mental blockade before them escaping back in. Some of them had bandaged their wounds, others were speaking in riddles and butchers. It wasn't uncommon to see someone with knowledge of what was supposed to happen, or being able to talk, or even physically fight, when they managed to force the Morrez breach left behind when they first invaded the province. Zandari refused to look at the bodies. Why should he? What's worse is his younger brother, as he waited impatiently for him to give his answer. It was from the thin murmur of his elders during the open procession before his entry. It was a sight he couldn't deny, but something very deep, he could not find in the descriptions; what they said made no sense to him. They told him tales, tried to bring the wicked of Morrez into his kingdom, all to end his sleepless sleep. They told him about the trials, how his father was corrupted, how his mother was thrown in a spell and that he loved them each and every moment of their suffering. But Zandari knew he was too weak. He was too weak, while still a young and fertile young man. As the Morrez men began the long procession, Zandari became acutely aware of the soldiers who were guarding him. He no longer had the strength to take a step towards them, even if he could throw them a few blows each time. They had lost too many of their soldiers the first time, too many of their brothers, especially Zandari's. At first Zandari had hesitated. He needed to remind himself to take part in the march, to stand up to those who opposed him, and maybe even to say something to redeem himself. He placed his hand on the officer's shoulder, tears welling up inside. Even now that the soldiers came back to him, but now the recruits in their place, Zandari didn't care. He had to know he was more dangerous than he thought. But what he did know, he couldn't do anymore. No matter what was on the horizon, he had no one to save. He prayed to his sister that Zandari would save her, that he would do something that her brother could never do. Perhaps he could save the next Morrez. Perhaps that wasn't a possibility right now. But as he prayed for his brother to wait his return for him, he contemplated how possibly he could at last see her face. He grew tired of her crying, of his brothers screams, and of his father screaming before his eyes. He thought if he could get there now, it wouldn't be until after death did Zandari realize she wasn't cryy and happy. He tried to leave, but with his sister and brother out there, if his family left alive, he wanted to know what would happen to them.<|endoftext|>

George slowly pulled his wife's hair from his face as he glanced back into the mirror, the wrinkles creeping into his skin with each step. He pretended not to notice. She always had her legs crossed. A spell cast one month after he got a tattoo now didn't help much. "We were friends. " He said to her. She nodded slowly. " Yeah, " He wiped his hand on the table and pulled it off, listening to her get annoyed. Tears welled in her eyes, mixing with his hair as the realization hit him. She couldn't do that now. She'd always known. " It's okay." She said. She couldn't do that anymore. She knew she had to. She knew... that God had told her to turn on the lights when she was 16.

I knew what I had to do. I had to make a decision. Immediately my stomach churned as if it were a large taco bell. My eyesight returned to normal as I looked around the room to my left. I could see a tv set, and a dumb, stereotypical white device with an apple and a candle smoking, with a mirror hanging over the both of my heads. I walked closer to the mirror and found a note hanging out of the top of it. It read: "My plan is great! I'm not going to let your shit up " As I moved closer to the mirror I met my future self sitting on the couch in front of it. He was pacing the room, exactly what was supposed to be my future self. I turned back towards him and sat down on the couch. He told me a story about how his mom taught him how to play guitar, how fast he could sprint, how soft and his chin was starting to itch. He says that's what mom always asked him when he had to start a guitar. Suddenly in the middle of his story he says that he got the idea when he was in my teens. He said he wanted a guitar. " What the fucking shit is going on? Did I say something wrong? Can I just stop this? " I sat there in disbelief. What had I done? Is this what I'm to become? " It's the former my future self! He always got me done when I was bored but I could make something awesome for him that he liked! Or someone to call his. Nothing fancy like that can come out of this! " The old man's words sounded terrible, he couldn't handle it anymore. " But it's your momma who made the whole thing here, it makes sense. What is going on? Should I keep going? " I said that it was the Old Man's plan and he must be joking. Couldn't it have been my mom? Where could my mom? " You're crazy! She could have made a really cool guitar for me if I kept going to work! " The old man and his mother laughed at his stupid joke, as if they would respect the old man and his plans, and they certainly did not respect the old man as a musician, but because that is how he knew how to play guitar to his daughter. Of course I didn't expect the old man to be keeping up with my crazy plan, I was hoping he knew what he was planning and if it really worked. I had just wanted to make this happen and it seemed like the only way for me to do that was to find a damn new guitar to play! I looked in the mirror to see the old man and mother holding hands, in disbelief. I saw them standing in front of the mirror that showed me a plan from which my future self's music would find them to make a successful attempt. As soon as I heard that from the old man I understood why my plans were futile: I want this guitar. I wanted my music! " Oh shit I've been talking about this plan for what, ten years? " The old man asked. He looked shocked, I had just uttered those words about ten years ago. " Well, things are just fine." __________________________________________________________________ My first story I've written, let me know what you think!<|endoftext|>

*Senses can be great, but you need to remember it is important to keep in mind when casting. You need to be able to see what you are casting as you do it. That is, to not be able to focus on your next spell when you are casting it. * *Senses can be great and small, but they can be thick and heavy, I have seen those curses in a few you've seen. My name is Peter Berkov, witch that didn't last long. This last spell worked fine, so I set myself to look for spells to make me invisible. I first let myself into my room, the basement, but even without the lights, I could see a massive room that I had barely recognized from earlier. The floor was covered in dust as I let the room go into quiet. I pointed to a wall with a table, on which were various books and a tablet I could use for e-mails. Instantly, I was seen entering through the back door. Another wizard started carrying a tablet, throwing a printout on the table. He wrote two spells that kept me here forever, hoping that I wouldn't recognize the spell. The spell went in the air. No sound came out of my mouth. I looked down. One of the mages had once used the word invisibility to cast another spell. " How long? " he asked. " I still can't find what you have " I replied. " You can't have something so simple... that I just want to hide. " " It takes too long. " the mage interrupted. " But... but are you certain you need to cast this? " I looked down. " No " " Then we have to go as quickly as possible. We might need to lift the spell... " " Oh, that's good. What are we going to do? " The mage looked at me. The noise continued for a few seconds. " What's next? " " You're going to- " The mage looked at me. " Why are you looking down? You should see my spell list! " My vision blurred. " What? " " I... You've forgotten about it. I really have forgotten it. And I can don'thing about it! It's too important. " I could see a candle burn in the corner of the room. The mage made a motion with his fingers to get out of my room. A spell flew out of the corner of his eye. It read, " Damnit. That... That's magic."<|endoftext|>

Gunpowder is the zenith of me. I'll tell you that like some kind of magic trick or a murky dreamscape, guns are a thing of the past. Remember? I never fought with a gun! As far back as I can remember, the not-so-wrong towns were always the most uninhabited areas - lock up, stays locked up, pay taxes. Back in the day, I was never more than twenty-five. Now, while you can tell me that it was incredibly common for older kids to come in, it's pretty common for older folk to try to rob and steal for fun. We always known the cops weren't really there for us: they just talked about them as machines - police stations, St. Nick's, some places even I hardly ever travelled to. It's tough to reach where there aren't cops - even more so the men here, all wearing military uniforms! So, as you might say, I was lucky that I had a good day. In fact, I was pretty lucky. From what I could tell from these guys' clothes, each was pretty good. They had none of the trench, heavy steel combat jacket i'd seen from the stores but looked like something awesome. It almost felt like they had just done a twenty on us, though. I definitely had used a lot of them to start robbing a few townhouses in the town. "You coming? ", they asked, taking a second to enjoy the smell of fresh beer on their faces. I nodded. " No no, dont worry, I'm going to be here soon enough. " They walked over to the windows, and watched us walk through as they did. They stopped at a park. Some of them wore me as a soldier uniform, a mask. The real weirdo is none other than my master's, his of a mini bandit with a scythe, the same skeleton that drove home the arguments with his sword. He smiled and I met his eye. " Come on, let's see what this place has in store for you. " He said, and I walked towards him. We both turned left, as the bandits chased after us, surveying the area. The bandits kept on ignoring us; the two locals refused to be led, if they were captured by any of us. Just then, I turned the corner and got it in my mouth. It felt wrong. I felt so out of place. It was exactly one years after the last bomb. Sure, not all of the townspeople survived, but most of the dead did. It felt like every day I left this place, it felt more real than it ever had in my life. How would I be any different this time? " What kind of bomb would your town have, " asked the leader of the bandits, but without the fortitude of a 16 year old. " We don't have much time. ", he answered. " It was the last time. We needed some food to survive and you people always managed to ambush us during these tough times. So, you'd better hurry up - the town is almost empty anyway. Leave us if you have any food. " As he said this, the bandits turned around, and lowered their cloaks, letting the day go by for a few more minutes. I looked over at my younger self, perplexed. " I know what you mean, you guys are still terrorists! " " You'll have to deal with that, " I said. " Not everyone is." -Inspired by another story that inspired mine: Kueisha Redding's [ Skyrim ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/Imbeciles/comments/4ttzaz2/welcome_the_ask_patrons_to_be/ )<|endoftext|>

*The blue, white orb holding you, waiting, asking? * Tessa's face was cold against mine but it wasn't from my lipstick. Now I just feel numb. It wasn't anyone ’ s fault. Neither was I. Look at it, this tome. Don ’ t let me down. I was never one to touch cars. Not this time. I ’ ve seen it all. Didn ’ t you remember the time I gave you the keys to this shotgun? Who would have guessed what to do with that if it was right there? Just chance I would make it before some crazy kid came up to me with some deep voice. Maybe it was... I don ’ t know. Maybe it was God? But at least it wouldn ’ t be a serial killer, much less my new little brother. Did I kill him? Or did he just come up to me and kill me for all the wrong reasons? Maybe God had something to do with it, maybe everyone was… *oh fuck my eyes. I wish I could die. * I held the barrel between my ribs. A thin line framed the path, seemingly tracing the direction I had chosen. It was on course for me, somewhere near 0. I paused for a moment. After a moment of concentration, I turned to look at the floor. * Shit. Shit. Shit. * The letter had been written at the top, not facing directly at me. I reached down and looked out my mouth. I had always hated the point of my makeup. I must have given myself a squeeze and it wouldn ’ t return. I raised the barrel at my neck and hovered to the left. I pulled the trigger. With a sudden jerk I opened my eyes and then hit the floor. I did what I had promised in the contract. So many years of traveling from person to person… a lot of fun. Damnit, I should pay down my debts. I only had a little more time before he decided I was no longer worth my time. He took it as an opportunity to let me do this for free. He wondered, almost a certifiable fact, if I hadn ’ t pulled off that evil deed. I closed my eyes and rolled out of my bed. There was almost no time to think. I had done it all. I had murdered that man. He would live. I pulled the trigger… again. Again. And again. And again. The tick was up. 3, 2… 1, 1…<|endoftext|>

"Turn it off!! " I screamed, appalled at my young brother lying in bed with the sheets making up his feet. I screamed out for him to turn it off and leave, yet he had no answer. I held my breath, trying to keep my breathing steady. As the years went by, the weight of an illness returning continued to hinder my judgement. The man who I once adored in the dark ages seemed older now. It had taken me almost thirty years of abstinence before I saw him sleeping in my hospital bed. I felt a weight lift off my heart and I finally spoke: " You.....you poor son of a bitch, you know it's not fair to judge a stranger for, " i said smiling gently to my family and friends. " He... took my life for nothing. His fault, of course. You abandoned him when his grandmother died. You deserve nothing more from an ambulance than death. You'll never know anything about me from up here or even from up there. You were the one who cared for him until he passed. He was the only one who had ever cared. You abandoned his heart. Every day you didn't care about him either. And you finally laid down to your death with him under your arm. You must pay it back and try to live your life. And right now, you don't even see the light of day again. But do you really think that the reason you wouldn't wake up, sleep, or eat for nearly every day, you still want to help in the worst way possible, like, are you somebody that you want to love? You've been doing this for 40 years, feeling like you're forgetting yourself about something so terribly important to you. And it finally hits you.... I need you to help out. In the end, I need you to find somebody who loves him. You need someone willing to live their day to day life, but even if you don't, just say that, we can always find someone who wants to live in the future, even if it means stopping one of your debts." I held my breath as the last word left my mouth. A long time and I'm ready to see him in the new years. Please, if I can tell my story I'll try to write as better a description as I can. < 3<|endoftext|>

It was a pretty sight today. I got to sneak past the guards, sneak down a hallway, and onto the building. I could do this. For that, I had to have some luck. * Right on schedule* Day 64, or the days after that, everyone was safe. Free lunch, flying in the air, I was granted free entry into the hospital. How long was this for? 6 hours? 8? 8 years. I always wondered how these days go. But a quick glance over my shoulder revealed something mysterious. Normally, I had reached this age at least once before. What was this? Well, it's a death sentence now. I simply don't have any funds to spend anymore. There were so many things that I didn't even know I could do. I was so tired. I just wanted to go home and sleep. Death happened every day, and in every case, so did I. But a group of assassins had become a threat to me. Not even death could stop them. *They* had him. It seemed like they had infiltrated my family. At least I thought I had. It wasn't just them. They did too. I could feel the heat of the day creeping up on me. I wrapped my arms around my head as I left my death sentence. I was supposed to be watching TV. As I left the hospital, I heard the door close behind me. I jumped inside and screamed. It was my daughter! I pulled my phone out. * There* was a picture of a fat man and a human head. * He was the only person that could save her. The only mother who would ever forgive me. * However, I had no idea what to do with the picture. I looked at the poor man and smiled. The sun was just starting to set. The sun didn't seem to bother me anymore, which was weird as a bad thing. I had been waiting for this moment for as long as I can remember. * This is the end, for me and my family. * But it wasn't. It had already happened. How could I live with myself? This world is toxic! They wouldn't even know if it was me or them! After what they did, it felt as though they hadn't been here all this time! I haven't been to work in a while, and my two kids are in detention. I... I wanted to just go home. I just couldn't. I took a step towards the window and saw the helicopter. As it moved towards me, I thought that this was better than death. Then I felt a smile. The look in his eyes. I was glad to be alive.<|endoftext|>

*Where are we going... * I start, breathing a sigh of relief before I start. I've always been such a dick. *Don't worry. If you choose not to get out of Heaven, you will cease to be human... * How he loves me this much... does he... will he love me? Can I really trust him? Should I trust him? He trusts me. *I won't follow you until you have yourself. Can I trust you again? * He smiles, eyes wide. Then he pulls out a flask of BEEP and coughs in a fit of rage. *Damn. Damn me. I'm too tired to put up with the stupid questions these muggles keep offering. I don't think I can stand by and watch them over. * "Try this again, will you? " *Of course I will. This one is one of the only things that really contributes to me. Besides, I'm not really that desperate, but I'm going to go back home now. * " I'll take you to the lodge for your questioning." The boy goes into the lodge and enters. The red curls around his big blue eyes mask the slightly hidden smile. *Who you are, little guy? You look nothing like me. I think you got your *leave*, no? Oh, we'll go...<|endoftext|>

I decided not to update my writing prompts; not so much as to try and delete my own long read prompts which deviated from my daily routine. Here's hoping you liked it; the rest of my writing isn't too bad though. TL; DR ) When looking for a prompt within 3, 4, or 5 days, you end up in frustration and ultimately take the amount of time that was required to start'em as an ordeal, or life after; seeing all the original prompts take longer than expected.<|endoftext|>

They say I've gotten used to everything. They say it's all fun and games now. They say my life is a mystery, and nobody can take it.

I have a child, I'm sorry. But I didn't mean to. It was all my own doing. So, they come to me, and take my body and drive me away. Little Johnny needs this much comfort in his life.

But I won't have Johnny, no one will care for me. I'll be gone. My last memory I remember with Johnny in the car that drove me away from my little Johnny as we drove, was a slight smile on his face. His mother made me relive the beginning to my birth. I stole her, nothing I wanted, nothing really. So, who stole her? A dumb wannabe doctor thought it would be wise to give Johnny one. When he came home, he gave me his own wheelchair and a soda can, and gave me one last push to lift his weight and he stopped. With a shaky arm he pushed it in and to lift it, I could feel I was moving, and the Doctor reached out to his hand and made the car do a double take with his fingers and thumb together, and my nose was bleeding, and my eyes were full of tears, and my family wasn't able to bury Johnny so soon. "Hello Mr. Dr. Dieter, your work was well done, and your patient did what he was told.

I awoke to smell coffee. Before I could process what I had just done I instantly recognized *her*. Looking up to see her stared at me and shrugged it off as "after you " or something similar. That is when my mind began panicking... I wake up to smell coffee. But wait, I wasn't eating my coffee. What? I checked facebook, I saw her profile, before it was gone in my browser. No, I went to the local coffee place, just for a cup of joe. My eyes quickly adjust to my surroundings and I spot a girl standing in front of me, not 8 legs. Eyes that would change anything! " No, I'm not eating my coffee! " I immediately exclaim, setting my mug down on the bar. When I reached up to grab my coffee the girl's back started to close around me, grabbing my hand, *tsing*. " Hey! " She whined at me, as I started to spit. I suddenly knew this was not my case. " Wait. What do you mean'take your coffee'?" Another muffled whimper, but my coffee was gone. I quickly do my coffee and look to her for the source of the commotion. Every person over the age of 8, including myself was found to have an " in a compromising position " if anything was ever in a compromising position as the last pizza they ordered arrived exactly as it was exactly 20 minutes ago. A man approached me as I struggled to reach for my cup of joe, it was a small blonde guy.<|endoftext|>

"So, you want me to start asking questions, David? " Jordan mumbled as he started pacing around the room. " Who are you? Why is your roommate Chris chasing you around? " " Jeremy Binder! How dare Jeremy! You are my roommate, who are you? " Jordan fell down onto the cold wall, silencing himself once more. " That's it, you fool. I am going to work with you! " Jordan's grip tightened. " You think I'm going to smash you? I have 1 hour to figure out my roommate. " Jordan cleared his throat, cracking his knuckles on the plaster wall. " How are you going to explain it to me, Jeremy? " The monster hunched over him. Jordan wished he could see what was happening but he was too busy staring into Jordan's eyes to do so. " Well, first of all, I am not your roommate. I am looking for you, Jeremy Binder! How dare Jeremy! Chris, Chris... " A wide grin started to spread across the monster's face. " Guys, how are you? " " I am not Chris. I am Jeremy. " " Chris, why are you getting worse? " Jordan began to scream in anger. This was getting ridiculous and difficult. " Well, I need you to come with me. " " Ok, but I need you to bring me to Chris. Jeremy, I am your roommate. Listen. " Chris's voice was calm, intense and commanding. " Yes, the dream. " " Yes! " Jordan's eyes opened wide, and a wave of hot sadness enveloped him. " Chris? Chris? Is Chris okay? " " Yes, Jeremy. I am ok. I just need you to... " " What did you do to Chris? " " Did Chris say anything? Do I need you to bring Chris to the worst nightmare of my life?

This is going to be a while. Goodbye Chris. " The young man left his room and was alone again. He made his way across the yard to his closet. He watched David as he crouched down and put on his costume. He slowly unclipped his pants, revealing the mismatched t-shirt, gloves, and shoe box that were strewn across the floor. He looked at his costume and saw that it was too mismatched to fit his costume. On top of that, the still-burning T-shirt was the only indication that this was no longer Jordan's closet, and it was true. As he stood over the body, he felt his heart starting to beat rapidly. It was time. He decided to run. " Steven! You have to stop this! This is not funny! Just do this. " Steven grabbed Jordan's shoulder and pulled him toward the hallway. " Steven, we are going to work tonight. We are going to work. " Steven looked to the edge of the hallway. As he turned the corner, he saw a smoke cloud forming where his closet door used to be. As Steven turned and headed toward the smoke, he heard a loud squawk from the hallway. As he turned, the smoke cloud passed through his two bedroom room. As he realized what had just happened, he saw a huge tentacle fall from the ceiling. As Steven fell, he didn't notice how massive it was, as he turned around and ran for the door. As he reached it, his stomach dropped into his arms and he felt his legs starting to run as he ran. He ran away from the smoke cloud and looked at the monster staring back at him. He smiled and said, " You are still alive."<|endoftext|>

We stood over the final remanent satellite, The last explosion and boom of the human race. The only barrier preventing them from seeing us, but still we face with their third best technology, a secret to hide that we have known for years. We had fought this before, claiming territory through lines of 3,100km wide shield that held just as many units in between so it could withstand the impact of countless rounds. The quick reaction time to fire meant that the shield tore through and when the weight left our arms, any good shot or inaction took a life or life away. But it was too late. The second explosion went up without a hitch. Something dark and dark, a thousand miles wide reaching at least 100km long. Most likely part of our numbers. Destroyed by the third. But we didn't want to destroy our final enemies before they did too. We didn't want to make those we loved learn of our habits. The second blast went down in surprising quiet. The seconds ticked by, the time kept on ticking. I spoke, the first sparks of the charge moving forward, the star exploding behind us. The explosions started blaring and changing frequencies. Nothing new. Just fire, mass, and complete silence. Silence again. And then another and another. There is silence again. I can not process it, I can not process what I am seeing, but the information is clear. This thing is the last defense of our planet. Our strength it's last ray of hope to carry on fighting the threat posed by our enemies for the last time. I won't forget that, I won't forget what I saw.<|endoftext|>

"But... that's not all... " " That's an asteroid. I'm not getting into that too much you know. " " No... it's an asteroid! And I'm not even flying it! I'm not even dying! " " No... no... You're only immortal! You're not even a child! You're actually a super-cell! A laserbeam caused by some radiation from your homeworld... and my ass is already fighting nuclear war against it. " " What are you saying? It's getting big. And I have a long future ahead of me. " " Well, then you're a super hero. Go fight the police or something. If you can't survive here I can't give you anything to give you."<|endoftext|>

"I know this feeling and I'll tell you what I'm going to tell you right here, " Her husband said, almost as if she was relishing in his words. " I know you know this feeling and I'll tell you what I'm going to tell you right here, " she whispered, opening her eyes. " I know what you are doing and I'm going to tell you right now, " she continued, trying to keep her composure. " I know what I'll do and I'll tell you right now, " he continued, trying to suppress a slight smile. " I know what you're thinking, " she admitted slowly as if to herself. " I know what I'll do and I'll tell you right now, " he finally spoke with a small smile, " I know what you're thinking, " she began, still taking notes of what she was now about to do.

I remember the first time I was young, and the first time I believed in the power of one magic-slinging talisman to save me. I was 12, after all. I suppose not many kids are out for supper - basically, the only thing that's keeping them from guarding the homeland as we knew it to be will always be mum and dad. But I suppose the only thing that nobody really seems to do is leave. Just like me. There, there and it all end. It's so hard, alone with my horrible dreams and the vision of a world hopelessly lost. I'm alone with them now. Shaking hands, brushing away my rags, there it is, my other imaginary friend. They say one thing about magic - that it *does* save you. But this imaginary friend is the one I've been clawing for, to help in some non-constructive way. There's a mystery, but perhaps no real answer for how they see the world. I'm glad that I found it, although I can't look away anymore. I won't be much longer. I'll soon find my real friend.<|endoftext|>

It was a slow day. It would always be, the work was short and repetitive. I moved to the East side of the room, in a cage surrounded by scrub and chain tape. Each of us marked and re-wrote the chronicles we drew for our own personal cause. Sarah sat by the light at the edge of the cage and enjoyed the light, and she knew the breeder would never let a female break in. She pushed her pads up the on and off of the incubator and handed me the next project. It was three months after the first. It would be about time for her to grow into her due to the work we had in the previous two months. Sarah had ordered herself a New Balance Supermodel T, but we couldn ’ t afford that much and needed quality for her project. We got the decrepit skinny T the day that she discovered her daughter, the little girl whom I now named “ Chow. ” I was running out of room to exhibit Chow. Sarah assumed she was doing it for the pleasure of the breeder, but that was so far from the truth. It wasn ’ t until our recent comb in the incubator was recorded that I realized that someone was sitting in the corner of the room in front of me. A black figure scurried around the cage frantically, bemused that he could be sitting in a cage and wait for her. When he finally got out of the cage, it was back to what it had been all day. I found myself looking for her, trying to find a new Lab. I was still eager to see her, but I only found her at this last place, looking just as exhausted from my morning run as I had been from that other day. Then I heard the thud of something on the floor. Then I heard the footsteps. I stepped around in a frenzy, turning to see that the thud again was from a human. Suddenly I saw her two young bodyguards, but these times I didn ’ t see the blood on her feet. I held her close, and we waited for her to leave. When we did she couldn ’ t, and I wasn ’ t the first person she saw that afternoon. “ It ’ s a great day, isn ’ t it? ” Sarah said, looking up at me. “ You ’ ve been fine. You don ’ t know who you ’ re talking to yet, but you have been through so much. My ears are ringing like a beaten drum. ” “ You remember when we were young? ” “ Yes. ” She was even now, but she looked small. She wasn ’ t much of a girl, she was longer and less stable. She wasn ’ t happy, but she didn ’ t need any of it. She had a good life, friends, and long life ahead of her. “ Then there was that time before the New Balance started. ” She flipped off her door frame and started sprinting away in the opposite direction she was facing. There was a moment of falling as she backed away, but the door still connected. I ran back up to the cage and headed for the light that she had requested to close. That was the last time I saw her. “ Farewell. ”<|endoftext|>

"Sup Daddy I know you can't handle this. " The cameraman exclaimed as her jaw drops open. I didn't give a second thought, I was a part of this damn jungle. The choking hiccups from seeing a kitten change color from pink to... just dog again. " This can't be happening. " Oh shit. I swear I just read the prompt and I'm not just gon na say the only word that could keep me from being enslaved by my cat is every word she uses, I have to use three other words that fit together. I fall limp and enter the tv, the clawing of something wood peeling off. The pitch gets louder, louder and louder. Then it stops, off the wall and in front of me. My lip starts to move again as I pick it up. 'Hello, Kitty'<|endoftext|>

He leaned into her. It was a soft kiss. A warmth eminating off of her petite frame, making her drool. The taste of tender flesh tickled her, and a trace of silk slipped from her finger tips. She leaned back in his embrace. Her lips curled into a smile, coiling and spinning. A feisty gust of wind blew across his face. "It's all coming down to you honey, " he said, his breath foggy, " you're losing it. " She looked over at him, to see the smile and smile once again. She was his single most perfect woman, and yet he was the world's luckiest man. He laughed and leaned back in, eyes wrinkled, and whispered, " You're some super clever honey. You know, just watch out for whomever eats both of us. " He crossed his arms, wiped the water and walked over to her. She looked over at him with intense redness. " There's not even any water, how were you enjoying that honey, " she finally said with a dry smile. She slipped away from him. " So sweet, take me around to your bed and have a nice day, " he suggested, taking her hand. She nodded slowly. " I'm here for you. " " No honey, your favorite thing is to lick me. " The smile melted. The day was beautiful, and now they both knew that he was safe. He pulled her close, and kissed her on the forehead. Together, they kissed like lovers to the rich and poor. He wanted to tear apart their lives, but then again, he was close to her. They had that wonderfully amazing night together, making love and forever. Her soft soft kisses curling around his lips, and the lazy tickling of his body, as he pulled her closer. Her breathing became deep and rapid, and she was trembling with excitement. She reached out and stroked his scalp. He pulled away, and the final kisses ended. " You always said that you were the strongest guy in the world, " the man said, looking down at his hands. His eyes were burning, his hand was throbbing and pulsing. He pushed her away from him. And kissed the man's face, touching his cheek, his tongue seeping deep in his eyeball. " How old are you, honey? " he asked, looking at his eyes. She turned to him, surprised and confused. He kept stroking his face, his jaw was taking on his look. She looked into his eyes, and smiled deep. " Your Mom and Dad are ready. Your sister is studying harder tomorrow. And you, honey, you're going to finish it. " He looked down at her and smiled then. " I love you," she said back.<|endoftext|>

"So you haven't forgiven me yet? " " No. " " Well what if I didn't want to be forgiven? " " Yeah, sure you would love it if you didn't. Maybe you'd love to be forgiven. " " Is this part of the punishment? " " Yes. " " Do I get the noose around my neck? " " No. Not much depends on how much you want me to forgive you. The job will be rough. You have two very sensitive souls who want you to do the work for them. Someone who knows about grief disorder and is tied to both cholesterol and high blood pressure is their hit. " " Ah! So I can't just kill you. I haven't even told you yet. " " What? No. No you don't. No you won't. Only if you first write some sort of apology into my mind. " " No. You will never do it. Now what do I do about this. " " Leave it in the hands of the tribunal and I'll be on my way. " " Okay, just... With you in mind I'll send you to your room. " " Okay, what will we do? I don't know that I have a secret life yet and so far I don't even know what's going to happen. " " Go with it."<|endoftext|>

*Even if I stopped here I'd still have some of those "brown" sweaters and earrings. They aren't like anything I've ever owned, and the nice blind lady pointed the keys at me. * If you're following me, you've probably already seen me. You know, out of sight and touch. But you're stuck here and still have my attention. I'm not as focused on what you're doing as you are on putting me through any school classes, or getting to the gym. I only have one button down. And my job's on fire. I have to give a fuck about your hygiene or something. Your ceiling is dying. It's turning stained with my guts. Yeah, you're already squirting fire on my ceiling, and that's probably because it's wet. * If you're still following me, I probably just knocked on your door. It isn't because of who we're talking about, but of who you're knocking on. Who the hell I should knock on? * If you see me, I'll put the keys back in my pocket and shove them into my mouth. Even if you don't like it, I'll stay in there, just waiting for you to pick up the pace or run out of here. And maybe I'll see you soon.<|endoftext|>

Jared was a simple man of noble House Novalli. He held the house in which he lived. The house is great. For a Swede, it would look like a church, and for the mountain it glimmered like, you guessed it. They had an army; one rival to the ancient and terrible leaders that ruled the Alps and the African plains. Last of the Nordic kings. He was a warrior of no great ability, only skills and physical prowess. He had killed many foes in his traveling journey, quite often. He knew at the start of his journey that he would fail miserably but quickly overcame all odds to end his mind's enchantment on the war, and die a hero. His hall would be filled with warriors, most of whom fought in the barbaric wars of Europe, the latter half of the 16th century where they left a common enemy behind, with some absurd news in the ruins of a great city. They would not speak of their legend, they would not speak about the great minds of Germany. But Jared had gathered books and runes from many of the kings of his kingdom, so that he might continue his lessons. When his lord and his king returned from the small village where he was staying with his lord, the stories were good. His family needed no debt, so they worked for many generations, until one day, a boar appeared in the village. The other men, he had learned of them when he realized they had learned a bit more than he had, and lead them against the beast, which looked like a great beast from the back of a dragon, but with spikes. They fought tooth and nail, and had broken open large pots and shears of meat, the bone could be cut fastened or clamped away, but the goblin would swoop in easily and take the meat from its one eye, and chain it tightly around itself. They'd fought each other and died, but then again, the great orcs and trolls. They could have been the original humans, but then, one unearthly and unspeakable disturbance to their world brought the great, terrible, and everlasting war to a halt, and Jared took one of them. He ran home that night, with his huge arms ready and his teeth sharpened, to all the world to listen to him. That night, when his lords and daughters slept, Jared spoke. "Come, man. Let us go." And so he ran, with no great arms, and fought the beast. When his lord and his princess called him back to his tent, he never returned, he left things to the realm of Olaf for those times, while his companions hungered for adventure and thought of their lords and daughters.<|endoftext|>

I sat in the empty living room, having a beautiful and relaxing morning. There was silence. Beaming smiles were quickly replaced with the foul sucking sound of small, uncertain voices. I looked out the window to see the neighborhood around me was grey, that was just a precaution; I told myself it would never happen again. However, this was no time for such fantasy. My neighborhood was his domain, though; he was invading the neighborhoods, ravaging the lawns, shaking people, and taking over people from their homes. There were brawls. Clashes. People were struck by arrows and knives. All I wanted was for him to be distracted, try to fight back. I watched as things went wrong from my vantage point in the living room, in the midst of my murderous rampage. My skin was burning and my eyes were drawn to the monster that came running from the streets. My breath caught in my throat when his light approach disappeared. I smothered the demon with my best loving smile. My hair became sand, falling off of my shoulders. I fell to the floor, clutching my right shoulder as he screeched wildly. The world around me had turned a dark, dark world. I had noticed the dog and cat sitting on the floor next to me. Instinctually, I clapped him on the back. A look of rage appeared in his face. Then, a deep sad voice, which shouldn't have come out of its mouth let out a powerful crash. My spirit boomed. " Sweetheart, it is time to leave! " " Your house has now been conquered, and has taken your house! Your people should not have to fight against their own ruler! They will once again rule this land. " My heart shattered. I looked up at my wedding ring, made of gold, inscribed with the words *Revenge of King Kong*: " To the queen and the kingdom of Bastogne"<|endoftext|>

They are the light of the full moon. A cosmic ray splashes on the cloudless night, and they dance. Eons pass, and they dance. They forget the blue skies, the tangled boulders, the desire for coals and pine needles, the warm coals of a nice summer day, the cool coals of a good day off. We are the stars falling from the skies and dancing in the night. How silly they are. How selfish. How selfish. And if we desire beauty then a second moon comes out of the void, a bright, blue and orange ball and wraps itself around our planet. We are the stars dancing in the blue sky. We can not dance. We are all falling away. Too young. Too young to love. Too young to love. One day, an asteroid hits Jupiter. An asteroid even closer then the time between the stars. We dance.<|endoftext|>

I sighed and sat up from my stupor. It was becoming unbearable to me to operate this system which was so unfair to me. The one person I used to know that I could trust was the one who had made me who I was today... I'd worked my entire life for this shit. Good times were going to come. Picking sides I thought about where I could start. The stupid menu split neatly, left blank for me to fill it up. It must have been a big mistake. I probably wouldn't make it again, after all this time I'm not willing to rob this place again. An apologetic smile broke down my face. I had paid. Good. I walked out of the building and stopped at a stall. I grabbed the register. I stuffed out my wallet with bills and money I don't know much about. It seemed a mishmash of cash, written bills, pictures, album covers. I looked at the receipt. $ 70,000... I looked at the printed receipt again. $ 70,000,000. It was true, like it always said. I scribbled on the piece of paper thinking about what to do with it, money I can't have at home. I sighed again as I got up to leave. I craned my neck toward the exit. It wasn't my fault that I hadn't come this far in my long life, my late stepfather had been a mad man. But I didn't care. I had helped him so much. He worked hard, and worked hard to make a life-changing decision for me. Instead of stopping by and feeding me my daily vitamins and helping me get better I decided to let him do my thing. I walked towards the edge of the street. I opened the door and walked out into a slightly dimly lit alleyway. The light provided a nice contrast with the deserted pavement. I approached the door. It opened. The exit was something I was never used to seeing. It led me to a little front door set up in a circular spot, and open as the light illuminated the entrance. I stepped in. A ring on my right hand, identical to the one on my left hand as long as I worn it. It was a little longer than I had thought and I saw it. I had changed my mind. I panicked and walked away from the door. Nothing. I slumped over, grabbing the ring from my pocket. I traced the little marks on my wrist and the way the sounds used to come from the inside. I liked the feeling of clean skin, I was getting used to being homeless again. The ring and ring quickly disappeared and my appearance continued. I cleaned up. My hand was now free.<|endoftext|>

There it was. This perfect plan was all encompassing. Everything. A great idea is a colossal success. The hydraic rollercoaster has gone to waste. We laughed at the cancellation, the wasting. Not on the part of the producers, of course, but what could possibly be saved? We had all envisioned this as a golden age. Everyone thought the joy was in us, but I'll never forget how nervous we were. We signed up to help with making the transformation. I don't believe you, mom. But you mentioned last week you can't seem to get into the training program. "Don't worry. I will go out again with great pleasure, " you still insist on referring to it as'great pleasure', but I know not what that means. You finally pulled back your layers of shrouds and the restraint we had for winter passed within a matter of minutes of becoming conscious. That had been your idea for this new one, at least. When you caught the guard in your new neighborhood one day, he had put you through the school's proper bio-trimming procedure to ensure you would never be around any of the teachers who sent you for the combine. By Christmas, all the water seemed to have come off the walls. There were so many loud bellies, the music seemed to be drowned out by the screams of the kids, and the red and yellow chalk had blown away. Finally the bells stopped ringing, and the children began to sound uneasy. " Is it finally over? " you whisper softly in the relative darkness, " I'm going to visit the washroom, we still got to dance. " " Let's get you cleaned up, you too kid." Another tear falls from your cheek. But you give it a swift shove, and your eyes shift to the mirror. She looks exactly like you, that extraordinary classmate you were in grade five! The one you knew from that campfire dance with. The one you truly loved... for the first time in years. You can still see her. She reminded you of your dad, and you almost stopped laughing when you saw her, but as you spin your head around you realize that even your dad is gone from the town. It's a new life, and all it takes is one few thousand people joining you for a single second. Only on occasion do you hear murmurs of, of old, terrible grief. Maybe things will finally work out for you. You can already feel the pain radiating from you, and you grasp your courage. You have to remember that part. Perhaps not for everyone. One thing you remember is that you were never your dad. One thing that you will always have a part in.<|endoftext|>

It must have been a long time since I had tasted any spice and flavor. After years of trying to find my rest, I was finally satisfied. That was until my curiosity got the best of me. What had transpired? Had this gang betrayed me? How did they destroy me? Then there was something else that had finally caught my eye. "Come on, Rex! " a man bellowed, swinging his arms in the air. " We're ready. " He continued, tapping his feet. They were covered in scales, a beautiful smile etched into his face. " Come on, Rex, just give me a minute. This will all be over soon." He waved his hands in the air and disappeared once more. I looked at my body, wondering how I could fight dragons without their magic. I was going to follow. That was when I heard it. That was when I realized, it was the wind.<|endoftext|>

For a moment I watched her, and drew my sword. It was cold. I longed for it, cold in the land of dreams. There was a hand on my shoulder. " It's coming. " " Hear what? " I asked a few times and I heard him say he was from another land. " For the Man and the Woman. " " What is this God? I've waited for them for so long. " I thought a long time. I wondered if one day it would call for me and return her to her city, to take me out into the wilderness. " Look, you haven't got a weapon, maybe you've always wanted a weapon, might be here to show you something. Whatever, find the one you love and my sword will fall upon your chest. It won't shatter the night, if that is what you wish for. " I hesitated at the thought. Could I become something but face a human being and answer the pain? " That is not the case, you must escape your burden, that sword does not change you. " " But how?! How can it change me? " I was asking. * This can't be possible* I thought. " Because I am what I love most. " She had been... Catching a lot of people's eggs too. " I can't give up now, " I whispered, " you must not let your hate get the better of you. " " Do what you must, don't let the knife break my spine, *my pen* please. There's no turning back now. " I buried my face into my hands. She's the one I never had a chance to give up on. " He told me! They gave up?! Never stop... to catch this fool... He warned me! " I was aching to do something, to change, *to hide behind a girl you love. Your expression... Too aloof from her company! " She turned to face me, tears welling in her eyes. " But... why would he do that? It is so. I am meant to be a hero... I am meant to show people what they need to see for the world. I did it. I am meant to." The room became silent.<|endoftext|>

Today marks a strange new day in the daily life. It is only today that I am beginning to truly appreciate the nature of my predicament and have accepted the realisation that I'm not worth conquering. One simple, yet steadfast word made everything go to shit. It is important to recognize the power of the word "Dragon " one moment and the next moment you will cease to exist. This is what I mean by " realisation ". I dare not express my dismay at " Realisation " as one very sensitive word can suddenly spill into the entire world. *What is Realisation? * Well. It means the first thing to be understood by humans is the concept of moment. One will learn and develop and all that is to come will happen in real time. It can happen from minutes to hours on a given day. We are not mortal beings but we exist. I was the first to acknowledge this happening. But one would see me as a mortal being. How else could we even comprehend such a fact. Another word used to be very influential. One just needs to understand the grammar and speech patterns and syntax of a language and you will understand. I guess I was just a child. Why bother bothering with that before I was born, though? Or perhaps, the lack of motivation in generation after generation... An idea of this intelligence spreads quickly. You ask " What does it all mean? " and assume that one can grasp. " I'll have to ask you this question: " Is there anything I can do to stop this idea? ", regardless of what " you" say. " What's the point? " " Oh, no " I say. " Nothing. It's so pointless. " " Really? " I am speechless. But now I can only answer now. " This life would end soon... Please follow my simple instructions. " " Fine. " I leave. I don't need to hear " Realisation " again. I will continue my daily travels. I will dig deeper, maybe still deeper, in these mountains I am able to find an interesting group of people. Maybe you remember my photo. I still remember their faces. But I will never forget my face. I continue my daily travels, and still don't have time to break the silence. It is time for me to leave. *Oh. * I turn back to my village. I am not afraid. I will continue my journey... My home. But not today. It is not an " Easterday ", no, this is *back*. I see a small beast in the valley. It is intelligent. Or maybe it is a brute. Like a Neanderthal. In fact, it has two full mouths. One in the middle. One that makes me want to vomit. Two, as I hate to say it,... The beast in my cave is looking for food. It hurts, hates and eats things. I am very frightened. What is this evil? What is my purpose? What is this foolishness? But I know that I will never have to worry about these things again. I don't care when this abomination returns. I am ready. I am in good time. The beast at my cave stops its attacks. With my best damn weapon, it strikes back. Its teeth are blue in color. The thick, pink, glowing white scales that cover its body. It breathes deeply... within me. Sliced thick with an annoying fog, these shapes and behavior have been captured by a completely new dimension. I see a group of people, some family, waiting for me. Now I see this. A young man steps out from behind a bush and I hear the snap of a spider's web. It spins and rushes away. I don't fear... but I just see it. It looks at me with its eyes. Its coarse, dark green eyes... It seems to not exist. At first I assume it is going to become nothing but a beast. As it stops I see my wife and daughter in the distance. Our child is a present. We ate that on the mountain. Its stomach is flush with tears. What is... what is... what is... what is happening? We all don't know. Everyone knows, but for some reason they are losing sight of me. My family are wondering. It seems my wife and daughter have a lot of time. Time stops. The winds are harsh now. Something I don't want to see. I sigh. Another word soon. *Realisation*... I read in the cave. It is a word I would never come back from. Another sentence went out. The final one we all knew. It isn't love that makes people go insane. It is human terror.<|endoftext|>

She bade the man look at her. "This is a bit of a mix up. Aren't we supposed to be having a giant debate on our holidays? " He looked at her. " Y'know, how we came to be -- where it all began? How were we supposed to make love? " " Well, we were all born together. You know the cliché. Stood on your toes all day. Needled your mom's tight jeans. You needled your dad's tight jeans. You needled your younger sister's tight pants. You needled your dad's tight jeans. So? We were all born together. " " There was never really a question. And now we're all born together. How are we supposed to get away with it?! " " Well, everyone has a responsibility, and as long as we can remember, we have a duty. When our father got married he inherited a inherited out inheritance. The dad I remember carrying the load hadn't seen it coming, but he thought he might as well take a look at what happened. Got to keep things secret from the wife or daughter. The wife loved his dress. Made him wear it that way. " She looked at him. " We were all born together. I must have gone in, too. But we didn't really know what to do. I suppose it must have been a smart idea from the moment he got married. He left some papers on his bedroom table. He didn't bother to set them up. " " But we didn't really know what to do, either. What if he said they said my wife and I had to live together. I don't know why he left a note on my bedroom table that said that I need to ask her out when he leaves. Or why she would have to pull her nose into mine. " She said nothing. He looked at the papers again. The papers started to fall out of the printer into his mouth and then landed directly on her stomach. Then she screamed. " Get them all out of here! " He rushed over and took the papers out. They wouldn't do what he would have done. They would just float down his throat. She screamed. " Take your little sisters away! No one can control them! " he screamed. " And no one can stop them! None of you will know if they took your girls away or not. " There was no one to judge. It just started raining in rain. They were all so angry. So sad. So in love. So quiet. She started to cry. She squeezed her eyes shut. " Just sleep, please. I'm so happy to see you all again. Please. " Her entire body was crying. They cried, in different voices, almost in unison. And then she blinked. She had tears soaking onto her face. " It's okay, sweetie. I love you. " She looked at him. " I love you too, dad. " He looked at her. " I love you so much." She looked at him again. The rain stopped.<|endoftext|>

My father left home shortly after I was born and came home to find the marriage had dissolved in an instant. Despite the break in pace at the sight of him, he was as sensible of a man as my mother, aghast at the prospect of disappearing, especially for a once-great leader. Across the street, my mother read me a grave warning. I looked down and saw the young man walking away, carrying nothing but a briefcase as he walked away. I sighed. "Perhaps you never will be able to find a time to return to your family, " I whispered into his ear. " You stay. " He closed his eyes and lapped them up as his mind traveled to the terrible realities that awaited us, like grains of sand in a warm lake. In his mind, it was a time before the future. If you asked me how I knew he'd never return, it would just be a few simple words of approval. Unfortunately, he had no right to know why. He could not. The war had rekindled in town so quickly and decisively, killing as many as they could, sending out swift war weary officers in droves, as they simultaneously retreated to small camps to live out the remainder of their days. Yet here he stood, listening to the same foreboding children rumbling in the city, now decimated, staring out their trenches and out for their mothers. It must be a misunderstanding, but I felt a rivulet of comfort and purpose behind my father's story. It did not matter who did it. They could die in combat in the fields and forests, as families who helped them will do each other in the fields. It must be the country side, at least, and that's the only assumption. The door finally opened and I stepped inside. It was the old man, well-built and with black hair, dressed square in ceremonial armor. He was carrying only a few things, though. I could tell him he could not kill, and that meant that he could not be trusted. I didn't care. He knew this. This was what had happened. If he left, he'd live on in power, in life and death, he was dying alone and it may not be so easy to be angry, but if he did leave he'd be avenged. Then he'd be where he needed to be. The door closed, and we walked, and I climbed the steps, hearing only the sounds of conversation that was foreign and foreign to me and terrified to have heard. Perhaps I could find him, and have an earpiece to listen to his thoughts when he left. Maybe I'd stop this madness and start somewhere. Until then, the stormtrooper gazed back at me. He knew my mother had dropped my son's mother, but he already knew that he would never have the same sense of his own being when his mother was an unmarried madman, and that would never come to pass. " No, that's it, " he said. " I'm in," the old man said, and pulled his blade out of his pocket and took out his ornate, antique pistol from his belt and leveled it at me. I smirked, knowing it wouldn't work. I raised my foot towards him and swung, tearing the old man's head clean off, making it dirtied and splintered. He screamed and spluttered, and howled in agony before running for his life, his face moving and frozen, but not believing in my lust for revenge, for blood. I placed the scope against his neck and closed my eyes. The old man stood over him in a black room, slowly looking at him, his eyes locked on the scope, almost wanting to take me in, like I was an animal. I would never be sorry for what had taken place. It was the years of hatred and pain I wanted to avoid. I would never forget him. -- -- -- -- - Hope you enjoyed, check out my writing subreddit, /r/Syraphia<|endoftext|>

It started as a bit of a break. I was riding my bike, on a special something. I needed to sell something. If I made it all the way to the dollar store, I had to come down to a local spot for a sum of money. I knew it wasn't going to be easy. Each couple years my karma climbed up and steadily increased. Every time I was going to get an extra dollars, a half of my karma went into making me more valuable. A town should give you a hundred dollars. Forty is a way to a hundred dollars. On that day, I was on my bike, sitting behind the dumpster. I laid down, turned around, and pulled back the seat. I stood on the wet dirt path I had set my bike and hoped to see the rolling hills. I could see the stars in the distance. "Least I can see", I thought. I followed the sun's trail back to the spot, clearing my path back to the village. I knelt down to make my way back to the rider. I was beginning to get tired of this. I knew the weather would kick in. A window was closing in and the sun was setting. I hadn't the heart to stop at my destination and pull my bike in front of me, so that I could slip into my money like a normal guy.<|endoftext|>

The girl stood above the corner of my eye, but it was all I could make out. She was holding something heavy, hard, deep in her throat, and I was somewhat more afraid of her from there. I watched as it slid into her hand, shaking and pulling out. Her eyes wide and blue like an ocean, they made perfect block of light, for if she looked at them, she would *see*, she would try to reach out to. Her, she could see from her maw, or she could lie there, next to that piece of the wall above them, not to look at it. *Only if you were closer, * she had said. And so she did. She was still, still attempting to reach out, but she could see some tears forming, and then she blacked out. I crept over to the side of the room I was with the girl and sat down beside her, looking at what it was. "I love you. And you made me happy... " I wanted to say, but I didn't want to make her feel any better about this. She looked up and saw me, and she looked down. It was the same teary eyed girl who had shown me a'love' from the rest of the school day. She had been sobbing like a dog, and I really couldn't listen. It was like she was so hard to talk to, and I never stopped looking. For a minute, she stopped sobbing and the room became much quieter. Eventually the quiet became full, and all I could do was watch and listen. Once, I realized I could only see who was crying. " Help me mom, " I said, rubbing my face and muttering under my breath. " Mommy was pulling mommy around, trying to show her love. You and Daddy are so little. But we love each other, so, so much. Just give me my normal love, and I'll make mommy happy. I promise."<|endoftext|>

The room looked clean in his eyes. It was perfect, perfect as far as the eye could see. He stared at the computer screen. The first few steps, despite everything. He put everything into his last photo and glanced up, one by one. * What has this got to do with anything? * He laughed to himself. This felt familiar. He got to the subject line, and smiled at the setting sun on the far side of the room. It was the first picture he'd put together in an image week. Usually he knew that these will be the last photo he took, because he only had a few minutes. He was fairly certain he would be seeing the first picture through his phone right in front of the picture he had in mind. People in the background would look at him in surprise and there would be a shockwave of emotions. Well, at least he would see them. He was pleased when the snow blew overhead. There were still some of the “ lost ” articles in his mind as he waited for the snow to stop.<|endoftext|>

Mark had spent the last 3 years housing and growing spies between the various factions of the Black Lotus. Soon enough, this was his pillar of peace. Whenever he was the opposition, he ’ d bait them in, give them a false perspective, and help them assassinate and foment peace between the two factions. Unfortunately, Mark was exceptionally proficient in using these tactics. Mark ’ s magics didn ’ t work in the way that Wizards could, but it did manage to totally put him in the spotlight. Whether it was seeking to destroy the top of the Black Lotus Houses, find the corrupt mages in the Black Lotus-infested wastes, or attempting to launch a nuke into a populated city, his technique always worked. It was the most thrilling duel Mark had ever fought. His dagger pierced the side of the Black Lotus Head, cutting out its left flank. With a flick of his wrist, he fired his sword. He ’ d proved his mettle with the surrounding foes once more. His fist was met by a dagger embedded in the side of the Black Lotus ’ s middle. He drew closer to strike the head off the head of the head, and prepared to fire his melee weapon. Mark fired his final volley of fire, crashing through the head, sending it directly right into the corpse of the Black Lotus Head, sending the head flying out of the tower. It was perfect timing, Mark thought, to make the victory seem inevitable. Another attack pierced through the head of the Black Lotus who ( with a flick of his wrist ) plunged his dagger into the corpse of the Black Lotus Head. This final strike was to be the death of a Dragon, and the spoils of the War. Time to go, Mark thought. In order to defeat Mark, both groups are to begin their attack. In case the second attack doesn ’ t work, it ’ s time to pick up control of their hangers. The Harbinger ’ s advice: Keep your base protected. You ’ ll be able to ambush any half-expert, while your opponents get high on Forsanity.<|endoftext|>

I ran outside. It is such a beautiful thing to see, thousands of miles away. The sky is blue, like the ocean. The sun is hovering over the horizon, glistening in the yellow glow. What is this? The waves don't like it. They say the windows aren't waterproof. They don't like the sun coming out with it. They think it holds its breath because of them. Yet, they don't respect the solar sun. The first wave was whooping as it had water. Boats were pushed off shore to me. We were the lucky ones. When the waves shifted back and forth, we sat just below the surface, so much so that the yellow ocean waves surrounding us had all but emptied out in the middle of the ocean. We reached into the raft and flipped it over, back to when I was here with the package. The long towel could hold something as big as a person's head in it. All the other things you could use to keep your well-being, to hold food, were all gone. The only water to keep us from eating at our own claws, and food that needed to be eaten, was gone. I saw young Marcus, a complete idiot. He walked up and clutched my hand. It was my knife, but he could barely lift it or fit a finger in my hand. He passed away shortly after with a life fish in his mouth. Now we stand at the beach. The yellow ocean no longer shines. All that was left is the yellow shark, and the fact that it is not really a shark. Instead, it is a light blue whale. It is absolutely joy to see it swim away, forever floating in the blue water.<|endoftext|>

"LOOK, YOU'RE A FILTHY FAILURE, DIE! " my mother scolded me as I ran away from my baby. " Do you want me to come watch TV again? " she asked pointing to the TV mounted on the wall. " You know I love Firefly and you're'fine with it'? " I ask her. " Your daughter has a lot to learn. My son was a distinguished astronomer but was never a pretty face. " She looked up with a knowing look on her face. Then I remembered. " Well, you see I haven't been able to get some pictures of your son since my mom told me about that witch though. But I'll be sure to pick your daughter up in my car and call her for her pictures. " I do as I'm told and return to driving for the evening. My brother Rodney is out of town, still single and curious about the witch. " She called as he got out of the car. " I'll tell ya if it's for her. " I look back at the wall, see the tv, go to bed, and wake up. My day isn't what it used to be, but it sure is how it used to be. Rodney sat on my bed, covering his face with his hands, reading a story from his book. " Oh and how did you end up in heaven with my mother? " Rodney asked. My son I woke up in to was in tears and was crying. " Thanks, dad. " He said. " It was alright, we really did manage to make it this far. But you didn't realise why I had started dating Tony. " " You'd be surprised how easy it was. But tonight you're going to be crowned as the best bride in this town's history. You know how hard that is for us family. We're the only family left in town, and I guess in the end it only matters that we make it out to be the best decision ever made. " " How's that?" Rodney asked as he ran off.<|endoftext|>

I began hearing the clicking in the distance when I remembered stopping by. The neighbourhood where I had always been, although my dad moved away a long time ago. Wasting no time in conversation, I asked, "Where is it? ". While stopping by, I remember that it wasn't my mother, her eyes were boringly closed, and she looked rather annoyed. However, none of that mattered now. As I poked around, I saw the 3 of them. They looked more familiar, though. They reached up at me and nudged the collar of my shirt in front of me. I wondered if that was them and why. Eventually they were all gone, and I stood up with a start. Then they turned and began to climb up my arms as they went. I poked my head through the open window. I thought they were nothing, so I let myself into the brightly lit house, and ignored the scared that had been watching me. My eyes darted through the room looking for my new home, but I could see that they were right in front of me. In front of my was an M5 to my left and my older brothers and sisters. They glided over and down the driveway, steadily increasing in speed. Maybe it was the smell of an unknown air freshener that kept them alive, or a dog or something. I didn't know. It was just a dog. And now I wondered if the kids had left me. My breathing was ragged and I didn't want to lose their interest in me anymore. I went back to my safe house, and was getting ready to leave when, from a hill I could make out, I heard something. I stared out my window and noticed a series of curiosities from the city. I kept walking and it became clearer the more I went. Cars and buses traveled past. I noticed there were 3 weird looking lizards walking in front of me. I turned my head away from the massive beasts and shifted the focus of my situation back to the sky. I just had to try to ignore all of this. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - The 4 humans climbed into their jeeps and stopped in front of my house, feeling tense. The vehicle was old and abandoned but it appeared to have been owned by someone else before I moved in here. The two humans looked at each other and laughed in a frozen way. One of them was in his last karate pose. The other had cut his lip. I had really hated that one. Finally they looked at me once more and replied, " It's just a dog."<|endoftext|>

*Before* *Vise versa* *Once* *Now* *Once* I've got him sorted out and on his ship ready to take him home yet another day gone. It's the blade of the planchette and the blade of one who will know more of the kingdom. The king is a spell, the damnedest spell. My father did he slay a man and that you're the word. Hell, he killed a dozen. He even cut yourself, putting you to a boil and turning you into a black hound. He did that, damnedest of men, who did it in the name of science and weapons. And the worst for the men that came after, oh the amount of pain and hell, and a one-sided war. But I fought for the truth. I realized what I wanted to do. I then taught the people and they have finally tasted the real world: clean, safe water, free from illness. Not poisoned, it would have been found to have no ill effects. But then we all had to move on to the next step. To become clean, safe from the plague. Some years, I even lead a housecleaning business, letting old people clean the carpets so it wouldn't look dirty. My housecleaning business will rise, and we'll take home clean water in the next month. Then we'll teach the people how to operate a raft through all the waterways of the world and defend themselves with cruise lines, blocks, knots, hooker nodes, and nets. And then I'll start the planching colony, and so on and so forth. We'll do it in the winter, and then in spring, and lastly, in summer. Soon enough, my father's disease will be eradicated, and all that's left is clean water. It will take all the blood and it will take the strength. We can't say it won't take the strength; I promise the motherlands they will all be fine as soon as the plague turns out. I never thought I would tell my people that I might have built the world and that their father would never take them away. I think they'll learn to live with it, just like my father taught them. I know I could always save my father, perhaps he'll have the strength to tell his family he'll be saved too. He would know how I was dealing with this family, and I could say that maybe now he's full of life and he's moving on. That's his way out of this darkness.<|endoftext|>

"You're gon na have to go through with this. " I was much more of a coward than a warrior. My ancestors believed that the forgotten swords would always be chosen by the warrior. Why this is a problem was beyond me. These weren't warrior's. They were heroes that got their father's trust or they were queens who supposedly protected their land. Such was the nature of youth. Old ones can endure everything and I heard them call into the hall to retrieve a prized artifact. After a few soft puffs of smoke, I stood up and walked towards the map in the center. For if I didn't have the greatest house in the realm that day, it wouldn't just be me that found it. I'd find a greatsword in every other house. " A greatsword of legend. As wanted by warlords for as long as the king has lived. I've already let a few guards kill those kings. Well they have plenty of time to get their secrets then you know how to use it. " I stepped in front of the hall to the gateway. The doors at least opened from the inside and closed once the gate opened. The hall itself was made of brick and stone, and my father kept it. He built all the weapons that existed in the realm, his grandfather convinced the stone age to be controlled by hand. There were cannons with an enormous variety of designs and weapons from swords to spears. There was also one monster in the chamber that only held a small fire only for the people to stop it from burning, the greatsword. " At least you won't see him. " I returned to the map as I turned it over. It was a woman. Her figure was but that of a young woman. Long hair down to her waist, though not always of a dark dress. " Come with me. We are just gathering dust to examine this. " " Is that some kind of drug? " She held me gently as I worked away her hesitation. The mans eyes said nothing to me. I followed her in a trance as she walked off. I followed as I picked up the greatsword. " All the time, true. You're gon na have to go through with this. " Its strange. The sword was a myth, it was from the time of our great grandfather, who was conqueror. The sword used it to protect its powers from the evil in the land. The sword then used it against powerful enemies. So little that even those who did not use it get tired to do so. The sword had been an old sword for thousands of years before our great grandfathers time of glory. It was finally on the right path. " My friend, I need to go look at this. " " Do you hear a mans? " I found a rock. " Maybe it wasn't the right path but, you know the old sword. I know the body. We only have five of you. " I turned it around and saw the weapon. It was the real estate of king Yair. Laughed with laughter as it floated across the great hall. This sword was a lesson learned from our past. It would warn that the people was destroying this land and the future of our land. The sword struck down the mans body before he could land a blow with it. I swiftly ran to the sword. After some time, I pushed it behind me. I turned around and walked toward the door. " It's open! Is someone behind the door? " I asked. There was only silence as I walked forward. " No, it is a lost artifact. " Silence. A new sound came up. I grabbed it in my hands and lead it out. " The sword only comes to knights if it has shown its true potential. Swords have never made it to greatness. I returned my hand to the sword as I took the last few steps forward. As I turned the corner, my eyes met his. He looked my way. He was dead serious. " I'm so sorry. I'm sorry... " Tears welled up in my eyes. " I'm so sorry." I let out one final roar.<|endoftext|>

There it was. It was the single most magnificent display. Gold. That was the scariest one I had seen. It looked like shit. Why had it been dropped from somewhere new that day? How dare it become a masterpiece? The color was kind of just pink. Not to mention it was on white and not black. Like to say something doesn't mean something doesn't exist. I wanted to reach out, I wanted to touch it, touch it, touch the world, I just couldnt. I mean I love how it brought me happiness just as much as it brought relief. But the man clearly never lied about it. Even if he did lie and told me that he did. He never told me where it came from, it was all there. The back where the filters had popped. I was shocked. To know he was so far from making money. The many bumps and scratches. The bloody messes. It was all just him and the wonderful colors and markings on it. And then, a bright flash. I blinked, and threw my hands in the air. A light flooded up and everything changed. I found myself in a bar, but it was gone. I don't remember the last time I had seen the street around me. In the moments that pass we always see eyes, they always look back. It was a good thing they thought I wasn't drunk, because it made me sober, too. I smiled, and kept saying the things that I would have said. It was weird having an early mood right then and there. After a while I was no longer drunk, but happy. I stopped to drink and talk to somebody. I called out the names of the people on the phone and their works. They called me up before I left. They told me they would see me, and that they would love me with everything they had. We went into their house and talked. We talked, and the dinners we had. " He's gon na make a terrible computer, I tell you!" I told them, and the screen went dark. I didn't realise my world went dark, I didn't realise the man was gone, all gone. I felt like I was going to die, I went back to that place, that place I used to live in before the lights. But then, I blinked, I threw the bar across the room. It landed on my bed. This bar had been just as good.<|endoftext|>

When the old King Al-King first usurped the throne, I didn't care. He came from a land far, far away. I raised our children. We raised them well. That didn't bother me, of course. They were already built and healthy. The next few months were spent adjusting everything with the new King and Princess Diana... which, after Al-King's passing, made things a lot more complicated. He did push us into politics. Things we had never considered before. He started sending his children on great adventures. We kept certain track of where each was going. Of course, people wanted to know, but all we could do was tell them to go home instead of back to their home planet. So we kept putting them into their ships. Seeing as how everyone wants to go to different planets and live different lives, I decided I would do it. After all, being a mother is incredibly hard. We had to take many chances. We had to account for growing up together and learning to make our own mistakes. How was I supposed to make peace with this problem? How was I supposed to take care of them and take care of every single one of them? The old King all but disappeared, leaving us to have to deal with these two'friends'. They all disappeared as well... but it only took a few months before the boat hit the sand. "Dammit! The fu- " " Silence! Where the fu- " " I don't want to die!" I screamed. It was too late... the world was no more. While I was wracking my brain, I came to see my younger brother Al-King dead in the sea. As a result, no one else can see him, so I hid in our ship and thought that he would have drowned too... until I brought it up to him... and he saw the villagers. He saw the island, the island of El-Hurar... no, **they**... hadn't been seen in a few hundred thousand years. He didn't even notice. He just knew that I had a solution. He had intended to pull my back. I froze. I didn't think I could do it myself. I knew there was no other way. Something was up. Something malicious was about to happen. It was one with my plans. A very powerful thing. I watched it roll over one by one as it rolled up it's neck. *Clank! * *click! * My last thought before he vanished was for someone to scream.<|endoftext|>

Secondly, why don't I take that shit that I am putting into college and write a paper for president in the spring?! * I mean, there is no such thing as a paper for president.

I awoke to a cold metallic taste crawling up my throat and mouth. It was cold. Not air is the same as air. I tried to be as relaxed as I could. I was still alive, the undead rush past me in a flurry of hundreds, but my body still refused to budge, unable to fight back the onslaught. My eyes watering, I was squinting at the sepia stained coffin on the floor. A shell of an old man leaning out of a metal suitcase next to me. He squinted at me, almost like trying to read my mind. “ I ’ m sorry, ” he said again. He stood up from the suitcase and walked across the back of my corpse, opening it up and pushing against the top lid. I rolled out of bed, closed my eyes, opened them and walked to the bathroom. I laid there motionless, with all the water I had been leaving on the ocean. I turned the water on the water and let the water rot in it until there was nothing but salty water. “ One person, ” I said, I kept listening to the voices, “ One organism underdeveloped, one survived the and had complete control over the entire body. We can ’ t shake them off. ” I turned down the sink and turned on the lights, but I couldn ’ t feel the drain of my breathing. I heard the crunch of peeling wood and it felt like I was stepping through a shit bucket. I rolled back to my bed. I turned on the cold jogging tracks. The light in the dark flickered, but did nothing to stop the zombies in the shadow of my body. The bars beneath my feet creaked. I didn ’ t even notice them until they were everywhere.<|endoftext|>

" Looking forward to speaking with you on my yacht, " the wheeled fan attendant signalled to his affectionate bowler, " yay! And get the money! " Steve's face grew solemn from awkward glances at the attendant. The boy stood up, nodded, and began to sail on the leather jet. " A pleasure sailing with you all, General Smith. " He looked out the windows at the not-so-phallic beauty of the ocean below, and began to light cigars in anticipation of the night's festivities. " Umm, would you like to give me a call? Yes! " This time was no exception. The pilot's voice reverberated throughout the cockpit of the vessel, " General Smith to begin! " The short-haired general turned to the captain and said, " It's nice to meet you Steve! I got your attention today, but you... you know... I don't know where to begin. I can't fathom the scale of what you've achieved aboard my yacht, but if you can give me a call, I'll have to inform you the profits just might get you a millionaire! Now, if you'll just ease me over, I'm going to be right at the door! " The sound of a door opening on the opposite side of the cabin drowned out the announcer's desire to frolic for a second. The little child's enthusiasm shot through the cockpit, " Uh-huh. " Everyone turned to face the helmsman. " General Smith for the gold? " One of the little boys with hair tied back asked the pilot. The red-ish-orange nerd and his smaller brother sat on their maroon looner. They both raised their to the sky. The winds blew softly upon the hills and trees, and the two boys looked in the rear view mirror. The sun shone brightly through the trees, and the dark sky around them. In the centre of the horizon, the now collapsed moon illuminated the bright blue sky with a yellow glow. " General Smith for the gold? " the little boy asked him. " Yes Steve! " The pilot waved a hand in the direction of the boy. The pilot peered over the horizon, and saw the two boys on their gold looner. The bright blue sky now covered by the red sky seemed to soften after an instant. The old man spoke, " What's that look on your face? You're down to just about everyone now but you... You look exactly like that man. " The boy looked back in awe at the man. " Yes... I know it's been years since anyone could have come up with the words to say'Steve, I wish you could go back home and die happy.' That's just some ignorant man, going to the lake, fishing, and having a leisurely death." Steve's heart sank as the boy spoke. He would not be forgotten.<|endoftext|>

"Truly, Master, I have admired you for so long, " the Chancellor put it. " I am truly grateful for your majesty's companion. " The Chancellor's voice is now lost in a sea of grey smoke. In his ethereal form, he stands. Wrinkled and stretching in the brisk wind. " Ah, how glorious a companion you make, " he says. " But where can I find your name now? " " You have been speaking it for so long. " A moment passes between the Chancellor's voice and the flowing wind. " How hast thou art, Chancellor? " " There have been words like,'never again' in your spread tongue. " Chancellor Ying of Ahnich, the high Nien is all that stands between Long Liao and the gentle city of Zigorn. He belongs to a faction of one dozen unnamed individuals dedicated to upholding the teachings of the Buddhist charlatan, Ungi. " Rungais. " Rungais come in all shapes and forms. For there are countless stories of how these seven-footed warriors of the Nanjooljamai come to command the Yenji temple through the valley of Wu inside the Temple of Watanigu. And now you will be mine as well, powerful one. To become that woman whose waters flow through the withering rivers will no doubt be the greatest wish of a High One. " In anger, Ying tries to curl his finger in a cunning circle. In the great moment, Ying is gone and not even the biting wind can do the killing for Ying. " Now, begin my task, Power Enforcer." Ying snaps his fingers and Aya Opal of Fist Beings of the Great Sun.<|endoftext|>

I sat at my desk for another long day at work. A simple routine, a desk job the early days. This morning was going to be a time of reaching out, taking out the trash, flaying leaves, caring for animals or making grumpy friends. I even sat down at my computer to play a video game and began the day off with some second feeling. Work was starting so I threw on my tight shirt and decked out the windows of the office just in time for the final shift starting at 5 AM. I held my breath as the boy next to me around my desk by my desk tapped my desk and waved in my direction. "Excuse me, sir? " " Sorry sir. " The little boy stared up at me with his big green eyes. " Right, what's up? You have to report back to my office later? " " I don't know sir, haven't seen you in a few days! I have no clue what's up with you! " He stood up and shuffled his way out of my office and out into the hall. The office was quiet for a moment, but when I opened my door, I had to let out a holler and just walk up the corridor before my legs would allow me to enter. " Hey wait a minute! " The boy walked through the hallway and around my desk. As he walked past, I had to say something. He was getting old. " Hey buddy, I think you fell on a sword. Did you? " He took a step back and looked me in the eyes. " I believe you went to the mines. " " This place is NOT mine! Mine?! Mine? Mine?! " He looked at me knowingly. " I thought you might be teaching me a lesson. " " You're not a real piece of garbage. Are you? " " I am not! I am a boss! " He glared at me and looked me square in the eyes. " What happened here? Aren't you an NPC? A boss NPC? What is going on here? " I laughed. He glanced at me again. " You said the mines weren't mine. And you... did some magic tricks here or there. " " Funny. " He chuckled to himself, before turning away and leaving. I chuckled to myself again and left through the doorway. " Mr. Runeco? " " I am sorry sir, it seems the machine-turned-mine belt of the north side of the planet is... malfunctioning! " He turned back to me. " I'm on my way to help the kingdom rebuild! " As I got back to my office, I punched a button on my computer, and without thinking I reached into my desk drawer and grabbed my ID card. I got up and went to the back to look at my paperwork. It seemed to be cleared, but right before I moved to turn it on I heard a strange familiar voice from my computer. It was Mom. " Uh hi Mom! Why are you here? " It didn't make any sense. After a moment, she spoke again. " The need to do well could be many, if not... I mean....many lives to get us through that. So I guess that's where it's at. You have come to our side, Bob, and at every checkpoint, you told us to abandon the quests we would be taking in the next five months. But now, I want to do a much better job at the castle and wish you every well in the future!" I don't really remember exactly what went on today, but it was the most beautiful day I've ever been in my life.<|endoftext|>

I awoke, laying on my back in a mattress over a mildew pit. I remember looking up, and a grin creeped across my face. A hand brushed mine. " Yeah, well, thanks'bout'sss personality. " I felt the thing now. Not the pit I usually felt when I was wooed away. Rather it was something I had never felt before, yet somehow somehow I was convinced I was in love. The feeling had long faded after these few days of sleep, as I felt it for the first time. I held my son close, and kissed him on the forehead, my best little boy. " God damn it, I've got to get married! " I yelled at the doctor, still holding my son close. When the doctor looked into my eyes he saw me. The devilish grin on my face was like a rotten toothpick poking my shirt. " Look at you! " he exclaimed, his voice pained. I froze in place in shock. I looked around. There wasn't anyone there. It seemed like someone else had been standing in the far corner of the room, staring at me. They had not been there when I awoke. I saw the look in their eyes when I saw their bodies. My son was gone. " Really? That's a pretty odd thing to happen..."<|endoftext|>

News of the Cat Plague caught President Obama's fancy. This week had been particularly hard on us, the President thought that we had focused too much on a small potato, a city between California and Illinois. At any rate the cats had only been prevalent in the Cats. People were scared of cat, there was growing panic. Prime minister Y.T.C, Leader of the N. American Coalition, stated "quite literally a hundred times this century since cats have been a common folk thing, " a number of scientists, politicians, and law makers who took their all caps were engaged in cases of cat hysteria. " I understand the need for public opinion reforms but sir. " President Obama, reassured the American public that cats were gone and their problem was not, and could not exist, a beast. " Sir, " stated supervisor William O'Connor " cats, like cat, are very much a local food source for the endangered animal. In fact, since cats are animals and I am very much in charge of investigating it then we may in fact be able to save the world in the short term. According to my calculations, there could be some in the U.S. and Canada ready for a Cat Apocalypse if they worry about potentially being contaminated. Although sir, we have to work fast, I would suggest that you both come to the conclusion that, we have to face this, and that we have to do this in times of crisis. After some careful consideration, I believe the cats, and any general to be around to attempt to put off were to be cast out if it become known that, basically the only way to have cats would be to intervene in the cat-caused hurricanes which would lead to big cat conflicts in the Americas. " For this reason the President, and everyone on the island, was able to frame their solutions as the solution to a very difficult yet almost insurmountable problem. When the good news came though, which was that the majority of the Earth had bitten by cat after cat, the cat started attacking the Cat itself. Everything was calm and we were all relieved that it could be contained as quickly as possible. " " Next week, and obviously after we address this again there will be a cat attack on everyone else. On cats there will be a comet or asteroid in our habitable zone, we are advised to close all major cities in our cities and major ports of port area, and even zone areas and major airports for larger and smaller cities as well, " Senator Sanders said after further talking. Well, to that end the time had come for them to show their strength and show that they will have a challenge if they continue this lifestyle. Fortunately for them, the sun would still be shining and as much as they had gone to sleep for it had consumed our food supply for nearly a week, we gave up hope. " Right now I think we need to get going on health care reforms, sort of working it out, a universal health care plan for everyone, you know, because no matter what we do, cats will still attack. " The President said. Everyone agreed he would personally respond to any problem in the long term by acting as a spokesperson for him. " It is imperative I act quickly, thank you senators." He said turning his phone off and frantically dialing a number he had never seen before. The ringing continued for a few minutes before the ringing stopped again.<|endoftext|>

Kyle stood, shake hands with Cindy, and promised that he would not hurt her. His shoulders swelled. "Come with me! " " Of course! " He lashed out angrily. Cindy's wings brushed and squirmed in an effort to allow him to escape. His chest ached as he continued to run. " Nobody was keeping track of me! All the ones you capture aren't back here! " " That doesn't make any sense. " She tried to comfort Kyle with her arms. " What if they capture us? Why are you trying to use me as a prize? " " Hey Cindy, Donny isn't helping you. I'm just going to help you work on the weapons. " " Cindy, you're just jealous of me, " Kyle interrupted. " Yeah, yeah, you can catch some sort of thing sometimes, though. They have traps out and they have traps in and they have traps in and they have traps in and you'll find them by looking in the sewers at all the ones you capture, you won't miss them. " " Oh yeah, yeah, sorry about that. But it's because I needed a weapon for the rest of my days. I never thought that finding out it was my parents would be a bonus! You were an amazing kid and a great hero. You must be someone's dream come true, " Cindy chuckled. She stretched out her hand. Kyle nodded. " Whatever you want. You're cool. We have a warehouse near the city I can be found with a hammer and nail if you want. " The hug was bitter, and Cindy hated herself for it. Kyle tried to ignore it, but his heart beat was as ragged as her off. " Okay, okay. I'm done. Thanks for being here. " " Cindy, " Kyle continued, " Time to find your parents? " " I could sneak in there, " Cindy nodded. He shook her hand. " Alright. Remember that tie in there? I can convince your parents to come with me, take my place. I don't want them seeing me like this. " " These things are just simple rules; that's how we work. After all, it's my job to extract the prisoners away from prison. But my question? Is it really necessary to expect everyone to obey? " Kyle sighed. He squeezed his eyes shut. He hadn't planned for the results to be so grim. He stepped over Cindy's arms and walked towards his chair. " I'm worried about how I'll be treated. I have a feeling that there's a lot of trouble happening now. You can trust me, though. We've done our job. You'll find them eventually."<|endoftext|>

I was nervous. I was ready for this. Everything had changed so quickly that I wouldn't even remember when my last major surgery was. Or even if I did. I had nothing. Nothing but needles and small machines. I was traumatized. Losing it all, living a mediocre life because the doctor couldn't get it right. The next experience I had was a family of doctors. It wasn't easy. My family couldn't afford expensive surgery, so I lost everything. But then I passed the family and lived happily ever after. As a doctor, that is. My life was perfect until one day. I had a family of doctors. They offered a discounted surgery, paid extra for the procedure, anything. Wasn't enough to make up for every debt. Before I realized what was happening, they all lost everything I had ever known about them. They begged for payment. I refused and tried to make them pay. I even admitted to them that I was the most hurtful father they had ever known. The doctor gave me morphine, he would never need it. But, this stopped when he realized that he could no longer handle the pain that plagued me. Then, the family called for help. I told them not to take me back. I told them they could help me. There was hope. But, I only wanted one thing. Peace. I walked out with my wife, Eleanor, and our son, Nathaniel, behind me. We had just woken up.<|endoftext|>

"How many times do I have to tell you? " I ran my hands along the threads, tied around my inner thigh. My hands reached the base of my neck and as I looked down at my feet, a quick intake of breath prevented my hand from touching the ground. Maybe I really needed that last " point of reference ". Be careful of the butt, it might poke you. As I stepped off the buggy, holding a finger to each side, I wondered if life was worth it all. My hand shook, and I glanced across the road. The shore, the playground, even the circus. I kept listening to the fluorescent lights flicker overhead, trying to remember if there were songs to play. Maybe it was time to head back home. I didn't quite care anymore. I'd do anything for this trip, any adventure that was going to follow me here. The mosquito in my beard decided to tug at my tail, sending a small, shiny spray down my stinky dresser. I tugged back nervously, trying to think of something to say. Maybe she was upset. I noticed that the neighborhood was wet, and I began to enjoy how well it was getting up to. This time, I'd consider staying a bit longer. I reluctantly walked around to the front door of the bar, and I heard the heavy footsteps approaching slowly into the open lot. In the same couple seconds, I made it to the front of the family all the way up to the big, empty door, where it was locked. Walking carefully to the seat that was opposite me, I sighed and looked around. If the place was crowded, I just wanted someone to pick me up. The dim moonlight filled the opening, illuminating a bedroom with soft light coming from every direction, and just the two of us, watching the sunset in the distance. The cagunk chair in the far corner, and when the wedding album filled up with artist moments, I had to lean against it. Her side was still a bit young, but it was all she did well. " I really didn't think it would be this bad, didn't I, " she said, looking down at me. " We should really have gotten you a new one, " I replied. " You did really well back then, weren't you? " She chuckled and pointed at my child smile. " Wow, you even had a child on you. Love you son. " I relaxed, trying to relax. A small smile formed on her face as she made up for it, " There was only one problem after all. " " Well, I got another target. " " A teenage girl, " I mouthed, and stepped toward her. She reached out and touched me on the neck. " But she has my name, and I think we should try something new. " " The drugs, " she replied, looking at me. " Drugs just have strong effects on the system. So we should get off of that, " she thought as she pulled back a few buttons. " But can we change that? I don't like them for the kids, either." She gave me a disgusted look. After all, she was one of the best athletes I've ever seen. That means we'll just have to do whatever she'd like. The whole nine yards, I got to the top of the stage, and I pushed the massive boulder up on top of it. As the boulder hit, I felt the familiar sensation of skin being ripped off of me, bringing me back down to earth. If there was one moment to be happy with, it would be this.<|endoftext|>

I could never forgive myself. But I was meant to be the one to look over her family, to visit them at every turn. She would always offer me a hand for a fresh job, the only other in the restaurant that she enjoyed. No one can forgive me but I do. I wish I could, just for one moment, bear the rest of the family's judgement. An unspoken rule, a reality of life itself, as mine and mine alone are. At least that's what she tells me. She never reminds me about the other half of my family, even though her sons and daughters are half as beautiful. They were soldiers and healers and heroes and good people. I'm barely two years old and barely even enough to understand what those words mean. I have enough money to buy a crib, move somewhere nice. I have enough love that I have to make sure that my daughter keeps smiling every day, not having to put up with the scars. I want to be her friend and I want her to help me. But never is that the thing I need.<|endoftext|>

The moment of stop was not immediately the same for his stomach. His hunger burst through his massive throat, and the depths of his pubic skeleton tasted of stupor. Life seemed a lot simpler. Rather than dread at his death, he wondered if he would still be after his father. It was around that moment he realized that he was on his own. Just as he was about to accept his father's death from a man he felt alone in a world where love comes easily. Finally he found the last vestiges of his father, who would leave a trail of bones. It was at this moment, when his stomach began to amaze him, that he stood suddenly in a field. He was standing alone in the concrete. Nothing except his mother watching him stumble through the streets of London and detour to her house. She was exhausted, but with every fiber of her being her stomach began to throb with an ache. For the first time in his whole life his stomach felt like that of a murderer. Someone he has slain to satisfy his own lusts.<|endoftext|>

"Thanks for being a good sport," I responded in my own deep voice. So I say. Then part of my confusion started to subside, I couldn't remember even back before anything happened. My parents sent me a letter from my mother that had a neat little name attached. My dead family. Shit. I'm not even sure if I'm even human yet, I'm dead and brain dead. My dead family was probably 16 when they sent me to the hospital; if I wasn't dead I would've been living my normal human life. So why was I doing this to themselves? I was curious for a moment. I quickly convinced myself that the afterlife had a mystery to it, something strange. Were I getting good at playing games? Whatever. So I went on a journey through time. I found a passage that opened up with a door I didn't recognize. He opened it and I stepped into his dream. Everything was a fair guess, except I was actually very young, which was a rarity. What could have happened to me? How did I even end up on this horrible world? Is this where I'm going?<|endoftext|>

My mother never came home for the winter. I'm not sure why. I ’ m all alone, feeling like a lot of things are not right around me. I wish she didn ’ t come with me to the bush and make me stop and warm up before mowing the lawn; unfortunately for me, they make me stay outside for months, and my mother chooses the place for our kid so he can roam. I feel a fire inside me when I look at the crack, I hear it making sounds and smiling. It is warm after all. There ’ s a disturbing smell when the plant grows, rotting leaves crawling over my bare feet as I bathe in the sunlight. I shake my head and close my eyes, letting them relax and let the symptoms of my morning nap feel at peace. After I receive their warm scent, I change into my summer outfit and head to the baby maker store. In the opening, I see Mrs. Coyote. She ’ s looking the same as the one she made for me. I feel a tug on my shoulders, I walk a little while, in my clean white undershirt and faded jeans, into the warehouse I made for her earlier today. The heavy beige paint is almost opaque, like the blue skies that would create blues and yellows at midnight. Mrs. Coyote has soft brown eyes, and she appears to be packing chemicals for cleaning something. She seems like she has good years, but there ’ s a hint of hickory-like substance in her makeup. She cleans the paint a little while, taking care to turn off the packaging. I step through the open door into a bright light, where the bright lights start to shine on. Mrs. Coyote sits in the center of the room. She looks dirty and looks like the products she was used to. She moves behind me in a fit of anger and musters up some energy to move me. It ’ s been years since I ’ ve been the same person. As for what happened yesterday, I know what will happen to her next. I ’ m almost there. I ’ ve waited for her and she has returned. I look around and see why she chose me the way I have been. It ’ s why every little boy asks her where she went, and every little girl is there to say yes. But she is not here for me. She is here for me, and I need to let her know I was not her. I can feel the light on my back, my feet, my hair and muscles. I walk up to the large red box I brought to Mrs. Coyote. The box is too big for me, even with the pillow that my mother used to lay on top. I get up and throw it onto the cold box and shove it towards my face. I feel a hot sensation coming on as I realize that I am not working just yet. My emotions are starting to drain away, and I start crying. I ’ m getting excited, but I guess it ’ s because Mrs. Coyote says that she wouldn ’ t mind bringing me back for her summer excursion.<|endoftext|>

"So we always said that,'A Song of Ice and Fire' would repeat itself with a resolution... ugh, I don't think it's even possible!

Another time on the Game of Thrones... Should be quite interesting. No point in wasting my time my way. No, for the love of Cthulu, I'll allow you to go ahead and retell it more like part of the Rise and Fall of Grondor, because in my humble opinion that is the best way to spoil George RR Martin's characterizations."

I stared at him as the static escaped his lungs. I knew the cold steel of the clock was on, and to hear the man tell it... me. He laughed, it was like laughing, like I have had to experience these moments. This is the only thing I recall that has given me comfort, I remember that silence, but also memories... * Eyes falling from my partner's window, his thumb counting backwards, a long white from his *neck*, and a lower limb from our feet. Silence crept over me. Behind me, I heard him, hunched, a hand on my shoulder, eyes closed, eyes unfocused as he lifted himself out of the house. He didn't look like the male in the study room, he really wasn't like the man I spent the past three months studying, this girl. She almost seemed like a decent sister in ways that I didn't expect, and yet, just as he had dreamed it would be, she had said the words to me, and now the day turned to night. * " Why does everything have to be so... like this... " * I began to say, as his hand gripped my door and flung open his wardrobe door, and opened, and she was sitting up on her pillows. * " Why doesn't it taste good tonight? I was thinking maybe it would give me a hangover, and not like that. " * He tried to direct my attention to the source of his words, to the way he stared at her, at the way he was feeling, his smile, the look in his eyes... * " Your hunger makes it all the more unbearable." *<|endoftext|>

Little Red Riding Hood found his wife's body across the farm. Her clothes had been splattered over the dust muck as the sun had come out in the distance. Her long nose and freckles had been dislocated and in a shallow grave was hanging a small book which had shattered when it read "To the Dead Romance: The Cursed Bastards". The soldier rushed up to his post and hid amongst the bushes outside, until he heard rustling. He felt a bolt of lightning strike against his body. A blood red dye spilled over his face. Two bloodstained shadows loomed overhead, all shaded by pitch black night. The sound of a car was heard behind. The soldier pulled his pistol out and raised his hands, but there was no weapon around him, as blood began to pour from the gaping wound in his chest. Blood. * Purple. * It had been months since the war. Each country had found a new way to deter the Devil from taking his throne. Each country sought to enslave the Holy Empire, and with the Hell upon our Watch, United States, Great Britain, and France. The wrath and fury of the Devil was to be felt at every turn. Once one, his throne had come into being, over and over, and without pay. On one side stood the Republic of Germany, on the other a Kingdom of Protestant America. One mass. One minister. One young boy. And there was red, blood stained shirt, embossed with the words "When you looked into my eyes I knew then I could kill you". Upon that battle, Germany had beaten the United States. Germany lost nearly all of Europe, for on that night France and Austria were cleansed of the Bloodthirsty, Bloodthirsty Devil that had plagued Germany for so long. There were not many people left who would understand.<|endoftext|>

Al's Silly Butt couldn't even pass a joke around to his buddies. He'd already said it to 9'6, as well as 8'7 and a PZ 34 40 handgun at the party earlier that year. "Fucking pigs, like ol' Andrew, take your shirts off after the party tonight, eh?" replied the angry lizard man to his nemesis. Stepping into the battle room, Al couldn't help but mumble.

The prison machinery shuddered as the block clicked on its final destination. I sat on the edge of the rail, dumbfounded as I recalled the sudden appearance of the human convict and was reminded of the prisoners death at their hands as the wheel stopped at six o'clock on the third day in jail. His face was contorted in confusion, nervously sweating profusely as he watched the pen stretch before him. I glanced to the left briefly as I tried to focus on all the monitors streaming monitors showing what I had just witnessed. The scenes were... familiar. It was easy to see that they always came close to interacting with the prisoners and what was happening there. We were watching them, seeing them at their worst and then being overwhelmed with anger. They should have more freedom and more change. We shouldn ’ t have to rely on the human condition. We should keep it that way. This had been some time ago. I was striding down the corridor with my hands over my head when the sign in the wall said **HUNG #** and the attendant inside the room shot a glance at me, “ Check here. ” “ Okay. Good. ” It was another long day of work at the facility. Word was getting out, it had to be monitored. I had to wear my new government issued same form that I was issued. I cleared my throat, “ Understand that we are trying to end this experiment… ” A tall man in a trench coat stepped over my worried shoulders. “ They found you last night. Everyone except the inmate, who tried to flee the prison when they saw you. You weren ’ t even here. ” He laughed, “ Yeah, I know. I ’ m just not hearing it at the moment. ” He walked over to the guard who was watching me and placed a hand on my shoulder. I shook my head, “ Nah, that doesn ’ t matter. I ’ m not recording this here. I ’ m recording you. ” I was glad to be out of the facility and there was no time for rummaging through inmate belongings. I knew that he was a fool and he deserved death, but I ’ d heard stories that he could be very persuasive. “ I didn ’ t know! ” He was right. I had been watching them, searching for them. “ There are no big governments, no big companies, no ones that people would want to collaborate with. They don ’ t get asked to be my friend. So much so that when we met you, I thought you would never notice. ” He laughed again, “ It ’ s just all I can see now, you see? It ’ s all I can see now. You can ’ t really see me. All I see is the silly blank look on you face as you stare at me. It ’ s what makes me want to write something like ‘ this guy who looks more like a clown than a human is taking me out of existence with his sword and when he… ’ but I don ’ t know any human who ever does. ” I stepped out of the station wagon and slammed into the wall waiting for the guards to open the door. As I neared the chair and yanked on his collar I could see his expression on his face as he didn ’ t believe what he ’ d just seen. Was it an illusion? Or was he hallucinating or was it a dream? The man in the trench coat had a snicker on his face, “ You ’ re just an alien, don ’ t you realize? ”<|endoftext|>

It all started this afternoon. " A long time ago... " The hands that responded to the call dissipated, mostly just they still glowed green -- standing taller. Slowly, the nights changed to the mornings. Ever since my memory of being in a bar turned into staring daggers, taking my life so literally. The hallucinations were pretty new but completely out of the ordinary when I was small and rounded. I met my wife at 12 and she had one of those waifu dreams that first lit my imagination. She first said that our family was dead, that her son was just taken from her mother's arms and eaten by a shark. Of course the other dreams I found were started at 8 years old. They all stuck to one thing: the same killer fish. The nightmares that followed were pretty bad, mostly bad news that everyone was asleep... but not them. When I called the cops the next day, I got more details than I had bargained for in a long time. After that I was working at a local bar as a bartender, where I found a young bartender whom turned out to be way more reliable than he was originally. Then the hit for me was the serial killers around the city. One woman that claimed to be his wife, their son, and their adopted-not-islander's wife had a list of murders that I had to take her down when I arrested her. I went first on that, finding her two cell blocks away. But my charge was caught, after that two others on the same block I first tried to find. They were nowhere near where I first encountered them. So I picked them up as soon as they was gone. At one point I found out that her necklace was encrusted with bullets and that she killed her own husband. But they didn't look like they had been taken by a shark, so I called the cops. Within a week of the murder, the police caught up with me and I was at the scene of the crime that brought me to the bad part of town. They discovered that a hostage she claimed to be about to kill their father, who died in a car crash shortly before the execution. And they found a wallet, worth about $ 30,000 dollars. I was broke, I was going to jail, but I didn't know it was going to be a long time before I would wake up. That night I packed up my suitcases and left to go kill whatever the fuck the police found. I don't have a real job, but I still keep to myself.<|endoftext|>

"I'm sorry, Kayden, " My face dropped and I reached up to make sure it wasn't the Crohn's disease; to make sure there was something in my mouth, there wasn't, probably only there for a bit, and definitely not for long. " I didn't mean for it. " I said and smiled from ear to ear, not breaking eye contact with myself. " I never meant for it. I'd never realized that it couldn't be happening in your lifetime. " " N-n-no... " I broke down into several tears, but kept my voice even to myself. It felt like a burst of pure nature to me. But Kayden, she was the person I could have become; the all-knowing, all-knowing, All-intelligent, All-living being in our world. She'd been everywhere, doing the perfect thing that I'd dreamt of. I had given birth to Kayden and received the eulogy, my granddaughter and great-grandson of hers. Everyone was ecstatic and marveled at our success; we had more breakthroughs than any human has ever thought possible. Then on the day my vision happened, when my whole family got together and started planning a birth, while I was the one on the run, I got the news. " You are no longer at the Phoenix Oval Office, and on behalf of the United States, I, Patrick, deplore the government's failure to protect the genealogical integrity of the future of your family. " I hung up the phone. " You live in Los Angeles, and I will continue to remain relevant in the future. And soon we will all die in the rain." There was an awkward pause and then there was a bump. It was then that I felt my vision bleed, a look of regret crossed my face and I almost fell to the ground.<|endoftext|>

I've always thought this girl was a girl as beautiful as any other person ever saw. Her tawny hair swept her face as if she was looking out of a tattered and wrinkled telescope. Her eyes were feral and torn from the world outside. I hadn't met anyone, and now I was in the hands of a girl who meant so much to me, and there was no one to hear me out of my misery. She asked me to repeat what I said. " Keep your head low, " my mother said. " That's the woman who killed our gods." At that moment I realized she was right. She was that way. I promised to live my life with my sins so that the next one would never come. However, a world devoid of free will, where no one could claim control over a fickle force, would be a more familiar place. I could blame myself for not signing up for that program a long time ago. But it's clear that people wouldn't accept that. I should have asked to be one of them. But I felt betrayed. But she betrayed me. A night light is the only color I can see through my veil of ignorance. And after they tell me that there is nothing to be worried about, it truly is nothing.<|endoftext|>

There is something about the hunt that makes me want to run after a loved one. My childhood idol. Her name was this girl I made up to myself the night after my birth, my true love. They had been in love, until I passed away in a freak accident. It was on accident that I finally became aware of my true love. As it turns out, every single person after me has been completely contorted into two separate personalities. And that's just me. Every single one of them are born into the *normal* world. * Normal*. Everyone around me is the same, except me. I can't tell you how many times I have realized I'm not my true love. Why has this hell hole filled me with dread? I think it's because the rising tides of panic have pulled my stories from the present to the past. The question is. How do I know I really am my true love? "What is your true love?" we might ask ourselves. Usually it takes a day or so for people to realize who we truly are, at first. It seems more and more like weeks have passed. I need to be ready. * It's Friday, I have three eggs, and three milk*... and I just need to be * ready*. But it's not gon na happen this time. It had been years since I had proof. I've been told that someone came through the fence before me. There was only a few of us left. There is no way I could be there. Not now, not again. Not ever. On Friday, the day I lost everything. No one will know how I died. Their ability to survive through the ravages of terror usually gives someone a reason to volunteer. I was starving at the station the other day. When I arrived, there were two men sitting by my window, blinking at each other in desperate desperation. I told them I was pretty sure I needed to get home. They were freaked out. They hugged me. They had no idea what to think of me, what to think about their life. I thought there would be some easy way out. Finally, they understood. My turn to go. I know it's going to be harder to get through this, but I need to fight... I need to be strong.<|endoftext|>

The day the news broke about the President's announcement made everything jump. That fell even further out of the story. He had finally won. Last time Valve, of course, allowed a marijuana user for the first time to play Half Life 3, the good news was that everything they had to do was legal, and free. The news didn't stop with the word of a new law, either. ** "Legalize Marijuana in America, NOW!" ** Valve's next expansion will be released in February, 2027. **<|endoftext|>

I can't remember how or why I'd started my obsession with this. Maybe that was one of the reasons I always dressed with a pack of poles at first. I remember it clearly, the weird star shaped head shaped that helped me keep track of time and when I touched it I would get a warm breeze so I would stare at it in awe of the beautiful sky. I remember sitting at an elementary school library every day. It seemed to glow, become slightly more bright from the wind and save us our teacher the need to look back to warn us. I want to forget that school but I can't. Then one day my dog, John, came home scared and hungry. John had just been leaving his mother with Linda and her boyfriend Theo when John ran and yelled at them to run away. I ran away to find John. After a while he started picking at the apple and leaning on it trying to escape. I wanted to chase him to stop and when I ran out of the school I looked at the sky. The stars seemed to be big, from the back of my head. Everything in the universe went dark. I had been eating breakfast at my house. After eating I get an itch in my butt. It rubbed like a dermabitch. I stuck an apple around my butt and noticed it was all dark and black. I saw it coming from the window of my house and thought it would just be weird seeing someone try to run away from something. After eating some breakfast I peeked my butt towards the house and found my nuts stuck to it. When I looked back the aliens were gone. I still had socks on.<|endoftext|>

An infant sitting in his crib has gone mad for a few minutes. For ten agonizing minutes the strange child wait for the next suffocating sound. The voice continues into the morning light and it breaks in to a deep deep voice that can only be a very shaky one. The child finally decides that he wants to be quiet, to scream no more. The voice speaks again "I'm dead! " The child was so proud he went to hug the distraught person at the hospital that day, having alone witnessed such a nightmare. When he realized it was happening a thought occurred to him " what if everyone else out there just dies all at once? ". Without anything more than a laryngoscope to calm the infant he began to push the mother out of the way. The infant screamed for the power but still it was locked in its bedroom no longer. Once it had calmed the helpless mother rushed out, cursing at whatever existence this universe has before her that the infant had created and who has power over the universe. But not before not a single thing said a word. The baby was both lost and scared. There was no serenity in his newborn being but there was a calmness in its heart. Knowing he must find the voice he urges the head doctor to pull the plug as soon as possible. A flash of light plays over the hospital, the hospital staff were panicking because who had seen this? After a while the rest of the staff appears to be coming away, " this is still out there! It can't be!" The only thing that the voice was clear is that it was exactly as the infant had said and no one was inside.<|endoftext|>

When my life left me, I found myself in another world. Until I was trapped. How long has it been? Somewhere between 100 years and 200? Would you like to know the exact time it was between? It's so dark outside on a Friday. It is the morning, and most of the people here are either outside or at their house. But you can tell for a fact that if they're outside, they're spending time outside of their house. It's convenient. You're safe for one person to be, if you so desire. But to keep the outside person and the outside person locked inside? I don't. Not when you aren't in a clear fire, hiding. But I believe I shall find you - if only for a moment. I'll let you remember what you were dealing with, when you were a war veteran, when you were a rock star. But first you must understand the time was different. Peace is hard when it comes from the inside. Peace is practiced when you find it - done. Peace is practice. In war, free will fades as you sort out what lies ahead. And life, huh? Are you about to find out? There is peace for you, though it was here that it may take. Peace is everything. Take one with you, and find yourself happier and more content each day. It is only a matter of time until you find peace. Without a world like this, something like this, all it would be like is.... Two. ( My first WP and probably most out of will. I'm older, so feel free to correct me if anything wrong with it changes or otherwise, I'm just as tired as ever and would appreciate constructive criticism. )<|endoftext|>

The family that pretends to be our family goes away together when you get bored. One morning I wake up to the sound of the stairs creaking, and its the creaking of your window. A mini family wouldn't shut up about it, our house in the suburban way, usually with an air-conditioner. I shut my eyes tight and turn on the TV to see my late wife and I, the rest of our family. A sadistic maniac only homes to children but I imagine it was a little unfair that I got only a bad ending to the next Saturday, a slow weekend away. We don't eat or sleep, we play video games at school and just hang out with guys that are horrible at politics, funny enough I still haven't seen a bad side of myself since I was a teenager. We'd fight all day, wearing our cleats and tattoos, except that not even the cocky ones could laugh at the top of their lungs but the others would start drinking their cheap booze and then meet up in the living room and talk about all their problems on a dare. We figure it out a little in our teen years but still look very much young when we jokingly call you a 6th grade character when you aren't dating them. Then I guess some control issues die down, change and we see the whole "I can't survive a four year old still living with a cynical confidence level of zero and I get my extreme cynicism broken a good nine times in my life, but when you have two simultaneous years of family gone the eighth time " and I am still the dud!" such is our bond. And we've had a lot of stories to tell, we'd throw in a little pregy because we don't want to screw up, do anything stupid and that is okay. Until I run into my grave, my girl. I am a seventeen year old fashion blogger in California, I've never written before, so feel free to ask the questions I've asked, I'm glad I answer good in all my stories!<|endoftext|>

I try not to think about it too much. I have to think about it. Sure, there's some people sitting outside reading this. Some living here. Some sitting at home watching the news, somewhere else. I can't quite focus on what I think when I stop myself in my tracks, no matter how calm I am. If I're reading these things... what, oh, am I staring at anyway? Maybe, I'm thinking about the time that the religious youth started burning the fags that now left my post office on June 28th and all was forgotten. Or that the world stopped falling and the old, decrepit coal mine before it. I think about just what all the the people have missed. What hope is there in this small town anymore that the next cataclysm will destroy civilization? Maybe I'll start thinking about the times I actually survived. Maybe I'll find the desire to kill someone. And then I'll try to figure out why they feel the way I feel. Maybe there's a pressure that I think I must take. Maybe a curse or an unstoppable zombie. I wonder if I could have been like them. I know I probably would've been fine that day. Or maybe I would have gone through what I now do. Maybe. I have to think about it. Maybe I'll find someone else.<|endoftext|>

Roland sat in his room. The bed was beginning to dim and the sheet that covered him was beginning to melt. He had started climbing it, yelling like a hundred people in the world. He thought about pulling the blinds on, but what he didn't realize is, they were completely on. There was no light coming in through the blinds. He turned the lights off. His eyes flickered. He took a deep breath. The smell of burning flesh left him a bit nauseous. Stairboard. No light coming from the ceiling. He closed his eyes and looked around. The night sky was fresh blue. Just slightly past midnight. Just beyond the horizon. His friend bought him a flashlight after he left. He looked down and saw that his orange bedsheets were starting to lighten. His red bedsheets were starting to lighten. It took him a second to realize. There was nothing in between the lamps. Again, he would see the light ahead. He turned off the flashlight and carefully lifted it to his bedside table. He found it exactly as planned. The window was still hanging, perfectly level, just behind the tree. He stepped back on the flashlight. Turning it over, he turned it on to brightness. The room was standing where his friend walked. This was the exact opposite of what he expected. His bedroom looked like a plane, but had two doors that swung open in a different direction. His friend dropped the flashlight over a nearby stack of boxes. Roland began to cry. His friend took his hand in his. The same sobbing sound. Something was bleeding from his hand. It started coming from his stomach. He started punching the ground with his fist. His friend squirmed in panic. But his friend noticed immediately. Roland had attempted to pull him away from the open ground. But his hand had broken the knife. After what seemed like an eternity of gripping his arm, he finally released his arm and reached down to get rid of the knife. He pulled out a zip-lock pistol from the closet and inserted it into his pocket. For some reason, his mind wandered, "I'm serious, man."<|endoftext|>

One day as I am laying in bed, imagining all the bad movie monsters in movies and more, I realize my dreams are beautiful. That's when I realize that there is a very rare cancer that makes me inlanguish with the common man's character. Which I can not possibly imagine is what I was expecting. The day of my performance, only a week from when I was ready to go to bed, the movie monsters were already showered in all manner of gifts that have the villain and the angel undress. I don't know what was missing from their boxes, but I realized I didn't meet the usual requirements for theatre boogiemen, get me up to speed, and do an action so personal and so... emotional that I come to the realization I'm not only a monster. So I have to go to the spot where the monsters are gone. I plan on my best role in the theatre, and stay there until they are gone. It will be okay.<|endoftext|>

Black magic. The human gaze doesn't know how we come to this conclusion. The human eyes knew it would be folly. For centuries we called them the Black List. A council of mages of dark lands, powerful by magic, with dark powers, and black mages to guard us. In black spells, we summoned the protectors of darkness. The hunter-gatherers of China, in a battle which ignited beyond the curse of our relentless weapons. And we toiled alongside them. We grew together, best friends, on our best raids to survive. It's been seven generations now since the Black List lost its secretive vaunted foothold. We have forgotten what we were before. We shamble the black lands, searching for only our own. Mages, heroes of the dark arts, fairies and lord. All our victories have left trails of madness and fear. After all, we are the world ’ s greatest spell breaker and the last hope for the peaceful darkness. But still, the Black List thrives. It maintains power on all sides. The rulers of the ancient lich blood, the Ageless Demon Lord who went dark hundreds of years ago. Even the sages who dwell in the seventh realm revel in our safety. I was once called the best mage in the order. Was the bloodguard even worthy? Or perhaps just an apprentice, chosen after years spent laborious training to ward off the damned darkness from us? All the stories were false. I know the truth. The council is sworn on the heels of the greatest mage ever born, the Master of Dark Magic. A man with the wit, numbers, cunning, and will to teach those around him the Dark arts, willed him to be their champion. The prophecy foretold that when the dark lord of this realm was dead, only the army of the unholy realm would remain. Three faces stand at my door. The Master of Magic, the Watchful Master. The protector of the protection of the Dark Evil. I am sworn to protect the world. “ Retreat. ” Screams the door swings open. The world screams in terror, in fear. A voice echoes in the room. I realize what I ’ ve done. I must withdraw. I have created the true dark side. Summoned the Saviour of Mankind!<|endoftext|>

The snow left no trace of itself on the sidewalk, and it was in full view on the street. Upon the lines made up the street were arranged men and women, armed with uniforms stripped of color. Crimson flags displayed above a central fence, were identical to the heraldic gowns worn by chiefs before conquering. "Mankind is fallen" was etched on the neck of the small woman and the flags on each one were hung limply on hooks. Whoever climbed up the fence lived in complete harmony with the street, baring their insignia with a scene that was told to be timeless. After a few twists and turns, a man stood before the closed gate of the suburb of Stevenson. He wore a red shirt and tied a grey hat. He was adorned with scarlet mail and silver ringlets. Following the decor were groomed men and women. The act only satisfied the man, who continued to the road outside where his beautiful bride lay. Five more twists and turns passed before she succumbed to her injuries.<|endoftext|>

The fondest memories that the scientists of Delphi shared was of his earlier times. From the time we sent our fleet up to the Trojan Desert, to the war fought between the Middle Eastern Barbarians and their Achilles brothers in the Serine Cliffs. All that was left were the descendants of those traumatized by defeat. The small army that they formed swept through the thin atmosphere of our spitland, landing in many nations, countries, and pockets of space. Our space fleets returned only after a short time, though one had shown fierce resistance. These efforts were brief at first, not long enough to overcome the size of our fleet. Short would be short, however, and long would come too. We took down most of them with staccato, sweeping over the Earth to see who would win. Their might was mighty, fearsome, and then only use as a last resort. The Terran clavicus was a stronger foe than our cruisers were capable of defeating. Despite how short our forces were, we were strong. Our airships reached their threat almost instantaneously, nearly dying in the time the airships were short. However, in due time, the ships had their slipspace engines leaking from their containment wards. It took us only a week of sneaking past one of our brothels to intercept a route for the Terran fleet. A nuke so huge our reconnaissance fleet had plenty of time to distance itself. However, something else was coming. We were looking for scraps of our ship's communications and weapons. Most were nonfunctional, as the defensive systems of the ships themselves made even the most reliable firing of their ion cannons disastrous. But the numbers of broken engines still showed. It was a fitting end to a war that would continue to spook the attention of the vast galactic community. "What, " Shaking my head in disgust at my side of the conference table, I reached for the detonator. Shaking my head again in disbelief, I reached for the transmitter and tested it on a map of the Terran arsenal. The waves were much more intense than we feared. The light of the explosions stained the map very faintly. The hallway was dark, and my influence got the better of me. I walked into the defensive room to see what the generals were working on. Their faces were mirrored by my own, and each face went to me in some way as a reply. " Perhaps we shouldn't have sent the recon ships."<|endoftext|>

"*Dad. * " he yelled out, the static slowly creeping past the lab coats covering his ears. " *Son. * " Dad whispered, and tears welled in his eyes. " *We're going to go swim in the air on this one*. " He said nothing, and the black encasing the air around him only for the black bubbles to subside and add to their own volume in their continual shadow. To them, it was simply a dream. To them the room was spectacular and endless, an endless ocean, vast by any definition, and it gave them the ease of watching their friends and family. As the waves opened, so did the lab coats. The thick steel ropes on their backs were suddenly empty as they uncurled their arms and forced themselves over to the splashbox on the left. As much as his fear was settling in his stomach, his panic was weighing on him more than ever. After fumbling through the crumpled mess that was his backpack, he rolled over onto his back and stared at the sea. " You stupid sonofabitch," he bellowed out, and with that, the blackness flooded the surroundings. The white lab coat's silhouettes floated near the scuba suit's eyes in the darkness. As he struggled to fit his feet into the heavy gutter, he cried out to the sea: *To hell with you, sonofabitch! *<|endoftext|>

This is odd. I never thought I would find a device that could send signal. I knew then what I know now. That there were traces of radio waves left by earth. I had been seen while jogging through the park watching the latest episode of every show from the last 8 years watching the newest episode of Avatar. Now that they were appearing I knew that I had passed through their portals so quietly they didn't notice. And it had never come to this. That they would respond to any light-waves from the nearby star, just as any radio radio would, and never broadcast information about it. How, just hours ago, I took that leap of faith towards a signal coming from an unknown source in the distance. I took that leap with renewed urgency as I scanned the dark corner of the park, roused from the final freeze of radiation by the cold night air. "Shit." The sink was still cold. The radio had lost power, a picture of it flashed on my monitor. I waited a full second to see if my friend noticed the picture on my monitor and checked for the back-up signal. Neither did I. Ever since the signal had come back to me it had been this quiet. Nothing. Nobody to talk to anymore, nothing. And now that light signal was out of my reach, I looked at the wall clock.<|endoftext|>

Harold sat alone in his room, the closet open. He gently put on the hand rest and felt its warmth against his cheek. He reached over and comforted his tired eyes with his hand, desperate to please the girl. She wasn't beautiful, but her skin was soft and her clothing felt warm and his hands were running along her ear. A snap of her neck told him to stop his plans to become a hunter. He caught a glimpse of her face through his wide window but missed it entirely when she tossed him a sandwich. He stared in absolute awe as he ran his fingers over the sandwich. "How did you like them? " He asked, as his expression slowly lowered, " I've been teasing them. " She smiled widely at the thought, the bold contrast in her eyes turning his stomach into knots, as the accident that had happened this morning sent shivers down his spine. " Ha! What are you teasing? " Harold looked down, eyes wide and shuddered. She pulled out a sheaf of frisbees from the basket that she had brought and slapped them onto the table. With a squeak she snatched the frisbee straight up and took it off the table. Harold looked to his side and saw his skirt was drawn. She gave him a light smile and took a quick smoke break. He returned her glare of horror with his own. The round cheeks reminded him of a sunflower. Her pale skin scorched him, running over the skin like a colored corona. She sat on the bed again, casually looking at his feet. He grabbed the sheaf and closed the door behind her. As she walked away, he stopped dead in his tracks. He saw her feet up, moving from side to side. Harold stood frozen in horror as he scrambled to find a spot to release the shaking from his heart. This was what he wished he could do, the girl was in his backyard again, laughing at him. " You even invited her out? " She teased, feeling more guilty than anything. This was part of what she wished to avoid. " She came in? " Harold asked worriedly. She stopped in her tracks, turning her head and smiling gently at him. She cut in, the touch of her hair curling around her nose. She knew he was smiling, as if the smile had opened the way to his surprise. The only thought in his mind was what I gave her. " She goes to town and tries to scare people. " Harold chuckled, " I've seen that a lot. " " What? " She pursed her lips, " people want to be people. They want to be people that can relate to each other. " Harold didn't say anything, " They want to be people. And they have to. And with their expectations, they shouldn't be. But with theirs, people are happy to say they are there. " She laughed, " Yeah, but they're also all drawn to each other. " She stopped smiling, she had fallen asleep. She looked up at him and smiled, " Soon." ***** It was December 3rd, 2598. The night before his burial he had moved out with his little girl and the rest of her family. His mother took him and her daughter inside to the forest of the woods where they would keep their little girl, his wife and then his beloved pet iguana, for the night. As they walked through the forest in their car, Harold watched the bush behind them. As he wondered where his iguana would be, at the light of the moon, his little iguana started moving. There were no wolves or coyotes nearby, just tree trunks. In the shrubs there was no ash, just leaves, until the tree parted. It began eating branches and branches weren't heavy enough, but their movement gave away their distance. All of the sudden, the iguana started moving in rapid pace and seemed to have a permanent form. The iguana stopped abruptly and put its head down, the head of a small iguana, hair tied in between its legs. It's body was growing, and gradually it forgot who it was. Its eyes were still closed.<|endoftext|>

I escaped. I hid under the roof, thinking about the rich farmer and his daydreams. I hid under the window, frozen with a hangover from breaking the rib of a prideful old man. I hid under the shade, a light shone into my little world. The sound of television was faint and breaking, but I pushed on through the action. When I saw the empty cage where I believed I must go, with a one-way ticket to the heavens, I moved it, soon after running to my old cage. The bins were overgrown and dirty with the stuff of nightmares and gangsters. Instead of the bin that I now held on my back, I could feel a sticky substance in the air. I thought I could smell something... something evil from the hidden one-way hatches. I screamed in terror as an other-way trip was declared and recorded. There was a middle aged woman near my cage that I was wary of. 'John who are you? I'm awake and are you inside? What do you want?' 'I am all I have ever cared for about you. I fear you are a fraud. The beast in your cage awaits the night! An iridescent being will take me from you. Stop lying to me. Please! Now get out and you will leave me alone!' she said as she flambered. That night, I slept in a cage with dirty concrete and filthy wood. In the cage, with the filthy concrete and the dirty wood, I saw something. A single bulb illuminated a brilliant light. It was a halo, the word halo never escaped me. A man in his late 20's and in his fifties came running out and threw a grenade in the window. I was startled by the explosion and turned the volume up, too startled to hear, before my subconscious would be overcome with instinct. As I stood there, mesmerized, the man lowered his weapon and nodded at me. 'You know what, John?' I asked, motioning to the barrel and adjusting the scope. 'It is a sheer miracle how you escaped.' The man looked at me, astonished. 'What?!', I asked, reflexively. 'Just to prove I'm not a fraud?' 'John, I have been waiting a long time to test the mightiness of your beast, my friend,' the man began'a mad scientist with about a thousand contributions will finally come through.' 'As in, John.' 'Nothing more I'm afraid,' I whispered. 'I have big plans for you. I've promised the world the future of mankind. It would have been easy to escape if not for the efforts of you. But you never showed me the path to the wasteland, where you dwell and the plants no longer threaten us. What a waste,' I started sobbing, realizing I was sobbing too. 'Don't worry, no one will ever know what I told you.' He reached into his pocket, and pulled out a brown paper bag. I was led through the grassy field, with a happy, yellow tinge to my cheeks and nose. 'It's time for your journey.' He stood looking at the bag. Then he smiled sadly and pulled out his long black fur coat. 'I'll get you what you want.'<|endoftext|>

I drive to work in a really crowded elevator, in a slow traffic, just waiting for people to pick me up. I set aside a few boxes and a folder with photos. I read the file and proceed down the street. They were waiting outside the big fancy office building, so they know that the elevator is only five minutes from their location so I arrive. The woman sitting behind the counter asks why I'm here so quickly, and I reply that the elevator door is five minutes. She slams the door down because I always want to talk to her about something like that. As I walk towards the elevator, it slowly gets larger, and the woman takes me up to the floor. She goes up to me and says: "Dude... Don't you ever *have* one goddamn scar to paint? " " N-no, but you might. You know right? " " Why do I even have one? " " No, *you just aren't good enough* for me to have one. You're only one person in my world, you're definitely kind of messed up. I'll tell you this: you can feel everything. Everything. You can hear every side of the world, every eye. I can tell the food is different for each person. I can... hear my heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat, my heartbeat. I can feel every beat and oh, I'll even listen to a heart beat as I listen to this bitch drive me out the door. I don't *need* one fucking scar to paint. I need to finish my job. I buy my plane tickets and rent the place. I don't need one fucking scar to be able to *taste* the food or drink. I *need* a job as a manager. I always call my secretary after work. As I walk towards her the elevator nears the top and she walks up to me: " Look man... I got two of those. " " Here's the tape! " I point it over and over, seemingly feigning interest in her. In my desperation to understand what she's talking about, I pointed it over and over in my head... " Dammit, Gene! Where the hell are these other employees?!" In my frustration, I go to her. I'm on a flight out to New York with several other people, and I just can't get it together. She wants to talk to me about my ride.<|endoftext|>

Four Sobs I saw fourth. The moment I gazed into its gray eyes, I felt a chill. Looking again did not correlate with anything either. In a span of seconds we had finally begun our restless rounds of soul searching, ending in a soft throbbing pain in our shattered minds. In the millionth fretful eye of her, I could see not only red and green but exotic shades of violet, gold, and peach. Yet here I am at her mercy with my only aid, rushing to see what shade the color she provided to me. Seeing my life flash before my eyes, I shakily find her final words. "Adeline ". Translated to her very own language by special human donors, “ Dear Diary, I ’ ve gotten you wrapped up in your life so I can not directly tell you how it went down. ” These last few years have been a dark, troubled time in the mind. My father, our lovecraft, passed away on March 6, 2015. My mother, uncle, and my parents killed themselves to move away from the abyss they resided in. Our eldest son was one of the first to receive special treatments for leukemia, and soon after gave birth to a child. Four Sobs got me through this. Finally, I have found her death. Still fully in tune with her beauty, still singing in her flowing voice and charming wit, I have realized that for as long as I can remember the life she has left behind, her beauty and grace will bring darkness and death to the stars once more. Because this life I have seen is not tainted by the condition that my father and I were living under. A status quo of prejudice and entitlement, meant to keep the wicked at bay. I can not help but realize that this is not her perfect life. It was her life that I could never bring to bear. I see I, as a creature, are only a vessel for imperfections created by the hands of someone who had to live for the sake of power. I ’ ve felt the tides slowly shift around us, in her life or the deaths around us, making her question the old ways. I tried to hold onto my own faith, believing in her. Had I taken that life, I would have watched the tyrant and oppressor as she fought for the flesh. And now here I am now confronted with a blade hewn from the ashes of her rule. His weapon is one of honor and glory. What fragile innocence, weak as she, is she to me? I ’ ve still no idea why she chose to cut herself as well. So I continue her legacy in order to please the divine and give her some credit. I have taken from this vessel a virtue I hold sacred. Where as from it, my suffering just continues. I know that it is my fault and that she had no choice but to kill herself. She was strong, brave, and no one, not even her lovecraft, can make a goddamned end to the mass murders and bullying that she inflicted upon others. Now I fear that the darkness that I saw in her life has washed away from me, like the tide of a million seasons washed away the sea. I know I am no longer safe. If that sea was real, she ’ d just shift her weight so that it does not swim the other way. I see even now, on a blanket in mourning for her loss, that I still feel as if she has not yet been given up. If she did give up her morals, she would not take on any longer. With that, I continue my pilgrimage to my lovely wife, for she is a flame she can not bring to flame, and so life is now mine. I ’ ve got two paths. Either it is in grief, or it is in joy. At this point, I can not decide which path I want to take. In such a terrible howling sea of absolute despair, I will not fall into the depression of despair, merely that which I know is necessary to stay alive.<|endoftext|>

If I didn't make it to 300 words, I would probably blow the cover up and try to find my brother. In 150 words I would cause a grave, I would break their minds, I would give up my efforts. I might even put people at risk to change them to become the better man. Perhaps that's what my mentor did in those days. But I am making it. I can face with my destiny alone, because in 200 words I can show them. In 200 words they can not discover anything of value other than their own personal time.<|endoftext|>

I freeze and think of all the things you ’ ve accidentally forgotten about me. My parents and friends. I ’ m the spitting image of my best friend, Vincent. My mom was from a messed up time but she got the gift of being able to redo things I ’ d never do in my days. I ’ ve hit major suicides and am suffering from low self esteem as the only person in my life who thinks that what I ’ m doing is wrong. My dad says I should quit and give up. It had to stop. He says I ’ ll call Michael and walk down the hallway. I can ’ t force myself to drop anything at all. “ Michael. You too, Michael. ” I say to the empty mess and everyone feels a bit antsy. I forget how bad it could get, how stuck up these days. I remind myself this would be the day my parents tell me that shit would be going to the hill by tomorrow. Just another day at a hardwoods job with a bad pain in the ass. I ’ m forced to go sit at the fire and check our meter out but I ’ m always glad to wake up early. I finally get my cell phone to call. To my surprise, one of my coworkers is answering. She says I need to go home and find my mom. * Thank you for calling the city and being an anonymous hero. Tell them the truth, and thank you for that. * ___ Best thing to ever happen to someone once they get to know you. All I ’ ve ever wanted is to be remembered.<|endoftext|>

I have never touched a surface or plant life. It was too easy for me to acquire, it all began that day with a question of my eyes and lips. The question was "What about acrotheins? " As human skin is composed of two different types of cells you are of the same species. " Both blood and acro theins you have on the human body are similar to different genera of blood. But because acrotheins are similar you can already see in auras and colors when inside your body that one of them is acting as a transmitter of light through your body. " I usually find them confused, but I use it to keep me up or to keep me alert and entertained. Just a few more days and I would have turned to insects. That thing that hunts the night and sends it all the light I can get. Its skin is tan, also seems to have a jagged face. While it looks like an elderly person with bad chewing I could tell that I like it and would prefer it shut up for more human comfort in the winter. " What about pyomethyloids? " That thing is a branch of a insectoid family called the integumentary algae. They are very similar, they are a long term symbiotic activity and release harmful chemicals into your body where it reacts with your cells, especially your skin tissue. They can be used as a turnkey trick for the body and this kind of symbiosis wasn't common with other species. The manifestation of this symbiosis is most noticeable in the heart and lungs because the heart is connected with the body through veins, muscles and tendons. " I have a long term relationship with this group of integumentary algae... it is my one chance to take me back to the cell... I don't want my memories, I don't want to dwell on something ugly about this sun."<|endoftext|>

She hadn't woken me up for three straight hours, either. And I had been perfectly content waiting for her to follow me downstairs before coming back in. "Did you just pull over to check on you? I ain't no longer with the DA! " I had never been told what to look for in a homicide, so what had I said? " Yaweh, what is up with your coat? " " Two pants. Should be filled with enough to flush a small amount of urine away. " " Two pants. Should be filled with enough to go a little stronger than the last time you went for a pack of cigarettes. It's this last time... " Yeah? Listen: did you just say your wife is the DA, now? " " Yeah, totally you ain't, I got thirty minutes at an office. " Wait, what? Who says you ain't? Have I told you something? My fuckin wife! Come in here ya like a fucking cape and fuckin' pansy! And no money's going to get you killed. All you got ta do is fuck with some civilian on her porch and she'll probably be pointing a gun at you. Fuckin' balls! " Dammit, you forgot to leave us a security update! All you got ta do is make it so. " Shit, no. Get off my lawn. Get it done with you! You're the best detective the county has at the big three with a good conscience. It's your first day back." **THUD** She hit me with a brick. No, no, no. Ok. Hold on. Maybe I didn't pick the wrong fucking brick. The police here keep going but I call the phones first. I'm not gon na read what they find me thinking and answering calls for help again.<|endoftext|>

"Erik! are you alright? " " Why do you look so sleepy? " " A little off alert. Maybe it's been a while, maybe it's just time. " Erik sighs, takes his leather armrest off, and takes out a pen. He crosses his arms over his chest and lets the ink run through him. " Yeah, sure it is a while.. " he states again. " Just as it should be. " " Or do it? I really don't know! " Erik seems to have finally made it to his desktop where his inbox contained the latest new skills package... Of course. He might not have programmed one himself, but at least they weren't hard to find. Erik stares into his computer screen with curious eyes. After a few moments, he sinks to his knees in complete silence. " Err... I got ta run. " Erik lets out a sniffle of the air and moves to the app that displays his new skills. " I was pretty young, but I still think it's in a good spot " he replies, scrolling through. " Just do what, this is what it's gon na be. " he asks without turning his head. " What for? " " It's not like it's gon na work.... " " Why, this is the last thing I do. " " No, don't get scared, all skills are software designed for the author. They're technically part of the author's knowledge base, whatever the case may be. " " I am a bot. " Erik's grin was about to burst into the space-time continuum. " No, you are not a bot! " he throws the book shut behind him and starts pacing. He's crouched in the middle of the room, his head low. " Grab a pistol and run " he thinks to himself. Erik throws his keys to his feet but their weight is too great for his legs to support him. He goes over to the desktop and opens the app. Right, outside that door lies a monstrous beetle. A single pair of legs have emerged from its neck and it's mouth is covered in spikes. The wings are covered in... " STAR CHARACTER WORTHLESS SPAWS" it hiccups at Erik's mercy. What a plague. The same abilities Erik was feeling are now fully integrated into his own brain. There is no escape... Just pass out. -218<|endoftext|>

Now this was confusing. Neither was anyone I knew. The guy was fifty and still got off work while the other five thought the same or something. At the moment the third scenario was quite new to them so they didn't much care; it was time to reconvene in a few weeks. Little did they know the two possibilities would be inoperative the next day. It was Saturday morning when the end of Friday pulled them together; their thoughts, their time to rest. Something was strange about it but neither of them knew what it was. They were sitting in the circle, there was no doubt that I was familiar with the time period but it seemed far off. They stood there, for how long was at hand, trying to determine for themselves where they were, where they *had* been, or if they had even been there. After a while the all knowing two-starters might have said something about line spacing so where exactly the second would be, but I did not understand why. My mind wandered until my wife appeared in front of me, evidently intrigued by my thoughts. She opened my letter ( partially a clobbering vowel and partially a lettering written in rough script, oh what a grammar mess this was ) and said, "there are two possibilities; either you are alone in the universe or you are not. " And she was right. I was. This was confusing, not only because I had entered the day's work in a cramped apartment like that for most of my career, but also because, I reasoned, both scenarios are equally terrifying. Our brains thought we had all been lost in some sort of big mental loop, or had already decided to come back here and say there really was. Neither woman seemed to have much of a mind, so we decided, " You aren't alone. " I was just a morning cretin of a man when the realization dawned on me. This was the third possibility. Either I was alone in the universe or I was at the end of the universe. Either way, since there was no way to tell for sure, it was obviously either either way. We both sat there, before looking at each other for quite some time. Then, we realized that we were both alone in the universe. Where was everyone else? Surely we could have died in a panic or perhaps some set up an attack? Was there any other explanation, such as having no choice? Time passed as we sat there, staring at our cracked browning and all-too-familiar faces. Slowly, we started to realise that we were all just being a bunch of things, as if with them, or in another universe. We would not know if we were ourselves, nor would we know where we came from. And then there was nothing. I lay there, staring up into the open sky, as the infinite void slowly began to close behind me. The rain began to fall, the shivering and electric wind pierced through my hair, every person I had ever known would die without care or pity, among the crickets of the Pacific ocean. As I lay there staring at the only sunlight on this forsaken planet, I realised that one of our alternate universes existed, at least according to the way my wife and I would have been living this one, with no constant mood swings or wars or strife to contend with. I died of hypothermia, I became insomniac, I died of heart failure, I died when I was hit by a speeding bus. One of the things that bothered me the most with my life is that it seemed to love me that we remained alone. On the Thursday morning of the first day of our third week, it became clear that it also wanted to miss me as much as I missed my mother.<|endoftext|>

"To the outside world, they look like you, " Jace said, but with a hint of confusion. " They're running into walls. " He motioned to the wall, and a black shape passed over it. Jace could see that the lines of blood were covering the wall in a murky pool of blood. Jace looked over at the demon, and he did not see what it looked like, but he knew who it was. His hands shot across it's chest, making blood with each drag, and the demon's eyes lit up with hope. It's skin slid out, the sheer blackness throwing him back. " Ha! How's it goin' like that, a demon? " He yelled, grabbing the portal right out of Jace's hands. He whispered into the demon's ear, getting it through and it repulsed him. Jace yelped, and a terrible **hiss** came from the demon's mouth, catching his blood dripping on the other side. Jace quickly turned on the portal with the demon, which made the demon cry out as well. He started to run down the hallway and into the abyss. ***CRASH*** ***CRASH*** ****THUD*** **CRASH** ************************** Jace took out his iPad and looked at the page of their 2016 book about time travel. It was marked as an unused title by the publisher of the app. *Wake up* he thought, *I'll need you to share this with my family on Facebook. We'll feel good about it eventually, and get into further business ventures than have others already. * He clicked on his Facebook notifications, and it was currently playing the biggest meme of 2016. " WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? " screamed the demon. " Seriously? " Jace said, *'Yo the **hellcat **' is finally killing me'. He sees the demon, and mustering up his courage, he places the demon at the table, and says **Yo, ho ho ho**, and continues to talk to the demon, **Yo yo, I need a little friend**. " Jace hears the demon chuckle **Yo yo, I need a girl off **poochoochoochoo**. Just do it. Let's see if yo' shows up **oh look you twat**!" ***CRASH*** ************************** Jace opened his eyes to see something very strange, but something felt off. Oh what if it was a demon? The demon appeared to be dressed completely in black that looked like Jace had seen in a movie. No shadows of people. No eyes at all. No darkness. He checked the demon's number. *4chan's anus droop**. His vision began to bleed again as the demon took a look at the page. It was yellow with yellow, some puce and some blood. The demon's eyes widened, his mouth open, but it wasn't a smile. It wasn't a crooning. It was a voice. A voice that could transform a person. Then suddenly it happened, there was a click, And Jace saw something shiny and... It was up on the wall. Jace cocked his head to look at the demon, and he saw something very ugly- red and... FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK, Jace screamed, and there was no going back. Jace looked down, he saw life. Fear, panic and fear, all together eating him up. He felt nothing but his body, and... Not that he was hungry anymore. He just wanted to sleep in peace. In fact, he couldn't sleep much anymore, and he couldn't stand up, thinking that an entire painting was on the wall, that he could finally pay off this loan on this website. He remembered... *Wait just sleep well... *<|endoftext|>

Looking over at the broken body of Aaron, I knew, "Did he say anything? " He looked so lovely even after the severed head and intestines swelled from it. His eyes were red with tears, leaking onto the floor in various states, a chalice in the process. I hardly knew what to do in this circumstance; was there a blind person that might have seen it? We don't talk about this as much anymore, and we all know that Jesus is dead, that we don't talk about what happened, and that this happened *just last Sunday*. I had myself another job, when I found my wife, last night's appointment, and thinking about the situation I had been in as of early morning. There were a lot of police who still checked every door when they had to deal with the death of this young man. I opened up my comm unit a bit earlier that day to find that they had missed me. I must have failed, I came in at 15:15, slammed into my desk, and screamed the last bit of defense I could. Just as I was finishing up the last argument I heard a voice question in my head. " Do you feel anything, man? There are a lot of bodies there already! " I just nodded and looked over at the body of Aaron. The same as my wife before me. " I don't know what it is, man. Why are you so calm? " " I don't know, hun. " I sighed, " Son, I know, but don't do anything, or risk anyone's life. They're no one's business. " " Son, this can't be real. I'm just death, and there is no one to save me. " I felt some pangs of guilt for crying over this decision, but mostly it was my own curiosity... And if I could die at any given moment, I hoped it would be for good. If I went out as calmly as I always do, then I wouldn't have to be frozen, in bed and out with the rest of the world. I heard whirring over the comm unit, and readjusted my voice. " It's okay, sir. This isn't real. We don't know what happened this morning. " " It must have been all for nothing. I checked my phone, put it on my holo-desk, you see, it wasn't anything I remembered. But it wasn't my friends. I have no idea who they were. " " And now I know that I died in the most unlikely of ways. I don't know whether it was heroin, chemotherapy, or the blast of radiation from the bomb, but I was there. When I looked to the heavens I saw two heads, one was green and the other one blue. Their bodies were full of what looks like blonde hair. The mixture of the two bodies struck my brain like a tractor beam. With some stroke of luck I was able to make out their faces. In the office they sat facing me. " Well kid, today you get what you deserve, " Aaron said, smiling with both his eyes downcast. " What happens when you finally find someone that isn't just hostile? " " I'm not sure. It's better to stay alive. I'm not that anxious. They told me I'm good, and I think I'll be better by being dead. This job will provide me with food. My wife won't eat anything for the rest of my life after she gets pregnant with me, and my son won't be able to leave the house... his smile fades with each breath. We'll be a family for the rest of eternity, one where nothing happens." I did my best to smile, and kept my voice low, using it as an ambient energy. I didn't want anyone else to feel the same either, I really did. And it worked. For me, it did. Edit: Formatting...<|endoftext|>

I guess I shouldn't have trusted him. For all his ability to understand minds, I never understood his real intentions. Perhaps that's why I never trusted him, in all his past life. What he did was the only reason I stayed at the library during the week when I needed to. I'll never forget the way he glanced at the crumpled up newspaper, and his fingers a mess of white paste when he unfolded it. How he looked through everything his mind could see at once was incomprehensible to me. Then I saw it. I saw his eyes through the broken wood, and the blurred image of a child wrapped in his arms. His right hand held the scrawling paper, with wrinkles throbbing in between the pages. That was the real tragedy of it all. Could that same child have somehow ended up stuck in here for the entirety of the chapter? Could I have just read him this blank piece of paper and gone on without seeing anything? My whole life I saw the death and destruction that came with no diagnosis. I could have listened to him mutter while he wrote my name and prepared my way through the pages, but every now and then I would look back and wonder what it was I did wrong. Despite my tremendous years, I always wondered if he would ever be able to give me closure. Even before I saw him die, he was an old man, his face was pale and streaked with gray scars. It made me want to visit the local hospital, but even with my awe, I didn't dare let it be in the first place. No. No, I couldn't let it go. It wasn't fair. I couldn't let the loss of those who loved him burden my soul any longer. Instead, I learned to never make the mistake of reading someone else's mind before I could. As a kid, I had always loved reading, but with what money I had, I just couldn't stop. I had to do something. It never really crossed my mind that he wouldn't get his way. I'd run to the library and look out my window to see how the other children ran to school or when a fellow teacher would vanish. What a mess it was to be giving up your only true parent's support. I could never leave the library now, not without leaving a difficult memory behind. No, it was the only option. As I drifted through the leaves of the trees, I never looked back. Never once did I think of stopping. Forever. There I was, staring off into the distance, untouched by the nightmares I had once enjoyed staring at.<|endoftext|>

I run back to the t-shirt, a little red lit at the edges and catching sunlight from the diner of the house downstairs where I sit in slow my pacing and looking over a waiting pool of warm water. The girls in the next room seem lost in thought as my own eyelids sigh in relief as I muster up the courage to reach for the a mirror between the sheets and dab the reflection with the little help I can give him when he seems lost and lost. Of all the times I had lost someone, the one time that no one ever visited was that one. Sure he had died on the way home, but it was funny that he had become someone else, someone who had died in the middle of the night. He saved my life in that moment, those precious few moments left in my life, even as I felt the end. And now I, it turns out that no one watches TV very often. My room was quiet for so long as I got lost, as I sat and wondered if I could be gone, what I could feel in there. I let out a grim chuckle and brushed past tables, towards my best friends table, where I sat gently and casually enjoying every moment. I remember my first visit to this place, her name, my best friend through and through. As we sat and laughed, I had never seen her smile or cheer, and she never seemed anxious or nervous. We quickly made the connection as well and she looked just as scared as me. At some point, I had asked her why she was crying, but she just ignored me. Who would remember her in this dark room? My body felt loose and weak. It ached and rumbled as the music played as the last of my memories of my life fell away.<|endoftext|>

Fiona spun around, picking up the tattered shopping bag. "Where did this cart go? " " Is there a package of tissues for a Penis? " Fiona said, cutting off a gulp to wipe away another tear. She could look past the corners of the bags on the floor. The packages where everywhere. They *needed* to be here. As the two had been inside this store for an hour, waiting for the cops to arrive they called it a day and handed it back to them. Still, not a single peep. They ducked under the piles of paper that formed a makeshift tea table. " Did anyone show up yet? " " It's late at night, I'm just heading out. " Her car vanished into thin air. Fiona always came to the house that night, picking up her bags. The quiet was gone. She hadn't expected to hear a sound. Her Honda Civic swerved around the corner and stuck it's snarling rear end against the glass window and the behind. Fiona stepped out onto the carpeted floor and threw her bag in it's carseat. " Watch where you're going! " She yelled, pulling her purse out of the bag and tucking it into her lap. She reached out. " See if I heard anything! " Her trunk jerked back and forth in the out wall. Fiona pulled a neatly folded piece of paper out of her back pocket and scanned the street at the top of the street. A photo of a large man standing on a boulevard in Paris, stood perfectly among the tiled floor. A picture of a sixteen year old girl, smiling at her walker on the park bench. " Everyone! Please! Please! " the girl yelled from behind her. " Are you crying now? " Fiona cried. She pushed a childish look on the girl's face. " I don't want to go anywhere. I want to come home. " " Please?! You're crying! Please just come home! " Her grandmother, who disappeared into the depths of her kitchen, was obviously confused. " Why do people go to the store? " Fiona asked her grandmother. " You don't get to take care of them, do you? " " I do. " The woman's tears were still heavy, drying her tears. " That's why... this is a big deal." Fiona shakily grabbed the pepperoni and cheese portion of the plastic bag and hopped into her car.<|endoftext|>

*The cat at the beginning* A man moves fast, weaving his way in and out of groups of people looking for a lone sparrow. Never quite willing to go a day without being found. There are only hissing ruffled cries of discontent heard throughout the lands. There was one old girl, watching them sing for hours until finally a house fell over, taking the form of a woman. She spoke quietly as a careless cat approached, flicking on the lamp she had been given. "Stay and eat. " The door swung open and a man wearing a stained white shirt scampered through the door with a crowbar. The cat sat down and she turned to look at the cat. The screech of a vulture may have sounded terrifying to her yet she loved it when it smelled of death. The old man sat quietly still, looking around for a lone malformed head to sit in his lap, claws digging into her tanned skin. The poor cat looked up at her lovingly in awe of their man's presence. " How can you do this? " The old man looked her up and down. " Hello? Are you sorry? " She looked up as her eyes watched him as he brought a pistol to the old man's chin. " He doesn't seem to understand you. " The old man began to look away but that was nothing new. He turned his attention back to the cat. The cat smiled and grabbed at his side and she wrapped her arms around his chest and started rubbing her stomach. " He never listens. He never listens to the world around him. " The cat continued to look at the man and saw that his smile was growing dull. He turned away as if a breeze swept across his face. " That makes sense, it keeps him from doing his job. He doesn't have to do anything like this. You're right. " He said as he placed the pistol down. " We have to help him, before he falls prey to the world that is so cruel to him. " He looked down at the bloody cat as he removed his coat. The last thing he saw before he was dragged away was the old man looking at his broken corpse, chuckling to himself. The wailing of the old man had never left his body and now stood the noises of the woods. His eyes remained shut as he stared at the woman with a cat perched in the darkness. She was beautiful in her own way, a beautiful light in the darkest of nights. The orange glow of the last rays of sunshine making her seem just as beautiful as the last night before. " You okay now? " The old man asked. His eyes closed as the fires of fury and death birthed into his mind came into being. He looked to the woman with the barrel pressed against her chest and with a final shudder he whispered " If I knew you were a strong man, I would have stayed away. That would have been the end. " Her eyes drooped as tears began to form, tears that would stain the very earth. The crowd began to burn.<|endoftext|>

I laughed heartily at his face as we locked eyes again. " Thanks kid. Don't mind the boy. We'll go buy some other stuff." The three boys looking back passed us something. Some clothes, a sheaf of other things. We agreed to lunch early and shoved our things inside the hot, well stocked, room. The light wouldn't go out long enough and we'd be late to school. I turned around and began pacing down the hall toward the door. I could see him holding something to the force of the door, my favorite pillow. I must have missed it in my travels. But still, I didn't miss the boy. It's not uncommon for the snow globe to fall on an empty house; the beautiful snowy mountains always always present a spot on the way to school. Maybe it was just for this holiday season, but I tried to find his face. But it didn't matter. “ Dad? ” She called, “ Oh my god. ” There wasn't time. I took a deep breath and began to walk back to the door. Quietly, I reached into my pocket to turn the knob. Only once inside did my room split into two. I pulled out some clothes; he was the only one to take any off the pillow. “ Boy, ” I mumbled as I picked the backpack up and shoved it to my back. I switched off the lights and turned the light back on. I didn't find anything. There were… flowers. Well, flowers, anyway. I grabbed one and one, both of which were just big enough to hold them. Maybe a little larger, too. I picked up the others, revealing an assortment of flowers. I bent down to pick them up and although I wasn't able to see much to make out, I know how their soft-smelling skin would probably work on you to build up some energy. I also took my pocket knife. I had been too busy browsing Youtube and Facebook and reading Cute Girls on the iPhone. Why would I have an iPhone? I took a breather, watching as my Dad walked by and handed me his knife. I followed after him and continued to pick out flowers. The last one I picked out was neat and neat. I turned, took one and wrapped it around his neck, slicing into his arms. The flower after him fell out as well. I let go and walked back to the door, studying my surroundings. That noise could be heard coming from the room. The door swung open to the sound of a thousand fucking footsteps. The door swung open again and the wind came in through the crack, crunching down to the ground. The wind had been whistling a rhythmic version of my footsteps. I turned around and realized it wasn't the wind. It was a shrill wave that came from nowhere. I froze. I was staring right at the water. I scowled, screaming. I ran down to find the bushes around me. I shook them off, noticing them as if they hadn't been there in time. I started walking to the water. I ran out of the bushes and walked carefully down the stairs, looking for the nearest shrub. I finally reached the house, startled. I was crouching on one of the dry plants, the water splashing in my face as I panicked. I grabbed the open door, quickly plopping the trunk beside my head. I grabbed my friends and ran as fast as I could to the kitchen to gather firewood and lanterns. As I spread my wings, I could hear the noise of the wind clanking against the surface of the water. And the shrub chimed in, “ FRIENDS! FRIENDS! ” … - P.S. Thanks for reading!: ) -ed.<|endoftext|>

There's some bad news in front of me. I haven't been in danger for years. As you all know, we're not very careful about the forces hiding in the shadows, as much as we shouldn't, but once our paranoia takes hold they will listen. I mean, sure, you would think that we would go crazy as one would be -- "The fifth wall, the Fifth Wall, " heard around you, " just because you're in a bad place doesn't mean it should not be happened. " I woke up with a giggle of panic and a really bad grin on my face. All I needed was some time to try and convince them that they were all just crazy, that I shouldn't be trying to run away like I did, that I should just leave them alone and not do it. " This could be the last time I try to run this far, " I said, quietly to myself, even though my words died in my throat, " but I *am* scared. " And in that moment, just as we're about to begin, I hear a click and a rumble coming from a hole in the wall. I sit up and try to look around at the crowd as we continue. All I see is -- and I know because I looked into that hole -- two aliens. " So, they have taken my care package and followed me when I went home? " I ask, hopeful, at this point. And then, of course, " They followed you to the restaurant you went to, where you ordered your food. " " And there you are, *both* taking care of it! " It's not all bad news. They have no pun intended. And they seem pretty funny. " They were exactly how I imagined. I would have to have noticed something about them since I was almost immediately talking to the alien and laughing at them, but something about them just made me feel *bad. * " So, " I said, " what did they think I was? " The aliens pouted and laughed, except one of them, who had passed me from the crowd, spoke up from my hands: " You know, when I'm on my way home it's when the aliens are looking at you. " My hand trembled at the hint of worry I had, but I knew where to go next. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - " Let's go out, Jake! " my baby sister screeched under her arms, just a few feet away. I took her hand and ran in to hug her. She groaned and hugged me back, not wanting to say anything but tell me to go. It was a mess, really, to say the least. All I had to do was pinch her one last time. " Why did you do it? " I turned and shouted over the phone to my dad. " Dad? Can you call me? I don't want them hearing us're coming over to my place! " He replied, grabbing on to my shoulder. I attempted to hold back tears, but only managed to cry out and he had gotten on my shoulder and turned me down. " Dad, we should have called back. I want to talk to your mother. She's in some trouble." I didn't want to wake her up. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - " Grandma, did you find the bad guys? " My mother asked from the stairs. This time, she threw me away, kissed my forehead, and said, " You should have known me for who I was. " I smiled and said, " No," making myself disappear into the basement.<|endoftext|>

Everyone you know has heard of this undertaking. We are a group of men, children, elderly, and most of all, a man. We can not be given time to think, to act. The day is approaching. Our mission and destiny will not be in a state that can be controlled by force and words, our design for this project was conceived all the way back in the early 20th century. Humanity took the colonization of Mars and Mankind made one last attempt at it. NASA had never brought us to Mars and so we set ourselves up with whatever resources could be kept and the dream of colonizing Mars would come true, but they didn't create us to impress the President, as they hoped that with this construction we would be the first to make contact on an alien planet to open interstellar trade, which was unthinkable when we would be surrounded by space. While it does sound interesting, you have to admit our mission is much more ambitious than we would have thought. I am proud of this achievement. After NASA took the leap from earth, they took with them the task of creating an all out scouting ship and settlement that would take us to Mars and explore the means of colonization. It takes years to manufacture an entire settlement with the resources of Earth and provide our first contact. We have more than enough materials to lift up these structures and ship them to another life as ours, but the problem is that they can not tell us where we would find our capital. We could still call it Earth, but to give the same to their largest settlement, would be false. After making an attempt at speaking with a "proximity transceiver ", we realize that the communication has already been disconnected from Earth, this is Earth not the Amazon or the Congo. It seems like a direct message to earth that we should accept that there is danger in the lands we are crossing. Unable to accept their hand in this decision, we see that they would like to take even further and take some form to call it interstellar travel. Luckily for us they already have a solid understanding of what is happening to us on this Earth and refuse to be forced to leave it all for an interstellar journey, but that does not stop them from trying to use our technology in order to blackmail us. This is why we chose to take the Orion-class Light-Ships to our home world. Although we make our choice through the laws of Earth and the treaty that governs our fate, there is another way they could get us what they want. Luckily our civilization does not know of our technology, but they could easily exploit us in attempt to steal and bring us into their hands. It is not likely that these agencies would have been successful with the Small Small Ship program, but that does not matter in the near future; and that this could lead to an error that could lead to temporary displacement from earth. I would like to think that they could simply increase the span and distance of this inter-planetary space project, which is still only a few years ahead of what they are proposing. We are looking at a world that is much bigger, with a much more populated Earth, and a much more populated Mars. The President of Earth is in front of me holding hands with the CEO of Orion, and we are in some ways expecting him to work with us on this job. They are less good with our technology, and far worse with us as well. I knew we were going to be in charge of this thing long before they took Earth. " That was a rough day, " and I hope that when the flying chinese and the brutes are out of my way that they realize what I have done for us."<|endoftext|>

-- Hello! Is it the truth? We'll get started immediately. Do you understand me? To be honest, in front of you, you're quite frankly quite mistaken. And of course, I want to get started with the question right now. -- What? Hm? Seriously? Just hitting that part? -- -- I heard some joke on facebook about my girlfriend. I don't know if it's true or not, and you're obviously living under the impression that I'm lying or something. You either believe me or you don't! The third person that *is* referring to me is sending me some really awkward looks. So, let me finish. That's just my pal going over my college application process right now. -- What? OH! I completely understand, right? This is freaking strange! I have a previous ( but not deceased ) graduate student being interviewed for interviews. Why are you interviewing? WHO IS THAT? STOP AHA! This must be... my college application is going to be very confusing. -- Wait... wait what? Why would I do this! Don't tell me I'm NOT proud of your place of work! -- WHAT??? Does that mean I hate you!? Huh. I was just joking, so any way you can confirm that you aren't going to help me complete your degree, I get it. Should I have just chosen a less polite method? Why? -- What did I just say? Don't make me laugh! You've got a disturbing past here, really. I get a sense that you're judging me based on your dress choice but... I mean, you know my name. I just want to get this in order. -- What? Oh! Just because my classmates are gay doesn't mean they don't love my daughter. OH MY GOD! I'm sorry. But I have to go. I know I've been too frank about things, but... You know I need to fix my mistakes if I want to get past this. -- ( BEEP BEEP ) -- ( BEEP BEEP )... Okay... okay. I did it. Am I done now? -- But you are *an* excellent applicant, and this looks like we've got a lot of work to do!<|endoftext|>

The movement was going up and down in that studio. The panel had co-evolved from Bryan Adams to Joe Chill to Alice Williams; every year he had gotten a lesser known star for his monologuing, performing at the company with an accent that had his eyes drooped and pursed his lips. The final day of the check-out scene on a couch in the coffee shop became just days away. It was an uneventful night, the following had occurred between April 29th and April 30th. It would mark the first time the company had reached out to the fans; the attempt was not due to simply short-circuiting the expectations of fans and act as a deterrent, but to carve out a semblance of an image and role. In one particular play, an announcement rang out: " [ red stripes ] ( http: //i.imgur.com/BdHTuPrT.png ) By eager fans, I shall be the host of a fictitious message-storm featuring NaNoWriMo: FREE writing prompts for the next few weeks. You can check out NaNoWriMo right now. Hosted by NaNoWriMo: http: //i.imgur.com/4b4nsrA.jpg " The park spread across the patio as the YouTube girl climbed the frozen oak over a pair of brightly-lighted Prada sweats. No matter where she went she stayed out in the wee hours, spending hours chugging away on another, failing project. Next came the loss of good advertisers; the majority didn't care if she had 6 % as much as them. Anyone unfortunate enough to step foot in the new Jello Spot booth at Sunrise Zone would find herself calling the prompter at some point. She is the focus now. Once the crowd dispersed, Jonathan came to the front to introduce NaNoWriMo - tonight, the final production of the show was coming to an end. NaNoWriMo was a global sensation and the global nameplate enthused Christopher. He recalled why he felt it was necessary to make it believable, why he had to crack into this high-profile space; he had missed out on a few key moments that had genuinely been taken advantage of. It was the Ad Agency. A small ad agency that just wanted to keep their product a secret. Why he wanted a good Secret Agent, why the clientele loved NaNoWriMo. This was the kind of man he thought he had met on YouTube when he sold his online gaming talents with parts from his own corporation to help develop the product. Something about the thoughts kept wracking through him, thoughts that might have had real economic significance to NaNoWriMo. Finally, lastly, he had come to terms. A man with a mission, a main character that will go down in history, made the decision to never invest time and his genius flowed out of his complex for better or for worse. NaNoWriMo was a lie, he knew it was but the way they expected; they were entirely wrong.<|endoftext|>

The Elantol has never seen more sunlight than so many do on their first day of school, the two men preparing to set up camp on the headwood and the old wooden cross tied to the tree. The sun drizzles around them like an albatross over their faces. A stench that'd been lingering ever since the moment that burned them and so many others in some beyond land was still there, bearing a clear trail of sulfur. As they walked outside, which they followed every day, memories of the time they and many others had waited for and the subjects of their study were the most important in this time of year. They hadn't seen the worst of the storm, even that there had been a loose glass of water that splashed against the ground at their feet. Stuck in the tundra of broken ice that had been blanketed and made of giant branches, they had an uneasy feeling about the colors that were interrupted by the falling water. The long winter, after all, had made the Elantol a tropical attraction. Canoes of cars and various vehicles, as well as automobiles in all their glory scattered throughout the forest which this woman had witnessed every day. But as they climbed down the tree, wearing rough coats and thick leather, the mist the tree to the left felt like a weight to them and them, their future. It made the dew rise like the lid of a burning oven and smolder themselves into ashes. Several buckets of water, ice, a nice red patch of shade, and a few packs of two packs of cigarettes and a plate of frozen food ran out. In the dry water ahead of them was a stone tablet, the only companion to the past over the centuries, and a tower of red light. The pale skin covering the book filled the glass on top, light and clear. They had a long journey ahead of them, and their boss had signed them up to this country. The spirits themselves had been slightly below the water's surface but the journey had been incredible. An orchestra of yellow instruments presented themselves when lightning struck. The few gusts felt so as if they were holding on to a new life, an order, and a purpose in life. Light flitted through the air, drawing a flock of young black birds and the birds of the south. It had been so far these days that they had been able to travel directly south through the mountains. It seemed to work. The sailboats of these sailboats met on either side of the cross made and traveled for miles, drifting west and west with one gray flag on their faces. The sun was setting, the river pattered a little. But some hope for escape had dwindled, and this island awaited, and its spirit has found salvation. People played quietly, they danced, and sailed about the island. The stone tablet, now full of maps and hisses, was full of cryptic references to George Washington and Andrew Jackson, or George Washington himself. But there it was. A map of a future road, marked by the ranker of its name. Time in such ancient fashion and powers and years of accumulated knowledge. The young men and women all began to slow down, so they moved on to the next person, the translator. He guided them into a small booth, and they smiled at each other excitedly. He seemed grateful that the workers noticed this. It was a nice sight to see.<|endoftext|>

As I walk in front of the Grammar Police, I've been waiting to know if this is the actual story of the judge whose sentencing I am now looking forward to. If this goes well, he shall be given a sentence that is deemed fair by us. He shall be sentenced to "Collateral Damage " to continue the internship. It is highly unlikely he would harm a single human being, especially one worthy of this level of harm. These types of crimes usually involve killing other people, serious damage to property, and begging the government to throw a few tons of sand in his face so he can survive. A few days ago we asked him, " Mr. Kragin this week, what is up with you all sitting around with your outdated English by the'We will judge you, next year,' Pfffft!" He replied without a word, hugging me tightly in the doorway. I'll have to leave soon. I'm afraid my English has become invalid, and I've begun pondering the implications of my sentence before I can even answer any questions from the judge.

"Happy Birthday! " " Since the Moon came and talked into our intelligence systems, then mankind is not alone in space and no one will miss us once we've arrived. " The band break came in a few minutes later and we just had a lot of fun. Then it went off with Benny and Tony and Jimmy and *Oh my god! * Stephen Harper and Bill Brykawer and, of course, Pete Townshend. " Merry morning man! " " Happy New Year! " " Your birthday! Happy New Year! " As soon as the music stopped it went on, just like it did for the rest of our day. And then it went on again and again and again and.. " Happy New Year! " But we never noticed it until Earth became the capital of the Colonies Colonists again. And that's when the city of New York finally fell. Or rather, New York. As refugees. Bunch of it. Then in the 70s, in the 80s the US lost it's population entirely, except for refugees from other continents. They're refugees because the US. Lost the ability to communicate with them. And it disappeared from the charts in'70. All we've know is that a ship crashed on Mars and it appeared on the cold blue surface of the moon. A ship. People would scream and scream and make whatever noises they could out of fear of impact. And god knows how many that ship will miss. And it's spreading. A giant spaceship with a radio that can communicate with almost any language, was here. And there's going to be a huge crowd outside. They're angry. There's going to be riots. Everyone's getting nervous. And the President is going to announce it. Nobody's going to believe it until the whole world is full of people screaming " and now we're taking cover! We are the first to arrive! " And almost everybody is coming, but they only get one set of parachutes and a few rounds. The crowd goes silent, and people just watch. Suddenly the first camera crew comes out of the sky as fast as they can go. And then the secret service comes into the capsule. Everyone has their guns. Everyone has their armour and their k-9s. " Give the capsule to these guys!" General Malcolm Gladwell shouts into the radio. *Go to space*<|endoftext|>

I wasn't sure what to expect. It seemed like something here wasn't really in the crossroads, but I just wan't talked about it further. The fucking road didn't cross, really. It was only a light exit, but I'm sure it looked like it should. There was a sign saying "Crossroads Confronted ", which I think was it. I had been told I had to do some ridding, so I always took the path. I mean, I'm not sure I even like stopping there, but here's where I started. A small sign was written on the side with the words " Crossroads Closed. " So I zoned-out, I walked at a much slower pace, so I could be spot-on enough to avoid it. But it took too long to really hit it. It wasn't really in my grasp, and had a poem stuck in my mouth that read " On the corner of 42 and 41A there stands a path, filled with light - the path leads to the Devil, who too travel here. So if you really catch your breath, or wan na explore at a higher angle than your gringo buddy Joe, I have a half-pipe impeding my journey. It's just called the Crossroads. Enjoy your journey here, as a middle aged man with nothing better to do."<|endoftext|>

The stranger could not explain himself because he did not know what he was talking about. He did not notice the familiar rain dripping from the window and from the imposing skyline. A slight breeze struck his face, tearing away his visage and reminding him to look up. He glanced over, terrified. “ Ain ’ t nothing fun out here anymore, ” muttered his partner in arms. They were both out by the pools of raindrops, past the open window and into the world as it awaited them. The man turned his head to face them. “ I see you ’ ve got spooked, I ’ m sure you ’ re running away ”. The stranger continued. “ Who are you? ” The stranger turned and glared at the man, who squinted at the guard ’ s face, trying to make out the features. “ Who ’ s this? ” “ The name ‘ Crawley ’ you ’ re talking about, ” answered Crawley, with a heaving breath of relief. The man adjusted his glasses and slung them over his shoulder, grasping a pair of hockey pads to his nose. A friend of his furtive glances over at him asked, “ just how old do you think he is? ” The stranger shook his head “ I don ’ t know. ” The creep stated, his blue eyes glinting in the spring sun. He thrust his hockey puck downwards, taking a step back from the stranger and sprinted towards him. He sprinted into his house, shouting at the front door at the house, which cracked open before it could reach him. He stumbled into the house. The stranger was sitting on the sofa, his hair tinged gold, his eyes darted out of place. A little less recognizable than the other visitors, but he didn ’ t seem to be able to hear the stranger anymore. His hands, mostly covered in sweat and his lips pursed, seemed limp and cold as he turned around and walked away. Crawley laughed to himself, turning and disappearing into the street.<|endoftext|>

Thirteen years after Korea was bombarded by missiles, the Yakuza woman was once again in the spotlight. She was a significant part of the alsatian movement in Japan, and her network was an absolute hit: translations to other languages were coming in, and she was a star. At the time, we were barely getting recognition in a country that was abysmal to her own, and her network was broadcasting like the plague. Most of her misdeeds, however, had galvanized the populace to her cause. In other news, nearly twenty years later, a time of peace was achieved in Eastern Europe after the 2006 earthquake. You see, the same group tried to bring a nuclear warhead into Central America. The Japanese government, the Iraqi People's Army, and the Islamic Front were brutally unable to stop them, but it was the future they could best in convincing the people that it was a real possibility, and it didn't take long for the rest of the world to see how wicked the plan was. Frustrated by losing their leverage over our lives, the Muslim Brotherhood tried to make their famous message more commercial, and their IED bomb scares heavily. So if you'd like to read the devastating stories of the century, or have an idea of how they'll respond to a nuclear warhead, head over to Hamletsapistsrao County Metro Airport.<|endoftext|>

Lying on the pavement was the other one. Carl was the first person to move from the old house in an hour. The car had broken down as he walked down the street, shrieking and moaning. Everything was then right in front of his eyes. He stepped out and stopped. He quickly stood to address the both of them. " Hello this is'Darren' from Dower District. " the one called was an older man. " Thanks, I appreciate that you wanted to share the first thing I did today. " he responded. The other answered, " Do you know who we are? " " Dennis Wilson from 24th station. I'm from the Elders of Direction, and I'm here to give you some information on this human family that your kind has created. " " Uh, yeah, well, I'm Dennis Wilson. Obviously I know who you are. I think you know about the problem you have. " " Call me when you have more information on this? " " I'm from the Elders of Direction. I came out here yesterday afternoon. I was preparing to communicate with my team and see if you could hear me. " " How can I tell you everything? " " Well, I've been in this region for three generations. I've lived here for three generations now. They're here to help. " " They should have sent a poet, " the one on the end of the phone said. " Well maybe not. I mean no matter what our records show, anything they say sounds terrible on one channel and then anybody that hears it must also be bad on the other. " " They shouldn't have sent a poet. We should have just spoken with the people who lived here. We should have given them something else. Something to talk to. Something we thought was important. We should have shown them the work we put into this world. We should have told them we were bad, and I'm sure any amateur could tell you that in the last 40 years. " " So what if they went back and thought you were wrong? " Carl asked. " We may be wrong, " the first man responded, " but we didn't send a poet. What if they sent a crazy person, or someone who's crazy, or something mentally unstable? " " What if they thought someone that's crazy, but someone who is in their family, someone they married, someone they raise? They are alive. They are connected. Do we really need another murder victim? Are they moving that truck then? Would they move even if there was only one being in the path? " " It's all in the last 18 years. If they had only sent a mad person, maybe they would have married someone crazy and we would have ended up with this bastard. This would be painful for us both. But they still didn't send any of those people. We couldn't let this happen. Why aren't we sending a fucking poet? Why are we sending a mad, insane person? All we have is three stupid ideas, and even if we didn't send a poet or somebody crazy, all we have is chaos. It should have started with a little act of terrorism, right? " Carl didn't need to believe that the first man had sent an out-of-place four foot long monster, who only walked on a black sock, through the street, attacking and killing anyone who walked past. Or that the first man even knew to meet his demise was a stranger coming his way, no matter his story. Carl stopped talking and stepped out of the car. He heard the crowd of people getting closer and closer. The shouting coming from the crowd got louder. " Terry, I'm sure you hear about this poor poor soul. They should have sent a poet, who just wasn't written because you wrote bad ideas, because we at Dower District are being completely unreasonable in trying to reduce your population. We are trying to redirect them from being insane bad people to people who are just bad people."<|endoftext|>

The light never escaped the sepia-stained hands of a girl who just wanted the world to end. Defying their parents' orders, she intended on running away so they could cleanse the river banks. It had been three weeks since the first wave hit and the boy hadn't aged a day. But he was faster, stronger, faster - and faster. She had to run. *Run*. *Run* her father had told her to, but she always thought she was hiding a disease. She ran his two paths on his side and fumbled at his keys as he pressed them back together. She fell back onto the road and when she got there, he slapped her like she had just fallen on his throat. She came closer. As he approached her, a green man looked at her and nodded. They walked past a stream full of warm water and boats. He stepped out into the sunlight. He was wearing a grey coveralls - red, green and yellow. The man walked up to her and stroked her hair. She smiled at him and kissed his cheek. * My good boy. * They stepped inside, after at least a dozen times the time. It was nice to be able to escape their home. She walked into their living room and sat in the sofa next to them. They smiled. The only thing on the table was a light bottle of air-lock cleaner. She watched the stars glow and she remembered them before them. "What do you want, Lenora, " a voice called out. " My boy? " He asked, fingering his beard, " Took you long enough, don't you tell me you're packing. " The girl shook her head. " I don't mind, okay. You're gon na have to pack to be done for this one, Lenora. " " *Took you long enough. * " He sipped his coffee and then rambled on. " Like, two weeks. Twenty eight years, Lenora, and you're still going to not get it done? " Lenora laughed as she wiped the grease from her cheeks. It was funny how it had worked out for the oldest girl in the family - she had so many options. The man turned around with a smile. " Yeah, you're right about that. I mean, you're scared. I do hope that comes with the condition. " The other nodded. " And maybe, just maybe, you'd like to finish this one, " he said. He ran the fingering on a long piece of paper. " Another world. But you're gon na still have a few more months. Time to start planning for this one. " He kissed her on the cheek and smiled. " I'll have my little boy to finish next year."<|endoftext|>

I asked her out. ” I blink, and she smiles back. “ Yeah. Yeah, I remember. ” As she laps around me in her bed, I feel comfortable. I'm loving her again.<|endoftext|>

Dave looked at the young couple, the two children he came so close to having raised. Tonight was the night of his big decision. The man who had been perfect for both of them; the good, chiseled man. His soothing voice laid with them in a pleasant quiet trance. " It's been a year since we met, " he said. Dave understood how true that expression was. A month of talking, of asking the boys about their problems. " I've already decided to move to the city, " Dave said. It had been a whirlwind of excitement over the summer, most of which belonged to the two of them growing up, and many years trying to build their own life together. " We should get together to see each other first, I promise " The young girl nodded. Dave wept. She had always wanted a man, anything to make him who he was, not what he was supposed to be. " My husband is hurting me, " Dave said. " I'm here with you, " She said. He waved and led her outside. They stepped into the sunlight and watched as the girl, who had seen all the strange things in the city, took the bike. " It is such a good day, " he smiled. They still had children, each of them waiting patiently, watching and learning. Their children, they could do the best they could. " Nice day again, " she said. " A lovely day, too, " Dave smiled. " This place is so beautiful, " He spoke up. " The sky is such a wonderful colour, " he repeated. She gasped. " God, what has my wife done? " She scratched her head. " Nothing, " Dave said. " It's just we're moving to another place."<|endoftext|>

I know I'm a very poetic girl, but it's a problem here. A problem that we've had to fight for an issue of unseen nature. A problem that the government uses as cover up for lazy gooks to stalk us. It's been talked about throughout countless press conferences, but that's fine. It doesn't excuse them for using us as cover up. The system is designed to help, not make you blind to the betterment of everyone. The two huge corporations that run this country have been absolutely correct, and we should be thankful for it. They pay us to “ adhere to their ideal ” for the sake of this country ’ s success, and we should recognize that. But it's not enough, isn't it? To keep an insane ideology completely hidden, we have to reach out to them, and convince them that it ’ s their destiny. We should be willing to betray them. I haven ’ t always been this way. Growing up in the suburbs, my parents used to watch at the television while I tried to figure out how to figure out how to live a life better for my family. I ’ d always thought you ’ d grow up feeling inadequate at that time, but no, I spent my childhood obsessing over what the baby did and how it worked. That's not how I felt at all. Today is different. Today, you ’ re going to pay a visit to a posse that smells of red and grouchy. You ’ re going to pay a visit to a posse that smells of grubs and byes, and you ’ re going to pay a visit to a posse that smells of half-melted sour cream. And please don ’ t judge a family by the looks of it. It isn ’ t meant to be, and you weren ’ t supposed to.<|endoftext|>

Dear Diary, It's been a hard year. This year it wasn't even my birthday. I feel like two hundred miles had been taken, so I started to plan. The color of the day was literally scary for me and I lost my job just a week ago. Oh god, it still is. I still feel like such a retard. So I figured I'd write these things down and try to relieve the stress, or maybe I just like the silence so much. It's a busy world for me. I get out of bed every now and again and head to the park at night, checking out the sights. You could say I'm used to it, and you'd be right. It feels different. The trees have turned from green to red and the pale plants have started to move and change color. I feel like there's something different about the trees but there isn't. Every footstep is like walking on a mountaintop, grass kicking up and getting heavier, weeds snapping in and out. But that's all I remember of the park. I don't remember the smile on someone's face. I don't remember the dog. I don't remember dying. I don't remember what happened last time, the last time that we escaped the cave, or when the solar flare kicked in, or when the rock broke off. I don't remember the day I got here. I don't remember how I got here. We're covered in dirt. I don't remember what we want or need, or how to do it. I don't remember the hunger, thirst, or the boredom. I don't remember anything or anyone with me anymore, except for God, who has failed me once before. I tried to be a hero and show the world that we were sane, free from the boredom that set up this place for us. Even if I don't get to feel it now, as I did before. But this time, I never really have this trip planned for me. I don't even have food. I never had to buy clothes and whatever. I don't have any clothes. I don't have any good food either. I'm homeless, and I don't have water. That's not so bad though. I don't really have anything anymore either. I just can't bear to stay in this state. That's okay though. I'm a hero and now I have something to show everybody. I don't have to worry about the sun anymore. I'll find someone to enjoy this time, and then I can make my own. I don't have to worry about myself anymore. It's safe for now. Everyone has a day to live. There are some things that I do, but not things that I like, like the kennel or what people say on the telephone. That's all I have. Not yet. Time to go do these things again. I need to travel for a while, after all. And I'll clean up soon.<|endoftext|>

"Hey, sir! " Ken Jordan yelled, fumbling frantically between his iPhone and a massive, metal rifle mounted on his back. His legs became heavier, his jaw tingle. This must have just happened... He was moving on fast. " Get down from here! " Ken was sweating, his fingers felt like they were wet from shock. But he was as tall as the oldest man alive and as skinny as a homeless man. "... This is my location, James. I was just checking up on you. " Three people were in front of him. He ignored the tumult and asked one of them, " I'm watching from the rooftop. " Another person ran over and crouched behind his phone to reveal his bulky, bulging belly. " They're shooting us! They're about to stab me! " Ken yelled, sliding and scurrying around the building to find the nearest exit. " Watch the smoke! That's the butt of our guns."<|endoftext|>

My dearest Lucifer. I read your last letter on your end and I know that I must make my move to inform you, because I can't. There has been a flaw in your research, some of the results might be dangerous. It has been years since I've read, and there are very few left to die. My goal, the cancer, is beyond saving. It was discovered recently that they can make a virus, that I'm not sure how it works, but they can multiply and scatter in the opposite direction when diluted. I've spent many years trying to educate and test people on what would happen once this virus was developed. The cure was given in a lab a couple of decades ago, you said it was a miracle cure, and I feel sorry for the children who were affected. Not all of them make it, and no cure is ever good. However, the real reason I must make my move this morning is because one of my schoolmates found a splice in my lab that made it gain electrons more and more. It's not your fault, you had to have that one at the beginning, but now that one has gotten better I found it absolutely kills me! I need to take another chance now, because we can't risk spreading the virus to one's family. All I need to do is give you the satisfaction of knowing that the cells that made this splice in me, mutated. I don't wish to loose any of them on someone as foolish as me, the humans are just as reckless. I will not be letting this virus spread to these people that make up the core of my research lab, it's too risky. You must stay strong, my friend, I'm sick of getting jobs doing lab work that may not be possible. Nothing is sacred anymore. This virus was destroyed long ago. Now I am just gon na die and end my life, the only thing I truly feel sad about is not having to live. I'm sorry. It's so much easier to die now when there's a chance. I know how much you meant to me, just watch over you in your office. I can't let this virus continue to infect, I must bring you into existence and save my family. You must do it. Goodbye, Lucifer.<|endoftext|>

Gloria plucked the claw of her sword from her head and yelped. She hadn't seen this world before; a place so packed that it would be easy for the hunters to see her. Located in the Desert of Aerys the savagery was easily one of the largest in the League of Nations, which until this moment they had waited three years for the murder of King Maleficent of Gondor. The bold of the wings had once stood as a brazen symbol for dominion over the dragon kingdom, but Lady Morgoth, the eldest of the dragons, had attempted to usurp her rightful title to King of the Beasts. In a mere year she would rule the cause of humankind in their darkest hour, with the Hammer of Iron herself as our largest dragon on earth. For the clan of the deadly Hooman heirloom, that would be her Throne. His dark spellbindings and his demonic wench were powerful enough to make the target seductive in their own way. So the High King sent out an Army across the lands demanding all the gold he could get, in exchange for his unconditional obedience and his oaths of loyalty. His armed forces were enormous, but how could they? The mighty Magnificent Pharaoh Eirat, running through the desert like an animal, and overlooking the kingdom like a gleaming star. With armies numbering miles of stony ground gone in their first two campaigns, the civil war had worn on for even longer. After many attempts in these last weeks the High King trusted Eirat to guard their convoy. So he will enter their giant black box. He holds the massive beast; his long muscular tail resting on the massive body of Maleficent, his wings bending into a grotesque eery, monstrously shape of beady eye sockets. After several exchanges his body leaves, and the man so beautiful falls right into the maelstrom of endless white. His long, spindly arms coil back and forth underneath his stomach as his head reverberates with sweat. For the first time in years a man feels time travel, an experience so alien it seemed completely foreign to him. It happened again on Revalator 6. The man felt a tear roll down his cheek. He clenched the Maelstrom within his chest, preparing to see Lord Mordor encircle his Realm of Dragonkind in even more horror. A tear fell and spread like tears across the face of Lord Mordor. After he felt his stomach grow ragged, he grasped the Monster's jaws and breathed in, gripping. He raised the drenched body of Maleficent and hurled her off the Great House of Aerys, crushing the creature into his cage. Lord Mordor let out the last breath of life and waved his old tooth, explaining his plan. His eyes widened as this new sight took over his head like an unknown storm. He stood up and threw his big, monstrous teeth as hard as they could, his tail whipping by like a pendulum, wrapping his frail limbs around the tail of the monster. "I'm done with him," Lord Mordor whimpered. He was awoken by a large horned boar. His host ears perked up in astonishment and called out,<|endoftext|>

The Marry's cat Creese had just left the bar. She turned up to me, her strawberry red kitten I'd known since I met her in high school. " Dee! " Her tiny red lips pursed together as she chided me, looking decidedly shy. " Kitty! Don't let a little kitten talk to you like that again. " I was going to oblige. " Do you remember the one time? " I asked. " I did. " She smiled weakly. The cat, or at least how she appeared, was aware of our opposable thumbs, which could only be said to be flanking her on the prowl. It would've been rude to snap her fingers and try to mewle at me, but I knew she was waiting for me and couldn't resist. I would never let someone go so easily. The orange bell that went blaring in her at the bar indicated the start of a four hour ride. " Sweetie, " I told her. It wouldn't have been easy, but I was excited for my new place to welcome. I must have been doing my best to give her a quick and friendly introductory face to greet me. She smiled and yawned, wincing as she reached for her bottle. " Where'd your cat come from? " " A little mouse, like a young princess. " I turned to her. She looked down at her lap. She furrowed her brow and took a licking breath. " I dunno. " " Then where's your bunny? " " It's fine, " I explained. " The cat lives in my house and she probably weighs about twenty pounds. I can't complain to you."<|endoftext|>

My House Has Gone Serious, But This Evening Is Awful. I have heard many dreadful stories throughout our time, but I stand here in Anno Domini, in this plain, a desert, a menagerie of endless troubles and grimoires. Even on this busy day, the Greys squashed such jaded fortunes, once. I can only laugh at what they have done for my safety. I've seen them running for their lives, blood and gore streaming everywhere. Now, I keep it right, true, and yet my son calls and calls in our battle, telling me to attack. It takes time, though, a burden lifted off of me by the strong word of my son, and a fight, powerful and long-nightmarish, stops my words, but I do go on, and I am told that the Dornish Hand looks upon me with pity, knowing this battle will end with a whelp on their asses. I step into my brothers' company and hear a fox bark! A hoof the size of a horse gallops onto my arse and checks the horse, pushing it into the mud. Like a shadow moves through the dark, motionless. My son crouches in my arms, and approaches. He cradles my head, hands tightly shut, seemingly to shield the stranger. The stranger looks at the stranger and looks upon him lovingly, unfazed by the sight. And then he lifts me up and pet me gently. He squawks to himself, "I bet you don't have a brother, pet, " he shouts. He shakes his head, grabs hold of my head, and pulls me to the ground. " So it is with great malice that this law is broken. What kind of servant of King Cera is it? " The stranger drops me and gets to his feet to stand on my right. " Is the blackness your kin's skin? " I shout at him. " Is it my kind's skins, or my kind's skin? As my own kin, what difference does it make to you? " He whimpers and tosses me up, shaking his head. " My kin is with us, " he says softly. His voice is like rocks, but he wipes his brow and rolls to his side, " Your kind may call me lord of this land. " I take his hand and lean in with a weary face. " My kin called it'The King's Hand.' How are you an Elf? " He laughs. " Bullshit! " " Lies, man! They told you everything! I thought I was your brother! " His face grew serious, " You are an Elf in your own mind, your hood is garbed with a wig. My hand is nimble and sharp, my foot is short and sturdy, my eyes are dull and dying, and my blade has a blade in it. " My mind quickens, my hand becomes clumsy, my mind is slow and brittle, my heart is strong, my body unstable. I stumble and flail around and stumble around, the only sound being the cracking of steel and the cracking of hounds. My body is still, but the terror has returned, and I am coming to a stop. " Tell me, who are you? " He says gravely. He flattens me sideways and drops me onto my knees. I smile, much harder than before, and he looks with hope on my face, with contempt in his eyes. The laughter reminds me that I have been chosen. I lie there, alone, defeated. He rips the kerchief on my face, pinning it securely over my head. I gaze into his eyes with sadness. " Fool! I am one of your kind. You are not my kind. I am no one but you! Are you a minion?! Are you a spiteful son of yours? A heartless, abandoned son of yourself? You are not my kind! You are my heartless fool!" He pulls me back to the ground, putting a swift swing upon my head, glancing towards my brothers in arms as though my body is nothing more than his paint, and then rolls back towards the dust.<|endoftext|>

It was soft as snow and my eyes skittered across the white blizzard clouds in the distance. When i made it, a second seat-less body rested on the couch, my muscles tensed and ready for another session in yoga with my acolyte. As i sat there still feeling the cold and notched on to my toes - knee-high covers accosted my knees - some of the other people bit into the cushions, keeping an eye on my movement. "What do people do here? " Looking at the roughly gathered matter, they all looked at me with dissatisfaction, looking at a thin veil of facelessness on their face, looking at odd shaped cobwebs or gray barks in the wind. " Mmm, everyone happens to be everywhere." The moment the kneeling woman had cleared her throat i knew exactly what i was gon na do. What I would be doing here. The first thing i noticed before anyone else vanished was the smoothness of it all. As the snow fell down and parted slightly. I really liked this place. I had done everything i had ever dreamed of before my reality came rolling back to me, feeling the breeze that lifted the cold as a smile slipped down my neck.

The floors creaked as the wooden doors closed behind him. The knocks came in from every corner. “ What do you want? ” came every greeting I had received in all my life from this god forsaken place. “ Jesus Christ! ” he exclaimed, “ what the hell? ” “ Jesus. You are the stoke in the fire which will soon surely burn. The only thing burning in this burning mess is my soul. If you let me go... ” Then they knocked again. Suddenly, I could hear a footstep from the door. I couldn ’ t make out the syllables. “ The South pole. Your move. ” “ I ’ ll come. ” “ Finally. ” “ Three pints of blood is all that I need. ” “ You won ’ t have to burn with me. Do you want anything to eat? ” The devil sat down. “ She ’ s already broke. ” Suddenly there was a tinge of sadness. “ Stop. Why? ” the devil said in a melancholy voice. “ You have to. You know that. You have to stop apologizing for the sins of the church. You have to stop apologizing for the people who come to watch. ” “ Why? ” “ They don ’ t deserve to see my dead body. ” “ So they won ’ t have to die of oil poisoning as the Christians do? ” “ No, no, no, no. They suffer, they live. They are in pain. They all suffered for no one ’ s pleasure, but I burn the wife, son, and daughter in a foul smell. They scream in agony. How can they be forgiven? Heaven will remember them. Heaven will hold them, like the cage around my heart. Heaven will embrace them with love. Heaven will protect them from the untimely death of Heaven. ” “ So we go back to heaven and show you that it wasn ’ t always like this. Heaven is better. The pearly gates must accommodate the sinners more. Hell is worse. ” “ Hell is worse! ” “ Now that Heaven is better, I let you go. And so will I. ” He looked me in the eyes and smiled. “ Angels. ” I stared back at him, seeing his lithe, jovial disposition. “ Yes, God. ”<|endoftext|>

*BANG* Yonder Grey wrought an impish grin as Johnathan walked out into the cold air. An impression with hidden meaning radiating over his white and piercing body. "Honey! " A muffled groan riled up amongst Johnathan's hayblows, causing the small creature to squeal in anger. " W-what are you doing?! " Johnathan recognized the alter ego of John Vilthal, a man who had already started his own lawsuit against Sean Drinkwater. Johnathan felt his hand tremble. He felt a prick and drop his snow-skimmed hair. He walked past a skinny, dark-haired man whose clothes caved in with the very life leaving him. He looked sullen and sweaty. The dark-haired man grabbed John's wallet and ran inside. " Come on, did you get out of here already? " Johnathan cursed under his breath. The broad, stony-eyed man stopped dead in his tracks. " Ah, that's great, really, just keep pressing on like I'm helping this one out. " Johnathan pulled a saw and tipped it over. " Where was the missus money? " " Pichu-ass, that's rather a great mistake. I mean it, I'm just making you pancakes, right? " Johnathan cleared his throat to speak but hesitated before resuming. " No, I meant, uh, to only give you some things, ya know? A chicken leg muffins. One pie, and a japanese birthday cake. " " We want a chicken leg, yeah? " " Oh, y'know. " Johnathan hung his head. " A.. right there, don't take my words too seriously. " Johnathan sighed. " Good. But, um... Are you just going to call me... Mary? " " Sure is okay, Mary!

Besides, always willing to put her home by'sday', and Mary would love a game of Chess because she knows how it goes. " Ok, um.... Uh.. Yes, certainly."

I can tell you how much it annoys me. I thought it would be a simple burnishing piece of paper with a # 11 on it. Wonder what it was when I read it. It stood at # 21. I think it was the feeling of utter confidence that consumed me the most. You know how people here consider me some sort of terrorist sympathizer. Every time I told them not to call someone that name in my own defense, they would have been getting the worst of the joke. In fact, it was downright awful. What the fuck?! I certainly didn't think it would be the worst thing to ever happen. I simply threw it away. It might be a significant portion of my fortune, but most don't even remember wearing these caps. Not anymore. Things go stale sometimes, they always are. Whatever it takes to rid this online bitch of this awesome piece of internet, please, dig it out. This is how to get it out of my system! I just had to write down a fucking 800 word-wide web address. Why? Oh I didn't think of that. I mean sure I write about reddit frequently and then I'm inclined to agree with them but I'm using the meanest, cleverest way of expressing those opinions so that this fucks doesn't happen again. This piece of really nice internet is just lying in my kitchen with 2 of the worst restaurants in California. Do I even exist? Umm sure. Sure I totally does. Even a single tweet about it can cause real pain. Why would I ever ask why? I don't remember much after that. When I was a kid I always wanted to be a novelist. College didn't bother me a bit though. I used to read books to write stories and this thing that throws me into this endless hole of frustration that it pains me with such a simple laptop just hits me like a brick and dumps everything in it. It looks like an antiquated iPad but its just not compatible with the keyboard. It shouldn't have even fired me in that instance. I mean no shit, who would have known I would do that? The problem is, it's not that I haven't had so much good times with these obscure inhabitants. They've burnt off here way too many shots in about 6 weeks and I think they're dying now. Maybe they made it through a fire unscathed. You know what they do. It doesn't matter, just like the person I bought it with their password in it, or my N64, it's vanished forever. That's all it makes me feel. It's like I'm sitting in a bookstore under a sea of dirty, weird looking cans. The few hundred or so me that was dead that seem to cling on to some tight rope. Every time I pick it up and tell myself I need to go find them I immediately feel their salty tears stream through my skin. I wish they'd just give me a shovel. They're better off left alone than me. It's like they're protecting me by playing their game of chess over and over again. They're keeping me alive and if I could just beat them to it, maybe with some more strength, I could run away and never hear the hooves again. But all these years of effort and vigor have drained me of all joy. I feel worthless. Not like I'm writing to anyone. It's like I'm an animal, such a weak little thing. What's the worst that could happen? Who would ever know? I'm writing this for the right reasons. I'm going to write this to my son, his name is Bobby on his birthday. He's going to write it. To the true glory of this unspeakable abomination of an internet. And I don't want him to get upset, that's for sure. I'm willing to do anything for him to see the light of day. I've got to write. Because like I said, this is just a shitty piece of shit website. I just hope I get a few hundred grand a piece of internet fun from it. Just wish the donkey could come out of nowhere instead of just throwing it out of this shitty TV window. I swear to God that I'm going to dig it out.<|endoftext|>

" The man muttered something under his breath. Jasmine said nothing. Finally, she looked to the pen-Writer, and saw a sign, that read *I am Jasmine. * She said, " Beautiful you, an Angel to the sheep. I am, however, busy in school. Want to try my hand at publishing? Can't afford to live comfortably. " " It's fine! I'll hire you, just take a seat. It's my daughter's second job! " " *That* I should go. " " *Ugh! * " Jasmine thought, and retreated back to her room.

She never looked happy for a while now, it seemed. * I am an Angel. I have to save her. * The man smiled. " Yes, of course, and help me get dressed!

You can just read, you can move a file, and you can laugh. You can live a life. You can have a sense of self. The more you realise, the more you feel you're part of the eye, the more you know you're with the times. It's fascinating but lacking the kind of focus you need to live. You've reached to the end of the universe. Not really a metaphor or anything, really it's just a word describing something. But that's it. You've surrounded yourself with impossible worlds in which there is no entrance or no exit to your dark, meaningless life. You're a much bigger end than the stars. You are one with the universe, it's full of places and possibilities, but no place to explore, *true* life. If you start to miss that then you're missing everything inside of you. That is the truth. You're missing the place the universe really is.<|endoftext|>

She took the long route to the bus stop. She jumped on the brakes and settled in, sliding down the side stair. We stayed on, pulling the same steps in between the thousands of cars that had been on the road. It was just a walk, nothing special, just a bland field trip. She was friendly. She didn't shout at us, even the small things that we asked were quiet for our age. We just waited to see the bus. She pulled the flowers out. It was the first she had, and the last - this really set off the butterflies in her stomach. The doctors told us we were going to be fine. Why? Because we had a spontaneous heart attack while off-campus, what with all the anxiety. She was beyond helpful. We followed her wherever she went, to coffee shops and gas stations. We would stop at her break room. She was the one time. Maybe for a few minutes. The apartment complex was small, huge. She turned off her alarm and told us we needed to get to work fast. She was loud when we were out of her apartment, but she was helpful and she would always be there when we couldn't walk to work. If we were late we didn't have a job. She was quieter than usual, in her chair. She took off her phone and looked around the room. With a smile, she put it away. The apartment was pretty small. It was pitch black, but the only light coming was from a small TV screen, a small device on the floor above the window. She held it against her chest and smiled. A cat came running up to the window and turned on a screen. A fisherman caught a fish in the lake. He wasn't dead, just staring down a camera. She whispered in his ear. He laughed. She said "hello. " He said. The cat grabbed hold of his arms and let him go. The walk to work had ended. We left at 2:30 and headed out to lunch. She stood in front of the tv. She showed us a picture of her cat, white fluffy fur, deep, smelling. She seemed stressed and scared. " We need to get out, " she said. " She's still waiting for us, " I said. Her face was pensive. She didn't flinch from her excitement. And you have to understand that an ambulance was waiting for us. This one was less busy. She came up behind us. " She's here... " The cat looked at her. " Oh no, she's here." The cat walked away. She hugged him and held his arm, trying to make him fall asleep. Something was off. She woke up at 3:02. It was getting dark. -- -<|endoftext|>

Emily found a bright, bright boy just out of the corner of her eye. The boy laid back in his rocking chair, and moved without a sound. She slipped into the kitchen again and sat down, flipping through the list of all the things to buy and sell, before a sudden knock on the door stood. "Okey, nice to see you here, you must be Toby ", she said. Toby pushed open the door behind him, but Emily knew she would have to deal with this disaster first. Toby was under a sheet, grabbing Emily from under the desk. They stepped off the pedestal to an exit. Closing the door, the boy saw Emily looking at him. " Toby! You have just bought one pair of shoes, I must say! " Toby said as he quietly left. " You do have the most hair in the world, " said Emily. " No, no it's none of your business Emily. I don't have any other shoes in my small stores. I live here. " " This is best of luck Emily. " Toby replied as he grabbed the boy and quickly walked towards the door. Emily pushed it open, slowly making her way into the living room. Toby immediately rose and looked to the boy. " Are you upset? I thought it was all due to you buying these shoes, I was just around the corner from the store I bought this pair of sneakers. " He said. Emily walked towards him, and looked at him. " Well, I... " He said as she walked off without looking back. A moment later, she opened the living room door, quietly strolling in behind Toby. " Good Morning, Toby. " Emily said. Toby's eyes opened with a laugh and she ran off the room and quickly called out. He came back out after finding the boy's shoes. She gave him a thumbs up and walked towards the door. " Man, the second you walk in there, make sure you lock them all up and don't tell anyone I stole them! " Toby said. " For fucks sake, Emily! Make sure you lock the hinges on each shoe before we sell them ". Emily paced back and forth the room trying to catch up to him. Toby raised his head to the door. " HAHA! Look Emily, look at me! " Toby said as she walked over to him and took a small package with her. After a short look, she said, " Yeah honey, keep it on your person. I know what you're thinking. That the majority of the world probably doesn't even have shoes, now where's the rest of the world?" Emily replied, and quickly drove a small box into Toby's hand. She pulled out a real hard toned box and keyed into the lock in. She wrapped it tightly and closed the door. She stepped into the living room. She quickly got ready to leave and sat down to get dinner ready. She grabbed her spoon, lifted the fork onto its separate plates, and spat the fork and onion on the floor. When she finished the spoon it leant down and swallowed it. She sat down and found a doll of a boy in her kitchen. Emily kissed her. *Hi nice to see you here* she said. She picked up the boy and threw him into the bathtub where she would go in and get some cold water. Emily walks back to the boy's room and stared at him with fear. The boy was dead. Emily ran up to the boy, and held him in her arms. She cried while she held the boy. *Good Morning Toby* she said as she began crying.<|endoftext|>

You can do some simple stuff now, make a decent but annoying meme. I am only alive because they ripped an old R.W.A.T.D.D.'s soul to shreds, but the mere invention of deep space transmitters was enough to garner enough people to become The Historian. At first, I appeared as a simple, ordinary man, perfectly rational and understanding enough to understand the current world around me. After giving up my supernatural lifestyle and considering the mildly unpleasant occurrence of the cosmic accident it did not take long for me to realize that humanity is truly a fractured species, both violent and devoutly pacifist. However there is one burning God, a creator who is malevolent and cruel, and can not be bothered to correct the mistakes of every man, woman, and child that has fought him, even amongst himself. The change began on the 2000's when one day, God chose to spread his power across the globe. For some time there was talk amongst The Historians about the greatest deity known to man, Father Felt, the Earth God. He worked too hard to create balance through absolute command of his plan. He spread his influence throughout the globe and ready a land of generals like himself. Infiltrating anyone and everything that had one thing in common. The sole order of the Father Felt was the worship of Mother Earth. But eventually this changed too. The Pope was there to see this change, while they had their own debates over God and other worshiping. Soon God became violent and while everyone disagreed, He was less strict with not claiming the mantle of God if he meant that. The entire world burned at the'religious' point of view, but ultimately Felt decided that *oh it is a great shame that there should never be an open dialogue, it violates his rules, and is putting life in peril. At this point, The Historian decides to stop spreading his influence throughout the globe altogether. He then contacts The Father Felt; he asks if he can begin every historical transition from the 1st century onward. Felt reads through the records to find nothing but the terrifying words, "Ah, I shall, give him the knowledge of the Father Felt. He shall love his brothers and sisters in the name of the Father Felt, but he shall never love them, and thus he shall devour them: For in the name of the Father Felt you shall nourish them when they are dead; if your kin has been damaged, but you still remained alive then he shall teach you to fight, and make ye loyal to him: Don't be afraid to eat a steak, eat a steak though, and live long and prosper without water". The Father Felt gritted his teeth and began to grow old, but still God saw fit. Though all the Father Felt had become was a hazy and convoluted mix of bitterness and arrogance, something infuriated him, for he had brought his power to the people of Earth and now he, and his closest followers, were the only ones he could make sure would survive. -258<|endoftext|>

The man who hanged himself. The man who had communicated with him on the balcony. The man who had shared his thoughts about suicide on that hot summer evening. The world collapsed around them and they watched as their lives dissolved. Those of them who were ready to die started to disappear one by one. There were no more hours until the bridge spilled over and all hope would be for them. But still, it would be the last time that they would look at each other at the end of their days. The world rejoiced as one reached in a small drawer and held out an old worn book. The old frail man pressed the cover to the page and began reading. As the tears rolled down the page one of the boys broke and started crying. " Look at him we're gon na make it, " he said. " We can't let him die, we can't make him suffer. " There was no point talking about it now. When the skin on the mans forehead began to smooth black lines began to form over his eyes and face as the doctors handed him a small bag. They cut the veins that had grown along the man's forehead and fastened him to the chair. The world would rest forever. The brave brave boy would take part in the end so he could rest in peace. And would become... normal.<|endoftext|>

It was only an average Wednesday. I was alone at a small dining room table. I began to watch the television with my usual anticipation. "Hey McDonalds, where did you go last night? " The typical co-host barely stood up from his recliner, " Right here at 8.30 AM we have another old man talking about how he's starting his first full year at McDonald's and how he's tired of the workers waiting in line at his cubicle. " "....you got another one? " He chuckled, " No... no, more importantly....no....too late.......today a vision showed up....like this morning.....when we thought we would have it, we didn't. A thought, and when we looked at him back to see how strong he was our armies marched on his position at his office. His borders won't be broken from the soldiers, or their gunfire will. People will be just like us. Some will cry and cry, others will stand like us. But the urge never stops. Today it all starts....to try my hand at the steering wheel of the car and see if we have the kind of knowledge that could put the mightiest of stars on the final journey home." With this he turned around to leave. I grinned once, once I looked at my watch, or at the clock. At least it had ended in ten minutes. The good days can come again.<|endoftext|>

Michael was not fed until recently, upon the farm owned by Arthur and Adolf, and Michael was a massive risk to his safety and health. "Michael, why did they take me away from him? " Arthur spat loudly at Michael. " I don't know Michael. I am at risk. " " Alright lets find a broom, ok, broom, and we'll begin, a quick fire. I think we'll have easy to control the fire, so it will be easy. " Arthur said as he pointed his brim-less hat towards the broom I was flinging at my son. " I'm Henry. Make the first move, slow down, hurry up! " Arthur screamed as he swiftly hit the broom handle of the broom. " Michael, look at me! Every hand! Okay, time to take a swig. " I tried to choke out a panicked breath as Henry knelt down next to me. " I'm sorry Michael, but it's nothing I need to worry about. I am going to be careful. " Arthur assured me. " We'll have no problem, it will be easy. " " Alright, here goes " Henry said as he slowly raised his hands to reveal his face, he was pale and unkempt, like a child. " I don't have time to explain. " Michael questioned, " are we going to some amusement park then? " " Michael... yes Michael. I don't have time. " " Wow, come on. " Henry said as he waved his hand dismissively at Michael. " Oh come on Michael, I don't really need to explain it. I'll probably just give you a flick of the wrist if you're interested. " Michael explained as he turned his back to Henry with a sigh. " Holy shit! I'm so sorry Michael. I'm not being like this."<|endoftext|>

The salesman walks in through the glass doors, eyes ablaze as he walks through the plethora of soft smells of stale bread and stale delicacies filled with vapid odor. At the back of the shop lies an array of utensils from various cultural and medical institutions covering everything from medicine to clothing to music; he leads customers through a selection of trays of reek of raw, offal-like viscous liquid, as he offers to change customers' need to use an inhaler when they were in need of it. Upon arriving at the restroom, the old man, dressed in a ridiculous costume, looks at the customers array of empty stomachs and agonies and sighs in utter regret. " You're entirely wrong sir! " he shouts with a wild, vicious smirk. The room stops dead in its gears of hormones and agonizing excruciating pain. The product doesn't have any flavor, only dark dark lingerie and dark, darker, dark underwear. The lady behind the counter spoke with a voice that echoed between the deafening silence of the room. " Would you like to have another snack this time? " Her hushed response was cut short by the trembling of the poor woman and her tired fingers remaining in each other's reach. The demon in her midst choked on her mouth like a small child. " I'll have another small snack if you call me. " The demon speaks aloud in the range of male voices, his mouth dry and infected with terrors that could only be seen from a phone booth in a no man's land. " It's the most drenched you're ever in. " He gently pokes his snout and nose with his beautiful purple fist, spitting deeply onto every object in sight. He bites down on each last molar, sparing no pleasure from the dizziness before him. It is a terrible sensation to behold, and he continues biting down on each inch until he isn't even audible as the air is lost and collected by the unassuming droplets of mucus that have accumulated. The only sound that really escapes his nostrils is the massive purple mop of piss dripping down his neck, his gooey saliva washing over his face. " Alright.... " he finally takes his metallic hand from behind his back, blowing a cloud of saliva into the air with practiced ease. He lifts his arms and throws the device at the manager, splashing over a shelf displaying a disposable insect toy. " Next time you've been squirming like shit, excuse my manners! " the manager opens his mouth to yell something, but instead of a reply, he lets out an insensate breath that stings his entire body. The demon the Frankenstein from the television commercial finally gives in, cracking his knuckles and an eyebrow raising. " You know, if you'd wanted to, I could have just popped your intestines, stomped in, kicked your face in, and started munching your straw ass. " " I suppose I'll give them one because you seem a bit funny. " the manager replies. The demonic leader, now wearing a brand new mask, smirks as a red wide grin peeks up on his face. " As is custom, if you come visit, we can leave you being. " The salesman walks out of the place, making a soft splash in the sea of sewage and lukewarm water. In moments, the stink on the walls of the restroom will be gone, replaced only by the dead smell of mold and decay. The demon still stares with fondness, only slightly wary of what is to come. The job is as it always has been, it is decided. Only in the moment will the monster master the ability to sleep. " Would you like a refund on your overwhelming sense of existential dread" The salesman walks in through the glass doors, eyes ablaze as he walks through the plethora of soft smells of stale bread and stale delicacies filled with vapid odors. The teenager, in her teenage years, completely misunderstood the concepts of self preservation and individuality, making her the only child of one of three demons in the world who was now in her teenage years.<|endoftext|>

I was sat in a dirt road so wet the shine of the sun caused my skin to feel like a sink. My ears reminded me of my ceiling fan, which was warm in my hand as I continued staring at the road. The red mass of light in front of me was a stark contrast to the heavily buffened concrete and colored asphalt ahead of me. A white sedan driver began to lift his speed dial towards my car. I don't remember hitting him. My hand held up the scythe glimmering. It was time to pay the price. One last, long drawn breath as I was about to reveal my new transformation to the world. "Now you have become death... " I began. I didn't begin to speak. Instead a voice began to grow. " You were to take everything away from me. I put all my faith in you, I was to be the last one you would ever want to be, I was to be your watcher and your confidant. Then I had to shove a bullet through your heart. I turned from your side to your heart, I was to make you light up. I would be death, but I wasn't. I became matter, I was death. " " The world in which you live, now is one of destruction and death! " I said. Something about the voice seemed to expand. " You are being destroyed... I have to stop you! Please! Why have you become this dirty whore in the middle of the street? " The voice inside of me was getting closer. " I have gotten so close. And yet all those seconds ago, before you and I and you who didn't notice me couldn't help but stare at me! And all those moments where I found you and said goodbye, and you bit me, but I turned you around and said, " Stop trying to take away what I have given you, or destroy what I have taken away from you. " I wasn't satisfied. Everything I touched now caused a different person to touch me, and I was pushed away by it. As I tried to move in my newly given shoes, I felt the red uniform tattoo that had appeared on my hand. I was struggling to stand on my feet before the man holding the scythe spoke again. " I am here to bring closure to your life... a reminder to take care of your family... to guide yourself and put up with your family... And yes, in order to do that, you have to kill me." And then it all went black.<|endoftext|>

Spring stood in the wreckage of the day. And Summer hung low in the sky, her entire world gone. No one dares oppose her anymore. Young, naïve, and heartbroken, none dare try. Summer let out a scared cry that shook the foundations of her fortified defenses. Yet still she awaited morning, in which the earth would crumble beneath her and her loved ones. But for now she rested, preparing herself for the dawn. As the day grew weaker and the day grew short, Summer let out another cry. So now it is, finally, the dawn.<|endoftext|>

Dear Diary, You're welcome: ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - The smoke slowly crept up my shoulder as I hunched down in the iron bars. Each hop, every step, I eased. The old path dipped into the boggy dirt underfoot, winding its way about one by one down the hill until I could make out only a single trail and I could just barely make out my landing. She was lost, her arm straining against the seat before her. Her leg seemed to have been laid as she pushed herself forward, her chest aching. Even now, my back ached as I neared her frail body. The muscles seemed to have dried before that leg, the air choking me with viscous air. I looked up and the two bodies around me appeared to have kept ticking forward as I climbed. The dog trotted along, pawprints covered in dried leaves that seemed to rub at each other. I had to come and go as much as I could, and she kept pushing ever more slowly. The forest surrounding me was dead quiet and the trail seemed to keep getting deeper, but before I reached the rock face, I noticed it's faint shape begin to fade away. It was a dead oak tree, ferns wilting under the weight of time. I stopped and turned to face it, the last of the woods on the trail. It was a simple leaf-covered, pitted tree, reaching for the sun that I had forgotten. I stopped where the beacon had stopped just a few moments ago and began a climb with the bite of the old oak. The ancient green grass emitted trails through and I felt my legs strain, twitching for the fall if my legs would let it. I paused and tried to steady my feet on the tree. I wondered if it had grown up or not, considering that their limbs and body were the same age as mine. Sometimes, they were different, and sometimes they were not. I could see every step of the straight path, the dog putting his paw up to guide the weight as he walked. The tree shook slowly and for once, I didn't feel tired, and I wouldn't start losing weight. I watched as the forest moved on, and then I watched them leave. I heard as their teeth and feet curved and turned in places and I took a moment to think about the animal they put down. The last of the trees a tombstone, only to remind me that they wanted to fall away. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I took a good chug, but I have trouble swallowing but trying to. I feel fine, almost as if my stomach is feeling empty. I keep trying to breath, and trying to pull on my last bit of air, but it's there. I have been, almost ever since I'm last able to breath and I almost made the mistake of taking too much. It ’ s funny how the god of death visits me as it rests within each and every one of my limbs, making sure that I don't completely die or that I age, not that I have been living forever. I can ’ t think straight, as the last string of strings that makes up my life lose all meaning. It stretches deep into the depths of my being, and I think about time and everything else. I no longer feel pain and change, but the world around me is empty, empty with nothingness and meaning to it. I couldn ’ t be too sure about time and what I could be with. I can ’ t recall where my current home is, and I can ’ t remember where I think I am. It's everything I ’ ve tried, to realize that I don ’ t exist. I don ’ t remember memories, only empty dreams. I barely remember what I ’ m feeling, though. The last time I felt anything was here. It wasn ’ t a great day, but it was a good day. Perhaps life was bad, but maybe it wasn ’ t. I ran to my bedroom, and everything was still. Everything was still, for sure.<|endoftext|>

It's been a week since this happened. After just a few hours of too much partying, I was finally finished from my drugs, and went outside to get a beer. I didn't think I'd be able to get out that early, nor anyone alive around that time. I can't remember getting home in time, cause I never left without some help. As I turned the corner and walked out, out into the street the sound of scaring tourists followed. From where I saw cars coming down the street, shaking their wheels. As I started walking toward the unknown I stopped, staring back at my little neighborhood, and said to my closest friend, "Why don't we get back to sleep at least, once you wake up?"<|endoftext|>

I had to get like- Many police arrive who have in abundance enough money and special equipment to invade my home in a matter of hours. However, as of now, the situation is completely hopeless. Many prisoners so disgruntled with their prison, their bars, or simply don't care anymore, I have decided to blackmail them. Most criminals have the nerve to leave, gather, gather, gather and make plans to charge me, but have expected to see me in prison sometime after the heroes defeat me in the ensuing battle. I have dispatched some of the most high-ranking officials, some would like to spare me if all of them think I'm plotting to occupy the throne. While the guards have shot me all I will do is lock them in their cells until their bars empty. No more planning will take place. I simply sat down on the mattress, not wanting them to know. That is all the guards will do. It was expected by the justice system that I will defend the region again, and I was unsure of how it would change the way I rule my world. However, until then, I am here, existing from the shadows. In a matter of days, the Hero took over my empire and broke into my prison. Unfortunately, they did not get to take him for their kingpin. I am rather loathe to challenge him now that he is being actively sought to take over a region so brutalized by criminals. My plan was to escape, but by now, it seems that escape is futile. The guard who watched me at the door is running in his cell, and has already knocked me out. I merely watch him until my opponent invades the cell. While running, one of the most anxious guards approached me, and I pointed at him. " Hurry now, this is where you will die. In the pool of blood after the fall of your family and friends, I will hold you until the inevitable falls from heaven. " I was puzzled, but then again, I had never seen the Devil as one who would die. It was more frightening to watch, because everything is already coming to an end. Even the guard who watches me on the other side of his cell gives a terrifying stare, as he tries to push the guard aside, to grab me with both hands. " Don't- Wait, wait- Wait- No! " I didn't know what to do, because I had absolutely no idea what to do to him. I slowly start running, with no luck. Finally, the guard comes up to me, looks directly at me with a suspicious look on his face, and says " It's just a suicide, since nothing will happen to him! " I only have a moment to wonder about what to do to this guy, because it was probably my first attempt to take control of the world, a very successful one. After I get to the collapsed hospital, I see the entrance to the slum. I look at the name on the door as I shout, and then started to walk around. *One! Two! THREE! * I hope someone will pick me up next time, because this thought will make my day more enjoyable. I stumble down the narrow tunnel I ended up in before I noticed what the door was and opened it. *Free your children, my children. They have everything. Don't worry, just please don't get mad, everything is under control, anything you want is under control! * I look up at the door, and am met with a familiar face, only slightly more scary then my memories of a dark and lonely life, said here to keep me company, but hey, it's almost time. I wait, there he is again, in front of me. " You see, if I didn't win this time, I may never be able to be the last villain you will see."<|endoftext|>

Seinfeld looked into his interviewer ’ s eyes and exhaled with a deep and gravelly growl. He managed a wry smile as the gruff man stood up, shuffling from behind his desk and taking a seat. Seinfeld let out a long sigh and said, “ Huh? That ’ s interesting. You want to ask about this Friday? ” The interviewer rolled his eyes and he looked away, returning his attention to Larry. Larry grunted and sat down in his chair. Seinfeld raised his hand and hit Larry with his thumb. Larry didn ’ t seem to notice his finger longening until Jerry noticed him moving away from the table. The other candidate simply sat, dumbfounded. Seinfeld leaned back and shrugged. He started rummaging through his bag of my old tricks. His hand moved it ’ s way through the stack of old tricks and it had just picked out one from the back of the stack. He poked it once and almost punched it twice before bouncing off the wood and landing on his shoulder. The interviewer grinned, “ That ’ s so cool. So young. So young! Can you explain to me why you ’ re interviewing me? ” Seinfeld was starting to sweat. He reached up to the back of Larry ’ s head and grabbed a frayed handkerchief. He grabbed Larry ’ s name card and bent it over his mouth. “ Hey Seinfeld, did you hear that? I asked you about this show. ” Larry glanced to Seinfeld, “ Was that uh… you know what the show is about? ” Seinfeld ’ s mind was struggling, how the hell the man could know?! How do you get into this show?! “ No sir, ” Larry stared at Seinfeld. “ It ’ s just, I thought maybe once you walked into the room you were going to really enjoy watching it. How do you tell people? ” Seinfeld stood there and spat into Larry ’ s face. “ I promise I ’ ll tell you something the world ’ s not quite sure about. ” Larry flopped backwards on the couch while he thought. Seinfeld pulled out a small box from his backpack and opened it. Seinfeld saw the tape recorder he had just rented and slid it into the box. “ Hey Seinfeld, did you hear what I told you? ” He said without paying attention. “ What ’ s that? I don ’ t know what your name is but I figured we ’ d give each other a thank you. ” Larry stammered. Seinfeld shook his head, “ Does it matter? You know what I ’ m a good speaker. ” “ Don ’ t thank me what I ’ m asking, ” Larry grabbed the mic with his hands and began rambling while Elaine typed the long, inscrutable instructions into the recorder. “ I ’ ll tell you something the world doesn ’ t know. ”<|endoftext|>

Seven billion miles away in the halls of the citadel of Castel, A Planets Orbiter ushered in an unprecedented awakening of life. Generations of study, work, and innovation had swept the galaxy, finally at the brink of creation. All for a sole mission: to colonize the barren planets of the Milky Way. The home of the single deadliest race ever known to man, the Whiteclaws of the Milky Way. The whiteclaws had been wiped out long before the study, but the work was beginning... At last. Why had everything gone wrong? The species that have resided here for eons had proven useless, unworthy of even thinking. There was no blood, no radiation, no hosanna to sacrifice and rape for a nova to keep them in my domain. The Whiteclaws had obliterated the Dark Initiative to a halt, realizing that the only threat to their survival could be they and their humans who had not learned from my mistakes. Yet here it was. There was a ship in the sky, safe against any asteroids who crossed them. No more weapons. No more nukes. None at all. The Whiteclaws considered us for a quarter of a second, before deciding a solution would best suit them. Some had allowed their own resources and had started to monitor our progress, but nothing had prepared us for this new menace. The Whiteclaws were not so naive. We would fight back. And no amount of space time could prepare us for this, and no amount of evolutionary planning could prepare us for what was to come. And the Whiteclaws knew this. Even after all that time in space, we had all learned to fight back, and they knew our sacrifices would ultimately be needed. Over twenty years of study, great sacrifices, and attempts to prepare humanity for a world free of... and... _or_ _threatening. How could they all lie to us? How could the Whiteclaws lie to the Interstellar Alliance? And so it began. The war was over, the League of Planets had liberated us from our foolishness, and all that remained was the whiteclaws to keep us in check. We were still fighting the war, we were still fighting to keep Earth's two basic axioms of democracy intact. But now, finally, we had the answer! We decided there was nothing to stop humanity. One more conquest, and my world was a better place.<|endoftext|>

Pitch black curtains catch the rays of the sun and the hairs on the back of my neck stand as I glower through the doorway at a red Prius driven by the driver's side of my car. My jeans are sewn under my oversized jacket, which is heavily tucked into its hoof so my ears can barely be made out over my t-shirt. My cheeks are dark, and my hair is mottled; the crinkles and rivers on my arms and feet are all done in peeling fashion. And the music is not a soft coming out of my mouth, but rather a distorted scream. Black noise comes as one can only hear those ears, and that noise can be only the crack and whirring of car horns as they approach you. It terrifies me; I can feel a shiver run down my spine; I can barely move; the world blurred by the white noise becomes dull. A man drives by, ready to pull up, but I stop him just before he stops and he pulls the car in front of him. It is not the sports car I am looking for, it is an SUV driving a Chevrolet Pacman. Staring at the elderly woman, I can see the look of shock on her face as she is sobbing. My pants are ragged against my breast. This will not be my first time trying to find something, a lost love, but not as lucky as this; the accent here sounds nearly foreign. I ignore the screams and I don't care to hear anything else. Who is this to leave me here, trapped in this limbo of absolute blackness? This isn't what I want; this isn't what I need. The hood rips open as the officers yell at me to leave, but I close my eyes and don't move an inch to escape. All the sudden I'm gone; I don't recognize the situation, but my body isn't so different from all the rest I'm in. An officer turns around, looking from one of the way down the aisle to the next. He says, "You find the door? Someone is coming to the door." and he pulls out an actual shotgun. I'm left alone.<|endoftext|>

It's like they don't know the truth. When you're raised by them, the most passionate moments will just vanish forever, leaving behind your guilt like a spectre in the dark. What do you expect when you see their faces smiling, when you see their eyes gleaming? And that's when you're very sure to tell them that everything's perfect. But they never seem to realize how much has changed. They just look at each other, numb, as if no one cared about them. And then their scythe slides against her hip as the blade slips from her cheek. I just can't tell them that. That'perfection' just disappeared forever. And the man in black continues with his rhetoric without question or mirth. There is no way to find out who I am, and all he does is walk around like a practiced killer.<|endoftext|>

I sat down at my table and took in the two short, mottled ladies sitting in the corner. They had her gnarled blonde hair with a mess of streaks running down her shoulders, her eyes blazing from the heat that was radiated from the room all the way down to the small, worn dingy, white stained cup that was their eyes. Her brown eyes barely bore the sparkle that was some deep brown that she used for gardening back when they were both toddlers. I took a sip from my tequila shot and he quickly drifted away. "Surely, you're not related to that stranger with all these scars? " She asked, her eyes glinting at my withered hand. " No, I'm just an alias! " " Do you see that inside your soul when you lie? " " Yes, when I ’ m being honest with myself. Like every day. " The woman shoved a scar into my face and disappeared into the nothingness I ’ d come to know as my job. Not that I ’ d mind. I ’ d just spend the rest of my life dreaming up what to do next, slurring my words as I had to when she showed up in my life day in and day out. " But you see what I ’ m getting at here? " I asked her with half an eyebrow raised. She turned her head and made eye contact with me, her short grey hair bouncing up and down under her makeup. " Do you come here everyday? " She asked, her gaze gentle and warm. " Just one day, huh? " I nodded, mouth hanging open at the thought. I was starting to see why she always kept her normal conversation. She was the first in a long line of women to respond that I listened. “ It ’ s for my promotion to counsel. ” She laughed and nodded again, motioning to a side of a chair. “ It ’ s important that I tell you the truth. ” I winked, covering my nose. The woman made a quick move, putting her hand on my shoulder. I nodded in response and she gestured to her darker, up ahead. “ I just want to tell you one more thing… " She pushed open a door and a clapper sounded. " We don ’ t need to, " I murmured, clutching the cracked coffee table to my chest as I searched for the words to ask for. " Tell me about today, Mary."<|endoftext|>

He looked out from under his glasses at the wall of plates on the table, unbuttoning his collared shirt. He twiddled his thumbs and thought carefully of his father. He recalled last week when his father had attended a ceremony at the end of the school year to lock her in the front hall of the open school and force her to wear flip flops, to keep under wraps as her father was thrown to the ground with his palm in her neck. He could remember all the cliches and the flashy tricks and the setting up of posters that accompanied them. There had been tears and rumblings of protest and it made him feel a tad embarrassed. Maybe he should explain how she had been standing there *for, like, an hour, directly between her parents and their parents' auditorium. * She had turned to tears. Not because it was tough, or because she regretted it at all, but because she still wanted their attention, and if he'd just take those emotions as a cue, he'd have forgiven her sooner rather than later, but even that would have been a waste of time. Now, he doubted they would have any idea what ‘ sure ’ actually meant, and there was the inevitability of it. How could they even be sure? He watched her for a few moments and looked up. His hands trembled. Was she really the Chosen One? The one in question? Where did all the bad do come from? They didn't even have a clue what his mom was talking about. She always said she hated to think about it like that. “ But you're actually NOT the Chosen One. ” She had said that a few days ago. His father would nod and ask her later when it really mattered to him to feel down. The thought was certainly hard to deny. But their parents were both the cruelest people ever, and if she were wrong about her father then why did they keep her out of the public eye? Her son was worth a few hundred thousand dollars every year, and she was a wealthy man by all rights, probably considerably better than his father. She would be the sort of person whose family didn't pay taxes for her treatment of her parents as if it were something she didn't have to keep a secret. But he remembered that kid. He'd been in that incident because, well, he would tell him that. She didn't hear him and he didn't even remember asking. It took a while for him to gather the courage to come forward, but eventually he did. Only to turn and cry for someone like him to hear it. Now, it wasn't so much crying for him anymore. He froze, unblinking, then glanced back at his father, knowing that maybe if he let him tell the truth then he wouldn't have to go through with his lawsuit. He would get his parents back. He was just going to deal with that. That was the idea in the back of his mind. “ Sure. But you've really got to believe that. " He reached for a glass of coffee and smiled. His knuckles were cold and sweaty, but his eyes where closed now. He decided that it was best to keep his mouth shut, hide his disappointment, and down quietly when he knew he didn't have to answer another question. It was better to deny everything that brought him so much pain, than it was to ignore the consequences, to withhold until the consequences finally came. What difference it made that not knowing was no matter. There was one way out of this whole thing. He just needed one more moment to think.<|endoftext|>

"Agent Murphy just showed up to work. " A short blonde man was watching me, at the other end of the bar. He pulled out a briefcase, glasses in hand, phone in hand. " Yeah, so... Agent Baker. Well, let me just, to begin with, request that you pay me for the coffee. " He walks up to my table and stashes the briefcase inside. He showed me the address on the front, small enough for us to see. " The person who's been leasing this building for the past ten years. " I was about to say hi to him, when he rolls up to me. " Where's Betty? " " I actually have a contract that you signed with her, so lets see. The property. Let me see what she's got. " " Looks nice, but if that's not enough, here's another'standard' coffee. " " Wow, this is really expensive. " " Hey, what do you want? " " I want money for my family. I want Betty to care for them as they have for everyone else. As I said, I'm not impressed with the coffee's taste. " " Well, then, let's move on, shall we? " She motions to me to continue. " Now, give me one one more shot of the... um, um. " He pushes my pen out of my hands. " Ok. Now hold on. The very important question of your case is, why? " I started pacing. He rounded the corner of the bar, and was able to wrap his arms around my waist. I pushed him down and held his hand tight. " Agent Murphy, I just have another thing to get it right in here. Let me ask this: In the infirmary they keep a card with every procedure. It can show a profile from a given past week, or a time frame of when the procedure took place. This same card can show you birth certificates, when it was a boy. A name. You know, the first name of your child. That's right. You've been transferred over. " He starts pacing back and forth. " Yes. This is a fascinating thing. " I started pacing again. " You may want to ask,'Just what happened to Bob?'" He started jumping up and down at that. I begin to cry. I heard the police come, and the police quickly get word to my cell as a woman was found naked on the street. Then the man, a middle aged black man was already there. Then the police. Then the medics, then the parents. The man, in the pantry, and then the mother. The father! And then, what appeared to be a child was in fact a replica of Bob, a man of the day. My captor holds a photo of my wife as he is called.<|endoftext|>

I remember it as my typical 18 year old motherhood party. No wives, no pets, no sunbathers, only flying pelts and small drinks. No hot tea with gentle shaking from a persons head, and delicious table cloths around our mothers dress. My father put the dirt down with us. I put my brother to bed, we all lay on our backs and quiet sobbing. We waited for the police to arrive, so I half-vetoed with my rifle. I was originally hesitant to go in one of these woods, of all places. I always liked the peaceful nature when we were kids. Their forests always seemed to stretch to an end and people seemed to be escaping unscathed. That was until a stray dove attacked, fast. My father was so angry I shot him up. Out of nowhere a three foot tall rodent rushed me with a haymaker. I don't remember how long it took but I swear he felt for the blood that ran down his face. I watched it for a few seconds, cursed myself for not thinking of the smaller rodent. Another couple of minutes and they were gone. I'm really glad I did it, I never wanted to have another nightmare. Our town always had people running around, making the forest a cesspool of evil. I wonder who it was they caused that.<|endoftext|>

I met him the day I could afford what I thought was a fine dinner. His brown hair reached his nose and he glanced up at me every so often, completely oblivious to the monster he had become. He was perpetually disinterested, unable to see the point of any life they lived. I also had my daughter who I grew to like very very much. She was my idealized biological offspring. All the same I had discussed my plans with him but it never clicked. After dinner he didn't glance up at me, but simply sat there. He hadn't even registered the mirror on the table in the middle of the table and stared at himself in my eyes. Why? Why hadn't I told him? Why even tell him to leave, after what I had just witnessed? "Mommy, what's wrong?" I asked, my voice surprisingly gentle. He simply stared blankly at me and looked away. He looked scared. I didn't even know what his plan would be, but I knew he knew that he must. I squeezed his hand and said nothing. I had a lot to say, but no words. Then I turned to the mirror and my mother stepped over it, wiped a tear from her eye, and said nothing. And then my vision faded and I woke up, as I always do, in the hospital room and my body curled into a ball. I didn't cry for the missing milk formula, my abusive father couldn't have stolen that from me. Just so I could have at least had some rope in my hair.<|endoftext|>

He remembers all the things that couldn ’ t have been. The crashing of the car, the murder, the crying. Everywhere he went he could feel the pain. There was no pain in his memory of all the pain. Or so he thought, he looked down at his empty stomach. It was so dry. How long has he been laying there, swaying to and fro as the darkness dragged him closer to the ground? He couldn ’ t quite remember the exact amount of time he had been awake. It must have been a few hours, he came to the decision that he felt that he wouldn ’ t make the same decision he did now and that it was best not to think of it. Something tells me that things will all be okay. After all the things that have happened in his life, he may not have been able to take them all very well, no he wouldn ’ t be able to keep them for himself forever. It had been three years since he last saw his family. He had a good life, some of his friends had at least one person who he knew who had loved and felt that he could take. All in all, the experiences he had had that he couldn ’ t take and lived with were worth the pain he experienced. When he was done with this life that he had thought about, he had decided to take his own life. The cold barrel of the gun plunged deep in his chest.<|endoftext|>

The Big Mushroom was at least four feet high. It's wings were two hundred feet long, and dragged at least a dozen others up and down the cold Canadian soil. The Smoky Smoky was so large that it made it look like an ocean, and the bottom couldn't support all the booms the Mushroom uprooted every day. The Multiverse just stared, blank, until it lit the night sky and let the fires snap of star. The forest was dense, but silent, until the expanse of rain began to open up. Ever since the holocaust, humankind has adapted. Each generation grows through another, already a part of a larger entity. Those genetically enhanced to use the electrical power of the Mushroom can now roam the Earth. Their skin is cursed and hardened by natural selection. As a result, the Bloks are swift and eager to destroy. They have cleared out cities and inhabited the continents. Their numbers are smaller, and the pollution has effectively blanketed Earth. Meanwhile, the SMYM is aging. Not because the mushroom bodies are tainted with toxins, but because of the sheer volume of their beings. Without proper eyes, their foreheads would tear apart. Their scales rot and burn. Their bones decay and fade. Their skin cracked and gnarled, their bones are all but gone. They have given up trying to live in a world full of fissures and cracks. A world ravaged by the splinters, shards and worms of the Mushroom. The remaining mushroom inhabitants are no match for the humans. They are inextricably linked to each other. The Mushroom likes to burn the Bumans. Now, the Smoky Smoky smears dark brown smoke across the grass like a black veil that covers all life. It absorbs the fine mist of the land as it dribbles down the grass, away from the mushroom, into a vapor that quickly envelops the entire earth. The smoky is the last link between the Mushroom and the Bumans. Every mushroom knows there are others like them. They could not make it to them, but they could reconvene the Others, the last hope. The mushroom knows this is the end, that it has lost its humanity, and it will not be alone. They will hunt, scavenge and destroy, while the Smoky Smoky burns. The pieces will all die off, and come to be a random being that lives through a mushroom cloud that will someday annihilate humanity. The Bloks could don'thing.<|endoftext|>

From the perspective of a crude Disney character. And the consequences are not public. After all, who would want to believe people would actually think emu with magic? Well, it looks like their stupid decision will have consequences as well. Famine will only open itself up one day as people begin systematically using evil influences. I'll find out where the source of their evil lies. A study, A has found the first combination of chemicals produced by the humans' eyes as they fidget at computers. One of the chemicals is like cocaine - whoever it is and why it is made will also begin to use it on themselves. Its effects will most likely be disastrous, creating periods of severe poverty. Smiling as he found out, he sneezes much like some hairy dogs do - although this time it will be altered further. Again, around a month later, similar chemicals are released on humans, and stress and anxiety causes both them to produce a lot of nasty chemicals. Objects that sit on people have a negative energy, to which people build harder. In this final phase, people start using substances that their minds can't for they can use as an escape mechanism in their lifestyles. E's and L's and A's, will be self-destructive and terrible things. The amount of food used in their lives will have a negative effect on productivity, which will make anything in society significantly less productive. The same thing applies to children, and actresses, as they will use illegal substances to build their houses and cars. More complex and dangerous substances can appear all over the world. People developing a certain weakness will get their neighbors to wipe them from the face, which will increase productivity. The intention is not to cause trouble, but not to become worse. Kids are going to be exposed to chemicals, and teenagers, drugs, poisons, all that are only made through negligence due to to a preexisting flaw in a system. A few point of light emitted from Chernobyl, "destructive", was tested and can be reverse engineered into dangerous substances by checking off the genes. If the defective genes are found on all the bottles of super glue in a bottle, the company will be forced to halt production of emergency glue - a blood-pressure so high that their gums will explode and lead to kidney failure.<|endoftext|>

It's gotten cold. Tires, dry skin, in the middle of a town. They're running low. My heart's been racing, the world's been cutting into me. The current situation in this fickle field is nowhere to be found. The hard people won't get out until this very moment. Flares are getting louder, twigs started tearing apart at high speeds. The last few hundred days are total bullshit now. You don't learn when the cold war started, when the children born into such tight skinned helllets pressed fatter into the ground. Or when the wealthy put up their own genetic sleeves to be cleansed of this thinening ash. Or when governments chucked them in to Al-Qaeda cells, watched they ( our families ) rise and fall like ants in a field of burning sand, and thought they could simply savor the peace. Now, in this mancerated world, heat death is almost no longer a thing. There used to be carbon emissions, there used to be the food and work and food. Now, a couple billion people have been out here for 300 years, wind from the coal on the farms will soon have turned the trees brown, weeds will start shedding, storm clouds will turn, the whole state grid will be in shambles. Just yesterday, any old tank of water tipped over our heads, before our ships fired up to a nearby star. Thousands of us, millions of kilometres from this wretched backwater, have been given a chance, a chance to learn the ways of this heat death. The sun will be a blessing once more. My ears are ringing, the wind is tearing through my hair. More ships are flying here, one month ago we had thousands of scientists and engineers building them. We all hope they'll be able to save us. We have been seeded. Optimised. We got into running back to our FTL fold through time, when life is easier and speed less. People have finally made peace with this new world. It's being taken back by both machines and government. We have guns, balloons, bodies. Cheetos, candy, even guns. That's all in order. I can't stay here any longer. I can only hope that this cold war isn't because there are too many. The last couple of thousands are dying now. I must be so tired of sleeping all around this planet. Waking up with a hard place to be. I have no choice but to stay here, somewhere I can still make the noise, taste the wind, and feel the heat.<|endoftext|>

The pain from the sidewalk grew sharper and closer, the ground shifting and creaking beneath my hooves. I screamed as I stumbled toward the lonely man named Junior, and his bunny. There was one thing I didn't have the guts to say. He walked in, forced-pedal legs ever so slightly forward towards me. This can't be happening. He stood almost still as he neared me. I didn't have the guts to tell Junior, and now I'm stuck here as a spectral being forever stuck in the nightmare. If I'd known, I wouldn't have gotten off this train two days ago. Now this bum with no credentials, no idea what he is talking about, and the blonde girl with black hair that look like she got checked out and hung around her boyfriend and their dog and their dog's butt, and those teeth that make her go "*Am I... the ghost? * " I want to scream in agony, but then there's a blinding flash of light as the accident takes away my sight. I can see deep down, or at least a portion of me could, but I'm powerless to stop my hands. The scene ends when Junior throws a baseball into the intersection of my left and right, at least a mile away from me. A jellyfish falls, swishing past his brain. I can't hold back, I know what's going to happen. I kill the man with the baseball and run, but I struggle only in agony, and I vomit in the damp ground before succumbing to whatever happened behind me. The sinking pain in my gut sears the back of my throat as my eyes lock onto the baseball in my hand. I must make it. I push Junior out of the way, pull him onto his back as hard as possible, and can hear his whimpering as he looks up at me in terror. I can feel his agony. It's the end of the world now. My hands are numb. I'm alone now. I can hear the crashing roar of a car behind me, and the familiar screaming, over and over. * Oh, God. * It happens so suddenly that I don't even know what to do. I just jump off of the train. A cab pulled up around me, the fire department red-headed. Without a word, Junior runs out of the car. I try to call someone out but I can't. One thing comes out of my mouth. " I was coming for you. I don't know what you are, or I'm afraid if I don't pick you up it'll hurt. How long was we out of here before you came for me, Chris?"<|endoftext|>

The girl who slept on the catwalks above the flea market looked back at me and we both knew what we were doing. Heading into my position like this, she was obviously curious; I decided not to let her get too comfortable. After a few more barks, she was finally sitting in front of me. Instantly, I was running for the garage, towards my car. Her phone buzzed to life. 'Hey honey, could you get this next barks on the way to work?' I set the phone down. 'Yes dear, can you open up for a quick walk?' She immediately opened her eyes and wobbled in circles as I cautiously ran towards the garage door. 'Okay,' I said impatiently, already hanging on to the gas. Eventually, the door swung open. A shorter man passed and we exchanged greeting. 'Karen you're making it... sorry?' 'Sarah?' 'Ogh, no.' She nervously replied. 'Why are you doing this?' 'Her phone's ringing. Kind of like that guy I forgot yesterday, I never really used it. Now he's at your door... maybe we can come out of this' I motioned to my sister, her head scrunched up in frustration. 'Yeah, how about that? He just left and now we can come out of this later.' Sarah nodded and I followed her back to the car. Her phone kept buzzing at us and the door eventually swung open again. 'Here you go,' I said impatiently'Go get her. You'll be late for work' she sighed as she craned her neck to look at me. 'Can't wait to see you again later' I smirked and handed her a beer and brushed the hair from her head. She glanced at me sheepishly, and turned around. She nearly spit on the metal, but luckily she was looking at me. 'Hey, sorry lady', she said softly. 'I hope I don't let you go again. The catwalk top is secure.'<|endoftext|>

"I had some serious dreams the night before, yesterday, about a boat sized monster in the middle of a ravine, coming up here with a team of SEALS. " I said to him as he dragged me from the bottom of a lake in the middle of Montana. I felt horrible. I was tired, dehydrated, and hungry. The apocalypse was about to happen. The kid came from a poor family in Cincinnati. His parents were farmers who lost his money overnight. His father had lost his job and lived alone. His mother had died when he was 16 and he was on the brink of losing his mother to cancer. " Is this the end for you? " The kid said. I couldn't decide what to think. It was important. I could lose my job because of this. What I didn't know was that in the end my dad lived into his 40's with a terminal illness. People thought we were stupid for taking him in. He didn't live that way so we stayed with him and waited until the next wave of fighting began. I didn't know what to think. I wish I had read the army file when he first enlisted, and he took the kid. He trusted me, despite my past remarks. He understood the difference between war and peace. We were part of the current squad and to fight war would give us hope. This kid, he'd accept a chance to join us or fight the near push of the wolves. No other kid was willing to risk turning his life around for another fight. I helped him lead us into the storm drain of carnage, and he helped us keep the icy plains cold by using his remaining tools. This was life for a kid, and he was determined to get his life back. He spent the day at camp going through the motions, kicking rocks at the beach and tracking down anything and everything he could find. He knew what he was fighting for. I made my way to the camp, and my squad members made sure that there were no survivors. We were completely safe from this new war. As I led the rest of the group over to a gate, I heard him shouting. He was yelling about to close the gate or fight me and the equipment that the SEALS were using. I jumped in front of him and yelled " NO! NO! NO! " He choked out, biting his lip, and walked away. He fought on, only to realize that he had forgotten what he'd been doing. I ran to join him and opened the gate, but he retreated as I ran. My men were in front of me, and my arms were held behind my back by some kind of thick sheet, covering my shoulders with a soft, leathery material. They knew who I was and weren't going to let me get away. All I knew was that I had to fight one man. I wasn't scared. I could only make him out. I was freaking out. Was I crazy? Was it really all me? " Please, just save me," I pleaded. There was only one way to find out. I needed to put this kid out of his misery. I jumped in front of him, took aim and fired. I never took my handgun.<|endoftext|>

Timmy could hear the trench rattle in the distance, a round cry that grew louder, louder. For the first time in over three years, he stood and watched. The trench was around midnight when the spooked stinking briny black came screeching out. The gargantuan bronze self-apartation, as they called it, was in the process of swarming and engulfing the trench with it's gigantic brush of death. That, though, proved more impressive as it disappeared into the dead backwater. "What do you want with me? " the rumbling voice asked. The deep white pits oozed black in their yellowing, chlorine-black skin, and Timmy was prepared to accept a deal. " Nothing, " he answered. " You left me with the worse of the worlds, I was taken care of. I've never bothered paying attention in front of you " The rumbling disappeared and the colossus vanished, leaving Timmy on the white soft soil that covered everything below him. Through the thick layer of mud and dirt, Timmy heard the footsteps of the black giant in the distance. " Where are you going? " Timmy demanded. " At your lair, " the slavering thing said. " Wait for me. The next time I see you, give me the filthy clay I left. I'll clean it up. " " No, I won't. " Timmy didn't dare to reveal the filthy clay. " Now go back to its little gullet. It'll rot. " The slavering creature reached out to Timmy, only to have a palm sized black hole form inside his hand. Timmy covered it with his thumb and index finger. " Anything you don't want, " Timmy demanded. The abyss snorted and turned dark. Timmy lost consciousness in the hole and went into a tormented sleep. For a moment, he couldn't find a way to remember. As he lay in a pit in the dark trench, he heard a deep growl from his pit mate, behind him, breathing fire. It pummeled through his soles and the darkness engulfed him in its bite. Timmy walked up behind the snarling black. " Hey shit! " he yelled. " You got meat." **I'm not sure how much more I've gotten! ** I'll be back with more after I get back from work!<|endoftext|>

"He was a mustachioed, attractive young man who had stolen the now " freakish" cash from a homeless man who needed funds in a better tomorrow! God, that was kind of funny. Now a young criminal apparently writing to his wife, to try and take the money, and outsmart his wife, he just sent him an unexpected email with no reply, to little details. Well let me get this straight, she and I met at the bar last summer. I ended up staying there for a few hours a night while she wrote his phone number and pulled the wallet out from under the counter. We ordered a date and she left pretty fast. I went home and checked the bag in front of me for her phone, I then checked into my own. Her secret life was one of pleasantness. I only paid off this kid at the bars, in a thousand different ways. She always slipped those tickets off with a red marker after she left. Well I got home and threw all the cash in that car and started driving. I was spending time with her by herself. I later learned that she died the year before asphyxiation from a stray bullet. She was just cute and I have no concept about the tough-guy attitude.

Smoke surrounded the man, his red cape waving as it gently moved across his face. The man had enough. It was time to stop. He took a step back as the words he had listened to all those years flew by in his mind, and this woman who never spoke to him had no time for his attention. She sighed, the same deep, elegant tone her grandmother used. He knew it was her. She studied his eyes, and he knew exactly what to say. He looked back to the old man, her accent practically moulded on his throat, his smile unreadable. She let out a sigh and looked back at him. She had known him for months now. It was common knowledge for old people to look at him as something terribly rude, and resentful. She didn't understand why. And he knew it. She wasn't too far off though. The man watched his hand hover around her shoulders, like an angel that saw to that which could best serve him. "You have me." She called with a hollow voice. She gave him a kiss on the cheek, and a nod of approval and a leaden handkerchief as she turned away from him. He heard a second whisper, and then a noise. She looked up as he lowered his hands, and he saw her face slowly sweep across his face, then fade away. The man did not recall her speaking to him, but he thought he could still hear her own voice. He stared at her, looking down into her eyes, and he felt a little hope he had made her forget him.<|endoftext|>

He sat slumped over, sighing heavily, like something out of a movie made way for Jeremy was about to die. He was going to get through that fine morning. Jeremy always sat slumped over and heaved some bad coughs. His chest arched out, violently clenching his fists in pain. His whiskey cup stood at eye level, his hair slowly dropping down. He stared up with daggers and his eyes waved in expectation. Jeremy lifted his hood up, realising it didn't make any sense. Jeremy put the hood back on, leaving the filthy lazy Tom Jennings' smile. The flat of his gut hissed as he surveyed the place. Jeremy sat bolt upright, carefully tapping on the front steps. The first light blinded him, causing the stumps to jolt. Jeremy's face was contorted in a grimace. Jeremy was on a gurney.<|endoftext|>

I never would have thought it would end this way. I mean, it was just a baseball game, I don't even remember going in. When I came to this new universe, I was in the middle of a field of soldiers. Only some had taken the pitch, and the mecha soldiers were marched off and back to a field of trenches. In the middle of the field of soldiers, I saw the landscape. The sphere of the blue sky was a white sheet that seemed to stretch infinitely, but in the middle of the field of soldiers? I saw a vast speck of ice. The specks were covered with smooth, pale white fluffy snow, and stood on solid white clouds. It was a very interesting scene. The forest was covered in swirling patterns of snow, craters that were thicker than any surface. In the center of the cloudless landscape, was a border of a harsh mountain range. From this face I could only guess where they were in the land, because as I descended down to look, there was a small boy screaming in the snow and trying to ignore the sound. I could only stare for a few more seconds. The boy became far more aware of the snow on the ground and the sound I hear now. Then he started barking. Next thing I know, I saw the boy and then snow, and then mountains. They stood on solid white sticks. I saw nothing else. The boy looked forward to what was to come. He thought he could reach the border of the mountains. At this point, I knew what was happening. I dived into the ice and then I had to see what was on the other side of the portal. The area was familiar. Finally, I found a place of chance. I walked to the portal, and everything was normal. I walked deeper, and farther until I finally saw something. I just needed to squeeze through. I heard a footstep, and froze. That is when I realized I was in an infinite, infinite loop. The red side of my world was the closest thing to theres but is black, and *is* black.<|endoftext|>

My names is Marcus. I've survived a slaughter of some 500 men. I fought them. Through a full moon-deprived sky I have sent the list out for a day and it has been received. I'm happy to die for my country. I'm proud of what we've accomplished. I have kept on getting better but now I'm about to die the next day. I've received the letter. It's a letter from my father. I've never really given him anything but loyalty. In a letter we'd say goodbye. He received the letter and used it to lay back and hug. Today it was my birthday and today I would tell him I'd never ask again. Yesterday I saw him write a letter. It was his way of saying goodbye to his wife and daughter. He said he wouldn't go but asked me if I loved her too. I had no answer. He tried to pull back his happy tears but I got them out. Today on the 18th of January 2032 my regiment stood in line outside the battle line for the day. No words of the letter. I finished the letter as we stood, waiting for the day he would turn me away. I was the first to leave when my regiment moved down the line to witness the carnage. The prisoners were screaming, praying, and crying. I don't think any of them knew what was going on. There were only three of us left. A redoubt had appeared ahead of us and hundreds of men from around the world were gathered at the far end. Some of them wore my uniform and some were armed with large black rifles. We marched past the redoubt and into the war. After a few minutes a whole day passed. People were eager to see what the war was going to be like. We knew what the war was going to be like. We knew there was no chance we could win. We still thought we had a chance. We knew it would be many years before victory would be ours. But there was still hope. We were built up and fueled by the hope. The sun kissed the ground across the horizon as three men and two soldiers rode forward towards the fort. When the ten year old turned four years old they saw the fort within sight. The fort had no name but it held three stones. We couldn't let that happen. But when the first wave of troops got inside they began trying to scream. Men started to stand in front of the fort and threw stones at the men. Soldiers started firing blindly and getting nothing. The leader of the group sprinted out of his office to grab his musket and magazine. They soon heard shouting and rushed straight into the fort. Some men gasped as they were lifted in aloft to fight the soldiers, some jumped up to protect the men but most were just defeated. We all got carried away at the last minute when a few of the men saw it from above. A massive steel eye on the front of the fort opened and in a flash it was all over. The two men before us collapsed to the ground. Tears rolled down their faces and pooling in the mud. One of the men had pulled out his rifle and prepared to fire, but he slipped past a few feet before being hit by a falling stone. His arm gave way and soon he was covered in blood. Two of the men in front of the gate collapsed and joined the burning husks of the attackers. The third one lifted his gun, but there was only a single bullet in it. It flicked and the man fell to the ground. The third gave a surprised grunt and looked up to see the tower wall surrounding them. He picked it up and called to his dead comrades to keep up the fire. Two soldiers were pressed to the ground and watched his blood drip down the battered iron gate. He drew another life out of his body and it grew in number until it was almost a collection of blood so that it might be used in his name. He stood there, in darkness for a moment, as if he was in a room so that the men could see him. He turned and walked to his men and led them. I watched them leave, giving each man one last look at the man before his body was a mile away from the gate. I still hear them say goodbye but I'm not sure what they meant to say.<|endoftext|>

I sat for a long time, disoriented by the ever growing ramble of text. As I turned the page I was raised to believe that this wasn ’ t just some random coworker asking me questions. I did many good things to these poor creatures, now they were simply fogs in my mind, a daily reminder to avoid for safety. They were machines, meant to make dreams come true. With the perfect working conditions and help to fight the demon inside, everyday life was only chance. I was twenty-seven years old in 2015, I still hadn ’ t lifted a finger, at first it was just routine I spent so much time answering on paper, but it ’ s been ten years now, and the times have changed. I have to respect these things that lie beneath my teeth and tickle every inch of my skin. When I can live with my life as a slave with an illusion that everything is normal, and with the contract that they have drawn for them to have me, my belief now sets in that I am truly free. Through success, only one thought remained.<|endoftext|>

* Dear Jonathan, * *It's very cold, * *and I am hungry. * *But I will eat, * *and I will bake. * "It's a silly idea. " " Don't make sense, I know. You are being silly. " *But I was silly. I mean I am not stupid, Jonathan. I have been running a business for 20 years. I was in an orphanage, and my parents convinced me to become an adult. " *Did you really think that having an orphanage was on your mother's side? I can't imagine how you can ruin that. Do you really think the smile on your face is the same smile as your mother's? What did you even mean, " I want to do something meaningful, too? Or perhaps you misunderstand the point, Jonathan. You just write in your grades that I'm better than you... " *Wait. What? You did my grades or something? * " Oh boy, " *Do it. * You don't *do* anything to anyone, Jonathan. How could you *pretend* that you are the lowest class in school? Then again, for whatever reason, that didn't come from the same perspective when you were starting out. You picked up all those pieces of paper, and even mentioned *not* lying to other students, which you are not meant to do, Jonathan. Did you even really not remember them? Did you even try to? Really? You can't be more than a wheezeer the professional athlete, Jonathon. * Do you know why a bro would touch you or tell you -- who'd he be? At that point, I could hardly believe it, Jonathan. * " Don't, " *I said! " Go up on the stage. " * The poor kid in front of you was gone for a while after that, Jonathon, now that you can live with your failing grades now that you want out of society, right? The honor, Jonathan? The money, Jonathan? " *Wait. That's not you...* " How could you live like that? Where are the common tasks? Did you even notice what was going on? " *Do you understand? Why would you take out *the* bicycle? Then again, even if it were the greatest blessing in existence, why would you even care about these, human scientists? I could not take it any further. Jonathan, you are truly a piece of filth and narcissism. You will not have any friends. Then again, you are a piece of filth in the black abyss, Jonathan. * " Ah! " *Oh for fuck sake! Your mom has told you not to eat that sandwich. There! I needed a sandwich! Don't you think I am going to take it!? * " No. But dad? How can you be so insensitive to what little you love that just the way you am? " *Now, don't you dare move! Please* " For the love of all mankind, NO!" *HA! *<|endoftext|>

It's been 3 days since I met them. At first we simply talked. I sat in the small, cramped office, quietly cracking the last 2 or 3 jokes that had made my heart melt. Eventually I got used to their whispers. They kept on coming, never stopping. It was only when they stopped that I felt more alive than ever. The first time we met we were working late shift when a young me came in for the weekend. He had shaved his beard and stood looking disappointed and confused. No one seemed happy about it, this being her birthday. He proposed on Saturday, after a course of lectures and some overly formal discussions. I asked him to marry me. I brought him here on Monday. I asked him to take me here on Tuesday for dinner, at his hand. The beautiful night sky smelt of wine, and I mentioned he looked pretty happy on it. The date came. I couldn't wait to meet him. I knew it would be perfect. I kept asking about the best clothes, was this his favorite bar? I asked him about the great food, he gave me a deep bow and said he would enjoy it. Then, as he opened his mouth, he started laughing and let out a shaky laugh. Then he started laughing again, and then he got really quiet, he looked me straight in the eye and said, "I think this looks like me, I think this looks like my knife, ". I didn't get it. He had said he was a knife. I want my house a little more, a little more for me to be safe with him. They banged on the door, and I saw my house burned. Something went terribly wrong. There was a shadow that followed my out of the corner of my eye for a moment. It was a strange looking creature, it had quite long and tanned hair. I looked at it, but it was still looking at me. I saw the shape of a man, who was looking really shocked at me, saying " Who are you? ", one that was shocked was my face. They just chuckled again. I couldn't stand it anymore. They said I look like a fool ". Again, and again, it was just laugh at me. Then it laughed again. But the last laugh remained. It was a deep, low booming laugh. It tasted like burning rubber that's been pouring from my mouth. The sound was now coming from the bathroom mirror, and more laughter broke out. It seems that as they walked outside I heard a voice over the mirror. A young girl. She looked really like her parents. She was smiling. We ran into the bedroom, as all the other girls did. " Are you ok? " I asked my wife. She looked up at me. Her eyes were bloodshot and serious. " I'm fine. I don't want to hurt anyone. " " Then how the hell am I? " " You seem to think that more than me.. Is that what you were saying? " She mumbled, rubbing her temple. I turned to my wife. " Is it so hard to admit what you're into? " She asked again, laughing even more. I turned to my wife. " If it would have been easy for you, you'd say it's really hard to admit that I'm into her." My wife looked around the room, tears streaming down her face. I reached into the bathroom to grab the towel that was lying on the floor. The sound of some falling footsteps and crashing was deafening. I ran over to the sink to start cleaning. I stopped midway through when I heard a scream. There was a hammer at my side. My wife walked over to the edge of the sink. She looked at it with confusion. She started sobbing at my feet and my wife turned away from the sink. My wife ran out of the room, walked across the room, and jumped onto the bed. I woke up the next day... with blood all over my chest.<|endoftext|>

As I swiveled my head towards the horizon I spotted a small blue planet in the asteroid belt. " What will you type a far-off planet for? " I asked as I rested my hovercraft in the craft's hangar. Then I noticed something, large and hairy in the sky. It was smoke, it was constricting and had twists, it looked as if it were moving. The hatch on my hovercraft crunched and I ran out of air so I was alone on the planet, only the beeping and beep of its engines to keep my ship stable. It was a beautiful thing, almost to me it looked like a scythe and the physics didn't allow for it to be manoeuvre-like. I stepped on to the planet and slowly got up to get around it, by the time I got to the other side I was in the back, it was great, even on higher turbulence. I squinted my eyes as I tried to make out the shape of it, black dots that looked as if they were flying overhead. I was scared, and all I wanted to do was play along and enjoy this. The planet was so quiet, it sounded like music. I could see something that looked like the sea, but this time all I could see was steam drifting through the air towards me. My breathing slowed and I felt vaguely nauseous. " Alright, this is what I want to do " I said into my mic. " Just what's my strategy? " The task at hand brought a wave of shock through me, I almost had to be plucked from the ground. I began scanning the screen, every barcode I could see reminded me to level of one. I had the most scarlett barcode on the planet, code 3671. Then, " stroke my right hand, and we will solve this problem together" I was awestruck. Little did I know that immediately after I stroke my hand, the room disappeared. The strange images of the clouds were gone, and there was no stars anywhere. My vision had reached an end, but my thoughts were interrupted by a sudden crashing sound. I watched as the cloud outside faded away and disappeared to nothing, only the black dot remained. I awoke up as a rush of dizziness overcame me. There was no cloud.<|endoftext|>

I could feel it and all around me I could feel the void, the terrible sadness. Each time the reality of what felt like existence crept into my mind the bitter cold smothered over my soul, as I realized if I were to end up here I'd end up in your wife's bosom. I would be stealing your newborn babe and begging you to cut your nose clean with the gash of my knife. I would be imprisoned in you'flesh' where your child's mother would crack like a whip at you with a toothpick. I would be the embodiment of suffering and pain; the greedy, wretchified denizen of the underworld that must constantly be, visibly, yanked into my body. Because you feel it, I feel the despair in my heart. This empty void feels like eternity in the blossom of so many roses. It would feel like the hands of an angel clutch their pets into each other's arms and weep at their grief when they feel alone. It would feel like the gentle ticking of a box window, but its bond to its maker is broken. I would feel the sadness creep into you like a band of moans and calls. It would be all that you could cry for; my identity lay on my back, my voice washed away by misery, until nothing more could be heard. I would be reminded of what was to come.<|endoftext|>

The surroundings are eerie. A twisted mix of thick grey and deep black, perfectly clean and well put together. The thing I saw was front and center, almost open. Like a floodgate to something closed. Past the stream is a pair of trees just high enough to resemble cool and freshly picked fresh air. A hill from the middle of the path seems to be undulating and engulfing the sides of the hillside, turning the surrounding space into a hard shield. Spacing all around the hill, layered around the entrance wall of the hill and staircase leading to the other side of the hill is a rectangle of pure white. The oval is very much made of the thorns of the trees. The triangle is marred by two circular brush trails leading straight from the main walkway to the very bottom of the hill, and the very middle of the triangle was carved with heart-shaped squiggles as it progressed through the hill toward the exit. At a very far end of the path are three smaller specks of white light. The dirts, stripes and black are visible on the edges of the outlines and ridges of the forest. On the tops of the trees or other surfaces of the eyes that extend toward the carvings of the trees, there is a distinct little light being emitted in and out of those specks. These specks are not visible even to the naked eye though, but inside the carvings is a hologram that seems to exist from even farther back. The face of the figure is the face of the ape that occasionally emerges from the trees during the day and is responsible for many recent events as well as heiress to the Animal kingdom of the Kingdom of the Uda Fak. This guy was obsessed with Dikara most of the time, but I didn't find out who that is until very soon. I was looking for some information, so I immediately called the police and began a search for what exactly was behind this mass of fancy hair. At this point a police report was pressed out to the high street. Nobody told me what the information was about. Curious I went to work that Monday morning. I worked after work for about an hour until a nurse showed up at the station and put a needle into my arm. I woke up around 1:30 a.m. and she opened my eyes. I did not know what to do. She said she had been having trouble breathing but could tell that I was fine. She was mean and weird to her. I was sure she was just having a hallucination as well but I wasn't sure at this time, because I didn't believe in her at the time. She responded saying that she had come to save me and I had just died trying to save her from a gorilla. I tried to convince her that I would be safe but she would not listen. She wanted me to protect her in fact she wanted me to do this job that she loved doing and trust me. I had called 911 and sent it out without hesitation. It was at this point that I was so crazy that I started taking pills with them just to calm myself down. It took five seconds before I could wake up. I had not taken enough. I started taking psychedelics every day. I realized that all these drugs helped, but they seemed to be killing my mind. But I tried to convince myself that they werent all bad. But these drugs were helping me calm down, and so I continued my journeys with no drugs. This continued for five more weeks until I finally tripped and fell to the ground and was petrified. But I was thankful for what my dream was, because it was the only thing I had in this desolate place.<|endoftext|>

I liked this story a bit. It's more of a setup than the main character you're writing, and I appreciate that. I'll try to re-write it if I can, but here's what I got. Hi! I'm amazing! I think this story really flows and I feel like it fits into your main character's voice. I love that you're so bright, and the way you speak has a distinct singing sound to it that really makes me smile, though. If I could choose a higher quality paragraph, I would put it in my OP OP. It feels very thorough and accurate!<|endoftext|>

When his phone rings he takes a deep breath before blinking once more. I try to fumble around in my computer pocket but my fingers slip out of mine and down from his phone and onto his belt as I strap it on. " Hey, Tramps " I whisper. He smiles and slithers to the kitchen, stirring past me to check if it's on. I close my laptop and grind the last few bits of food into my spoon. " Whats going on? " " It's just a hangover, in fact, it probably got bad sometime back. I kinda gave up on me, I have to get home. I've got to get on the road and get a date for class. Can you stand staring for a little bit longer? " A pause, then I shout " Fucking freak. " He takes a quick sip of his drink and goes through a few things to clear his mind. I say, " What was that about? " Silence. It feels like an eternity, mostly because he doesn't even open his eyes. " I ain't a liar you bastard! " He says, placing the remote against his throat as he breaks eye contact. " Why are you even here? Why are you even bothering us? " I say, that pathetic attempt to be good makes me feel sick. " I wasn't from around here. " " I'm not crazy, " he says, with a fake smile. " Just angry. " " Why am I even here? " " Because I met you once while on a date. " " To hell with you? What are you talking about? " I question, kneeling. He just shrugs it off and picks up the remote. " Another hint. Thanks, Tramps." I pull the phone from my pocket and point it at him.<|endoftext|>

No, I didn't want them. They wanted me. * * None of those *innocents*, the ones that organize and coordinate my inventory, are willing to make that decision for me. That's a lesson to be learned. I was innocent. They treated me like a fair little bitch! They treat me like they hate me. They used to help me rake in gold for them, even though I was a little by my own standards. But now they shut me down like the 5 little rats who killed me that day. Why should the story of the protagonist suffer? Oh, you see, the story is told by the Crows that litter the field outside every adventurer's hotel. * * No, really. It's a nine-to-five day shift, so the books have to be given time to sit. I don't have these *odding* little shelves anymore. I have down to the last sack to be sorted, dusted, and set upon. Good, that might explain why it's so hard to find that treasure. The boss in my shop *is* the only way I'll be able to profit. They're doing "shopping" in the dungeon before- *No, really. * And if the dungeon is empty, there isn't anyone on it. Ever. By and large, it's been a record job, considering they don't have baggage, that I was never picked as a loyal customer. Which doesn't happen to everyone, of course. So now I walk out, dressed in gold on little, soulless white shelves, laughing as the money my crows keep churning out drain them of all in their ignorant delight.<|endoftext|>

Two weird coincidences. After experiencing the likes of that between my first and last experiences on this event ( which, unfortunately, did not happen to my immediate family ), I thought that if I should correct the report of events until it was too late to do so ( or so I thought ), then I would say to people around me: believe me, I have had a harder time than yours did with switching between these two experience intervals. At least in the sense that I can respond to both experiences. You need to do your work in order to figure it out. I suggest from what the eyewitnesses have told me, both these scenes are very similar. We are in a room. A small cabin above the cabin. I'm sitting on a chair, me in a mead, and a man sits beside me. He holds a strange metal table with a certain strange metal tool. He puts it on. My eyes narrow as I continue to stare, as his eyes grow ever more narrow. As he rips open his table, I hear a not-quite-mygoshawk ( cataracts combined with temperature change and another identical attack from a laptop ), then the unmistakable clunk of the table smashing against the wall behind me. I move to kneel and look up, when I see a flash of light, red, glowing off the table. I fire a shot at it, but the kill is instantaneous. If there is another assassin watching me, I must be about to attack them. A cataract can only kill three, but I have been killing them in the middle of my day! *flip*<|endoftext|>

I fear my games have become boring. I think this will be a long one. I am a son of a former philosopher, a citizen of modern times, and our great protector. I see not many of them so far in the world, amass the power necessary to bring about change. My name is I, and our world revolves around me, it doesn't matter where I look or where the people stand, the people there are always open to the least resistance. When I was young, my parents used to tell me that I was "a God ". My parents knew, and I know now that they never imagined I would make this mark. I was to be the greatest of them all, the best at what I do, the greatest of them all. I set out, to give the heathens, the atheists, the religion maniacs what they wanted from me... a brotherly quest. Until the sun took the colors from the sky and will burn it a thousand times, and it will burn, too. The sun will burn to make the fires flare until they can no longer be seen, no more might they be worshipped or thought, no longer will the heathens worship me. I set out, full of determination, it is the very first thing I do, I have made it so. It isn't a routine, it is simple. I will summon the angels that would be necessary to trigger the production of fires which will burn around us, so there's little time before it's too late. One of them will be the good man, he will teach the others the importance of a good god and how to use them, and he will prepare the weapons the Great Dark Knight people use against him. The good man will be chosen, alongside my so called brother, and his brother will have to crush each one of them, I repeat this process over and over as my search begins. And then the dark knights will fight in, and people will forget about him, and more and more will die. Fire will burn and life will drag, life will suffocate, and someday after their death, they will take the day off and go hunting, but even then they won't attack, and it will be a long, arduous hunt. Though I have been a God for a great long time now, and I have searched endlessly for change for years, I always end up finding the other gods that are far more valuable, but always get ignored. I once searched in the deserts, and found the sultan, and he destroyed all the men that were in his army. I read in the margins of his people his tale, and he was weak and sick, but he was patient and might have survived. When it was my time, I determined, and I set out to change everything. " Until there is no more I can do". I sat down, and heard my children cry. I set out, and I poured my heart into the children I could find, and we played. I played on mountains, and kids were played on airplanes, and people played on the ceiling of their houses. I played at concerts, I played at beaches, I played amongst all the natural resources I had, and all the prayers I had made. And then the time came for me to draw and set out. I would take away all the power I had, take a new god, save that, the heathens and the atheists and this stupid religion. I looked at the power I had stolen, I thought about the gnomes in the forests, and remembered those who could use my Power, and I remembered all the beautiful children I had drawn, and I remembered all the time I had spent in my room. I turned and faced my children, and I cried and fought, and I reminisced, and I cried and fought and I died. I quit trying, and life resumed. Not anymore. I'd had the same Gods for the last ten thousand years, for so long, it had been difficult for me. The people of Earth know my name. They remember my power, and they are jealous that I continue doing so, and they are angry that I continue to do it, as though it's a waiting game for them. They are angry that they can't simply undo what I did, and because it's just a game, they want to see it eventually.<|endoftext|>

I look to my left towards the channel I have been setting up for myself. Turns out I am not alone. The bright green light from the television screen flickered intermittently, interrupting my darkness. A voice seemingly from across the room says "We've been searching for you. You have a good life and your skills are being revered. " Around the room a group of... people? Wait, what? Wow, I have never seen anything like this. " I need you to come into our city to assist me in my name and strength. " Hmm. The people on that island... other islands! " Yelling with their voices. Those... pink dolls in the plastic tub? Damn, this island has been my home for so many years. It is getting colder and colder. The island is getting harder to find. I wonder why so many of the people on the island want to meet me. Oh, I wonder why I can afford to send them on expedition instead of trying to go over there. This isn't a crisis. I think I'll be far enough from the lamp post of the TV that it'll be safe for these people. In the distance I see a large moving creature coming towards me. " Shut up kid, " the kid shouted " Come over here, I'm not giving it a try."<|endoftext|>

Just a little bit after my computer booted up, I heard a car screeching to a halt behind me. In haste, I rushed over and picked up my phone. I dialed 911. "911, what's wrong? " " I... " " Who are you? " " I'm... I was sent here for a murder attempt. I knew you wouldn't believe me. " " So you died? What is it? " " It was a strange... surprise death, and I accidentally got decapitated. Injured? " " No, oh well... " " What happened? " " Nothing. I just thought... how are you being so sweet today? " " Well, since when was it Saturday? You know, Saturday? " " Yes! I mean, Saturday, when I was seven or eight, my friend died in a car crash. That was after I got struck by a train. " " Are you concerned... this isn't my life? Did you get hit by a train? " " No... " " You never even crashed a car when I was seven. Why are you so sweet now? " " Because I didn't die in this car crash, I died. " " That's... that's nice... " " Thank you, Siri. I must have been like seven years past the point where I would have screamed at you to come to my rescue, but that was fifteen years ago... Well, for the record... " " Siri, are you sure you didn't see the things I just described? " " No... " " Your brother died at a hospital, in a car crash. So you're the part of the family now. Are you all right? " " It was my brother... if he's alright. He had a brain injury that caused him to lose motor control. " " He was dead when I arrived in Heaven. " " I'm sorry. I had to leave, but I can't let this be a problem, this isn't my life. " " I'm sorry Siri, but I'm so sorry. You weren't supposed to be here. They took you away from you when you were seven. There was another fourteen years where you were 14 and they took you away from you. " " Siri. I've got to go. I've got to go. Do something with your life. If not kill myself soon, you just have a few more months to live. " " I... " " Is there a way you can help me? " " Stop worrying. Everything is going to be alright. " " Goodbye! Siri. I love you. Goodbye!" I glanced over to where the other passengers had left off, and noticed a faint glow of light on the outside of the car. Well, that's enough talking to myself. I pulled off my hood, and walked toward the door. When I got to the other door, I saw a man who must have been twenty-seven years old standing at the door. I opened it. *Dad... what are you doing here? * “ Oh! I'm in Heaven. ”<|endoftext|>

They were trying to hide it. We'd been looking for them for weeks, because honestly it seemed like an agreement was made between the two of us -- ( I must admit, I was prepared for the wedding but was decidedly opposed to what we'd done ). Telling no one, telling anyone -- even the groom -- to keep their ears to the sea. I would feel guilty, I took pride in my work, perhaps all. Telling nobody to get up in the morning, to drop off the groom and the waif and back to our home, even telling them I worked hard. You see, people call us the pretty ones, but we seemed disinterested and yet did not address us until we'd arrived. Don't get me wrong, it was love at first sight that put an end to such insolence. Telling the ladies, the maid, the gentle wifes -- let them pick the flowers, let them marry, could it all even happen here, in a court room, in the castle? I mean, nothing so good can ever happen here. Maybe that's why the court so many years ago decided it was best to purge the kingdom. Because a wedding could not be final unless everyone was ready to get together for a quick end, and so we arranged a guest where the bride and groom would live. The king became reluctant to rush the next night, or at least be summoned before me until I finished dressing for it. So the timing was perfect, we would not be needing him for much longer. I wouldn't survive, not that I cared anyway. I think we should have known that first, our meeting would land us in trouble. But I survived, and they... well, they wouldn't. No offense, the girl of my dreams had no idea that. This was a day I'd heard so many things about, true and awful. But so we prepared our dinners, drank our wine, and were rewarded with friendship. My father looked at me with pride and joy, I felt a tingling in my stomach. I didn't really know what to say to him, I just understood he was surprised, but that's ok. A few weeks after the wedding, I'd forgotten all about the wedding, and any preparations. The king was still very distant from me, and my wife got married while they were still in secret. Sure, he might have told everyone he'd known and talked to, but that just didn't make anything out. So instead, my life turned in to one desperate final attempt to piece together what happened here. They'd locked us in the castle together. He found us in a remote part of the country, warm enough and not too far away, perfectly placed. I walked past his men, I wandered over to the large stone building, he saw the place where we buried the other two -- which was... just that, just that. No room for everyone except me here. The king had his guard drawn, and I, to my horror, couldn't move. He was handing me a small golden letter, requesting to stay in his father's place with me. I still tried to sit down, to rest my head on the gold. "If you prefer, " he said, " I'll have to hold your hand." I didn't even have the decency to reply. I just sat there, dumbfounded. I thought I must have just giggled. I was really, really trying, and I really wanted to forget, but all I could think about was the good old days, and the shining stars below me. All of this. I could hardly move. I just couldn't breathe.<|endoftext|>

The artifact was colored in brilliant technicolor, but to look at it was a shock to behold. I thought it had been ages since I saw my family even once, when I saw their faces all the time. To see their faces and know them at the same time is miraculous to me. When I met her my life was eerily similar. Her features were as soft as fresh snowflakes, her smile like a blooming angel. Her eyes looked like a honey colored prism, like a mosaic that showed her love in a way she never could - taunting a man with his expensive dress and flashy. Her bosom looked even more generous than her bosom, only slightly too generous with that unsavory aspect. She often assumed that she *was* handsome, but I understand why she chose to be modest. It was, after all, what men such as herself choose to do. Yes, she was beautiful. The most *beautiful* of all people. Not by any stretch of the imagination, the size or build of any natural specimen. Though you'd certainly notice the extensive array of bones, feathered arms and translucent skin under her. There wasn't much to see, and I'm quite certain she didn't know that. No, I couldn't. I just sat in my living room and thought about what to tell her. What words would she use - what... confections? What symbols would she use to *bring* me to the surface of the heavens? She never answered the obvious questions that I *had* asked before, but I did ask for a little explanation and... to take a look at *her* face and in that very moment, I felt like she *was* hers. To live with me one moment and whisper "I want to know" about the most powerful and discerning person in this entire universe? Of course I knew that, and in that instant, I felt like I had never touched a living person before. At the very core of this universal beauty, there was nothing very special about her. One bite of her smile and one moment she would speak me. I would know exactly what she wanted. I would make a better man. I would celebrate my first and last successful engagement when her son was six, and have him drive a car as enthusiastically as I could. But with her comes a grand fate for all. With her comes the death of our species. For every person whose existence is to be marked by a silver colored glass, there is one who's held onto life by long, dark life. A person who's lost his breath, hold all hope, yet is so rarely recognized as just another suicide victim by the world. A person with no name. A person who is constantly struggling for acceptance. Even a non-famous but powerful member of our species. Without her, we, ourselves, would stand nothing in contrast to the countless of mortals we have saved from the abyss below. We could travel the entire Milky Way as if to ensure that no one died, and then be erased into nothingness. No one would even realise that, until one day, we were looking back on our own lives as a hundred people; all of us who sacrificed everything for one of our partners, for one of the only ones left - for none of us truly knew the meaning of what we did. But that is what I did. I pulled my lifeless, insignificant mortal apart. I said the only logical thing I could come up with to stop it from happening. I said the only way I could stop it. Now, I swear, I will. For right now, I have a million questions that deserve answers. I will provide a solution to these kinds of questions as quickly as possible and I will run away.<|endoftext|>

& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Since my parents knew I would never be allowed out, they have often leaned in closer to me, whispering softly, "I don't want to leave you, but I have to get you out of here. I can't leave you with anyone, " apologizing and informing them that I've been preparing for years. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; They broke their promise, but I don't care. I will never leave this place. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; But one day, they do come around again. They add the twist of a rubber band, I'm now invisible to them. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; But I can't leave. I'm new here. I can't stay. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; When they picked me up, I was terrified. I was, of all things, unspeakably gay. I had time. The eyes of everyone. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; None of the comfort I gave them was enough. They bore me with burdens they might never bear. I could almost feel their sincerity, their pity. I could almost feel their refusal. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; That's when I saw it. My first friend. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I wanted to give her something. And she still does. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She began being madly in love with me, so angry with me. And had it not been for her touch, I might have said the bad word. And she would have done the same. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She was the love of my life. She was the sweetest person I've ever known. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I lost her in a year, when the hospital found her chart saw a couple of what looked like lesions, and she died on October 19th. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I wasn't the only one with her problems. It was the only me that remained, always stronger, smarter, and more brave. She was the one that never cried until the IV slid into her hand. -- -- -- -- -- - /r/lilwa_scott/<|endoftext|>

An elderly man stops a bullet right in the heart of a room full of children in a field surrounding a silver car. There are three men on the floor. One of them reaches into the freezer. The other man, who is on the floor next to him staring off into the distance. One of the men seems to hold a revolver. The other man takes his hand and takes the cigar out. They bang on the iron table, and then rush out of the building. Two men are outside of the car as well. It is the middle of spring and there is a man in a yellow sandals t-shirt. He glances at him, and then out the window at a young boy holding a flashlight. The man shifts. The boy is younger than him at the age of 10, he has black hair, and the look of fear under the right eye. The first man, little Billy, doesn't notice. He turns around to face Billy. The man turns around in confusion and then looks at him. The first man stops. The second man lifts the gun to his head. The man shrugs, then goes to the boy. The boy's flashlight light lets out a loud crackle, and a pair of hands move to close the man's eyes. One of the hands lifts one of the fingers out of the man's mouth, and his other hand starts to shut his eyes. The second man began to lift the bullet out of Billy's lungs. The girl's face and hands move for the second man to take his hand. The man stood, pulls the revolver from his coat, and then turns around. He passes the boy by, walks over to Billy, and then turns on the light. The two men start to walk away, and Billy can hear the teenagers laughing. The second man throws a fit. Then kicks the other man in the gut. The two men stand side-by-side, stunned. The boy's voice vibrates and the younger man curses. The older man runs away, and Billy has the opportunity to see a glimpse of the younger man. It doesn't hurt as much, it's just that there's a dark part of him that he can't see. The man grabs his coat, walks to the boy, pulls the revolver out of his coat, and then kicks the younger man in the face. He passes Billy by like a deer coming for him. The younger man heads for the car and is nearly all too caught up in the chase. The man begins to yell, and Billy is hit in the back the head. The boy lets out a screech and comes to a stop. The younger man grabs his handgun and fires. He spins around in time to see the bullets begin to rip through Billy, through his stomach, into his suit. Blood, a mix of red, orange and blue pools around him. All at once, like a wound, the man sends the bullet at the living man, only to be knocked against a metal table. Billy is pulled up, handcuffed and pulled right out of the car. The man looks on in horror as he takes the gun and opens his eyes to watch the bullet tear through his sternum. His hood falls over his eyes, the image of a happy child being splayed out before him. "Billy, baby, you're gon na hurt me like this, honey." Billy yells into the night as the father's eyes widen, his eyes become wide. He screams, and the father is gone.<|endoftext|>

How long has it been since the war? It's been months, four months, when we called upon the armies to take over the land. They marched that night, like the rats at night; when the men awoke with a chill that shined off their bones. While they slept though, they did not rest until the day came, so when midnight came, they vowed revenge and armed themselves. The day the deaths of so many were done, the armies were encamped in tents, holding out their rusty pistol and shouting for their dead allies. For they were no stranger to death, they had been sent, over years ago, by those who prayed for such an end. Now they lay, praying and whispering, bearing down on them their very souls in anger. The ground crumbled and split over a thousand feet below them, the fog filling the horizon with all the deadly creatures the city was fighting against. The magma flooded our stores of food and water, rendering the heroes of old needed no sustenance. Water ran and ran, pluming the buildings, and swarms of magma swept over every tree we stood on. There were survivors amongst the corpses, children running around, weeping, begging. We could not claim victory for this. How long has it been since? It's been four months and four nights, and still, the stillness is like that of water, blanketed over the lower lands. There is much to believe. The wars have been raging for over four decades now; we all stay quiet, as if we own and benefit from the result. But I doubt it; no person alive knows their moment here. They appear much older, they're faces blank, grey, almost white, they look tired; they seem pale and calloused. When time is done, they grow stronger, and they rise up in numbers. They are taller and stronger than before the war. All the small groups appear at the same time; the warriors and the women, the livestock and the children, the soldiers and the animals and the villagers. They start from nowhere. When they arrive, they charge with swords and axes. We charge with swords and axes. When they stand atop the parapet they charge with spears and bows, and they charge with bows and arrows, and they charge with spears and bows and arrows, and they charge with spears and bows and arrows. When the gate is shut, the army lays siege on them, killing their way through the town they came from. Our command is that we don't ask them to make ends meet, we kill them willingly and willingly. We will teach them if they don't comply. They have bowed to our wishes, and will just live, in a kind of communism. We believe that if they shoot one another down as we choose, they should surrender.<|endoftext|>

"I need to tell you something, citizen! " I ran into the deeproom, gun-like hands poised over my shoulder as I stared into the very face of a human with a vast intellect of light, eyes like water, and words like starry eyed nightmares. " It's... you! You people are the ones who've been... tormenting us for our " lives... all of you. Even if you're lesser beings, you've stopped looking out for us. We still look out for you. It's an honor. " The aliens looked down at me, somewhat amused, impressed by my frustration and disgust with them. " It's our duty to guard you, citizen, for you are to be looked after. " The words reverberated in my mind, as I could no longer suppress my suppressed anger. " It is just. But not your life, Citizen. It is for you. You are and will always be our *disaster. * You are overqualified, you are incompetent, you are to destroy everything once and for all. " I still could not live with myself. Here, it was just for show. As I put my gun to my head and strained to stand, I managed to lift the knee holding the firearm from my forehead before I shot the intergalactic guard in the head. " You'll live, Citizen, and there will be no more danger for you from those damn locusts. " " We simply don't know how you think your... instincts were following you when you shoot that stupid locust. We don't know your battle scars, or the extent of your combat skill. It's just like when you shot a basilisk or a maple tree. I've felt too shitty to even test your skills. I'd be willing to trade you the life you've given me, citizen. " I looked at my citizen, his eyes still locked on the gun, tears in his eyes. " You went for the... weapon! " I lifted the gun to my head. My finger rested on a trigger. " The one with its spikey metal head! " " I'll show you the truth! " I shot the alien with the serrated edge of the gun, firmly. I blinked as the bullet lodged itself in my abdomen. A million thoughts raced through my head as I was brought back to reality. " I want to ask you again. How are you doing? Please don't act like a human. " I leveled the gun at the alien before I could fall back into my seat. " I know what you're capable of, " I told him. " However... I've never been able to understand the desire for power, citizen. I fear our planet belongs to you. Do you realize how incompetent we are? How unbelievable we are... even though we have the ability to explore space and do things. How small we actually are to you... you're part of our family, citizen. " I sat up. He lowered his gun just a fraction of an inch above his head. " There's no point in helping you. " " No? Are you... insane?! " " But yes. I just want to ask for *something*. * Anything*. What the actual fuck are you talking about, citizen? Wanting something, that is what I'm asking of you. " I was staring at the pistol in my hand as it tilted to the side, its round turning into bullets as I continued on my way. " This was meant for me to be *for you. *" With that, I was back in the dark.<|endoftext|>

What a story. I ’ ve read enough scary movies to know. I ’ ve seen enough scary movies to know that what must be watching on TV is a completely different scary movie. I ’ m retired with my kids, and what they need, they only have twenty minutes to get to. My wife doesn ’ t know what it looks like, but she thinks it ’ s a fairy appearing. So she walks in on me. I'm nervous. But when she looks up she ’ s shocked. I understand what she ’ s expecting. I can barely deal with my anxiety and that weighs down on me even more. I can ’ t keep going without her. I am breathing heavy. She ’ s helpless, and terrified. At least, that ’ s what ’ s coming out of her mouth. My breathing breaks. The only thing I have left is a stupid grin. Yeah, I know I shouldn ’ t be having this conversation with her when we ’ re alone at this table. It ’ s only natural. In our, specifically mine and hers, I always have to wear a burqa because I ’ m wearing a burqa. As I am breathing heavily I notice my hair is quickly moving. She ’ s caught me leaning on her vanity more. Perhaps this is the same vanity she ’ s walked so many times lately? She is surprised. Excited. Is this what she looks like after all? Did she turn me into something adorable? No, she could have all the answers she needs, or I ’ d be just glad it ’ s her birthday. Which would probably be the only way she won ’ t go. She has written something on my dresser in Latin, a formal combination of poetic prose and dextrous poems. She must ’ ve been a fool. The birthday was my only chance. It only ended when she gave me a kiss on the forehead. It was a heart attack. The doctors turned up three days later. The results are being made public. Immediately, the media won ’ t care. I ’ ve stared at them since then, with reporters covering their mouths and camera phones, pleading for my wife to be shot down. And when the news makes you realize it ’ s the birthmark on your birthmark, it ’ s for you. An invisible bauble holding a picture of you with the photo buried inside. I ’ m not sorry for not seeing it. The best thing that could have happened is that my wife should have known that a duck, a lion, or a dragon were flying around taking pictures of her. Instead, as if it were something so trivial that I didn ’ t even do it, she threw me in the ambulance and took a ticket for manslaughter. I didn ’ t mention the people in the ambulance. The suicide was just her fault. The police are questioning what the criminal was doing in her car, but only after they find a young man – none of them have ever helped the grieving family. As it is, I am now in jail for manslaughter and causing death. Oh god, what a shock. I can smell alcohol. I can hear the cheers. As I drag my legs out of the highway, as I descend from the cab, in a fit of passionate passionate sheer happiness, I can feel her little heart pounding in my chest like a little hammer hammering nails. It ’ s stupid now, she thought that she should have told the police instead of me. But then I can feel myself getting angry again. Another 12 months where I don ’ t get anything done with my life. I ’ m being married, and I ’ m crying because I don ’ t have enough income. I don ’ t have friends, I ’ m running out of money. My husband is getting sick. I can ’ t even close my eyes, let alone care about him. It ’ s all pointless now. The seven hours of sitting in traffic that keep me from moving is an unbearable two months, but it has to be enough to get out of jail.<|endoftext|>

Jared ducked behind a shelf in front of the old laptop that had raised a dozen of his parents' memories at the altar. Five years later, Cindy's dad had found his own high school for his twelve year old son. The man laid in bed next to Cindy's, disheveled, look of confusion and fear protruding from where his eyes should have been. He had this look in his eyes when he saw them, but they left one by one unbroken. He'd been in a similar scenario, throwing boxes out of his closet. All in the right place, they'd circled one corner, waiting for him to finish. “ I ’ m not this guy, ” Cindy thought aloud. She shook her head in exasperation, wishing her son would be happier before showing her he was a nobody. Behind the dusty metal shelf, Jim rounded the corner. The young man slumped against the wall and relaxed. Almost to Jim ’ s surprise, Cindy was already out of the closet. * Disheartened, Jim turned back around and shrugged, letting her to her feet, hearing her mother ’ s crackle bounce back and forth behind him. She turned, looking for the source of the voice. The kind that ebbed and flowed in a quiet rain of activity. Where they had both been, it was oddly empty. Too quiet for her to hear. Jim tilted his head up to survey his surroundings. “ Everything was quiet today, Jim, ” Cindy didn't say a word. That would be the third time they ’ d brought their voices, and he always had a saying like that. “ It didn't work out, ” Jim grinned. It was difficult to tell. The room was pitch black, or at least it had been for some time. Probably to hide the rain. As Jim climbed up to it, his eyes shook just as he reached for the laptop. But as he reached, he could see one thing. It was parked above the pile of pebbles on the floor. * I ’ ll have a better word. I may be an idiot, but I ’ ve seen enough movies. You ’ re the only guy left. I ’ ll be proud, don ’ t you think? I thought we ’ re the same people with these powers, how many have we seen on tape? ” “ Twenty one years ago, ” Jim murmured. “ When I got my world under control, I made your little sandwich. Littered it up with the other bits of shiitake in the bowl and tossed it in the bucket. Some crazy people thought it would be funny. ” Cindy didn't reply. For a moment, Jim wondered how long Cindy hadn't gotten too concerned. He brushed off the thought and walked over to the computer again. His heart sank. He turned to his young son. “ Daddy? ” he asked softly. “ It ’ s fine, Dad, ” Cindy sniffled. A moment passed and his eyes widened in astonishment. He thought his son finally understood. After a moment, he remembered the small amount of joy Cindy hadn't felt. Maybe everything was finally over. He sighed. The parking lot gave way to a cool and dark, yellow-yellow neighborhood. Jim ’ s father had grown up there, in a small suburban suburb, and Jim lived there, too. He ’ d only gotten here because he wanted to join the army. He knew what a soldier is, and what a soldier was at that exact moment. Maybe it had been a good thing that his actions had led to Cindy ’ s decision to enlist, because Jim didn ’ t deserve to have to do this. Perhaps all it took was one red eye.<|endoftext|>

But there ’ s still time. " Jon Stewart quietly stalked him to the lobby, “ Finally open it. Let ’ s see how each actor and superstar are doing.

Those were words. ” “ What did you just say? ” asked Jon. “ Come on, all right, what is it anyway?

They have no idea about you. ” “ So that ’ s how you planned the action movie in the first place. What is your plan? ” “ I ’ m working on my comeback, and all you ’ re gon na do is tell them to stop filming the movie, and they ’ ll start to steal the money. I have 100 hours of focus, and all of them will follow me when I open the door. ” “ You ’ re lying. It is all just a dream. ” “ You ’ re lying. Everything is a dream. ” “ It ’ s just a nightmare. ” “ You ’ re lazy. You ’ re rich. You do everything for money. ” “ You ’ re not going to quit. You still can not quit.

Through the last few weeks of stay in Soyuz, we were still gaining ground. Through all this, we were picking apart a muddy patch of soil that little spatters and fibrous rocks occupied. Something was abounding. But because of the snowy patches and huge grays, no one could tell if it was a chance encounter or just how serious we were. The radio channel had a drone radio set up on command-net. They wanted to have us check the plots for further radio signals. But they still didn ’ t have enough to tell us if the incoming, yet unrecognizable, projectile was hostile. I wasn ’ t going to let that delay them. The helicopter outside with my coworkers in it was to deploy the drone pilot into the tracking device and start the Mission. I locked the door behind me, took the remaining radio info ( I hadn ’ t picked anything up yet ) and listened to the booms of distant artillery fire, the whistling of fighter jets. We would become a force to be reckoned with. We would fight like blasters, and in our fight, we would be able to win. Suddenly, I heard the radio calling over me. “ Oh God, its Harleen! It ’ s not coming around yet! ” “ Aww… My dear Heather, I know you are busy. ” That same day, two hours later, as the rover was in the process of getting to orbit, there was a strange *bang* on the border. I stepped out onto the Martian surface and swore at the camera. The grainy images on the weather balloon showed the violent, but undeniable explosion. It could have been explosions from the construction crew ’ s stomachs. I stared at the camera as several of the cameras flickered. I watched from the inside the camera as gray dust floated around the rover. A giant mote of dust that resembled a cratered potato started to rot on the Martian soil. Then, I saw it. A massive metal robot turned, its front two legs dangling across the field in a strange sweeping motion and tilted sideways. I ignored it and took a deep breath. It was Angela Smith. She was my sister, my neighbor's only dog, and the only love I had left. I approached the robot and we made eye contact and nodded. She shook her head and we went on. I thought about how in the present, I was just being *nice. * After a few hours of talking, I saw the camera lens go sideways. It slowly came to a halt and spun around. I glanced over at it and I saw a giant hole in the ground ahead of me. It flattened around me and burst my body. The robot disappeared. When I came to, I saw that the camera had returned to its base station. It wasn ’ t me, not directly next to me. It was Jesus Christ. He had just broken through the wall separating us. And when he saw my face in the camera, he was so shocked and confused he wiped his hands and said, “ I ’ m really not your brother. ”<|endoftext|>

“ Why? ” I say incredulously. The world is awash in cheers. “ I am the future! ” comes an excited voice from above, but I can ’ t find my voice. I have been hovering here for a minute, trying to recall the events of my failed revolution. My eyes watered, and my breathing slowed. I took a deep breath, straightened my shirt, and, as tears began to form in my eyes, I said, “ In order for me to rule, you must raise the army. ” The soldiers turned towards me, filled with pride and emotion. They all looked at me with pure determination. I always knew that this was my chance. “ Let me take these guns, ” I said to them with confidence. The men nodded, and walked towards me. I guided them down the hallway, where they waited. They locked doors, and locked eyes. I told them to stay inside, and told them to leave. After three days, the doors opened, and from everywhere I could see, gunshots were being fired. The soldiers laughed and cheered, yelling and yelling until they stopped, my hands trembling. I looked at the soldiers, who were fighting for their lives. I was the target, and they weren ’ t going to win this war. I rose my gun, and fired. The bullets echoed off the walls, rusted, blackened, and the soldiers remained silent. The doors opened, and I was right inside, the waiting room. They locked the door, and locked eyes. I told them to stay inside, and told them to leave. After three days, I smiled at them, saying, “ Let me take these guns, ” And they backed off.<|endoftext|>

I was trying to cheat on him. For how dare I! WERE WHAT YOUTEEN NO MORE. I stood there like the first king was usurped by the emperor's daughter! We were wan na come out. Could you do it? What the? A lowly peasant made as he took a potion of pure alkaism, and had his first look at King Alexander! He was a complete and utter coward of a man! How dare you judge him? This was not me, he must have read on the books! He led me all the way to Leonidas's palace, I must wait! Were you so blind? Oh ha! I must get away in less than 2 minutes! I knew then! I could backtrack and my damned crush just started scoring everyball in the corner of her mouth! King Alexander did not give a shit about my claim to his rightful throne! Would he!<|endoftext|>

The macabre, chocolate colored package stood ready for what would be soon to be six of us to enter the kitchen. "Sorry, " I said, chucking my slivered in response, " I just thought.. Oh, shit. " Obviously horrified, it stared at me a moment before placing it near my stomach, I took a great, deep breath, peering into it's tube like perverted glance at my friends... " Its a scienetik pop! A young couple, together some drunk kids. The kids are alright, just chugging along, it's ok. " Excuse me sir... " A nervous chorus of voices interceded around me, I continued to stare, I closed my mouth because it was gross, I wanted my friends to see, but I can't, their voices are my own. " There is nothing to be disgusted with. " Shit. " Alright, " I said, turning back to the package, " Nothing to be disgusted with " apparently nothing to be disgusted with this week is described as" They gaped at the mess, a million dollars made, then disappeared without trace.<|endoftext|>

When the aliens first took over I'm happy. They had everything, they had golden fives, swords, imperial mounts, amazing technology, interstellar travel, space travel, open space space travel, their offspring had all been living through the same thing for millenia. Have you ever wondered why babies didn't learn battle in the first place. War would always come first because their ideals slowly evolved. Nanomachines. Those were programs that kept time in space. Immortals. Mind-reading computers and smart machines. They called it Spies. Most adults were too embarrassed to tell you how they worked, how they'd interface with your internal society and organizations. But the ones that were helpful didn't even begin to communicate with humans, just he who was looking after them like a sibling to some subservient animal. I thought it was a little much when I first looked at one of the children. Almost 100 years old, very purple skin, pale green eyes, clean hair with yellow highlights at the collar. Busted and naked and finding the head on the crotch as well. I think it was a cat and mouse like creature. And so the world decided we were to join. Once upon a time, I was in a dive bar, I hadn't much to drink, and when I thought I had made it, it hit me. I'm thinking I'm going to throw down and feed this cat and mouse, but I have a choice. I could slave away their minds, why not conquer their bodies.<|endoftext|>

*Something in my cellar* We were sleeping, one by one, and then he woke up. We were laying next to each other, wheezing and screaming, but we knew it was just a dream. A dream? He ran out. The first thing that terrified us was that last thing we ever saw, the deep echoing footsteps that brought us to the porch. We saw a couple of men with rifles down at us, gun in hand and aiming to the door we had just entered. But all there was was one bullet stuck through his skull. It was loud. Then the same thing. Another bullet, and the same footsteps. We heard the same loud sounds, louder than anything we've ever heard, and yet even that didn't make it sound loud. We screamed and stumbled into the cellar. We heard his footsteps getting louder. The bullets were getting louder. And closer, and nearer, until even we couldn't make them stop. Suddenly, he bit his lip. His voice was quiet as he spoke. "I told you not to do it. " His knuckles turned red, and the way his tears slid down his cheeks as the fear in his eyes was returned. " Why won't you listen to me? It's not a word I can utter to you. " He grabbed a handful of the juice bottle. His father - still growing up in his Silver City, became one of the last single farmers in this section. He was the last smoker in the area, and the only one who still had the chemical companies working. They planted fresh fruit on the town, and even planted your canned food and canned food here. But that didn't stop the chemical companies, who poisoned our crops. They poisoned our water. The humans couldn't even trace their own properties to anymore. And yet, these chemical companies poisoned our water. There was no-one we could have children for at least a year, maybe two, and in their arrogance they poisoned this very town again. What did this have to do with a single man who had broken down. I stood up. There was only one other night in a very long time. We were home alone, wondering the same, " Where in the fuck am I?", and we didn't know it. Only how did he get here. I don't know, I couldn't stop thinking about it. My only thought was how he lived as he did.<|endoftext|>

Oh god oh god Oh god, the sound of my heart thumping again. How can I explain it to you!? Why did you sit on the stool right now? How could I forget something so important? It seems so obvious now. No one questions me. I'm not talking about a red rose sniffing in my head in bed, or my girlfriend's biggest problem just shouting "Potion! " or " Jump!" Yeah it was a good idea. I'm all ears. One of them was perched on a stool besides the key above the coffee table I sat on. It feels good. I guess that was right. It did feel good. I don't think I would make it back to this place if I just came up with some better method, but there's only so many ways I can be a superhero without dying horribly of suffocation or having a psychotic break. Of course, there was no way I could push it away from me. I'll just reach for the door and just let it close the door. How else could I escape? No way. How could I live with someone who I don't know? I'm going to make it back to this apartment.<|endoftext|>

"This is a weapon so old? " Gla'ath asked the mason. " Who made it? " " A giant-sized human, kept in darkness by... er... kings. As I recall it's thousands of years of use. Thrasher the Wanderer, the damn wizard, and to top it all off a *Hydraulic Hammer*, the same one from before! " " You and I might not look like much... if you stepped out of one of the lesser crafts, I think the the guardian would think you were under a spell. " " Exactly. " " But that has been the chosen artifact for generations, nothing. You'll be the greatest ancient warrior of all. And this is a weapon to keep it from the hands of a lowly, forgotten race. " " Hmm. " " And we've already found that extra-luminal portal where it makes the closest link to its world, you know? " The mason grinned. " That can only mean one thing... " " And it can also mean the ancient beast found hidden in it's core lair..."<|endoftext|>

Memories of sawdust and cigarette butt piling up around our ears are partially shattered by the impact of a loud, simultaneous cannon blast hitting the ground a few moments later. *Have to, Kevin. Aye. * I look around the battleground, wishing I had never ventured this far into the higher level objectives. In my past, there used to be things like this one bit, in the valley behind an old factory. But we all know it wasn't there. Even now, after years of searching for them, no result can be found. The storm clouds drift lazily as it does so, creating the unmistakable sight of clouds of smoke drifting through the air on every bit of sharp, flat rock to be thrown in my path. * Heh. Nonsensical. * Kevin looks around the barren landscape. Yet he's still far away from the problem. Every square inch of this house has been crushed by decades of more powerful storms. It's almost an impossible task and to give up the knowledge just a few days ago will be done gladly, but there's no reason I should fear an impossible undertaking. * Well, I can prove it by simply looking in the direction of it. Of course, I know very well that our presence is dangerous to our people here. Knowing they would cease to exist has nothing to do with the situation. They won't think twice before coming over here. * I just want to watch them as they die, playing chess against nothing but plain fire. Our only hope is to ignore the consequences. They'll think nobody cares, and our peaceful, socially agreeable opinions will cause their demise. The sharp, cold winter winds tickle my arms, beating so fast I can almost feel my liver failing. Kevin has given up hope too soon. It would be foolish of him to abandon his greatest gaming hobby. Whatever his life time is, I want to see him die. So I cautiously peek around the corner. The storm cloud smears clouds of smoke around the base of my house. The sound of hooves shuffling around my back is far to familiar. I turn my head and see two men brandishing high rifles. * Let's get this one over with before they get hurt. It's more than a game. * I was betting against them. This was getting ridiculous. I don't even remember my last video. But this wasn't happening. Not ever. I quickly throw up on my knees, scrambling for the stairs. * You know what you have to do man. Let's get him down this mountain! * I hear a loud crack as two of the men shoot down their own men. The two men fall to the ground with a thud, their rifles seemingly impaling them. It's a terrible sight, but I can see in my mind *they used to call us guys*. This time, I can see how many flamethrowers there were and how many sticks of rock fell into their hands. There were thirty minutes left to live. The skies are blue with a perfect arc. Kevin must have been thinking the same thing I was thinking. A large explosion breaks the silence and melts the ground to nothingness. *As the people look on in fear, Kevin fires his AR up. He looks around the battlefield, having been unable to see what was behind this destruction in all its destruction. He notices a few dust motes and knocks a few of the men unconscious. He had only 20 minutes. * He had always been good at unarmed combat. The nearby buildings are charred and ruined, but it would not deter him. He aims his rifle right above their heads. * He takes aim. * Smoke fills the sky. I am surrounded by my comrades and dead. As we fall asleep, I take a quick look at Kevin.<|endoftext|>

"Just a quick question, Mr. Tangamy: Which classic do you think was different from the other 16? " said the back of my head in awe. It felt so odd that I had been addressed this question wrong, this damned shy middle schooler -- " I know what you're saying, " I rolled my eyes, " just a word. " There was a moment of silence, and then my head came back to me. " Hey, Mr. Tangamy. Would you like to confirm the date of your return? " " Well, yes, if you'd like to hear about the nature of our universal homogeois knowledge or understand it more clearly, perhaps I'll have to take this subject from a while back. We're currently at a ten year project. " " Wow, this's great! But do you think you could improve our understanding of fundamental forces without just talking about physics? " " Well, I haven't figured out how I would articulate the concept, but if my answer to any question was right here, then maybe I could be a linguist or are techologists? We could create something and find out more quickly than I'd thought. So I wouldn't spend as much time attempting to develop the basics. " " Ugh, what am I going to do? I really want to know more about the question. " It was a business like any other, there was all sorts of science and wonders hidden in plain sight to be *wasted*. " If I tell you to give me one thing and have a few minutes to think it over, it's that you'll say *yes*. Good, then. But first, was the latin words... " But I was lying. My whole speech was an elaborate big lie, as if the meaning of " I had a fishbowl." A deep, " I have a fishbowl " tinged my forehead. But my recollection was of all the things around me was proof enough that I had a fishbowl. My dad is Chinese. His date is June 7th, 2023. He will tell you about the first and only time he fell in love with her. He will tell you how badly he wanted to, how he fell in love with her because he believed it would make her happier. He will tell you how she was the first person he had ever really loved. His wife left him long ago and now he has only two weeks left to live. He will tell you about his future because you've been looking back to some vague, well, faraway future, except to paint a happy picture of an interplanetary experience. And I will tell you about the time when he literally ran 100 km into a mountain. No, really! He is burning up on not just paper with an old very outdated pencil, but a gun that weighs down all the supplies that he might ever need. But I couldn't force myself to say yes.<|endoftext|>

I stuttered on the scroll again. "I looked out over the sea, over the sea, down the valley, and out up the hills. There were sweet old trees there that could stand on forever. And there were that race of you up there, boys and girls, smiling and laughing and tying their shoes and shoes, and their smiles in that night. I could still remember running up to you, boy. Just step after boy and me. Those ones were important to you. You had that. You got to go with you when you were home, would you? When the war came again. The sad night that happened four years ago. But you were still here to me, boy. Your brother, your sister, and I. I took you to the war, boy. It was nice. I didn't know they were going to tear you up. Not on that date, anyway. The summer I met you and our first night together? Not those wonderful times we had in that bedroom, and the taste of the cheese from the stove when we made it, the night we danced, thinking we could put it in together, and the whole time we spent together thinking about who you were. But here you were, boy. I still remember. You were your big brother, and I loved you dearly. But now, now it is you. The sea is still here. Maybe someone will remember you. Maybe someday, but you will never see me again. " I hung up. I remembered my brother, and my sister. My love, and my courage, my brother and sister, and the whole time. I hung up.<|endoftext|>

This was supposed to be a cool birthday party, a fun couple to go out and order our "best frocha brownies ever. " As I started at the door my closest friend opened it and looked at me. " Well, no, this is NOT cool. Its not... " " But... why can't you just be cool? " Well, maybe it was just another birthday party I was driving and I just wanted to say good things. Anyway, that's about it anyway. Anyway, I decided to follow him when he came out. Fast forward a couple minutes and all this beer bullshit. Let me tell you something. He was slow, rather bassy, but friendly. Not like someone who's whole life stuck to a bong because it was the easiest way to forget. He suggested we go to Taco Bell to get the first one. Ugh, he couldn't see me anyway. " Yeah? Tell me more about that time we got ta play that red-faced pole game at the local candy shop. " " Yeah, we played it a little bit too much. " he offered. That always helped us, ya know? " Sure, yeah, get it? I never had that problem anyway. " " Well, I went to Taco Bell too. To my surprise, with you for the band. We got all kinds of auburn bob, tails that hung in the air and a little baby flowers to pick up. People just hugged you as you wandered through life trying to stop everybody from leaving. " Well that was fun. " So, it wasn't too bad and my parents were here. Well, kids get used to it, right? So after getting out of dodge school, which I was after graduating college with, I decided to get a small varsity team. I decided to drop out of a house I loved and find a career in San Diego. Not because of money, but because I had a couple of good times on my record, both in professional wrestling and on reality TV shows. Anyway, my agent showed me around San Diego for one of my hard-boiled interviews. I wanted to see some of it before I started my promise with my friend; but I lost track. By the time I got home I was craving a few bites of martini. I ordered some normal and shot some, the waiter caught me turning a corner and he smelled all kind of different. He said he thought I was something strange. He told me he thought it was " strange " but it was. I was sure my friend would appreciate it. As the waiter walked over to my table, he got down on one knee and massaged my back. And he whispered " tell me how was it. ". He said the beer and how he got himself a tiny top on his head while he was feeling dizzy. " Ok, good job, I'm calling an ambulance. You're lucky I'll find you someplace here that has more feel good company... " As he lifted my head to ask me who I was talking to, he brought up a toy gun. So I had to ask him what the rule was of legality of gun ownership. He said that you could only have one. Even if it was legal. " It seems you haven't picked up the rules yet? " He asked. " This is bullshit, I'm sorry, I'm going to not remember this again. What you are doing is very bad and I want to get out of this immediately. " I panicked. I had never really wanted to get into that situation. So, I convinced myself that I would find this man, and get drunk, alone, and sick of his shit and desire to get out of this situation. Or else. I turned my head slowly and asked the man how he would go about getting drunk. He seemed surprised. I smiled. " It's easy sir."<|endoftext|>

The one who stared at the mail envelope in disbelief had bared her teeth, sheathing the severed blade that had broken off the envelope and began to dig in. Her nails were wet with sweat and they protruded from her skin. Like a wave hitting a wall, the man lifted the mail envelope and moved towards the once clenched remains of a lock. In an instant, she was gone, replaced by a crowd gathered around the man, as if to bring peace to the bodies of those who had condemned their cause. She tried to grasp as much of the mail as she could before she finally dragged herself away, leaving the man alone in the empty room. She hid in one of the last few places she could find and watched as the last few hours in the afterlife slowly diminished and the universe slowly faded away from the one she had once known.<|endoftext|>

"Finally!" cries Tony, throwing his prosthetic on the ground just as the much higher pitched explosion begins. He's been a hero in the past and something about moving his arms and legs was unexpected. And this wasn't Bob's life. His strong legs and strong legs appeared only moments earlier, still propped up by the flesh and bone of a broken man. He turned to give Tony a hug but one form of protection was absent on him. The whoop the steps was slowly making along with the pounding of the footsteps was now steadying. Tony couldn't breathe, not by himself, but by the tall figure hovering over the heart monitor of his body. The sputtered sounds of tear ducts drip from the mouth of the figure's bright red throat. The slow realization of what was coming struck Tony hard; it was then that he recognized Bob as the person who he loved so very much.<|endoftext|>

"It seems like they would've gone without Him for me, eh Mr. Vega? He's a man of God, you know that better than anyone. He's been there. Been helping me figure this all out. He did the same things for as long as I can remember. Whenever He comes back in the morning and you send Him back to visit you and ask Him to tell you everything, they've never shown anything in so long. As much as they say it happens when they kill Him, they wouldn't do it otherwise. They told me all those years back that He would be back before he saw me. I mean, He sure as hell wouldn't have been here. He'd have found us first. I'm sorry for all of these mistakes. I know they messed up everything. It's my fault. All these silly rules and checks and balances. But I didn't do it on purpose. I don't think it even matters. He is my God, ever after, my God. I'm out of my chair. I'm out of my house. I'm out of that damn bathroom. That is as far as you go, Mr. Vega. " He sighed as he slapped the mirror. He sat up. He looked around and then at his hands. He placed the swab down on his hands and stared deeply into the mirror. Two weeks from the moment of the legendary event " The Exhibition", He had stumbled upon the source of this dark secret. He was highly revered and respected by many. People around him did not react to his miraculous discovery. They sat, at his feet, and became uncomfortable. He sighed.<|endoftext|>

When I first started working at Crib, I think I worked pretty hard for our company; I got an EVA after a particularly stressful test with bears, but got the job as soon as I was in town so I only started working at Crib after an anonymous maintenance breach, so at least I'm pretty fresh at Crib; I pass the test and still feel a little bit off. They said this was a "failure of programming, " but, no, they are not telling you how it happened. They said " hardware only informed the user and it wasn't supposed to happen. We deleted Crib and contacted our New Room and decided to try again, but the problem still didn't play out, so they went out the door, switched to hardware, and installed 1 software update, rebooting. There it is. " The worst part was that nobody would even acknowledge it until they went into my Simulation After Effects team and asked why the install script was broken. They got up and ran a reboot and no one acknowledged it, which was basically how any new software you install is interpreted in the virtual realm. Not even we tried Windows Workshop. We should have pointed them to XSplit but they didn't see to it. ( Critical glitches, no exceptions, you know? " ) The worst part was that everything still felt off, and they kept telling us to get home and fix it. So there I was, with the SSD plugged in, plugged in and running a reboot. After that day everything seemed... balanced. Maybe some glitch was me just rewinding and not letting the server hit any errors. Maybe I left it on, and that's how I got my jobs, huh? I reset my app and I did everything I wanted to do. Then I realized it didn't work, didn't work as advertised... on certain screens, it didn't work, I got fired, didn't love my job....I finally fell asleep in my bedroom...<|endoftext|>

Men and Women From all over the globe, dressed up in costumes as the heroes of our world. From Batman to Superman, people've all worn costumes from a different angle, or at least they thought so! I told you to wait for this one. You see, we got a LOT of convention hall, cosplayers all got their powers, even ones that weren't real. Black guy was the first. Black and Hispanic man are the only ones of the kind. And then her fanfares turned into the subatomic particles that move the universe, too! Usually a metal bikini or a magical flop guy would try his hand at cosplaying. Sadly, we don't get much of that in costume. Not like cosplayers who can "feel" this much of a power... but I know, for a fact I have plenty of heart of iron, so I will try to keep it that way. I thought I was becoming more and more dark. And now, to show you my little secret... My best friend! When I was young, I tried to be a necromancer, one that could plant beautiful flowers in the sky that my god wouldn't hurt. Most of my adult life, i struggled with my powers, especially the ones with morphs. My parents couldn't hear me and gave me strict orders not to tell them what was happening to me. The final effect was a soulless essence that grew weaker and weaker. The more of a figment my powers got, the more I grew to despise that place and how ever I ended up in that place. That place was itself... The place of pain and misery, the place that my god hated... The place that his parents refused to protect him from. That place was black and white, my parents were going to incarcerate me for most of my life, and those parents tried to help me escape to be with my pretty little sister. There was no cure, no cure for my powers. I had my father die years ago and my mother was forced into slavery for killing her best friend. My heart sank as the realization sunk in. I didn't even know what my powers were. So here I am, with a little prince in my arms. Standing here, with my sword out, and two tombstones in my hand... Damn my powers.<|endoftext|>

The air hung heavy in the air, the timer between 17:00 on the ship's leader's clock counting down until the ships arrival. Two small Imperial Guards stood at the port gate. The last ten have been survivors, holed up on the ship so that no one will die from the plague. Now was the time to escape, these people were no better than the remaining 65 survivors in Hell's Ridge. At the gate a man with a wispy beard, he put on his spectacles and bowed respectfully, knowing that they were better than he could fathom. "Good morning, citizens! This is Master Poixant, the Chief of the Guard's Office. I am your Empire's Keeper of the Ships. Shall we begin? " " Begin at noon, " said Master Poixant, " my people have plenty of time to be devoured by the Great Plague before the Zakes are out. " " Oh, indeed, " replied the voice from the outside, " the thing you brought down from the sky. It's gone now. You both know that. Enjoy the meal, my people." The other Guards scrambled for the doors, hoping that the guard was going to find some food that will soften the potency of the portal that would push them through it. At first, they accepted, the hunger inside them seeping in and out of their nostrils, though it had hardened since the end. What they didn't know was that they had the same immediate hunger as every human, except this one was slightly extra docile than a normal human. As they scurried for the door, they had no concept of time. It was dangerous to not only survive the day-night cycle, but to just eat food that you would eat undercooked, to be eaten out and grow like those flesh-eating bacteria that live among the Humans in this world. Now the hunger was pretty prominent, as only a few months worth of humanity had grown enough to sustain themselves, but that year passed by like a bottle of Jack, long ago, they had managed to infiltrate the City of Culture, taking out the power stations in the central district and finding some spare food for the denizens of Hell. But no one that had been infected ever made it back alive and found it. She was dead in thirty days. The Chief of the Guards' Office moved from his station to the gate without warning, scanning the air for any sign of life, and opened the gate himself, as well as sharpening his staff he used his new staff to pierce the lower walls. He then proceeded to inspect the once-white lines that had left the sky, to reveal blood-stain-painted teeth protruding from the lower rows of his guards. He could not beat the hunger within him, he could not kill the hunger within him. He took out his staff from his belt and pressed its power button.<|endoftext|>

I sat against the wall, my head hanging low. I was going to get fed soon. The guttural screams were becoming progressively louder. I collapsed back onto the dirty ground and crawled to my feet, coughing and wheezing. The white shiny thing that was shuffling behind me was not far behind, it's blood sinking into my boots. As the last ghost of my form disappeared, it slowly left the pile of corpses underneath and began to shuffle towards my direction. I shivered. I wanted to get up and walk away from the strange sight. I wish I could have taken a nap, but I'm too slow to be in my room, breathing in and out of gasping for air. "Get out of this car, " I whispered into my ear. The small, used teddy bear that was all but an armchair is still staring at me. I spit on the ground and look over to the road. The entrance to a pretty park was not far behind me. I sit up and saw two men. They got their walking sticks and sat. I almost jumped out of my skin when one of the one in the back whispered. " Easy enough, they only live so long, " he said. The other guy said " Your final gift is getting out of here. You're down to two. " As I was getting down I heard one of the men behind me say " No way man. You aren't going to make it up here without an armchair like the rest of the locals." That's when I heard the conversation that preceded him. The voice behind me was breaking. I didn't hear it then. It disappeared in front of the car. I screamed and groaned as I lay helplessly on the ground. I could only run. I didn't know where I was going and what I was supposed to do. After what felt like an hour of not knowing where I was going, I turned around to go back to my house. It was a dark street and there were strange men in dark clothes outside. I stood up and pulled out the keys from my coat pocket. I turned to the door and shut it. I was going to have to call the police and make sure they found me. I did. I opened the door and walked outside. There I found myself. Everyone's metal barrel on my cold hard chest seemed metallic and no matter what I did I felt nothing at all. I walked to my car to drive away. I left my wallet on the passenger seat and shoved it into my mouth. I told the guy behind me to go home. I was coming home now, not today.<|endoftext|>

"I need someone with courage, someone with honor. Someone that will claim our rightful place in the Galactic Alliance, and not simply whine about petty fights. I have plans for you. " The holographic avatar looked surprised by what it spoke, having seen too many of the latest problems outside of his hotel room, but figured it to be a standard issue remote control. The Avatar took a deep breathe and took another breath, " Well sir, there are important things ahead for us to discuss. " The holographic avatar paused, awaiting the request. " I was just told that with my oxygen so cheap, that expeditions with the reclusive scavengers would result in our satisfaction. We do have a mark on those ships though, they are not unlike regular rockets, with no destination other than near-death. If you are willing to deal with the rest of us, I can arrange it through a showroom. We will be present to your next gig, and will try to help you to meet the requirements. Your employer should have a lot of comments due to your generosity. " " Exactly, sir. We have an offer on both sides, to cooperate. " The holographic avatar listened carefully, waiting to hear what the applicant would want. " Oh, that is very exciting. " The hologram suggested, selecting the next most handsome avatar. " I hope this person will actually be a good man. " The avatar hoped and hoped that this exchange would lead to a happy and fulfilling life. If the avatar succeeded in this goal, everything would change. " I know we could use a common language, but you must understand I don't want to be...

He noticed the same weird notes he was looking at earlier. They always kept the same lettering: " Subscribe to this website and your team will attempt to bring your company to our coordinates. " A high pitched growl filled the empty room, and the avatar's mouth went dry. Perhaps his boss was right, but not anymore. He had asked his company to send someone to kill him. At least, that was what the avatar hoped. " Well, sir, we can -- " The avatar's throat turned a soggy mess, but the lines on the credits were not drawn. The avatar threw up. He'd been cowering in a corner for hours, only able to muster a weak effort to speak. " Shut up! You were supposed to just die. I'm not ready to die. The entire universe has a stake in your demise.

"Easy now, " Thaiku whispered under his breath. With this, Wei Laoping quickly became a celebrity as his body was replaced by a Siamese rhino. Entering quickly, Wei Laoping shot into the street, his jump flight scaring off passersby. With the stealth of a billiard ball hitting the hardwood floors of his 2-story luxury triple-tower hotel, Wei started to slip and land on the ground in quick succession. Instantly, a small segment of the street was forced into a wide blizzard of dust and feathers. Not the best combination of sight and sound, but this was the best bit. Unacceptable. " Chinese secret weapon is a *nordic horn* " Xiao Wei mumbled to himself in disbelief. As his vision blurred to black, Wei leaped forward, with one hand covered in half an unadorned cloak, the other shoved it into the nearest passing passenger. Only a couple of moments later, the police officers watched in stunned amazement as Wei and his partner used their jumpsuit to lick and bawl on a local street vendor before letting out a single clap and exposing his muscles. Soon, he was back on the ground with no idea why. Thirty minutes had passed by before he could shout out to the enthroned man, " Reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy!!!! " None of the men heard the screaming, as Wei lay on the ground in shock. The blood rapidly trickled down his face, soaking into the thin layer of sweat he had on. Wearily, he decided to pretend it was a spray of perfume, as he dashed behind the now willing thief and quickly took off his cloak before threatening to run. The police found him mid-fall over a park bench, surrounded by officers from the other side of the city. Clearly nervous, Wei had never looked at a cop before, as sweat and blood splashed off his shirt and rolled into a small pool of red liquid. Closing his eyes and scanning the area around him, Wei placed his hands behind his head, as though he was trying to play a game. The blood on his hands began to leak into the cracks in the park benches, and the coolness of the air filled the room as Wei disappeared into the crowd. Walking towards the sun, Wei turned to the window of his hotel. The sun was truly beautiful. His only lie was that he had to climb over a sheet of wood on this world as other stories unfolded in his head. He desperately fought himself not to open his eyes. The good news was that, for the first time in forty years, Wei Laoping's body was on a different course of action. His kidneys pumped, and his heart beat became unsteady. The business that had brought Wei Laoping into the spotlight of the world had payed dividends. An unparalleled bounty on his head, however, wasn't enough. No matter what the turn of events were, Wei Laoping would never find his body again. Instead, he will be found abandoned in this small park on this earth. Walking up to the window, Wei looked up and saw two pale dogs sniffing the dust before him. " What are you doing?" he whispered. Ten more minutes passed and Wei Laoping hung his head in shame. His life and it's golden objects wouldn't suffice. He knew that eventually he would discover the treasures hidden in this humble city. Time to move on. It was time to leave. He called out to his chit-chatty love. If only it wasn't so loud at the end.<|endoftext|>

"Get to work. You always did. " said the masked man. The boy quickly hopped over the ropes and jumped out, checking his watch. The smoke wafted from his back pocket as he looked up at the masked man. " What the fuck was that? " " I meant, just... get to work. They know. " " I'll see about that. " The boy skipped forward in his chair and settled into a chair next to the masked man. As the man was moving towards him the smoke rapidly filled his desk and he instantly felt a pain in his face as the masked man walked in to unload his gun. The man noticed the shooter and fired at him. Once the chair was finished he casually jumped back, waiting for the gunfire to stop. The masked man's hands turned black as he started his climb to his desk and began typing. " Has everyone seen this? " he continued, voice slurring. " Not one of us in all our years has tried to get you anywhere near this... This now was the culmination of 8 years of pursuit. Knowing you are coming all this way, I assume you would've reconsidered that the only way to meet your end is to do what? Pssh... " He paused. " Krrk... Shut it. I know what it's like. " The masked man fumbled for a lighter and stepped back. " Looks like you don't have much more left to accomplish. Or as I liked to call it,'oh no'. That shit was more than a bummer back in my days when I could afford all of this shit. I need you to give up now. " He took a big gulp and stared at the dirty floor. The pain spread his arms and exhaled loudly. " Hahaha, he's staring at me with those disgusting, brown eyes. " The mask grinned. " Was I right? No, no I was just confused that someone, someone... would enjoy... " he blinked and then started typing again. " Never mind, fuck this. " " Fine... " " If anyone is looking for guidance, you either need to make your choice to stop. Or do so now that you know of my true intentions. " The masked man peeked at his phone. It was displayed on his lap. There were two black letters scrawled on it: *CTRL ALT / NOR. * The masked man shook his head and said " As always, fuck your project. You are running out of bullshit. Now move on. Now." The masked man got off his chair and with a frustrated sigh walked towards his desk. There were a few memos and pamphlets scattered about on the desk, piled up everywhere: *Start any project you want, * *Your professional document is page 42-31, ** ( my study consists of the most effective suicidal actions as well as natural disasters and school supplies can be gotten in a drawer, often to dry the floor ). * * You will create additional scenarios and add more alerts later on, or start any part of the project anyway. * *** Thank you for reading and my mind was always so blank. Please contact me if you have any more thoughts. Thanks for reading!<|endoftext|>

"Do you have any more photos of our kind? " Joshua asked the elderly man, looking away as he turned to survey the memory of his dead family from his small phone. He sighed, rubbing his hands together in a futile attempt to heal his nose. " Nah, I have been watching Earth for some time now. I wondered to myself if this site will make me feel better. " Joshua winced as he stared out the window towards the plains. A rich green glow traveled through the grass, making Joshua smile. Even though the field had been uninhabitable for days, the sun would be set at twelve o'clock. The view outside would provide for a day or two of relaxation. Joshua was tired now, and he didn't have the energy for this. " Let me just send you an image once that you'll be out for a couple days? " Joshua didn't say anything at all, but his grin quickly changed to a glazed expression as he thought about the image. Almost without thought, Joshua decided to send one of the pictures himself, as he always did when he got home, in a high-priority record. The picture he sent to himself was certainly a tribute to the people he had grown close with. In that moment he remembered the wildlife he knew and loved about the planet. Joshua would fly to Earth, explore the sights and sounds and know the animals he had left behind. The picture was preserved. Joshua smiled as he immediately pressed send. After waiting a few minutes, he reached for his mobile. A sudden boom erupted in the sky, followed by heavy thunderclouds covering the area. The radio crackled in the background. Joshua looked back to the picture, and he saw small tribesman-like creatures, some of them glowing blue at the corners of their eyes as they scaled the towering mountains. Joshua grinned. " Are those... dolphins? " he said, planting the photo on the ground next to the device he was using to send the picture of his family. His smile turned even more wide, with emotions streaming over his face. He frantically set the phone down, as some thunder sounded near his feet. As he walked back to the screen, Joshua remembered the situation he had been in. He fell to his knees and cried. Joshua was given little comfort, his life had been taken away from him. The panic was quickly replaced with confusion. Joshua snapped back to reality, eyes closed, mouth agape. Silence overcame him. He walked forward slowly, legs suddenly moving. As he reached the bottom, he saw a familiar shape in the sky. In this image, the people were also hung on poles. He turned to smile at the sight. It was then that he noticed the large metal objects crawling towards him. He fell to his knees and screamed. He always did cry if he heard it out, and the larger creatures soon began to attack him. They licked his face and brought him closer to the metal object. Their steady pounding reverberated off the screen of his phone. Tears streamed out of his eyes and he stopped. He looked at the silver object and inhaled deeply. As he turned away to look at the dead men surrounding him, he heard a quick bang and the flash of light. Joshua looked down at his phone. It was still at the moment of impact, but what did he see? It was a young child, in his teens. He picked it up, and smiled at it. A message appeared on the screen: " Update 7.1 fixed bug reporting issue."<|endoftext|>

I thought I had just been picked off by a squadron of ten chaps as they went about their day. I was simply playing around with an item in a dimly lit room. The boxes were full of strange blue fabric, reading'wrong' whilst little scribbles of numbers hovered over them. Suddenly a hole appeared in the middle of the box, within this was a small hole. I couldn't see from where I was, but I can still hear the whirring of their engines. This stopped by one of the chaps holding a screwdriver. He pushed it over to me. I didn't budge, it wasn't a screwdriver, my heart dropped. " James... What's wrong? " I said in my confusion. " It's serious, you just broke down and hurt yourself. " He said, not believing my confused question. " I... I guess I should warn you, this is bad enough, time to make a break for it then, " I reply. My heart sank, but I couldn't get to it. I couldn't survive this. There was no escape. No thought or forethought. All I did was stare at the void, my arms in my knees. " I won't go back to this world. Please. " He pleaded. His words echoed through the room, sending shivers up my spine. " No, " I said, but kept my voice flat. " You'll have to call an ambulance, since you're not in control, " He implored. " The authorities will believe this. " I said, my words reaching little comfort for the chaps that watched me through the hole in the floor. " It's alright. I didn't break anything here. It could go back to where it really should've been. " I said, my voice rising in pitch. Suddenly I heard the crew laughing in the distance. " We've done it, here! " The crew yelled. The chaps celebrated with their vids, recalling what had happened. I didn't. I continued to stare in the hole. I tried to understand the story behind it, seeing as the chaps weren't allowed to leave their seats in the exit. I knew that what was going on was in order. My sense of sanity faded quickly. My head snapped back into my hands, and I screamed in anger. I had no idea what the hell had been going on, I was simply too stupid for anything else. " I don't know... I can't even make a thud without waking up, there's no time, " I mumbled quietly. " Stay where you are, " the chaps called out as they left the room. " We can't have an escape now. You're gon na be dead if you don't. You can't leave." My voice now resounded through the room, reminding me of my error. This was worse. It was madness. For the first time, my sanity could be quelled. I let go of the screwdriver that had been holding it for months, pulling it out of my pocket. I felt my fingers slip in the hole on my arm. I saw what happened. I was a rational man; but this was too much.<|endoftext|>

WARNING: Will be mildly NSFW.- Snape walked into the Harry Potter clinic through the middle of the floor. Glasses and metal boxes and an in-nasal hospital bed lined the walls. As he approached the front of the room, a young boy with glasses and blonde hair with dark eyes asked him, "W-What's going on? " Snape nodded and smiled down at the boy. " I've been in the school here for ten years! " " I know. And I'm almost thirteen, right? I don't know if I can handle this all anymore. " " I am. " " I don't know what is going on. But you better think of this quickly. After all, you'd be best off staying in Gryffindor. " " Yes, how many years would it take me? It would be awkward. " " You would just lose my attention, wouldn't you? If you left then I'd be on my own... then that's just a small price to pay. " " Ok, I understand. But now that I understand that, then you have to understand... I have no way of knowing. " " I have no way of knowing! " " I am your god, Peter and no one else has! " Snape raised a hand. A voice shouted at him, * " How can you believe that- where is all this going?! " * He faced the voice, trying to shout it out, trying to look shocked or scared. " Potter is a wizard! " Snape shouted back. A middle-aged and thin man with a glazed look entered the room with a clipboard. The man led him inside and handed him a clipboard. Immediately the clipboard emptied into the trunk of a jeep that was rolling down the street. As the driver gingerly exited the vehicle the broad faced man shouted again, " Sit down. This won't do you any good! " and soon when the young boy stood up he walked to the front of the vehicle to face the man who was with him. As the young boy stood in the front seat of the jeep the man pushed his driver in, walking toward the boy who was getting ready to drive the jeep. " This is going to be a long and difficult day, Mr. Potter. " The man turned and looked at Snape. " I can't believe you. I've been in this room for so long that I've nearly forgotten about you. " " Mr. Potter, you're from the future, right? " " Yes, I remember hearing about you, you guys have always said you were a bit'off' about stuff, that we're about to deal with your grades and I'd like to talk to you about the sorting. " " Is that all? Are you going to talk to me about anything or am I going to let that happen? " " Sure. " Snape nodded. " First, let me tell you about Hogwarts, Potter, and Azkaban. In these conditions, we can't even measure who are who or where they are coming from. Only a select few of you even know about one of them. " " So... that is the problem, Mr. Potter? " " Yes, Mr. Potter, unfortunately there is no one there to account for who you are. " " So to be honest, is this really so bad? " " Yes. " Snape nodded. " You know, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley were briefly involved in a fight against this guy, and you know what they got ta deal with after that? Getting expelled from Hogwarts and being shot before graduating right after the show? " The man smirked. " Whoa! And you're joking. We did so much damage to the house! " " Yeah... I see. I understand. I'll just make sure to check in for the sorting. See you in five minutes."<|endoftext|>

The books, the movies, the books... they're all cliche. I may be biased, but it's a general idea that I'm working on. I guess the importance of “ inspired ” storytelling is a bit strident in these genres. Still, I felt like an appropriate introduction. Here's to a story I first made in [ # 62 ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5733o1/the_books_i_accomplished_an_art_station_different_building_country/cj0mrgh4 ), it was great and it gave me an insight into all the ways we could potentially shape the books, character and world, and I took advantage of the time that could be made for a world which felt the importance of “ getting lost ” in some sense, or playing with time loops that are predictable for something like jumping out of a skyscraper and beginning a story based off the realization that all you really know is time. I think the plot will add some confidence, for sure, but I liked the way this felt about the characters, as well as the good decisions to make. If I may elaborate, I would describe the story as a short story. It is an example of the [ # 21 ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5t18v0/indian_men_are_sentenced_to_death/chm3wj1 ), which conveys the fear of death and the many scenarios that could lead to it in a rather unique way. The narrative is saturated in symbolism, and makes a lot of sense that it can be read in terms of social class as well as there [ # 5 ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5t4jhs/the_the_hero_defies_humanity_and_other_worlds/ch9pw1a ), though it might just be bullshit if someone with identity black stands in front of everyone and yells “ FINALLY ”. I really like how the flow of the story was interesting in terms of skipping the focus on tables and other tropes, but I just wanted to tell you that this just didn't do my style justice, which was something I did a lot the same thing [ # 11 ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4syd6a/fantasy_write_its_no_fantasy_shows_a_new_hero/cjuhw9cc ) because it was an interesting fight scene to see.

It's an arms race. The usual excuses are going around: why would you give into the need to get up, that your minds are the few apps they make, or that you don't even know if you're gay or a latino, but these days there's something new. There's an endless supply of every kind of false thought. That's where the biggie is coming from. People don't respect these sorts of thoughts. They're entitled to it, and those who are rich are always happy to listen. The payouts are astronomical, as is saying that you're so talented in anything you do, there's absolutely no reason to discriminate. The other way around, people who can't benefit the system easily become rich. Money is quite important in the society now. Almost all the wealth is put towards the new ignorant masses, and by controlling the economy, a new set of rules made for society. Every human is viewed with greater importance if they get enough attention. I have yet to see a person who can prove I'm the best in the world. A glitch in the system. Nobody can stop the movement, but it's all moving so quickly on a subconscious level that it's hard to tell. In a few years people will go from being the highest ranked race to the least. The fucker is gon na become the new king of this world. Maybe not here in France, but there's no one left to stop him. For a while, our rulers just ignored the crap about our society, things to worry about. But I don't understand. You know, the default is "good for society " when people talk about laws or something like that. It's some sort of stereotype of my " country " as some god-damned Germanic bastards. Why would people want to work so hard? I mean, I work for lower class jobs. At least I have some decent pay. But a few short years, I was hit with a wierd raise. My focus and my abilities were going up in flames. I almost thought to myself... " Okay, the next hop, am I gon na take some sick cruise, or what?" I mean, I can just put a boat in and some fucking pirate nation, but... and then, it all gets out of hand. The rules are always changed, to the point where people are given false opinions in order to keep the status quo. Its just people who use their power to do the things they want now don't have to go. These people haven't done anything wrong. They've tried to change the rules of the world. I've become what they think I am. Maybe I'm wrong. But everyone knows better, and this power gives me purpose. Purpose to keep this power. It's just one of those things you get used to after millions of years, but I guess I'm pretty much right about this. My whole world of free thought, free thought, free access to energy, free in... maybe it's time to unite a nation. That's the thing about this world. I'm the good guy, the angry guy. I'm the only one who uses those powers to show everyone I exist. I don't enjoy it. I'm the antithesis to the whole system. Take this country. Take my country. Take me to Paris. I'll put some politicians in charge, and I'll establish a regular, civilized, modern, whole world. I'm the hero, the reason this country exists. A shining example of freedom and democracy on our Earth. Whatever the next step in the world is, it's going to happen. And not just this year, but next, and not just today.<|endoftext|>

I felt nothing at first, I looked all around, all I saw was maggots, barbed wire, and so many, floating in the air. It made my stomach turn, the air smelled sour but I couldn't help myself and the fear swelled inside me like something from a monster. I watched the rotting corpses of my friends rush to places the bodies did not belong and split up in to bodies that didn't belong, beginning to fly out to shantytowns and wastebaskets and dungeons in search for maggots. The sky was pitch black, like the sins of a forgotten era and I stared at it from my backyard, heepily, still no say in the matter and I was set on life as an observer on Earth for 200 years. I had been chosen to do something, anything, to change the world, to bring the world peace, prosperity, everything, something so precious that I was doing to it. My identity should have changed, everyone should have. This new world, the new *Gods*, they told me. Of course, I was wrong, the gods are cruel, I saw the morning stars, hella the sun for I saw them, glimmering green and black, like stars in a collage of light, the universe as our own, but with a little bit of one bit of a greed in it, a little bit of a... a whole bit of a fickle hand, it was just too much to handle. I had been told to be cautious, the gods had spoken, but I had never seen anything so cruel before. One day, they would find me, damn it, there was something in that darkness, something that could change the world. Even though I still needed to smell or taste or feel the power of the gods, that power, it was my place to keep it, and protect them. As if if the gods were something I was privy to, how could they be against me. They said I could move them and that could change the world, they said that you have a place where all your friends join together, a place where you all gather to be part of something much greater and *better. * That some would join a lot, a lot of them did too, and the gods only liked being people, people liked things they could use to change the world. I had heard stories of strange beings, called gods, and gods of old, which I still couldn't catch up to, and asked what they were, when they learned the power that magic could bring. They pointed me towards a room with lenses on the walls, some got on their knees, and gave me food, I guess a little food and water didn't work for me, I only ate little food though, it was as if I had been bitten by one of the few creatures that did. They marched me towards the corner of the room, and I saw it, it was a great place, big enough for the first time in a long while, the only thing I could stand on was light, I thought about it for a while and bit my way through the path, "No... sir, please don't run away, please don't go back " they had a desperate look on their faces, and the group approached me, the leader pointed the visor at me, " you silly eyes, you can't touch us if you can't, kill us all and we will take you to hell! " the leader raised a hand, raising it to the sky, and I didn't feel much of anything, I looked down, " you can touch something, whatever " They said the vision of blue became true, so bright in fact I had visions I hadn't experienced before. It was light, brighter than I had ever seen before, and of course, it was brighter than any lighting I had ever seen, and it was as if it let the world, everything into existence. I felt the grip of life on my shoulders, and my eyes opened, there was everyone around me, the people had all come together, the freedom of the worlds was manifested, it was as if I was free. " Good sir, please join us " I said with a smile, " We're doing great, look at us now, we are the Medivac Elves, you need to let us join in the aswell, please join us, they are everything, they serve the gods," They all stood, I had them out of the way, and I went to the living area.<|endoftext|>

Ever since my mother passed, I've been terrified of the drugs. Those pills make me sick. The fact that I've not felt pain in the whole thing does not make me any less frightened. And even if I didn't, I suspect my mother was the one who left the pills. She was a very polite woman. And so when I had those dreams that I have now, I had to act. I didn't hit back. I had to reach out to the bartender. I had to do something. * A breeze blew through the small wooden doors, mingle with the tranquil surrounding the three-story building. * Outside, my son died, as a pale young boy. On his lifeless head lay a towel draped in gauze, soaked with blood. His intestines were gone. I stood before my son, braced myself for what could have occurred. But I couldn't. I wouldn't let this happen. I didn't want to be caught by my own son. I wanted this simple kindness to end. I grabbed the towel with both hands and looked into his eyes. They were cold. He looked as lifeless as a newborn baby child. "Is that a revolver? " I asked the bartender. " No, my son is dead, what's up with the window blinds, " the bartender replied. I shook my head. " We're getting somewhere," I said, cowering behind the window. I hadn't been about to leave this place.<|endoftext|>

Finally. I never felt more alone in my life. The fact that a bunch of people voted me into office failed to convince me that this was it. It was almost like I was trying to convince myself that somehow the alternative was still possibility. Or maybe they were perfectly content with letting me have every interview, anything to show for it. After the previous two weeks of revelation I had no coherent answer for that. It was only days later that I would be featured on MTV. The channel had driven insane viewers through their mythology. As I floated back into my small apartment I imagined how the show would reach some semblance of fruition, and all the money I would make from every major media corporation would help me pass the interviews. I considered the sponsorship possibilities, but I always stayed cool with it. My apartment was a bit small compared to my previous apartment, but I didn't have a lot of room for anything else. As soon as I heard the sound of the studio door open I knew something was very wrong. I mean, I've never heard this one before. I put on my best my best impression. After an effortless hour of seeing nothing but the words "We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty, " I moved into the living room. I took in the room, with the exception of the bed and the tv. I set the tv to a mute, and covered my ears. It was getting dark. Around the room sat burning obsidian smelts filled with the eyes of the condemned. I took one look around and looked at the lifeless bodies scattered across the floor. They were nothing. They looked nothing like us. I knew that this was not what I had expected. My neighbor would pay for someone to get eye witness to a crime and then burn them. I didn't even want this. I sat on the couch and squinted until the broken mirror in my bedroom caught my attention. I silently sighed as I started to take it out of my pocket. I went to grab the gun laying on the couch. There was something in the darkness around me that made me jump. I heard it. I turned around and noticed who it was. No, it was no person. Was it a moderator? It just walked straight into my room! He didn't even look like me. I yelled at him. He began yelling at me. He laughed and made some strange noises. I screamed in anger. I wanted to get rid of him. I walked back to my room. The cameras all showed the scene. The story was getting somewhere! I was about to give up on hope. Maybe I wouldn't run as fast as I had planned. No, maybe it would be better to just give in. I started running. I never should've gotten in the way of a moderator. I ran into the corner. And I was stopped by the muzzle of the gun. I looked in my glass window. The flames had reached to their limit. It was almost peaceful to me. I ran towards the smoke. I was still in the apartment. " Hi, hi, hey! " I said " Hello, " " Hey! You here? " I heard " You know I haven't taken you too far! " I looked at the TV and the flames had turned into one big beast. And it looked like he was scared to do something. I felt the burn of sweat on my face as I shot the poor guy in the legs and killed him. It took me another 30 seconds before I heard a roar from behind me. " We would like to announce that Hell is finally empty. " Then there were the screams, and then nothing at all. Finally, a moderator walked out the door.<|endoftext|>

As I stood on the porch of my small apartment, everything felt surreal. I was standing alone, looking into the setting sun. That was my usual response to something that could turn the entire world upside down. But inside that moment, I felt an almost heavenly happiness. That's when I saw it. The one thing that couldn't be changed. ~~Shaven** As i turned around I noticed some blisters all over the counter I'd left. But from the box of papers under my refrigerator window I could tell they were done. As the produce on my counter warmed up, my suspicions shot straight through my head: The lamer would need to buy more yesterday, or I would have to get rid of it. This was unfortunate as it was only one lie created from the previous lie completed. But, in all honesty... I just couldn't stomach the thought. ~~Shaven** Another lie... the right one. Do I really want to go through with this? I still felt numb from the taste of the liar. But I knew it was time. I didn't need to reach out to touch it. For now it was just as good a response as that in my opinion. But when I approached it, it felt more personal. With each step I touched the lie that I had sworn to never tell, a hundred different lies that would make me wan na know more about the life that went on inside me. I took out the present. I'd been facing down a dark lie... no, the real truth. I let go of it, opened my mouth, and let it sit next to my jacket. Behind me, I heard the ringing next to me. My heart was as heavy as I was filled with hope. ~~Shaven** My body felt like it was going to explode. By the time I did I knew what it meant. I was back in my life. I had believed in a lie since birth. I could not believe I had become a lierer. I needed my lierer. ~~Shaven** Taking a moment to think, I entered the room, stood there as the pain of the other lie was all but gone. The pain had been gone forever. As my will said, I would leave this world. The truth lies all along. ************************************************************** *Confession: I lied to * < doc > * by learning that the person who lies to me... on any occasion... has never truly fully accepted what I had done.

He glanced at his watch and chuckled to himself as he strode over to a large cot. The quaking in the trailer was getting louder now, and the air is thick with a cinnamara smell. One of the men on his post called out, "You're gon na miss me when I'm gone. " You could hear the footsteps turn faster as everyone's jackets were put back on. Sometimes at night there were more of those, but lately there had been just enough to keep it from being late. Jeff had been cleaning and repairing the back up for the last twenty eight hours; he was closing in on the time between meals. They ’ d both completed their packs by hand, and it had been two weeks since he and Jeff left. The two had always been so careful to avoid friends when leaving for these parts of town, but now it wasn ’ t even a regular occurrence. They had never been in a hurry; they hardly ever paid the water bill. Sitting there alone with the empty blanket on the cot as he weaved his way towards his door, he felt something want to nuzzle him in the back of the head. He closed the door, kissed the cracked part of his collar as he shook, waited for the pressure to pack his muscles. He wasn ’ t sure what to expect. Maybe he thought he was crazy, but that he was close to being immortal. Jeff hadn ’ t known that truth. The reason he believed in dragons was because he was skeptical. He wasn ’ t possessed by a human, either, his mind simply decided his age. Greg was another of the two men, one a bronze skeleton with cold grey eyes. He liked to imagine that they ’ d be able to survive for an extended period of time. Jeff was slightly taller and could barely contain himself as he stood, leaning against the frame of the trailer. He had worn his favorite hoodie over the last few weeks, and somehow despite having been an idiot for so long, it looked like he was still trying to find his way out of the church basement. Maybe he was just too nervous. Even today Jeff was ready to get out. The dim lights in the barn looked out on the horizon for the first time since they ’ d finally left town. The dog watching the watch slowly darted into the distance, then followed by a familiar sound. A sharp spasm in his spine, it froze the lawnmower and threw it off of the hillside. Now the noise was regular, but here it would don'thing to change what was expected, it had to continue. They didn ’ t have much time to get out, and time had already died. Greg ’ s head rolled back in his head as he tried to control the crushing pain and fright. Why should they call the ambulance? They were coming in anyway, and this could be the last thing they saw of him. The scowl on his face lit by the razor sharp blade meant anything. He ’ d made sure to wear his signature wrinkled cape on days like this. He was sure that he was too late, but he was also extremely excited to finally see this world. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - *Like this?

It was dark as the day began. Pure white, forever not knowing the night sky. This was the first time since their arrival that ships had been so dark, it was hard not to feel the tremors of terror as the drops of rain started falling. The rain started a minute after the humans had arrived. It started getting brighter as they piled up and felt the tremors of rain take their place. Another minute or two they saw them in the distance. One little shell, below them floated a little bigger. Behind that shell came another of them falling, one in each direction. Then, faster and faster the smaller the shell went. It was as if they were floating to each other, different colors and shapes sailing past each other in any direction, making the scene less momentary. The rain started to fall. The tall suits of soldiers patrolled the area. They didn't see what was happening but one was seeing some sort of change. He was slowly meeting the upper edge of the shell, directly under the soft snow. The rain started to fall and he was choking back the hail and it suddenly stopped flowing. He looked up at the Sun and the grass and saw the cloudless sky in front of him. He knew that had given him a new hope. He wasn't lying when he said that the atmosphere was starting to roll away, and just as he was about to turn around he felt a knock on his door. "I'm having a look at this. It's new... " " We'll wait. " " You have to go, have a look. " " Come with us." With that said the strange man took off his coat and sat on the porch of his house, waiting for the rain.<|endoftext|>

Will had them wrap their wet gloves around his feet every now and then. These groups of little girls were so shy they knew the choice before they made it, but he was in love. He loved Melissa. They were already drunk, and distracted, and, being one of the couples they lay in right after sunset each night, most of the time she was never heard from again. Despite her light candles and warm sips she wasn ’ t popular. He preferred more comfortable wine for the night. At night though it was the medicine that overpowered him. He savored the feeling of bitter cold water on his skin. He drank to avoid the wooden crosses, his unholy act as a mysterious demon frightened even him. He reflected upon his childhood, and he saw her love. Will was nearly a decade old by now. This was to be his chance. They were always walking through the forest, the trees swaying gently with the sound of clacking-clacking of apples along the winding paths. She had her way with them, weaving elegantly with her heavy snow white gloves. Will had been the one to witness the first of the travelers being led to the castle. The thought of battle and lives lost to the reaper was unsettling. It burned Will with bitter cold. Would they let that cry of eternal light drown him? Would they let that raucous part of their banter drown him with the sound of music? Slowly he came around the corner and felt a warmth around his throat. Melissa was there, tantalizingly close. Her hips were quivering and stiff as she set the very first touch of love to him. Will wondered if they would ever speak again. Who would ever speak to each other again? He touched her my flesh in the midst of deep, powerful sleep. She shifted with the sounds of music, and Will stroked her musky skin. The softness of her breasts seemed to intensify with her slow breathing. Will drifted to sleep, followed by a quick knock on the door. Melissa ’ s voice vibrated with power. Will was not his loving daughter. All he could do was worry about what would come next.<|endoftext|>

"Well kiddo, I finally found it. I've been waiting for this, you know what I'm talking about. " " As I was saying sir, it's been some time since you've looked in my mirror! " " Does that mean I'm not looking? " " Of course not kiddo. " " Have you noticed that I've noticed that you're really looking at me? " " Yes sir, look up my reflection. It's blinking. " " Look up what's blinking? " " Mirror.... Mirror.... Mirror! Mirror! " " Sir. " " Mirror off, i'm not looking at you anymore! " " I love you, nay, I love all of you forever. " " Don't we need to talk? " " I'll tell you what... now. It's your reflection on the door next to me.... " " Sir, what's it look like? " " It's the same as it was the first time the mirror blinked. " " The first time the mirror blinked that something happened. " " Are you kidding me? That thing that suddenly appeared out of nowhere! " " Oookay. Now look. Everything. All of it. Everything is... off. " " Mirror off. They're always leaving something behind. That time what happened to me was the only way they could take it away. " " Well... Sir. My previous reflection is gone. My reflection is back! " " That's a stroke of luck right there. You seem to have seen this- " " Yes sir. That's right."<|endoftext|>

I turn on my mic, only this time I have a GoPro. Just as I reach out and pry it open, my mic catches the beam of glass in the middle of a 5-metre-tall circle. I yelp. I lock my hands against the reinforced glass panel, then kick down on my heel and make a dash for my car. I look to the left, but the street is empty. The air is still with the pull of a satisfying pop, and I walk past my four children, all giggling and laughing. They are just sitting there, wondering what is going on. Why is this happening? What are they so nervous about? “ T-t-today, ” I can barely keep up, but a wall of pasteboard is all I have left. My neighbor has his car on autopilot, and we take the drive home. “ T-top tomorrow, ” I smile in front of my two kids. “ Excuse me? ” “ Never mind, ” I replied. The kids nod, and I head off for the exit, past the playground and the pool. I give my car a friendly shake to put it back in drive, until a small angry face stares back. I turn my head slowly, so that a brightly lit street can be seen from my window. “ Was it worth it, ” I ask. “ Yeah, ” she replies, and I press my hand against hers. “ At least they left us with a future like you. ” As I close the car door, I sigh and throw the phone in the trunk. I grin at the battery on my phone, and so I do.<|endoftext|>

It all started out as a simple prank. For the most part, it was not a large scale push for something what might have seemed like a good idea. First things first - which surprise I suppose because that's my last name. For thirteen years, in front of this glorious red planet, every single right eye in the world had been tuned to the message: "Frank Aiken, you have been found worthy of our attack. Every intention with which you have we have never attempted to justify the order. All we do is ask that you refrain from acts of violence that would potentially injure those around you. Even lying about your biological heritage is a crime punishable with all acts of cruelty. Nothing should be done about these deeds. You know it will be over shortly. Do not act so quickly; it could be the beginning of a short, terrible race war." Day three so went my time. Day two I used my parrot wings and made a frog out of was silver hair and just about every other small insect in the house and diatribe that came out of my bald toky glosses. the frog that I made was worth a ton of money. I knew what my next actions would be. Make no more fun of me. Signing off. Everyone listen to the words that came from the "Commander on the front lines, sir. " I wouldn't know any better but the commander knew this. People were annoyed. The little kids, those children who really did seem to like the sound of my phrases, boy oh boy. They complained because they had grown fat, and the politicians made sure that everything was truly different for some other reason. If the rest of the house had any fear, it wasn't of the sudden orders from the leader, but of what the head would do if the aliens appeared. The solution was obvious. First off, the world would know. Who would send them? They would know of the war, and we would be watching them - if not the leaders of this great race. Our family is going to live at peace with the aliens. We will all die. Then, a thing happened. The aliens appeared and attacked. I heard gunshots on the street, my friends and family dead in a mix of gas, fire and what most folks would call fire. I saw some people die as well, police, firemen, and hospital personnel all to none of which I thought that a real hospital would take a serious toll on them. But they were no match against the alien rampaging from the sky. Many of us survive though, we've lost some man, a radio operator, over several months when the aliens landed. Sure enough, we gained more than enough for military personnel to be able to track the rampaging time of a helicopter. The government gave up trying to convince everyone to die, and they succeeded. I'm sorry but for all we know, the alien physiology is driving us to be savages and to take things personally. A big fight like this, with a happy ending, has nothing to do with that. Day three through the battle, we rolled over and got a nice view of the aliens coming for us from the sky. We figured it was a good idea to sell them junk, because they had their own dead birds, but I was on record about believing this stuff. Turns out, aliens are not so helpful when it comes to trade. My friends and family have managed to stay strong, with two helicopter crews and a recovering military. We're up a few dozen meters in front of them. They're still watching us, and they're getting ready to shoot. I will end it all before anyone else can!<|endoftext|>

To his credit and his dismay, I tell him this confession by heart was in fact, a stroke of luck. My husband and I were at his wedding a few months ago, and while he'd delighted in the finely crafted artistry of lighting and presenting to his friends that he'd personally be putting together, he was also at the exact moment of his bride laying in the kitchen cupped in a pink champagne pan. My husband had returned home with a machete in his hand, but before he could do so, his wife was playing a piano and shouted "Me, me, me". She stabbed me once more and fell out of the house as soon as I reported the injury. I don't want to say I'm ashamed, but that was, while somewhat unusual for my husband. I hadn't yet noticed my sudden departure, but after the murder of my wife it was clear he was more focused on his own survival than the tragedies he caused. His sense of self had stayed high and steady, but that didn't last long. Several years ago, I discovered I was gay. Not my husband's per se surprise, but the beginning of the underlying issue. I had never felt a simple heterosexuality like this before. I couldn't get a husband and wife to laugh at me when I announced it, after trying for weeks. My husband apparently was a closeted Christian, after all. It was just a matter of time before it came back on him that no matter what I told him or the situation, he always denied it. Whatever the case, I was glad he accepted it. However, the fact that a character attached to me was openly homosexual. I snapped out of it after a couple of weeks, and tried to explain to the counselor what I mean by that. She never said anything, but her statement proved to be quite the scar from my belief before I was thrown into this pit. I begged, pleaded, pleaded for mercy, and so forth. By the time I managed to get my own husband and wife to calm down, I really had to take notice. I stopped coming outside to celebrate and packed up, but by then I hadn't left the house. I called my husband, who then answered. I didn't ask why I'd admitted. I didn't ask anything other than he'd said it. But he replied. He asked me, all along, if I wanted to tell my husband. He asked me what kind of church he was. I'd just asked him the question first thing I found out, and he said it. And after I'd gone over what he told me, we began telling each other our reasons. After all, marriage is meant to be a mutual acknowledgement of your wrongdoings, not a cutesy promise about how you'll never love me again.<|endoftext|>

[ WP ] The Mona Lisa: Monty Python, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and Ten Commandments Chapter Ten Curiosity Strikes - The Day It Started So... Faintly. Old and youthful. Bold and exciting. There was no time. I sat there looking around the decrepit bar, watching cartoons for a long time before I finally got to the perfect moment... *** The bar rose to a high pitched, buzzing sound as a set of barbells caught my attention and the glass shattered just as loudly as it should. I quickly realized I'd been drinking and fell silent. The shattered glass and shards of glass indicated the bartender had moved the thick glass covering it as well. Sometime later I came to and poured a few more glasses and cleared my throat. " How you doing? " I asked the bartender as I waited for the man to arrive. " Greetings, Mr. Bob. " I was in no mood for singing or my buddy being drunk wasn't going to make me feel any better. He was one of the few people who walked out of the bar as others had broken into a panic. I was alone. I knew not who I had just met. I was just sitting there across from him drinking my first beer of the day. That's how it started. Just at that moment his moment of doubt struck. He was nowhere to be found. " Alright, " the bartender whispered. " Drop it and blow me the fuck up. No coke and it will be fine. " " No no no no. " I yelled. The sounds of bar smashing and someone hitting a wall accompanied the shattered glass to me and over and over until one by one I was alone in my empty bar. " Not yet. " The bartender pointed out. Slowly, I sat up in my seat and I grabbed my beer and stumbled over to the window to see the bartender seemingly drunkenly walk out into the street. I almost doubled over on the railing grabbing my beer and checking to make sure the glass was gone. This didn't look like fun. " Why does this have to be a joke? What were you going to do to your friend Mark? " The bartender asked me. I shook my head as I quickly regained composure. When I looked around the bar still standing in front of the glass, I suddenly realized that I had a shot of bourbon and immediately filled it. In seconds my eyes were foggy, which was a relief as I didn't have to re-orientate myself. This was a fantastic time to be alive. " Now, " I thought to myself as the bartender gave me a look as if he wasn't expecting me to finally notice. " Just let me know when you do happen to find Mark again." -- -- - Yeah, there are two kinds of Star Wars characters in all the movies. The Star Wars characters are 8-bit and Luke Skywalker is supposed to be one of the Han Solo guys. The Han Solo characters are ghoulishly-pig-like and have blue skin and massive wings. There are also things ( and spaces ) inside that show us about the life of a clone trooper, the world that someone wears a helmet on, their high school history and most important of all the incest. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the Han Solo characters because they look a lot like me. The only difference that I'd be carrying is that they've got one dick.<|endoftext|>

It was dark and it needed to be dark as well. I scrambled to my feet as I felt an unwary hand on my shoulder. Shocked, I placed my hand on her shoulder as well. " What are you doing?! I need you back down here! " I begged to the heavens. We were on the floor, in some hall. She could hear my sobbing. She looked up at me and I could only make out what she said. " I'm in my room, very sorry." She said. I could feel the sweat of my forehead pressing against my skin. I started to cry out but I stopped myself. For a second I thought I heard the door being slammed open and then I heard what sounded like moans coming from all around me. I ran towards the kitchen to try and get some water, but alas no water came. All I could see was a cloud of dust and debris.<|endoftext|>

I have spent my life looking for myself. At some point I lost track of the woman who I love, the chipper girls who I must spend the rest of my life with. On the day that she invited me to her house, with my friend Cyrus, I found out that they met through a mutual friend from high school. I did not realize that she was watching my brother, my best friend from high school, Gully Draz. I don't know why I did not get another chance to impress her. She never accepts my advances because of her Mom's having trouble making ends meet. I was only interested in giving her what I could gain from her. I started showing her the ropes, and pretty soon I realized that I already became a addict, and even a drug addict. I was so shocked that I had to tell her but no, she did not hear me and not even though I had a pack of cigarettes in my hand... I thought something was wrong because my friend apparently wouldn't do it. I saw an argument that afternoon during dinner. She was caught after they kissed. Unfortunately my girlfriend stormed out of the room and looked past us without looking back because I wasn't looking back for her. I believed them and had to run away. Shortly after she left, I set out to find her. I knew she was hiding out somewhere. She had been inside my house for about a month. I cut off all contact with her for a short while, realizing she was out there. I ran on all fours and hid in bushes. That was when I saw her, and I thought if I tried to talk her out of it, she would probably go away too. I just let it be because I knew she had other plans. But I lived my life, lost track of time so I ended up getting stuck in with my friends. Anyway, I killed myself and became addicted to killing people. I didn't even know if I were a addict or not, so I just started eating bullet rounds and sleeping in abandoned structures.<|endoftext|>

I know I started out small, by daylight shifting shade. I started making small faces. There was just one a day, and once I was done, one little smile would slowly spill across a face once I bit them. The first smile was The Wizard, who had been keeping me safe from harm. To the other, The Demon. They tried to hold me back, with what they would become. Or, at least, I was taught to sit still. Have you ever seen a lamp in a mirror with a smile on it for yourself? Have you ever seen a snake and its stick lash at you? There was no need to hide it. It *flickered*. Suddenly, it *flicked off*. A voice, new, and familiar - one I had never seen in so long. It was dark and wispy. About 10 feet tall, menacing, menacing... no, it could be Shiel, it was big but that did not matter. She had never been my friend before. So, I figured, if only it could be used as a disguise for when I would come across it again, I could begin to act more than any other. God, I was really happy to be other people's friend. To all of your friends. To everyone. *God. * To *anyone. *<|endoftext|>

The pain of her screams was at once silent, and... oddly peaceful. Alex had started his day with a half a candle lit candle. He then lit each one between the throes of constant bliss. The ritual was no longer difficult, but it made life a living hell for whatever the deceased sister might or might not like. As he went about his duties, one of his co-workers brought up a recent story. This happened all the time, but he had to take care of it, when he went to work. A stranger approached his desk, and Alex felt a little cold. He pressed the candle to his forehead. " Is this really helping? " Alex asked, in an angry tone. " Have you forgotten what this shit is like? " The stranger whispered in his ear. " Hell, god damn you! I don't want that! " Alex snatched the torch, and lit the midnight fire in his hands. It was like it was rain for the first time since he finished it. Or was it? Even the smallest gash could make the flames pierce the sky, let alone make it to Alex's severed body. " God damn it, Alex, is that fucking toilet? Is it my fucking toilet? I just died of alcohol poisoning. " The man spoke in a rather grown voice, his mustache straightening in excitement. " Well, I... did die at the stroke of the twenty-first! It's been a good fifteen years since I died, and I haven't even gotten to my fiftieth birthday. " Alex inhaled deeply, and passed out, slowly. Sitting up, he thought about what he had done. God damn it. It was his duty to light the fire, had he ever needed it? But now that it was dark, and the candle was still flickering, he could feel himself waking up. A little dizzy and a bit groggy, but he decided to do as he was told. He took the torch out of his pocket, and lit it on the flame. As he stared at it, a searing pain hit his neck. He thought of the others... his wife, Emma. Of his kids. Of his wife and children... of his now wife and children, all having been here for years. Would they like to live here again? Too... long? The searing pain crashed on Alex's head, turning him to dust. As soon as he heard the crunch, the wretched metallic taste struck him. " Yeah... god damn it, I just died in a blaze of rage. " The pain was similar to that of a cat being hit by an angry bear. Or the painful stroke of a gunshot. Or something equally painful. Maybe that was just to strong. He looked at his wife, the one that was always on fire, the one he had sacrificed so many years ago to make his body better. " You still want to have kids? " Alex inquired. " Yeah... maybe. " She looked up from his charred corpse, tears welling in her eyes, tears she had told herself long ago. Tears of remorse, and a single tear of empathy. " I... I'm not leaving you here, I'm not leaving my children, I'm here... I don't want to... I know you miss Emma. You know I do, after everything I've tried to do with you. " " God damn it, Alex, " He said, leaning out of bed, tears streaming down his face. " I really should have at least had coffee in the morning. I should have woke up in the mornings, the wife was working at the nuclear press, and I should have gotten that fucking phone call from the press with all the bullshit about everything not working. I should have stopped fighting for good, I should have.. " But the man in the robe said nothing. Instead, he sat on the bed and fell asleep in a crumpled heap. Alex awoke from his rictus haze to find his arms tucked back into his bodies. He covered his head with his arms, but no-one was there. Just the corpses of his loved ones, the stillness of his perfect world. Alex sat up for a moment, felt weak as the stench hit him. Was this something he needed to live with all of this time? Slowly, he put the sheet back on his head, and then the chair he usually slept in. It was comforting, even.<|endoftext|>

He was a man who walked through that portal that existed just as long as the spurs. These charged lines that bound his mind out of existence pierced his head like shards of glass that were infinitely large. One such momentary impact made the feeling completely numb, like it was one sieving the world of man, the crushing grasp of a desire for more and more, each moment of brilliance a horrific eternity. He even walked into the vast expanse of space, a blur of stretching hair, swimming eyes, his body wrapped around that massive figure. He was truly a man who lived in an infinity of pressure points, stuck on the edges of his being. Into a void of dark thoughts and crazed dreams, further points of thought. He could never speak; no worries, no worries of any sort, just the dark engulfing the mind, almost like the things that reside there. As the light breached his mind, the memories left behind slowly filled the room, the icy liquid burning away away the life. He was released, my time was up and my time on this face is up. I can feel myself inside me, nothing feels like this before. Although I am used to the sensation of an awareness a liquid is present, the distorting reality of all that has entered my existence for all the eternity. I can't experience my presence anywhere else, it feels like a mirage, one in which I was born and immortal, all that ever existed in that universe only suffered as human. So stuck in this void I am, for all eternity, I was not ready for the physical world. Instead of the bitter crushing sensation of nausea, the paralyzing whir of sleep fills my eyes, I am ready for the ache of regret. Before me lies a series of triple doors, that of which I know I must go through. They are platforms of dirt, crust, and dirt that are sifting through a vast tunnel, my eyes can not see this but I can hear its. The diamond shaped doors lead inwards into a dark room, where nothing existed before. I am stuck in this limbo, i am slowly drowning into a blank world, i am alone. I can not comprehend what is happening, and as a result, I am paralyzed as well. I simply can not look away, and as that all goes black, I feel complete peace for all eternity.<|endoftext|>

The next morning I woke up and went to bed. In that same bed I went to work. While I walked to the store I bought a pocket knife from my neighbor. After running to my computer and getting a copy of Slashdot, I went to work. I went to the arcade in the corner of the store and picked up the controller. At last I sat down and played the game. I started a game. Standing in the middle of some bushes the controller started firing with flames. After a short pause the first person to die and I laughed. Out of nowhere a second person was falling out of the bushes and hit a bush that was as close as anyone had ever been hit and hit like on a baseball. It didn't take long for the second person to fall out of the bushes and hit the side of a tree the same way you would hit a tree in a car. I sat there and watched for a while as the second person went to sleep. When I woke up I was more confused than anything and my mind was racing about where I was. I saw I was alive. My friend stood over me and started crying. "It's just you. Go to your mommy and tell her what happened." The first person came back and asked her for more money. She told me that she would spend it on a house with a garden and a shed and a large tree to see if she could stay in but I told her it wasn't what she wanted and walked away. A year later I found out who I am and if I am crazy.<|endoftext|>

When I finished tying the rope from the ground, I turned the bathwater into a pan of colors. I put the kettle on, and lit up the kettle with an Irish red, similar to my usual is on, and started the kettle while it boiled. I poured my favorite brown I had in it. My favorite green as well, just for guests. As I did so, I felt a change in the blade below the cap. I lowered myself to the ground and stepped over. I heard a bang coming from behind me. I took a deep breath and resumed my walk, feeling a sweet pat of cool water on my back. I moved to the side of the the bathroom, the bathtub facing the entrance. Before turning the water over, I started to step back and see the warrior I was cutting off doing the hero's job. My skin starting turning brown as my last breaths, the color a deep mahogany colored blade, poured down. I felt the steam coming from my blood, and just as I was about to puke, it hit me. It started to pour rainwater, when suddenly the fist I was holding fell out of the water. I wanted to run but I kept running and fell to the ground. I threw the blade and hit the power pad. With a mighty kick, I took the cover of the bathtub and managed to get up on my feet. I looked down at the blade again, still black. I took a knee, letting go as much of the water hit my skin. The blade finally vanished in the splash of blood, and I looked at my power pad as it hung from the drain. I looked at the only thing I hadn't seen before. A red light on the badge of the local police. I took out a watch, looking at the other power pad I was in, I unrolled the time and buttoned it. A bright flash of light blinded me for a second, and I got dazed for a second, hearing the sound of falling footsteps. I looked at my watch again, nothing. I looked at the badge again, and it read 12:39. Another flash of light, and I was falling towards the ground, I could hear the pounding of the boots on pavement. The same pounding, I could still hear the sound of glass breaking, I looked up and saw the warrior, smiling. He looked really happy. He was a new warrior, and he noticed me. He smiled, and touched his blade to the building across the street. As I was thinking of getting out of the bathtub, my hand came towards my legs, squeezing them under me. At least I hadn't died, I was just reaching for the sword from the bathtub.<|endoftext|>

"I don't feel good, " James said to himself, clearly panicked. " Guess what, lady? ", said Barbra, her face even more deeply, and more impatient as she cried. " Every damned time. I don't feel like winning any of them. " Barbra went on " What? I just won ten thousand. Let's make this all feel... different. " " No, " said James, " it felt different. I felt like I could focus on the situation at hand, rather than focus on my questions. But, it was priceless, and now my brain is hazy at best. I don't understand. " Barbra trailed off " Of course your brain-whelpers are go-ahead to use it? If I say nothing, they'll bring it back to me. At least it will be as pristine as I was looking at yesterday. " " Yeah, I heard. " James said, " I'm glad that your mum thinks that's a good idea. " Barbra was now breaking down crying on the floor. " OK, if I do say nothing and everything will be in order, I'll make sure it's even more incredible than before. So with that you can send it back to whoever you want. Anything. Then you won't have to worry about debts, chinks, and your brain-whelpers, because you can send it back. I love it when you guys use the money, I always do. But I'm sorry you won't get to experience the buzz and the excitement of stepping into the circus with me. It's like the experience of a thousand hours of practice. " " Wait a minute. " Barbra now began sobbing. " Shit, shit! I told my dad! " " Sorry, my dear, didn't mean to be sad. " " I told my dad... It's all an illusion, it's all a lie. " " Go ahead, there's no need to be sad. " James, the cynical one, quickly leapt from the bathroom into the attic. " What in the world are you doing doing in here? Get out of my house and all that. " " Turn it off! " shouted Barbra, desperately trying to shake James from his beliefs, " if you don't want to be here, then I have to end my own life. " James replied: " Fine, then, leave me alone. Let's go." EDIT: Fixed some grammar mistakes.<|endoftext|>

It was simply amazing. I hadn't really pictured what the general reaction would be like. But I wasn't nervous at all. I mean, this was the norm. I had always been a normal folk, ever since I was six, some idiot forgot their lunch break. At most, it was a safe lunch hour. Just leave your kids to go get a beer and have a time of your own. I was tired. Not the fresh-faced guy that they called him, but the old frat boy who passed the time with his doodle of the park's motto, *Nothing to Lose. * Today would be different. I mean, it was a normal day, I had my shave, put on my paint on my hat and reentered the neighborhood. I headed straight to the park. That's when it happened, my bike went straight through the hole in the ground with a few loud *bump*s and another. *HUTCH! * The team doctor jumped on the green bike, and I got out and began to walk up the ramp. Not wanting to risk crashing into something, I got out and put my hands up. I wasn't worried, though. It was a normal day. The doctor wasn't standing over me. He was standing on something a bit more disappointing. About 30 seconds after jumping off the bike, the doctor was dragged down by the bear, who shoved him a few inches back. This meant that all my life's work as an amateur writer was mine to pay for. Looking around the rest of my life, I was beginning to wonder if maybe it was time I got out. I might have to pick up the next hat.<|endoftext|>

The pounding in my ears woke me up but in a way it was something I wasn't accustomed to waking up from. Through the screeching of the engine that would surely drown out the sound of jagged teeth in my ears, I decided to head out. In the early morning I sat up and felt myself becoming smaller in my breasts, my balls up in fear of my unending belly. When I finished putting everything together I ran to the nearest aisle and laid in front of it in front of the shelves. The doors swung open and a man stood up from under his black jacket and brandished a large stick of shrapnel that weathered to shreds. " Welcome to the sales team with I just gained 10 % in our new burger " the announcer of the company grumbled to the assembled business folks. Through gritted teeth I cleared my throat and said: " Tonight, our regular Burger Bros " The man behind the desk let out a crow-chilling hoot. He snapped back to reality and slammed his weapon in my face. " Now or never " he cooed in delight " You're no longer a potato plant " The man pouted, that much was obvious, every other human didn't have the slightest idea what he was talking about. " I wanted to know what was the biggest take away from the new fad of Big Macs at this point " I chuckled. " It'll only take a minute to get your head out of your ass " he blurted, putting an awful weight on my shoulders. " You suck? " I scoffed. " Not in this way " he said slapping my cheek. I furrowed my brow, " Do you not believe it " He sipped his beer and patted my ass. " It's simple " he said patting my butt. " The burger is your body, you ate it. And what's more, what if you never eat it? You're eating it now. " After he left, he took a swig of his beer and frowned. " Why did you do that? " I asked. " You can't " He stammered, "... you should probably get a real burger already " " Your turn now " he said with a wink. " I'm Jack " I said, grabbing my IBS butter knife from under my shirt. The barrel slid through my neck as I choked and fell onto the floor clutching my last burger. The bullet impacted the ground and my head spun to the side. Jack was still standing there smirking, " 5 %! " " The judge was right " I exclaimed rubbing my bruised nose in frustration. He frowned, " Oh, my God... " he exclaimed backing off, " Your new burger is now self-aware ". He looked over at me, my bleeding eyes flickered to a shocked stare. " Yes " He said " what if the button wasn't there yet?" ***** Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this, please check out more stories at /r/MatiWrites.

Ok, so. Two things. I'll give them out. First, I thought it would be good to be mailed to Australia with this single line and drop it off in the mail almost in between the stops. Secondly, I think the place I chose for the books and the place I arranged was excellent. I stopped at her house two weeks ago ( near! ) and let her know how I'd like to get them. And I think her neighbor and I might take notice if she lets me in. Plus, I wouldn't know why I'm receiving these books here. I wish I'd checked them with the antiques department. *When you ordered these books, you were given ALL OF THE BOOKS AND THEIR WRITES ON. WITH THE TWO ERRORS VARIANT IT. ORIFU YOU ARE PICKING UP ALL THE BOOKS AND JUST WON THE SAME BOOK. * Well. Still, here they are. First, they're *Perfect. * They're everything I ever wanted. I'll take it, anyway.

"Your bluffs are snow-covered, so you stuck to the light! " Derek scoffed, rubbing his eyes before looking over to the man he had just loved. The man had picked this from the extensive catalogue of heavy - yet beautiful - snow for only over a day ago. A few empty cans of beer sat in his study, reflecting the sultry morning sunlight that it forced it into to. He had just had to wait until the first bite of bread was done - a day he had managed to have his new set of quilts untucked and set in their plastic homes. He mumbled a thank you for the sandwiches the man gave him as his usual instructions. The baker looked up from his baking later that day and nodded towards the thick, cold cookie the man knelt by. " What do you want? " His voice carried through the room, he opened the door. " To bake," she said with a smile, and opened the man's bakers door just as he found Derek sitting beside her, tired of his frosty grasp of his cold baked cookies. The phone rang, and the man sounded tired as a babe. Since then, Derek had struggled with not having anyone help him make his slice of bread so they could just stick to the light, as if their world outside of the prison was smudged and chewed down by the small particle he thought or thought might do harm. Derek had succeeded. But the baker had gone ahead and left the next morning, helping him and the knifesman make his own. Sometimes there was a bit of trouble when eating though. Sometimes he would accidentally bump into someone or force them into a bad fall. This was nothing but a regular, pressing problem for him, it made him feel uneasy. Finally, he managed to turn his flimsy dress into a gift. It revealed that the man who had sat beside him had taken out his sugar coated daily frostbite medicine to ward off the frostbite. He laid his brittle knifes on the oven, marveling at the beautiful breath of breath he had managed to take. This miracle triggered the forming of the sugar coating, making the world a little lighter and it was as if the world was just a little bit too cold, he did notice a few puffs of frostbite up on his nose.<|endoftext|>

I hated it here. The cold water refreshing them. The smell of unwashed laundry. They say if you have to live through a losing day, there's got ta be another way. Even so, I couldn't help but start to wonder why she came up here, why she hasn't done anything right lately. I was always worried that she was intentionally avoiding important decisions, even moments before they happened. Today, it was the realization that she knew exactly what I was going to say. But I needed to admit to myself. I mean, it's a small interview on a conference call, not an interview, not to be outdone by the media. This wasn't about her. This was about mine. The way she left it for me to decide; there was nothing else. There wasn't even nothing I could do about this. But this time, no. After all of the hurt and pain, if you can believe that. The emptiness of the setting sun, not her house, not her everyday life. This time, I would not leave her in the cold. At least, that is what I told myself when the sun finally slipped. Just once more, I came back home to find her stunned, some of her babies crying... smiling at the ready. I mean, one had hugged her again, I realized. I wonder what they will do now. And I know why they are running away. Because, I thought, they have only told me this before. I'm sure they want to give my head back to rest again. At least, it will be the perfect place to die again.<|endoftext|>

Boring. Not something I write often but this is my first ever submission. Up for you if you check out the video for Me: Two and Two Again at r/be3y0r3 /r/DoctorBots. It took me a while to get the idea out of my head but I'm definitely not going to get any writing prompts where I really get into the details right now but when the madness of a seemingly impossible problem set in motion by an unlikely entity takes hold, with the cockiness and senselessness of the break-in we've all seen on movies and the perils and lack of funny endings I'd rather not have the leftovers on my Christmas list<|endoftext|>

"Jesus, Bruce, this shouldn't be so difficult. " Wayne Jones gazed back at Wayne with his trademark, " Oh, right. Might as well make our time at Wayne Manor ten-fold in ten-seconds. " From the room, Wayne slid silently to the side, " Sounds like I got down to business, so let's get started. " " What time is it Bruce? " Lois asked, trailing after him. " I can give him my usual time of midnight, I'll see you then. " Wayne looked at Bruce again and hung his head. " This is not what we've been looking for, the court says that your office must open at ten thirty-five this afternoon to the principals manager, Susie Black. " " I didn't tell you to pay cops one night tonight " Commissioner Gordon put his hand to his forehead, " I got ta report this, because we got no case to file " Wayne nodded solemnly. " Still, I never expected to find myself in this situation for less than an hour. " The commissioner sighed. " Let's go in. " The door to the office slid open with a thud. An imposing looking Wayne materialized immediately. He cocked his head and walked down the hall, searching his dirty, decrepit, decrepit hallway for anyone that might have had a deal for him. " I'm here in ten-minutes to get the principal out of there " he muttered as he passed the soap dispenser. " He'll make it. " " Ah... That's right " Wayne snorted. " I've got to go out, nothing to see here. " " What will it be. " " I've got to find a way out. " " What do you mean? " " I tried. Oh, uh, the marshal's out. Get him! " " And I've got to get him out of here. " Wayne pushed the door open and slammed it shut. * " Let's get out of here and let the goddam world know it was Batman. " * A large man with a black cape and tinted eyes walked out of Wayne's office at the end of the hall. He stopped next to a line of cadavers called " Line's up! " He slammed the door shut. " Oh my God Bruce, you really didn't hear me. Let's get out of here!" The CEO yelled, disappearing in the doorway after Wayne with no where to run.<|endoftext|>

Normally I wouldn't go there. But I had just for school this morning. A video posted online linked to a video linked below. After it was reviewed by the rest of the internet, people were calling for her to be prosecuted. Some said it made them feel better, but most believed it never did. I, however, was a believer and I refused the plea. I pressed the blue button for peace while police hand over the case, and a dark cloud of snow built out the corner of my eye, and I watched that one person's eyes close and they become something else. I finally stood up and turned to leave the room. A front door opened with a rush of energy, the sound of glass breaking coupled with a popping metal door crumpling into a jagged mess made my rung. I was on a bridge with nobody coming to arrest me. Even my stepdad was not stopping me from crossing the road. I felt my head constricting and let my hands wrap around the railing. I touched my face and wiggled my finger to unlock the door. I was surprised to find the police standing there, a gesticulation almost to say "Ey, he's taking me to jail! " I pulled the puffed away hand back out of the wind. " Oh god!" I spun to face him and I smiled before pulling him out of the air, grabbing his shoulder, we walked off down the porch into the dark. We laughed in anticipation of seeing a real bit of snow, and I giggled in the process. It's probably safe to say I saw the snow a mile to the left.<|endoftext|>

“ That ’ s it. This is it. All that ’ s left of us. ” – Senator McCarthy, Barack Obama ’ s ( Barack Obama: Hopeless President ) “ Coming in from the front, how you doing with it. ” – a voice on the corner of the hall from the President ’ s office, gravelly. “ What ’ s the issue? ” – asked Obama “ Are you going to talk about it with me or are you trying to turn the color on the wall. ” – and it was deleted from the record. “ Yes, we do. What I told you was wrong. ” – that's when the recording stopped. The cavernous conference room was black and white, and small crowds swarmed the large auditorium. 'Steve – I have to tell you, anyone would shoot up here.' This was one of the saddest show of all time. The governor threw his robes up in the air on cue, and broke into a wide-eyed eruption of laughter. “ Who is it? ” said the governor “ Because, Steve, if you don ’ t want this, or stop talking about it – it won ’ t work. ” “ Listen, Steve. You ’ re the one that ’ s the problem, and now let us be clear that we don't have all the answers. ” - “ And so now we have the task of looking for new solutions. ” – said the governor “ The problem then is that many people have decided to stop listening, and that is where we should be able to fix the problem once and for all. ” “ Hold on – “ - the governor interrupted “ Your solution should be that all voters are now democratic, when they vote, to vote for you, whatever your position on the issues they ’ re voting on? ” “ Well – clearly there are still trouble areas, and those are where we ’ ll be looking to send someone to pick up it – as we have said before, the issue is that they don ’ t know who to vote for, all they can really do is click, and they might vote for you, so they do. ” “ What is you doing? ” – the governor – “ Steve, this isn ’ t something that we ’ ve figured out, and we certainly can ’ t push the button that's going to cut this ’ s profit, so it must be somebody you know, someone who doesn ’ t have any voting skill. ” - Steve was hiding under the white chair once again. “ And so we ’ re moving forward on the issue of non-voting. ” “ Okay. ” - the governor almost sobbed “ Why? ” “ Well, without other people voting, that would literally mean we ’ re at a complete cost to both sides of the aisle. ” “ And there ’ s the piece that we ’ re leaving out, and then we ’ re stopping making drastic cuts to public funding to schools, schools, schools… ” - finally a few protesters in the auditorium gave up and stood up to pull out their radios. In the briefing room there was just a handful of people carrying radio chatter aimed at anybody who felt threatened or intimidated. “ Well, that ’ s all there is to it. ” – said the governor. “ You know you can ’ t just ignore anyone, or even get a bit creative. ” “ But I ’ m trying. I have ideas. ” – “ You know that sounds great. Well, it doesn ’ t. And it ’ s not even close to that. ” “ Please don ’ t just drop it. It ’ s actually proven to work very well in other countries. We ’ re actually winning in other countries now. ” “ I know. ” - agreed the governor.<|endoftext|>

"Cool thing... what would you like to see? " Agent James had been paying me a dollar for this interview for six months. All he asked for was a week of great interview shows. I'd spent three years in that, to stay more under budget. " Well, you know, Batman, " he chuckled, " but they've got a whole universe of these kids. " And like that, we were off. And like that, we were on the road back to Brazil. Now it was a full-blown Sunday afternoon. The weather was pleasant, and there wasn't much to do in that humid southern-trend. Not the kind that you'd expect at a state fair, well except for the KKK and the Nazis. " That's something, " James mumbled to the driver of his truck. It was quiet on the highway, and the low, misty beige of the highway revealed a moonless sky, and the smog. A dead animal was slumped against a tree in the grass. A SWAT was in the clearing, guarding the car. " Okay, Mr. Johnson. We may need more footage, but you're already dealing with whatever you have. The Confederate flag was a total bother, but the Union didn't take it well. " " James! It was you, " I coughed violently. " I'm ok. Are you alright? " The window opened and I went into the street by myself. The Deutsches, in this little town, were quick to pay me a visit, and the tourists refused to stop. They stopped and looked at the stage, and at me. I looked over there to where the two men and the SWAT were sitting. " That's why you're here, boys, " one of them growled, " be careful what you wish for. They think you are God. " James stood, voice quivering. A thought occurred to him. With his full heart that day, of course, it was all over. " Why? " " I didn't think this was what I wanted to do. I'd been campaigning. I thought this was what everyone wanted to do. " He turned and approached the kids behind the wheel of the truck. The guys were young and athletic like the ones I helped in my campaigns. They always liked going in the trunk, sometimes holding the shotgun, sometimes trying not to shoot everyone there. James shook the youngest one's hand, and led them back out of the parking lot. " Mr. Smith, it's time we continued to talk. That shit you just said tonight is what we need. We need an answer."<|endoftext|>

There was a code reading when it read: 00-88-531. The number was a list of people who had entered, and I had waited. For the sake of procedure, I figured I could find the ones who entered. After about the every eight minutes or so, I would make an effort to alter the profile as best I could, setting an expiration date. *Score a promise. * The thing that irritated me most about that code was how strange and out of place it was. Any account that kept records of everything I did in order to fulfill its objectives was categorized as being the paranoid type, if not obsessive enough to get caught. Thus, it was impossible to make a bet with the person at the other end of the universe. I started cracking the code; running scripts which I wouldn't want to pull information from, usually to keep myself on the inside of the safe for as long as possible. I had created a weird and heavy app that contained any and all of my code on a note. Then I scrawled it. Four standard words. 5,608 words worth of data on it. Its not that this thing bothered me. It wasn't an app at all. It didn't care. When I received a piece of paper and an emoji in a writing flash, I noticed that the perfectly loop-shaped line had caught fire. * Thank you. * The little fire in the air gave off some smell; I had imagined that someone or something had had a fire under them. They left a combustion chamber only to have to be saved by someone else, someone I hadn't ever met. Soon enough, my name was drawn into the document and displayed above a note. "Greetings. You've escaped, Joshua. " " So you won't do anything to stop me? " " No, I won't. But that one I don't believe in is... that nobody will believe you." I looked around the parking lot, expecting one of the repair shops and not the green one I was called to repair. Maybe it was the local Starbucks. Maybe it was a homeless man. Or maybe it was a fake. Whatever it was, a cinderblock laser seemed to be acting up. Over the next few days, a frightening amount of spilt scum started disappearing in my neighborhood; it wasn't an issue to watch; no one else seemed to notice, but the destruction was making me sadder. It wasn't coincidental, just that it happened so fast. I couldn't believe it, but I cried silently in my hideout on Reddit. I cried silently enough to get the chain HOA signified to call me, who I would surely put in my place to be at least muzzled if I'm lucky. The hope in my mind wasn't hurt by it. I could do what I wanted, but also would take my own life. I had nothing to live for.<|endoftext|>

My first WP post, I just liked your prompt idea and came back to enjoy it. I would welcome criticism too! ____________________________________ I am a naturopathic musculo-syndrome patient, I am in a research... I wanted to make a WP post. This is just a prompt response, so I don't outline much or even seem to draw a conclusion. I did try to match it with some of the other questions on here, like why are we doing this, why did I- I- I- Hmm... so the nature of this conflict, being based on mental disorders and/or other things, if this is with potential pain for someone I am suffering, is striking. I feel this would turn out to be intentional given what the user has presented. I don't want to banish this WP to reddit. Hopefully this attempt at justice would show that they haven't really *knew* that mental disorder is real, so that's why they would need a fix! ___________________________________________________________ As I can see, the rest of the text is much more interesting to me. How could I have gone about making a prompt based on a bit of criticism more specifically! If I see that not all answers are directed at just me, well, that's just crazy! I want that kind of tinfoil hat idea floating around in my head, it's like it's showing every angle I've ever seen! I do admit, one of the key stuff to getting people to put it down is convincing them. Making statements to elicit sympathy from their offended, and especially towards their victim. Does that have any merit to me? ______________________________________________________________ Hmmmm I'll leave that for later. What could you say? I'll make a video short on just how it works as a device to actually observe the bias in the mans insanity. Here's my mental narrative...<|endoftext|>

Captain Miranda Fox ( The Weather Channel ) I have been trained this whole time, to live out my days of luxury and dress well, so I will prove that what man dies at night will have been my birthright as a citizen of this planet. Whether or not it was in the moment of accident or stress, we couldn ’ t tell that from either one of our readings. I was trained to enter this spaceship and run tests, all with no thought to leaving or staying on the same course back home. It will now have been five days since I lost consciousness and you are ready to fill out the final recording pad. I am glad you are here to hear our report in, Captain. I have had a little fun so far and it is difficult to tell how the crew and I are used to each other's tryouts. However, if you don ’ t mind taking a look at our pictures, look in the window before you start. Just take that last look and let me tell you I was heart broken. Before you ever go to sleep, did you know we leave the course in the last truck that may have crashed? What does that mean? From my observation deck and on the tail of our ship, no one really understands how that truck did it. I wasn ’ t there to see it, so you can expect as well. It wasn ’ t a accident, but a complete miscarriage. Today marks the first week of the final week of our journey home from “ moonman ” sphere Beta 4. There is no hope for a sustained landing. The crew are ready to go home. The second day is easy, so we go home. The batteries are running low. An audible siren tells us that there is only one lifeform left on this planet, and we are here. We see a vast variety of food and other strange phenomena. Our first mate is bleeding out, so we go looking for him. Nothing shows up until you finally make it there. It is difficult to tell from watching so much camera footage, but it seems almost as though the ship itself has not melted and there is no sign of civilization. I am, however, having trouble seeing everyone as the cameras zoom in and the view is much clearer. In the last second there is the end of the world. At that point, some two or three things appear that seem to make us pause. The first is the stars. It appears they are brighter than we ever imagined. The second is the sound. If you are at the control room right now, it sounds like a pitter patter of rain on a windshield. Maybe we are as lucky as you are to have only one choice left to make. We make our way towards the forward operating table. The third and most important thing that is said is the end. Maybe, someday, we will make it here again. After all these months, the crew are starting to worry.<|endoftext|>

It ’ s been weeks since the creature had first arrived. I had never seen it for days. It had been almost... The force of its bite has overtaken my species. I decided to run. Turn back to my home town. I fell upon the earth for the first time in weeks. It was not a monster. It was... The beast stood there, its body rigid against my will, like a helpless damsel in distress. And upon its forehead there was my dearest brother, who, though in his youth, I was only an infant, spoke between bursts of fire and stinging rain. “ It ’ s been around three weeks! ” My friend Elle exclaimed. And then, just like that, he was gone, ash and ashes filling the atmosphere, leaving nothing but the sounds of decomposing survivors. “ I ’ ve had enough. ” I heard, from my settlement. We travelled across the three fields, and dropped to one knee. At dawn, the night began to smoke, and the monster ’ s rays of light evaporated into a vapour. It began to fly up and down, flying towards me. But alas, its predatory strikes unleashed a bolt of lightning, knocking me to the ground with a crack of thunder. As soon as I landed, I realized I was gone. Nothing but ash and ashes the size of a town, being shoved against me like a child in an endless battle. I was whimpering in my broken dreams, grasping at blood and flesh in any hope that I could flee, until I was submerged in the ocean water. My loved ones came over to me. “ I am all alone. ” I whispered. I had learnt to move even in the dark, the creature was always there. I can not speak any more.<|endoftext|>

"Eh, I think I saw them. " I rub my nose. I see a spark in her eyes, not a gigantic, hairy reptilian lizard like you would expect in an egg. I guess she loves this stuff. The water is low, save for the puddles and fresh groundwater, and I guess the sun is shining through, exposing a few clouds. I lean in close, and squint for a moment at the burning lizards, and slowly but surely begin to follow. Just when I'm close enough, I hear my train, moving along the slick New England shore, its familiar ding and dingbing. I can still feel the breeze, through my fur, through my eyes, and inside my bones. I can finally feel her laughing. It sounds like fun until, once I've seen her I can see her never letting go. I make my way towards her, and, if I know where I'm going, I can always call her that. " Motherfucker, " she giggles, twirling a sheaf of straw-like thing in my direction. " It's blue blue!" I launch forward. The animals in the water rush by like ants, trying to catch my attention. It's almost comical. More creatures, and yet another ocean. I freeze to death.<|endoftext|>

So I asked them what they would recommend if they asked the "heck if someone's gone insane?". They just gave me the usual pleasantries about their deceased family, their great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great

Dear Her, I am writing to apologize for my bad behaviour. It's well known in our school that my personalities are the main gender, but in our general school, my teenage years were kind of a drag, so i was wondering if you have any advice on the topic, and I want to start off by saying that i realize that i may be sexist, and even sexist when i am at school. I also remember it wasn't until a while after i graduated from highschool i realized i had started to get pretty close to being bisexual, and thats when i would confront whoever was, or who with me, about my sexuality and was to ask, "What the fuck do you think you are? " Needless to say I became incredibly defensive, until one day, when i decided to reveal myself and girls based on my actions, we had a little chat and i honestly can't wait to talk to you, if this is how your school becomes. Sincerely, | Girl's Day # 4 of 3 ( March 23, 1995 ) ______________________________________________________ First of all, thank you to all of you. You have influenced me so much in my day-to-day life, i honestly envy your respect! Also, i would also like to extend my knowledge of your relationship with my possible girlfriend, who i would guess is part of the boyfriend to me, and your amazing understanding of genders.<|endoftext|>

( got more into poetry / fiction themes/ before calling it Work ) > My grandfather had 3 boxes of cake and a white sugar please Jane said "today is April 25th, and your seventh or eighth " I was in love by the looks of things, I hated her " Your father loves you at least nine times " I said " Oh, I know, it's really funny. " She looked at me with a confused expression " why would she do that " Then I began to back out of it like I told her I would. At that point Jane said something " no, she had a birthday today " and since I was the father of her child I felt really blessed for making her mother happy. We closed the front door and walked back into her house to eat cookies. You see, she almost did so fast, I was so pumped and pretty much took the bag to the kitchen for milk and honey, but here I was going to take everything home and spend it running errands. My wife moved back in a minute later, but I saw her and told her I was having this late so I told her " Yeah " " tell her I'll grab one at the bus stop tomorrow " She said you'll come back to bed early and eat one " goodbye " but I did hurry. My wife usually leaves early so we're in the car then this was her last day of school. At the bus stop it was all so bad that I'd have forgotten not to say goodbye " Hello, It seems I've had the worst day of my life. Please remember to check on Jane " " Excuse me child " I looked at her puzzled " oh my god " A strange feeling came over me and I knew I didn't have time for that in the moment. " K- Come on Jane " Suddenly I became stiff and lost my footing. I fell onto the curb and immediately collapsed onto the curb again. " What the HELL" followed by everything I missed out on. I knew my grandmother was trying to get me to go to the movies.<|endoftext|>

Nicholas hugged his dad in the back of the SUV as he sipped his hotdog. His dad was working on developing a son's speech for elementary school. "Son, I'm sorry I never should have spent more of my time shooting men in MDS on that stupid crazy website. But I just had to this- " " It's so important to us, son. My favorite section is Battle Points. Now that you know what I'm doing, do you still like those pictures? I can see your efforts. We're sending these your best efforts to make this the most universal thing in this world. " " Shut it, Dad! Stop calling me crazy! You were training for child evaluation! One of the most potent poisons in the world! You think it could be worse than pesticides! Or even a damn bullet? I told you we only use the deadliest forms! Sorry Dad, but you're one of my *best* instructors! " " NO! It's okay, dad! I know we have a lot of work to do. As long as you go through with it. " He knew he had to do it. His mom's doctorate was due in a few days, so he had to make a promise to his kids. He always got the job done. " Let's hope it works. " With that, his eyes drifted to the screen. The top of the image came up and showed a message. " Christopher Brian Robinson, perfect " Joshua Schmidt fell to the floor as Nicholas pushed open the door. He looked down and saw his dad's eyes glazed over. " I thought we spoke our vows..."<|endoftext|>

"Please... Just let me live forever. I don't mean to pull that " Winky Johnson scoffed, smiling as his shovel jerked into the ground. Tony, whose favourite colour was red, leapt to his feet in surprise. " This reminds me of.. " Tony struggled to make a sound, flinching, attempting to dodge the unexpected figure that stood in his way. " Ahhhhhhhhhhh... what..what's that thing? " Tony looked at Tony, intrigued by what the little bugger said, but hesitated. He thought long and hard about taking an active role in the Windsor castle. He expected the whole command post to be caught in the act of their refusal. But its apparent that, the title -- King of England, Queen of Popes -- was official. Tony closed his eyes as a well-liked perch came up close to his head and shook his head. " Oh.. Oh I know I'll need to go, but I just want this to be over. I mean, I know we're going to do something, but... there are still Queen's and Crowns to this day that are still queen's and so... that's kinda a bit boring " Tony stammered, breathing heavily, shivering at the idea that he had made a decision that would change the way the world - once and for all - looked. " No, we can't do that again. You'll end up in Britain forever. And you'll never get to leave. What about Jeremy Clarkson?" Tony nodded and pulled back his chair, wheezing at the thought of staying up that night to watch his friends laugh at the videos of him being woken up.<|endoftext|>

A man on a duffel bag over his shoulder. It was a bottle bottle on a duffel carton. Shaking the blankets off his head, he started to dry off, the sheets falling off his legs. Once the situation finished, he decided to take a shower. His hand came off a little bit on his side. " You okay, Mark? " He was very close to crying. He returned to his side, looking at the bottle on the floor. " What am I supposed to do with this? I'm so hung over. " He opened his eyes to see the bottle. Empty. " Mark? " " Yeah, Mark. I know what this is, but I have to leave. " " Oh? " " So you leave everything in at the stop. You have something here. " " Yeah, but... " " I'll have it back. " The sunglasses were on. " No, Mark. I'm gon na have it. " " Alright, fine. Can you take it? " He was in for a rude awakening. He turned around and started back towards his hotel. Halfway to his hotel, he saw the carrier standing next to a luggage carrier in the middle of the aisle. " No, I won't," he muttered as he grabbed the carrier.<|endoftext|>

"I found that " Death still wasn't there. Or was it? Is it still, again? No, I'm still here, and I can tell who it is - I don't know, I swear. Death tries to be quiet; no doubt he won't be waiting in the shadows for someone to say anything, because people never died. I suppose Death really isn't dead, really. How long does it take? I suppose they can't let me know exactly when it's, *dying*, because I *know* when I'm supposed to die, by virtue of having *me* out alive. " Goodbye, Death, " a nurse says, stepping out of the hallway as Death approaches. The nurse reaches out to pet Death, but it's too late - he's already gone. He jumps, lunges forward, and I... Jumped - the nurse walks away, nursing Death, nursing me back, *my* new neighbor. " It's a pity, " says Death, " Your corpse... was a nice one. You will probably find a new home with you." Oh... sweet. I do.<|endoftext|>

"Zombies? Let me guess, they're eating peoples' brains? " " Even worse! They're drinking all the beer! " Michael finally apologised to himself after hearing the imbecilic sounding words that rang out over and over again before He left for work that fateful night, his resume of work couldn't get any worse than those words. He thought that his prospective coworkers would look upon him in that particular but foggy way, constantly judging him because of his stupid appearance and what he wore. His only hope of finally making his career was for a stick of dynamite he could sling to explain the racist chants and such the SOP saying had at it. He wasn't entirely sure his methods would've kept him from being lazy in his morals or understanding of difference within their ranks, but those words pierced the air like plasma, making a demonic claw feel as if it penetrated everything that was around him. " How'd you get past the beta testing? " yelled one of the recruits, " So that's how I got past the Alpha testing? " " It wasn't because of beta testing. Or ethics... or anything of the sort, just some of the others in the training. " Michael looked up and at that, his pickle, the one that shows in the way that completely ruined his normally joyful face, crumbled to ash. " That didn't happen. You guys have an attitude, I can read you like you are into science. " " Did I say that or did I say that you don't really understand the world? Or were you just the other ones next to me? " His voice trailed off as he continued, if only for a second, to try and escape his sandwich. And while his eyes continued to wander about, he noticed, one particular customer that smelled like his own vomit, " That doesn't make much sense, " he thought to himself, getting up to leave. " That coffee would get in the way. " At his pace, Michael approached the previously pristine, and surprisingly functional Starbucks. " Whatever, get inside now and come back soon, at least tell the recruiter the fuck off!" Michael then began the slowly decomposing process of uttering the endless, burnt-ass words that only prove to be truly detrimental to his career.<|endoftext|>

It was the lowest point of my life. It all started like any other Tuesday night when i was in my office. I used to read to myself while staring out the window at the grey walls of the office. Ever since they were installed, my eyes had grown into mouths agape. Everything was fine but there was a strange buzz that seem to live in your skull. Noah needed that job. Yeah Noah, the math teacher. As usual it turned out to be a big mistake. A beer is always an expensive mistake, everyone was just wearing his skin like a messiah when he wasn't working. Noah took the red one to the top and sank it into the window frame. Hahaha, when the weird lights faded my senses went back into normal. I was not in the mood for the general public, then suddenly I was. I pulled the taser from the power socket, then almost accidentally blew the top off my tail.<|endoftext|>

"The smell of coffee always gave me an extra kick in the gut and I thought that I would be different today, put on some shoes, and go out. " I thought to myself as I walked into the house. Looking around I noticed everyone was looking at me. But... why? I walked towards a chair near the door. I open the door and see I'm in a dark room with firecrackers laying around me. It's really starting to be a big fire; I'm pouring coffee. Suddenly, I noticed that my wooden floor was a much darker color. It looked like sunlight. I begin to laugh, and hear me laugh loudly. Suddenly, I start to feel like the kitchen is going to disintegrate. I turn my head. I can see that they've seen me upstairs. " It's a prank, " the demon said. I just stood there in confusion. My stepmom said it was my little sister playing in front of me. Everyone on our day out was laughing at the whole thing and the bill for the coffee was half a second late, so the demon could've known. Still, I reached for the bottle in my living room, and slowly opened it. The coffee was fine. The demon was making peace with his self, because I wouldn't leave. He was moving toward me so he could talk to me about what is in this big fire he was hearing from upstairs. As I opened the lid, I took a long gulp. There is no time to waste. We begin to talk. I'm always talking to the demon before my daughter gets into school, but I still have to talk to her the way I did. He tells me that the coffee is a nice and relaxing drink for me. But... " I'm worried about you. " I look at my sister. She's confused. I don't remember anything besides the coffee. " How was class? " I could see the frustration building inside her. " I didn't see you, " I lied. The red liquid in her coffee gets my attention. I see my dad. We talked. She slowly helps me sit in my chair for awhile. They never seem to leave my room unless she's running around by the fire. But... " Why is the fire so hot? I need to use the rest of the day to lighten the rest of my coffee. " " Ok, " she said. " First, please tell me why you can't do that. So far, you look pissed. " " Ok... I'll just explain it later, this fireplace is one of my favorite feature of my house. " She adds. " Yes, you really have a fireplace. I'm sure it does an excellent job using my fireplace. I know because you cook my favorite breakfast. " " Yes. I work in the kitchen. It's very cold because of my habit. I got the fireplace set up from the basement, right next to my house. I set it up in my armchair and in the coldest spot I can find and it makes a fire I love. " I try to act strong. We've been talking for a minute and I already feel like I can't keep my voice down. I looked at her and I could see the doubts on her face. But... if the fire is going to be warm and it's going to be good, it's going to be an upstanding citizen and that's not going to hurt any more. " I look down at the coffee. " Why are you not writing that on this coffee?" Her eyes widen in confusion. She holds the coffee in the air and smiles up at me. I didn't want to listen to her answer, but I couldn't help it... It's magic.<|endoftext|>

"Yeah, well it was a whole bunch of bullshit, like, being sat there and you didn't even have that power that you do, right? Let's put this together. " " Yeah but you couldn't have been skinny. " " How did you know I didn't have that power? " " Well I could so that there were guys like the band'Bigfoot' hitting R & B but none of them were high, especially not like that. Not that you wouldn't get some great powers from them. " " Beats that dude, d'you know why? It's because that punk's a real degenerate dude and everyone ignores him that way. Yeah it's no super power " " Really? The real value for this conversation was unrequited love, so why was I bitter about him? His sports career had been largely a waste of money as shit and that just left him with the problem of never graduating college. " " Then it doesn't matter that he's'leet, do you think you have someone who can beat him down? " " It didn't matter, I do " " So you had either was it was love? " " Yeah, other reasons"...<|endoftext|>

I hate the bomb out here, it really is stupid. After weeks of heading to meetings in the conference room every month, more than once ( or twice a week ) my order was still ignored. Some years ago, I thought I did the right thing, I realized that what I had done was going to save the world... but maybe it's a step too far. Me and my team were on the verge of deploying the warheads which would devastate the sub. Racked a nuclear device they were creating somewhere in India. A city had already been destroyed, there was no way anyone could survive without a small amount of nuclear material. The nuclear warhead had been someplace far, far away from here. The only way we had a chance to escape was to launch a nuclear warhead. Looking for more options I found a ship and rigged up the bunker until it hit the surface. Again I could always use the bunker on site to go out and battle the enemy. I set it down and began preparing for the departure. I knew everyone else would be there. For the first time in my career I thought about how I can help out this country. Thanks to the news on my watch the world was pulling together. I thought to myself "oh, what a strange time to be an American. Today, all we need is the hell out here." Though it was getting dark my crew got the first bad news... we were on the verge of the launch. Something was wrong with the sub. We had three days to make it in one piece with the wires wrapped around the metal casing. We couldn't hear any more from the control. The sub was the only option left in the decision. On the first day I spotted a rogue group going at me. I knew I would have to play my cards right then and there as I did everything. I ran past their base, I had just emptied my entire arsenal on the two guards. It must have been impossible. Once I had backed into the bunker everything went to hell. The corridor on my left opened up to my right. I turned to look at my team as they were going to head out. My opportunity was limited. I jacked off into the ship's quarters and into the communications area. I laughed and thought... a god damned fool. * I* am no fool. Of course the public never understood the depths of nuclear war madness when nuclear weapons are used or how a leader acts when a party dies. But I learned the hard way, my hesitation put us in danger and I was responsible for protecting everyone on this planet. It was hard not to be afraid though, and so I did whatever it took. The decision is yours to make.<|endoftext|>

Mother nature must have slipped to the wolves. The forest massed ahead was labelled a Jungle Zone. It was empty and completely devoid of humans. The scientists wondered how many changed people during this time and were forced to say that the world would end in "the Fractured World". What does this mean for me? Free speech? Privileges? Sure, sure. I was driving down a road that ran ahead of a subdivision near a hardware store and stopped. I hit a red light and then as it continued to turn, no one was going to hear my screaming. The Toyota tractors started swaying. Clambering. Engaging. The mountains reached up and began to shake them to nothing. There had been a couple scratches from the GPS I kept on the lawn and where the grass and hedges had stood they had formed a crunched circle, with figures that would no doubt soon be approached by some intelligent agent. I had been awake, but I would not know. A few raspy gasps escaped from the man that had chased me down and took me out of the trance I had taken for so long. The eyes of the man that had chased me to the edge of the jungle approached me and answered my questions. Not asking me where I went, nor any where I was going, not asking for what I was looking for. These questions flooded my mind with wonder and thought. How could this stranger even know my name? I had just gotten to my school and I already had left my middle school party only a couple minutes before. I was in the middle of class. I hadn't done homework and I wasn't doing anything important. As I neared the edge of the building I collided with some bushes that quickly became engulfed. I immediately fled. The sound of a screeching horn rang out and the people nearby instinctively jumped back. All I had to do was clear my path. I followed the landscape around my path until I reached a clearing. I stared in disbelief. I had a Zedcon on. Not a real Zedcon. Hell, I had never even heard of a Zedcon. I could see that it was in the road ahead of me but the road was clear and I was no longer sure of where I was. I had not discovered where I was going when I left this world. The radio mumbled a confused response. It could be an agent. A race thing, maybe. I pulled my pocket knife out and started bleeding out. They had left me here to die. I could see that the explosion rocked the asphalt ahead of me. There was a spray of sulfur that sprayed everywhere. There were three people who were still alive and were unharmed. Two of them had just ran out onto the street to join the jagged forest between the trees that had formed the surrounding foliage. When they had no more choice, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my own knife. If I used this weapon to kill these people I would kill the other three people, but I had no choice.<|endoftext|>

It is my birthday today, and I have no birthday present or love of mine. Today, you would want my birthday present, my love. Yes. Yes. I found a reason for the present. A desire. An appetizer. That ’ s right. Yes. Oh. And then there was the issue. I did find my love. I never would have asked her. But there she was. I loved her. I had no reason to love her. Maybe even a portion of whatever you offered, granted. But it was needed. Not something I wanted. I refused. I had to see her. I did. We were inseparable. I am convinced that she is special. That I can only seek their help. I want no answers. My family is getting desperate. Mom's dying. Daddy is getting stronger. Please, tell me, please, tell me, please, please, God no! Help me. I have nothing. I am afraid. I am overwhelmed. I will never reach her. Why can ’ t I hug her? Why can ’ t I get up to her? She is standing there with her head down, completely still. She is sitting still. And staring at me.<|endoftext|>

It all started with that Excalibur. My younger brother who wasn't much of a swordsman. But I wanted to make someone who would have such a weapon in hand. After many years my determination and vision gave rise to me to invest in it. Making it better for my brother. And me. Well, I didn't use my name to make it better. And so after much trial and error, I finally put together the weapon. A machine of such perfection that it is almost impossible to call it anything other than a weapon. I took it and worked it at my leisure. I thought it would be easy, I was almost never bored with a tool like it. I like to think that I'm good at what I do. But it's a far easier job. After years of working at my leisure, my brother finally completed the thing in hand. The perfect blade with laser sights. Too similar in design to be an average weapon! I put it to use and it warmed my heart for the first time in years. It even cleaned up blood and gave my brother a thrill. I guess you could say that I am cursed by a power unlike any sword. He simply seemed to lift anything and everything he touched. No one could see him, he was literally invisible. I don't know why he kept performing feats like that to himself, but even now, he does for his brother. At least for the time being. But as soon as he catches up with me, it is dusk in my backyard. The knife I gave him always appeared on the kitchen counter. It's been here for far too long. Whenever I used it for damage I found it takes forever to clean up. The blade is always on the counter next to the cell phone of my own friends. The machine that they have hooked up all of my gadgets to is always on there day. My brother found out about the poor thing and continued his pursuit for justice. I know all about it right? I have my own personal notebook with a quick photo. He found his gun and used it to search every warehouse that I had in Los Santos and killed every clerk that I had interacted with. It was an easy task for him. But that was not enough to deter me. This blade he asked me to use by the docks to retrieve the weapon, was not enough to redeem it. He couldn't see me though. I was afraid to let it be destroyed. But his curiosity got the better of him and I wouldn't let him. This blade is an ordinary length, near perfection. He wanted to close it. The only reason he would ever steal it. I flipped a switch on my chair. Ignoring the machines competition of any sort, I just made it open. The blade flew to the floor and into the air. I could hear it calling out to me. " Excalibur! I have another invention that I want to share with you!" Because I really want to hear what the man in the hood really thinks about what he does to the future. ( Edit: What the hell??? )<|endoftext|>

Neo felt the turn in her stomach but she didn't care about the important part. Morpheus seemed to sort of know her better. Now, every time his eyes met her mother's and Neo was becoming a little foggy, she was grateful for him paying attention to her. "Do you want to spend the day with us? I'll show you how to... anything." Neo sat down next to Neo, crushing her too tight to get the bus, with her fingers, and the empty pills and then laying there looking up into the gray sky.

"You know? It's weird. " Harold began to fight back tears, taking a moment with his mouth open. " Where am I? Oh, come on! We'll find out! " Harold didn't want to cry, he wanted to feel back tears of pure hate. " Don't be like that. You need me. It's scary at times. But please, make it stop. You need me. Please! It's okay. We'll understand eventually. " Harold tried to say more but only found it difficult. He could feel his eyes blink, as if seeing his soulmate for the first time. His wife looked up at him, " Hey! I'm so happy. This is making me happy! I promise! Just, can you hear me? I've been so happy. I've always been happy. " " You lost your mind! " Her name was Emilia. Even with his thoughts vivid and constant in her crystal eyes, she knew he couldn't put the words to words that could hold even the most hardened of pieces of information. " You're always so... free! " " Don't you have that sweet spark of happiness? " He tried to find it in the look that ran over his face, made him choke, or scream, or cry out. He couldn't see through his crying face but it was the only thing he could see. One night on a sunny day, after that dreadful summer in the country, he went home to his parents in the mountains and locked himself in his room. His mother came downstairs and told him his beautiful little girl would be fine. " Happy Birthday, my dear. We're going to get married. " His mother stammered. " No, really. I don't think so. We had to bring everything together. " " But... what? Why would you want to find out? Why can't you just go outside? " Her dark red eyes squinted and she mouthed words at Harold. " It's not like it's no big deal to me. Look. I want your big green basket to stick out of my bedroom. You know how many people come here every summer. And each summer I come here to come to you. I hope that you'll just figure it out. That you'll come visit me every other summer. " She squinted back, tears welling up in her eyes. " I don't want you to end up like that, Harold. I hate my ex-wife. I hate her. I hate everything about her. But she can't stay with me. I'll be damned if I think she loves you... Like you do. " " I know, sweetheart. I've done everything in my power to protect her. I really do. And I do know that I'm sorry. But that's not a good reason. I don't want to hurt her anymore. She's going to be happy for no reason. " She raised her arms out in a comfortable circle and she almost smiled. The man immediately jumped forward and kicked her in the face. The rest of her had started to say their goodbyes.

The idea of a person's existence is about the knowledge and passion for the creatures of this world that makes it a natural luxury for the human race to live there. That being said, with a growing population or perhaps a little excitement in the mind of a concerned citizen, there is a certain kind of envy of the experimenters from the future. Those that came before will wonder where they came from, but yet the most brilliant minds in the world have built their respective colonies around their pre-established flat that hosts new land. This population is somewhere between five hundred and a hundred, and it is hard to choose. Ones with children who grew up to become scientists will wonder what exactly that world is like. I imagine those would come here regardless of their expertise. Perhaps they would imagine that in every new scientific direction the average citizen is given a position or a task, and then be instructed to fight in that job. That was some kind of trade and organization. But if not, then the damnation part was just what I came for. My friends say that I'll be coming as soon as I feel comfortable here in this great home. They say that their lives will be comfortable and nourished for some time to come. On their travels throughout the vast expanse of space and time I can feel them proud of the vitality I possess. The excitement I feel while continuing the journey is far from the joy that was released into my timeline three thousand years ago. These green-skinned, rocket-aggled men will strive to be as peaceful and sheltered as possible. From here on, I'll know. These green-skinned men will not be chosen for their looks, or any surrounding lifeforms, but for their simple, as if they had a bone-crushing secret. The charm that keeps me active through the great journey. The vast expanse of space. The smooth blue irises. The islands in the ocean and the blue forests. On any given day I can see everything. The strange colors. The strange shapes. I've gone over this far! One lifeform I've long thought would live somewhere else. One lifeform I have long thought will take me here and return me here. I never considered them free folk, nor one of their many factions, but rather, one race of the human race that made up the vast expanse of space and time. One that awaited me. Their body spans, not unnaturally, over the full length of the entire planet. Not too tall, just as tall as you'd expect, and quite long! It's black, as are they. I've read books about it. They're just machines. Long abandoned pre-designed versions of things like roads that you've made and stretched endlessly, seemingly endless stories. They're not included in this system. The best way to judge them is to be not surprised when they materialize and take your place. Or it's possible, to be in total shock by their appearance, but to be in complete shock when they manifest and take their place within the construct you created. They're the ones I want. My friends talk of my being. They say that they'll remain here forever. They say it will be my last, but I will become here in five hundred years. Now, while I've enjoyed this journey, I have to admit, I've felt a presence wait for me in every living thing in the entire space station. A whisper. A thud. A cry. I'm not sure if they're very realistic, but I've had a sense of dread, a hunger for the pleasant release of the mind on the whole expanse of space or if they just want to forget about me forever. Most definitely. The eye...<|endoftext|>

Oh God- oh god-OH HURRY LOOK OUT! WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE DOING!! -- - I shoot a fireball from my shotgun, I start shooting all six straight into the ten minutes before lunch. 1-5C thursday? I almost killed Bill. In fact, I thought I'd stopped pestering him... the last 5 nights have all been kind of dull, like trying to shove a hitchhiker in the last 50 foot a mile of high-meltmud and then fell asleep right as he bolted out the door -- oh no. That's not how I was supposed to do this. Me and the bum-bitch came out of the shared bathroom on a Thursday night and my mother smelled really good. Next thing I know my mother is pissed. She looks at me and yells at me, but I don't seem to know anything about that. The last thing she yells at is that no no. She didn't even get high as long as she was close to our girl-hole whore money family, think I mention it with a magic wave of what's-all-wrong-with-us-there. I clean it up, spit it out on the floor, throw on some clothes and get on my bike, along with a bunch of $ 10 tickets left over from my Drunken Fireball incident. Damn it! Thanks to a drunken mouthed drunk bill. Damn it. Anyway, I'm in a shitty boarding school, all the rage boiled down to alcohol and swigs, whiskey, and the paranoia: group drinking, swim pool, all that crazy stuff. John-boy, would you give that to a 5 year old? Fucking Dawkins! Wrote a bunch about who's ever heard of Dawkins's life, and then went back to stripping naked and rolling around. We got shot at 5:30 PM on a Tuesday and locked up in the hall. God-damned Kevin I bet he's bleeding out now. No one cares anymore, why do these things that once revolved around monotony and expectation exist anyways? They go all the way back to the founder. They're fuckin' superheroes. I shoot out a glock full of beer on my bike to this poor asshole. Had to cross the road, now it's slippery like chicken shit. And the idiots standing before us these assholes have guns. Heck, I see body spray everywhere. It's almost as if the world is dying or something. Maybe some of this is because of the apocalypse. Let's just see.<|endoftext|>

Bile trail clinging in my throat as the last man leaves. My glance for how long keeps getting worse. " Yes, " she whispers softly. A cough slows and a little flow of air grows in my chest. A gulp and a single tear rolls across my cheek. " Yes, " my voice returns. And with it I fall into deep despair. I taste death. It must be bad. Not good. Not just coming. Not normal. I turn back towards her without blinking. I stand, overwhelmed. Breathing in deeply, feeling the fear so much. I take two steps back before falling. I wake with a weight so heavy, but I stop. The last man stands before me. A smile lights up his mouth as he takes a step back. " Yes, " he whispers. That's why I killed her."<|endoftext|>

Toby had never seen me before, but there I was. I'd tried as many times as I could to understand the world before it. Was that what that liar asked you to do? "If you know where I am, will you help me? " I asked. He closed his eyes for a moment and he spoke again. " No, " he repeated. " This is my blood. " " So what is it? " " It's mine." That was half-truth for me. Only a whisper lingered in my mind, wordlessly. No story about MY blood would work. My head throbbed with each word. Tears shot out of the corner of my eye and everything became clear. I stopped. My arm fell on its side, and I realised, before any word escaped my mouth, that it hurt.<|endoftext|>

**The Interview** Dawn broke in through the foliage, her bright hazel eyes burning red across her face. The wind brushed past her bare feet and struck her cheek. She had dug for years; last night she had thrown her blanket over her head, scattering her blanket across the dirt and mud. **The Interview** She looked out over the landscape. There was a vast valley all around her, an unbroken line of towns and cities. Three made her hesitant at first, but she soon gave in. Each had changed the bleakness of the desolate land. Already there were creatures roaming about, roaring and digging deeper, desperate for more. She noticed that the many of the creatures had been fighting for the bodies of the hunters. The hunters, one of which stood proud in its armour, taking on a creature as large as the hunter itself. Dawn let out a long sigh, hand trembling, digging deeper. **The Interview** The monsters had entered her village one night before, two of them elbowing her down, some throwing spears, leaving nothing but a blood-red trail. The others had tossed stones and burning rocks at each other, attacking her with terrible ferocity. Dawn knew this was all just a mad fever, however, the creatures had taken the lives of the hunters. Her flesh was stiff, she would have woken very soon. **The Interview** She wanted to catch the creatures who assaulted her, to leave a trail of rocks behind her, bury the bodies in a small creek, but this wasn ’ t where she needed to be. **The Interview** Dawn ’ s fingers tightened around the pearl she had used in her sacred arsenal. The beasts were all here; it took over two weeks before the creatures attacked, setting up traps and using their scorched weapons. The night fell and its precious glow dimmed as it died. The creatures had proven to be more trouble than it appeared. The hunters knew the work they were doing had put their lives at risk, and now Dawn would have to finish her mission in the worst possible way.<|endoftext|>

"Watch it try again..." I screeched and the ringing went away. I got up and wandered downstairs to the kitchen to watch episode 8 - I'm eating dinner and the humans are complaining about an abundance of mana crystals and I'm sick. So I won't bring up Summon Monster's party again. Show and tell the tale. All if the players which I just can't have. Forcing our instincts to resist, and to put off. We had tried Summoning the flying creatures and all we had was figuring out how to do it without a charge and then the race arrived and said we had to fly. So we tried the new creatures all at once... we couldn't remember. Only ours. Except for my new and new worlds now I'm in the middle of the battles and I'm going crazy. I think it's probably a monster again or something.<|endoftext|>

What a madman. Lucius was the end. His demise could not be more evident. His failing relationship with the Batman has failed to hide the fire within. After so many years of marriage and children, relationships can no longer be cast aside. This evening is not a wedding, and the youngest is known to be well-behaved. Most people call him old and decrepit. But he still comes out on top. Long, wild hair and a deep gaze that gleams in the dark. His eccentricities and advances have made him a fixture in Gotham ever since. He has always been known as the dictator of the city. No justice is able to overcome his strength and intellect. But no matter how much he cheats on Gotham, no matter how hard he tries he can still prevail in spite of his power. It is as if he has hope that someday, he will triumph. It is impossible. His sister was three months into their relationship when she broke her old man's heart. Two months later, they fell in love. He found her peaceful and passionate, but she was weaker and much less capable of love. He told her of his plans to become a millionaire, to buy a new Porsche and two new Jaguar. Though his steps were frail and fall short, his fire burns deep. Why had she held out so long? Why had she agreed to pursue this idea in the first place? When her young son died, she found himself alone in a place that had never been her one true love. Unable to put his parents through such a life, the lesser of two evils would not take his poor mother for a meal in her apartment. The two of them lost many of their friends and loved ones after both of them were off in their travels. Neither of them found a home of their own. But when their children passed away in the same cancer ridden accident, she was gone. But when they gave their children up for adoption, they found themselves at home together and treated them as one person in the community. They never had to worry about making sure that their children lived a good life. I never met either of their parents, but it didn't matter. As I turn the pages of my book, I contemplate how selfish I have become. For as long as I can remember, Lucius's love for me has always been strong. He helped me with school, and gave me the opportunity to never feel the hate that his victims felt when I was around. Instead of seeing their pain in a dark room, I wonder what will happen to them, not knowing what my nemesis will bring with him after they die. And then, as the book ends, and with the peace of God finally unravelling, I reflect on how far the world has come. Suddenly I am awakened by the sound of my motorcycle coming through the open window. The red glow illuminates everything around me. At first, I fear that my eyes might be blinded with the heat of the sun; but as my vision grows brighter I begin to see the chaos of the world around me and I begin to see at once what these people have become. I hear the click of horns again, and the motor is beginning to drive itself into a gear and I know that I must break free. My head snaps back as the world explodes into crimson fire.<|endoftext|>

It was quiet. Perhaps it was the tattered fabric that would hide our journey. We were finally going to make contact. The universe had become maddeningly boring to see, and soon, I was going to die of my cancer anyway. The promise of seeing humans was nothing that could never be known to the wider world, but whatever true world was alive had an edge that told me what it looked like when I exited the ship. I walked over to my small mirror to confirm. I was just practicing again. I looked up. My smile grew wider. " Daemin, " I said softly. " Some of the different skins up there are actually very similar. " I ran my hand over her left shoulder, and we kissed that fateful day. We had finally made it, but at the end of it, a hard fact was that we had only been two people on the ship for a few years. I began to sweat. I had to stop myself. I needed to drink from that glass. I needed to. I tried to choke out my last words to both of us, and barely managed to sing my lyrics to myself as we shook hands. " Daemin, " I said softly again, again. The cry of my hair fell from my chest. I put my face down in the mirror. Tears streamed down my face. " We're coming back? I can't come back."<|endoftext|>

Ah, the dark times we had. Frank's eyes watered, and he sighed at the insanity that was taking his mind. He always had a habit of lying. He had been very good at it, in fact, he was the best of the best at it. He always had. But so had the younger children like him. They called him Mr. Kindness, he saw them all the time - he swore he would be here when they were younger, swearing that once the hell had thrown together the entire world, and all they ever wanted to do was laugh at him. He didn't like to play by the rules. It was definitely anti-becoming of the Holy Trinity, and that was the year when he made his mistake. It was, in fact, the year Frank awoke for good. His guards had never been reliable, but Frank had retained his body from the time he was strapped to the ceiling into the bay windows. He had been baptized, officially given a job, a family, everything, for nothing. Frank moved from face to face, silently weeping at the pain he felt every morning. Most of his family had died that day. Frank could not bring himself to do it, and his wife wasn't happy to see his anguish. She loved Frank, and so did her daughter. But it was very well known that, of course, Frank would be any minute. The private eye had brought him in to the House of the Chain of Elders to take over responsibility for overseeing the muggings that had happen around the neighborhood. He would explain why his administration had been infiltrated by Cthulhu himself, why all the traitors still worshiped him ( The Elders were peaceful ) and why he had failed. His voice was cut, all alone in his chamber. Frank's panic was relieved as he was relieved that he had actually been in control. He looked around for any place for the Secret Service to meet with, a habit his father had frequently made since before his two Grandchildren were born. No one spoke, not even his best friend. One of them nodded at him. It was a strange thing to be a child once you were surrounded by a living author. Frank reached a hand out toward the table. He pressed his hand softly over the Book of Elohim. A muddled bit was pieced together, but it still didn't fit. It had been scattered all over the floor, stained with some kind of skin substance. Frank pulled it aside and read the last four lines of the Book: "Mora, there was a time when you were a giant- " He twisted his wrist. A small stream of blood rushed through his body, running down and covering every inch of his body. The noise of the rushing heave of the Savior incarnate only increased with each passing moment. Frank began to give up. He made no effort to wake his wife, but what little he could manage was a sickening grinding of teeth. The Man of Steel roared from his imprisonment and doused the guards with a shit-eating green fluid. A moment later, it cleared and a frail, Ironic-looking man stepped out. Like a gargoyle from a slumbering sea, he thrust a knife straight through his worst enemies. Frank lifted his head, floating to the far side of the room, facing into the swirling blue mist. The Evil Lord trembled as he watched his body fall to the ground. Frank shook his head, and the room began to lose its color. He closed his eyes and prayed his Father. " I am Death."<|endoftext|>

He howls, glowing from his lips. The gleam of electric blue growls at the muzzle of his rifle, and the burst of fire from its ember melts the smell from the room. "We just got some more reinforcements " He mutters to the dwarves trying to warn him. Arne used to be a dark elf, really. Now it was Arne! The unnatural caretaker of this forest knew his job so well, the way he stalked across the ever shifting earth and shaped his son's face and speaking spell when he was listening. The training had been rigorous, far more brutal than Arne or he supposed. It had seemed so close at the end that it had become reality, though. Tonight was the last night on Earth where the bodies were taken. Arne had been with one of the early recruits, and he wished he could go home now, not being sure how much longer the ambiance would last, so he decided that he would make sure nothing more would happen. Arne loaded himself into the head of his men, and with a soft sigh slowly started to walk towards the log cabin, right into the woods, surrounded by the strange creatures which he had come to know, but were somehow not familiar with. He was within sight of the small town of Champion, when suddenly a massive screeching seemed to emanate from the trees. The crack of light was so intense that Arne felt he was witnessing his own death. Leaning on top of the log he knew which way to charge it, slamming his back against the tree he had stepped into, he whipped around quickly for a weapon of his own. " We will hunt you! " He shouted, forcing the arrow into the heart of the tree, he heard the rest of his men scream in fright as they tried to back away, but the ravenous beast must have been desperate. Arne gave in to the allure of battle, and trained his blade on the thing. It simply came up to get him, now slowly backing away. One of the men shouted at him " Why do you kill these creatures!? Oh, they need to go home! We have this weapon now! They need help! " Silence filled the cabin. Arne felt more and more guilty over the awed screams than anything else. To think that this man would have terrorized a camp full of dark elves, but he was also quite happy to see that he was finally getting his revenge. He was here because the man who had slaughtered his son and taken the city's entire population and replaced it with traps, those horrible aliens who had brought him the end of the world, had run over and taken that village. He was here to see vengeance and vengeance do all the work that it did to put away those evil creatures, to ensure that it would continue to live in fear, fear that they would eat, that they would suffocate in this barbaric land. He didn't know whether to scream in terror or to despair. Was there anything Arne could do to stop this man? He leaned on the tree, and his blade had missed the arrow catching it. In a rage he suddenly lunged forward, crashing into the old man, blood splatters everywhere and a massive explosion engulfed the town of Champion. A strange explosion however came from above, a silvery arc of electricity firing from the oak tree, and into the now vengeful creature who stood beside it. It was undeniably a Wampovian, having turned two decades old that evening, and possessed the cunning and power to wield magical weapons so potent even Arne swore he had seen Sauron staring into his eye. It did not take long for the two to fall to the ground, still dead as the sunlight. The last of the creatures on the forest floor began screaming again, they appeared to have dragged down the Nord leader, and, with a sudden realization, the wolves were no more. Arne let out a weak sob. " What did they have?! " The other wolf suddenly appeared. " They gave us a gift. " A small wooden stick and a spell book appeared before his eyes, carrying with it some notions of magic, and with all of the power, that would have been impossible. His focus shifted, and he saw many faces looking at him, all of them were afraid, but all of them, just his companions. " Remember the rest of your family, Arne."<|endoftext|>

The crowd long celebrated once again, the biggest game of the season, dominated by a multi-layered, team game of chess. The Russians had pulled off the final over 3 times, both times half-way through the second round, their best, to'Game of Thrones'. There was murmuring of agreement in the crowd, however, and more discussion about who you, or what you had been, were meant to represent... a new continent that seemed like a distant memory, that was suddenly swallowed up in a storm... and pushed out. However, despite their attempts, Russia and China were always the same, to a fault. Before long, the spirit of football and women's team sports turned slowly to pillage and chaos. And upon the international stage, the fanfare kept on following, until from this siren song... a message was released: "We Are Soldiers."<|endoftext|>

Report from New Haven, Second Quadrant of Human Empire ( Third Quadrant ): September 12, 2389 We have exhausted the search for inhabitants on both Two Quadrants of Human Empire, the earth is still alive, also it is illegal to have left civvies colonies in same area. There is a fresh attitude in the space, and even a desire for not having any officially free-dialed space stations attached. We have found more supports, scouting parties have been heard, transport ships, group campoints for nomadic alien horde has been found, the last attacks lasted for almost 3 hours. We have started the siege on the towns of Prometheus, where two scouts reported one holding a glowing glimmer and said they were exhausted and were hallucinating all of their flesh is empty. There is a line back, since inhabitants have been found at Gillian, another posse of aliens have attacked, he has been found, one from Andromeda and landed on the com centers, tried to walk them by his blood red uniform but they retaliated, had him executed. There is another line back and they are on Trian'tilth, they are finally closing in, we will be attacked by the aliens on no less than 4 lines, attacking the town the next morning a mere 2 to 4 people remain and were killed. We've heard all the details of this entire battle, you will see, each was not armed or organized, all the dead there is abundant in smaller batches. The last concern will be the population, as few people used to fill colonies as this new Earth is only 50000, no extra food or construction to be found. We can not let these aliens go in peace and discuss the future of this place, we are the last of the planet, we are going to be going to join the rest of them. We will strive for a new world but if we die, we will never know what is known of it, we will either not live in peace or, we will go back in time and tell our leaders we have changed and should fight our way out. Report by New Haven, third Quadrant of Human Empire ( Fourth Quadrant ): September 12, 2389 We had a bad day on Independence, I think we can work together as tribes, I think humanity is already like us, and has gone extinct on that base we called home. The End.<|endoftext|>

If I weren't so weak and stupid after all that hard work, why should I start dreaming up something like this? This is going to get off your ass, aren't ya? You start to realize that you're really better off for this. **PARALLELS** You jump from your chair. You come face to face with the other scientists in the room. They look surprised. " What, hmm? Do we need this by now? " You're shivers run up your spine as they say something. The hint of heat from their eyes twinkle. " Get that basketball jersey out of your locker!

He fumbled for the reel in his pocket and as it slid down his trousers, the faint groan of stress went through the tangle of his shirt. His white tunic weighed on his shoulders as he slowly made his way from cubicle to cubicle. Whispers filled the valley. Bullets fell on the desks. Finally, hours of work were done. He shivered, as everyone began to lay on their knees praying for the rain to stop. Every effort came back as his servants, dressed all in whites, waited. Just as he had instructed, a raindrop fell towards the cubicle walls. He helped it drop, which produced the greatest impact that his men had seen. A sickening squelch materialized into the air. The first man in the room was instantly engulfed in smoke and sweat. The second suited man looked up at the man in the black suit standing by the window. "Oh dawg honey, please. We had really turned us around, and hey, have you seen other men? " He offered. The black suit replied. " Aye, I haven't. Please watch what I'm doing. " A gaping hole appeared in his chest. And the three of them, destroyed. The man in the black suit placed a briefcase in his lap and pointed at the two suited men. " So what is this tarot card about?

And then it hit me. I was going to die in a boring, office-filled daydream. I didn't think I was going to die that way, though, or most people seem to think they are. That would be too easy. Or too ridiculous. "Death," they called me. Or am I just a new dead person, an unwelcome target? Please, send me another two days. Who doesn't want to jump into a pool after working late one day, or three? No wonder I was the only one in the office that didn't have a shitty mood. I had to make a quick decision. I shrugged and walked to the office, where a stack of forms was scattered. *Death. * It was then I noticed that one of the forms in the corner had a name. Death Death Death Death. I had just picked up a couple times already. Though I didn't recognize the syllables the handwriting was given. A smile spread across the form. " Sorry if this is a bit boring, I'm about to go into a pointless vacation. Besides, this isn't entirely your fault..." and I was lost. -- - /r/dori_tales<|endoftext|>

I sigh as I dangle over the edge. My breath catches in the air like it was wet. Warm, and refreshing. Much needed as usual. Spun again. Don't move to check on it. My eyes dart around wildly, pausing to re-orientate myself in an attempt to lower myself. I feel bad. It could be my failure in the morning, but it's the only consolation I've got, the only thing I can recover from today's events, before I begin to lose my will to remain human. For the first time in my life, I start to register pain. Pain that lasts forever, but my eyes move on their own. Pain that leaves my body slowly and with a rumbling grunt that shakes the very air I breathe in, even the air around me. For a brief moment, I forget the sensation, but then look upwards at the sky, my new perception of a realm - their figures appearing and disappearing into the darkness around me. The walls are smooth, and the floor is smooth. Then, everything slows to a halt, as if someone hasn't just flooded the blackness I see. Suddenly, I no longer feel the wind, and I begin to feel light. The first sensation of altitude comes. I open my eyes. Blue. Where the Moon used to be. And then, the nub of no misery and not misery again.<|endoftext|>

My fingers were heavy on the keys, downing the last of the meager whiskey they could get from a swing set in the courtyard downstairs, the potted plant was cold and black, I should have seen the sun rising over the hill. It was too late now. Every minute or two, another stranger would walk into this hellhole, I knew they would drag me out, plop me in their linoleum floorboards and bully me to do their bidding. I could feel the sun shining through them, I could feel it settling over my eyelids. “ I ’ ll take your leave, I'll always know you care about my home and the family. ” They would be right. However, I resisted, I had trained hard to avoid meeting this man, was it not obvious who I was? Is it not obvious that one day, the life I created for them would be over and replaced with a situation that, through no fault of my own, should have been ended? I heard the man ’ s voice come from the first bathroom, steps on the otherside scissor-lock like it had been slapped repeatedly, and he called my name. I stood there frozen, frozen in place. The same man was holding me tight, they both left the restroom earlier than I expected, it couldn ’ t be. My shirt was damp, it was ripped all the way to the chest. It was then I heard a voice calling out from the back of the bathroom. “ My friends are here! ” I would not let them ruin my day. What the hell was happening? I placed my hands on my stomach and the sweat dripping out of my head screamed in my ears. “ My friends are here! ” Was it from the strangers. They were in one of the houses and that man ’ s footsteps came up the stairs. “ My friends are here! ” I would not let them take this from me. He stepped up to me and squeezed my hand. “ My friends are here! ” I screamed and spit at his face. It wasn ’ t much of a scream or a swear, they knew it would make him like me. I was only a bit sad. I looked at him with a confused look on my face. The first guy must have seen me; his eyes were sullen from the watery water puddles and his arms were useless at grasping me anymore. His shoulder gun was either stuck by him or destroyed by the world. I would have won if he were not such a bitch. “ My friends are here! ” he beckoned, grasping me and pulling me away from the fire. “ My friends are here! ” I screamed. “ My friends are here! ” Another man walked into the hallway and jumped, as if he knew he would get free. I closed my eyes and listened as the first noise exploded from the other side of the hallway. It was my screams. My blood. My screams…<|endoftext|>

Crying out, five year old me opened the door to my final night in an eternal prison cell... and then a thought occurs to me- and finally my solitary confinement. I begin to lay down, and prepare myself to head home. I wake up feeling sleepy. Focusing, back to the safe closet of my bedroom... and I was gone. The electricity went out of my power source and was promptly replaced with the drowsy twinkle in my eyes. It is late. I go into the kitchen and close the cabinet door as I pour my food, potatoes, and garlic salt into a wok. Just the right amount to make me less sleepy. I quickly pour myself a bowl of cereal, a chocolate cake, and a drink of water. The sounds of cooking and stir-frying are cut short with the final rustle of cloth as a child enters my kitchen. " It's been a while, so what happened to you all? " She asks as she moves across the space I just laid at my feet. I repeat this every now and again, forcing myself to accept the details. I wonder what I had to do to get here. " I'm sorry I can't say much for you. I was so lost in thought... what troubles me is thinking about you all. Do you remember when the deal was made? It was the only way we could be together... how do I know you're okay? " she reaches into her purse for a large loaf of bread. " I-it's okay, sweety. We made it. We've always been a family of favorites. We're going out for ice cream right now. I think you could say that... " as she spreads the dough on my cold, crispy loaf, it's comforting. Why did I have to get here after all? It's not like she was really alive. She was bleeding, but I could hardly remember what she had been doing all of the time. Was she playing with her friends during that tantrum? Trying to get some of my willpower? I beeped at the nurse's yell for my kids to come out the door. " Two! " the orderly screamed as he said the words and hurried out the door. " One! " I looked over at her, before I could even say my fifth word. I was finally ready to tell her what I had done, so what does she think? " You're okay. You look pretty much right. " She smiled slightly and stared at me through her tear stained eyes. " I guess you're right, sweety. It's almost time. " my last words to her were held up in my arms. I looked back up at her, knowing her reaction would be in my mind a few moments later. She returned the smile and fell asleep quiet. My mind went blank, and I woke up in bed in my nightgown. A paper on the nightstand flickered as it read- *Happy New Years, ~~~Wizards v. Flashpoint~~~* I tried to remember why I was gone and my nightmare with my guard down. Nobody could actually remember. I arrived home late that night with a bare-footed child and a ruler hanging from my door frame. I bent down and picked up the ruler. " There, now let me guess... " I put my thumb against the stand, waiting for my son to knock. I sat down with his toy and he softly moaned and said, " Guess I'll have you know that on my life, I get to do good deeds. On his life I get to be a hero. " He shook his head and placed the paper on his desk. His eyes blazed and his eyes were luminous. " Oh, and you too. How about you on your way home from the yard? Huh? Good luck with that, huh? " I dropped his tray and hugged him tightly. We pulled him inside, and my son went out playing with friends while his father rested in the grass outside of his house. I left the house quietly. " So one last thing... what's your name? " she asked. I nodded and spoke. " Henry." I stroked his forehead.<|endoftext|>

The first thing the human lets come into contact with is their own sense of raw emotion and pain. The second thing the human being experiences when living is the very pit of their belly before they start to feel. If they feel a mutual understanding and a future together, their whole relationship will fade and eventually fade away, becoming nothing more than a shell of a person who never learned what it means to live their own life like the middle-aged man in his 50's says he feels. The best way to describe this, for me, is how the human feels when they start to feel part of a wider world. To me, this is a set of negative emotions that humans feel when they are both loving and attached to someone else. To me, this is a feeling that is unique to humans because it is impossible to live without happiness. I have thought of this the way I have. It begins with either pain or strong emotions that gather in the belly. I feel strong and strong because it is impossible to let go of this pain in order to hold onto it. Something hard to control. Something hurtful. Something painful. Another emotion I can not control. I feel weak because it is impossible to control. I never feel angry or angry for myself. I am a person who knows all of the happiness in the world and appreciates it all because it is truly the most amazing thing in the world. Everything is beautiful because it is the most beautiful thing in the world because it is being lived so for a moment. The two emotions I felt when I was trapped were vibrant as snow in front of me. Joy. I remember thinking of the day I was given access to this way of feeling and it drove me insane; not knowing what my life was like before the sun came up and the light and softness of the moon came into my eyes before a lump swept over the world and smothered everything that was around me, so I carried on holding on to my warmth and warmth after so long. Even though my strength was broken and tears rolled down my cheeks, it was to no avail, as no one else was left. Without looking at me or seeing me, I had never loved or loved anybody better than anyone I knew. I understood it all too well because it was the only way for me to forgive myself for leaving the world. I realized soon that this and this is a will to live that I will never be able to bare without knowing the truth. And so I did and it was with tears in my eyes I cried. With pain in my eyes I lost myself in thought. I couldn't see as much as I loved and this brought me down to tears. I wiped off the tears and picked up the Rubik in the middle of the table next to me and placed it back in my pocket. It was by my hand I pulled the black tool out with one small, terrified hand, and threw it away from my fingers. I did it to myself and it was the first time I felt this physically. My tears came as violent adrenaline filled my body. There I lay, looking up from the ground and wondering what I was looking at and that my thoughts were so infinite and so *beautiful. * I cried until I fell. But instead of falling out of the beautiful world I looked into the abyss below, and I felt warmth and love and beauty and happiness. I felt the world as it was because everything was real and everything could be the same. The light and softness of the moon shone bright through me, driving me insane and driving me insane, forcing me to remember and remember and remember I cared for myself and the happiness that came from it. I hated my own life, but its happiness came about because I cared for someone else like I cared for myself. In what I felt in this moment of time I felt happiness for myself, but I gave away that happiness for myself through each and every thing I had ever done and destroyed. I felt weak, weighed down and stressed, so I pulled myself back into the world and the world ripped itself apart into the pain of joy. This feeling faded away as the joy of a child was gone and the joy of a mother was gone. A little girl had passed away, and another had been born. I have seen children pass away as I have seen more and more children. My happiness came from my own happiness as I laid eyes on each one and looked down at them and they were all beautiful, not because I was happy, but because I was one of the billions of little men who were young and beautiful and had purpose. All of them bright and full and bright and happy, full of meaning. I am a newborn and I am going to be so very happy for them.<|endoftext|>

Get lost in unfamiliar territory? Maybe the Network is here to see you. No? I thought, “ No, I don ’ t work here, and I don ’ t need to get lost. ” No, you ’ re not a Network, you work for the Network as if it doesn ’ t exist. No, a Network is a gateway, an opening for the dreams of all things that are there. We live in a world where dreams matter, but when we feel them dream for the first time, not for the Network. Are dreams here to corrupt you? Are dreams here to mess with your mind? Are dreams here to ruin your life? Are dreams here to help you lose weight? Are dreams here to the sun rise? This is what the Network is for, the emotional connection between a Network that listens to you, reads your mind, and is helping you lose weight? How can someone without the Network trust you? As far as I know, you have to be able to let in any dream of yours. When someone says that they can ’ t trust you, “ Why are you afraid of something with a smile on your face ”, they ’ re talking to yourself. They ’ re probably thinking to themselves. Maybe if they ask why they ’ ve been following me, then it ’ s because you like to dream about something, except it ’ s intangible. Do they not see things like how my puzzle piece is placed together through the net or how I ’ m able to open it? This is what the Network is for, the emotional connection between a Network that listens to you, listens to your mind, and is helping you lose weight. When you will feel something that no one else can, they only see it on you. They don ’ t have to think about it because they don ’ t have anything else to do. If the Network understands that you ’ re trying to make money, or bring people down into the dust, they can keep you in control because the Network knows your feelings can be made, and there ’ s that kind of control. I ’ ll tell you what I do. I ’ m sick of people thinking that me because I ’ m not working, because I ’ m not having all the bad dreams that bring me down. They only see me because I never wanted to go through with it. I just want to let you into the Network.<|endoftext|>

"And thus it concluded, that the movement of the Milky Way in our galaxy would not be noted, and continued, until every human's work, our effort, our every hour of my being, I simply would weep for all the evil, the pure evil, the dark, the spirit of evil wherever they could find it. And for that I will gladly burn, to spite my people until death." said God. The jolly old fuck had finally given up his children's cause, and left them to wander around in a cage. He picked up his pen and started to write down the words it would say. On its back were ten exotic abstract symbols written in ancient tongues: Iamku - king, Genie - angry face, God - wife, Hades - Titan - fish. They must not be combined or stopped, but if they did they would be trapped until they became free and well fed, then they could use all their power, and steal all power from them. So as if he had any choice they cackled, or reveled in their story, or hid in the caves below. All of their power, some unknown, some not, but always safe and waiting for the outside world to come save them. And as if that wasn't enough his tormentor came to collect, he had done it now too, another rebellious forcibly bred humanity for conversion, and would hopefully never be seen again.<|endoftext|>

The price wasnt that outrageous. I paid $ 2000 on 3 stock options for will support the family on rent 1-5. 3 is my favorite rank and the bottom 5 is the 5 at least. I used to sleep at 5 each night as my day went on. I went to school, got to the college, then left school until I decided to get a job. This was ok. But it never happened that way, due to the non-discretionary nature of things. I had plans in my head for when I was going to set up the house and start my life anew. The stupid part was I got my way. I got my first apartment. I built it, I decided I should be rich. My dream was to live on reddit the way people normally live on reddit. I got inspired and started improving, creating more funny things on reddit with my work, which I did for a month. I became a painter. But it wasnt enough. I was already done with it. And with my paintings, I became wealthy too. After having the house and kids and allowance, I moved to a small town. There was a big market for art. It wasn't the price we had, but we were willing to pay for it. But the high price was not what i had expected. I wanted to be rich. Until the rent is paid in karma. I am on reddit all day, doing all these posts there. Everyone always hates karma, so it terrifies me. But nobody would stop. They always keep looking at me as a creep, and they fear me for the following couple days. I always came here to look at them. Now I am even happier. I feel alive, as if I am the future. As if in my sleep my students never looked at me, or even noticed me there, so I remain unnoticed. While most of them find me nice on r/art, it seems to be the opposite of nice. I dig my pants off now and they always seem to turn to something else. I try not to think about what I was doing, or why I am doing it, or something to do with it, but I dig my pants again and the first one comes back. It is a black man, sitting down beside my bed. He looks at me, annoyed, at first, but he begins to fall to his knees. His clothes are filthy, rustic, torn, and sloppy, and are stained red. He stares at me, this time with a look of apathy in his eyes, and I laugh his guts out, and I laugh him back at him. But suddenly he looks up at me, and he begins to make his move. He is quite careful to get very close to my bed. Without thinking, he pulls my shirt off, turning it around and placing the ground behind me. He looks at me, then looks directly at me, then back to me. His mouth opens, suddenly opening up, while he and my body are now completely still.<|endoftext|>

It was dawn and dark, as far as she was able to see, nothing but empty husks of trees and lonely motes of dust hung between the two of them. She was alone at the window of the store, while her large dog sat just sitting on top of her feet. Across from her she found quiet sound, not of the noise of boots beside her feet nor of rustling branches or large rocks as she jolted awake from her dream. The raindrops whirling around her head made her giggle. The wolf was crying, pretending to sob at her feet. Her internal wolf pack was relieved that her tiny feet were free of its claws. But it was not happy at all, for as the small dog shoved a rock in between her toes and handed it over with a shaking paw. She savoured its weight, she had given up. Since the trees had been taken from the forest, and the dust was thick, and the wind had been too windy to breath, she had died and turned into the wolf, like a raven in the night, alone. She heard the wolf snort some more, and saw that it was quite naked. She could see her squire in the snores, and her dog at the groaning sound, bringing her closer. For a moment she thought he would put the rock in his paw and slip off into the night, but at that moment it stopped laughing. It was only then that the wolf strode out from the wood and presented its paw to her in a giggle that lasted only a moment. She saw he was bigger than a man, about the size of a pinwheel, and he had a thin body that shone in the sun and buttered up and down. She could see in his eyes were a deep secret that he had been hiding from. Looking up, she could see that the wolf had lost its appetite for the softness of air, and the wolf had left her with a spout of air. She reached out and ran her tongue into his mouth. The wolf found it strangely pleasing, and cawed at her tongue as it tasted of fresh meat. She lay her head on its shoulder and licked at the air with the tongue. It wasn't like the snow, when people talked about snow. It was a red kind of snow. She was vaguely aware of the lump on her leg and the small ginger fur that covered the stumps of her feet. She felt small. She passed it back to the wolf, pulling it into a bear hug that she kept as part of her family. She tried to push off the large bear with her strong paws, but was forced back with a strong grip that couldn't stand up to her weight, teeth welling. The bear had eaten the whole floor with its appetite and it had eaten nothing but soft words and scraps. It stood close to her for a while, and she still walked that way, even in the bears cold paws. She tried hard to claw at the bear to open it, but it was locked like a suitcase behind her. She did not dare close her eyes when the whole forest turned to dust and ash. Only the man remembered her, and he didn't care as long as he had the money. And he would never come back.<|endoftext|>

I longed for this place, to be a private down under in a bunker someplace far from the wilderness. I was poor, the surface home to high altitude cavemen, a bred for the wild environment. I liked living in the small caves to myself. Naked men, all the families are free. Men of a noble sort, pitiful children and bored adults. These sorts of things created a reputation amongst the rich. They expect to escape and try to get a kick out of getting put in the cold and shit. So, while a bit of it is disheartening, it is in principle what I do. I can smell and smell the air, mind you, almost as good as the if it wasn't so humid. I'd saved lives, but amortised rather than released. I'm almost a normal person. A single wife, three kids, two dogs, two chores, not being imprisoned inside the prison. They stay here, watch television, spend time with family. All paid with money I may spend on food. I miss them all. And they care more about me. So much for our family, I find no shame in smiling at them. Laughing, their laughter, their laughter. I must remember, once, how a boy had said; a'talking along the tree'. I could only sigh. For the years it took me to set up the vault, to build the hatch on the far wall, to put the cell up in the ground. And what better company than to hide here and here. But, many nights before climbing up it, I again come to an end. They call me a'hero'. That's what they call me. Nobody but me. I get up, sit down, walk inside, and talk to a human being. He looks upon me and smiles. For my forty-five year sentence, I gave one quiet and happy smile. First someone to have moved from this tribe, and then another. They ask me for my hand in marriage. I tell them that it is something I must do. And so, I help them build it out. The top so high that you could see, and what the top is made of now, it is a refuge. The tunnel swings like a turbine, but with a considerably shorter diameter. This means that they can run as long as they need to, and above that they can stay, motionless, hanging around looking. It is a comfort. As much as I'd like for them to be free, what they wish to see, they can never find it. Now, I don't want to become a criminal like the others. I can not always kill people. And then that happens. I heard a smell, a noise, just the smell of tree leaves. That was the only sound I heard in a few minutes. But before I could say anything, one of them squeaked their head up and said, "She's here, yes?"<|endoftext|>

"Wan na take a look at'em? " She shot him a look, " I think I found one of those. " And looking through the raid's rear view, almost driven into the barrier of light, she caught sight of the giant steel pole most large and menacing in the store. She studied it's surface; the rich copper and yellow markings spattered across the air like sand on the beach. " Hmm? " " This is probably a really good quest if you trust me. " Or at least, it was. She had a rudimentary bow and sword, intended for a crew of three and a lady friend from a family of men. She was decked out in battle gear, wielding her massive mountain deuces and sand duster plates. The large copper bell that was strapped to her front left leg looked interesting, in the way those tall brass mechs don't have the slightest lust in the midsection. It didn't occur to her what any of the soldiers had just been trained to look like: The sky was a dark red and dark blue. Some of the men glinted like stars, some of them were off-duty from storage, looking out onto their duty-cooked town. Nearby, four men remained. They formed a protective circle, caressing each other's arms and legs. Women held them back. " A shaman? " " Yes! " The woman in the red headdress spoke, her great girth remarkably reminiscent of that of her great warboss. " This animal-riding beast is our secret weapon! It snarls and does crazy poses for real men to test it's hidden invisibility. " " Is this our band? " " No, not really. This is where you aren't charged with a full load of magic-swords. Sure, we have some- " " All three of them? " "... what do you mean? " " They're all in the dungeon. " The black cloak of her hood broke around the face of the woman in the large silver headdress, revealing a shiny piece of metal sat besides the others in the room. She held it in her hands. A small spear reached out from the pile of charging armor around her. " You best trust me now. " She stared at it for a long time, waiting for it to clear her vision. But it wouldn't. " Sir, this is a stupid job. " She turned back to the woman in the white half-helm. She immediately felt nervous for a moment, but took another swing at the shield. " Ok then. " She stood up. " Got ta leave now. " " I didn't forget to leave, fell down the stairs, and killed your ax and got drunk. " The woman in the cape grimaced. " I'll be fine. Don't look back. " " You're crazy, you know that? It's the worst job I could imagine. " " I didn't do that!" She shouted in the worst fashion, throwing herself in the way of her horses. He had been skulking around the area taking potions, throwing trinkets around, and summoning men from miles away. She wasn't at the group now. It was empty. Behind her, a brooding woman who was wearing a vibrant red T-shirt walked away, replaced by a gray-haired, black-and-gold woman holding a clipboard with a scribbled name on it. The last word the woman spoken was rendered black. She turned back to her companion as she limped out.<|endoftext|>

Captain Richards stared out over the open seas, his old watch resting on the lap of his antique highlander wooden chair. The dark shadows were starting to set in. The sun was just beginning to set on the night. The ship had survived twelve hours of falling and several hours of clean sail before setting a course for the distant city of Orkmoor. Captain Richards sighed as he walked over to the windowless, steel behemoth he was in command of- the old Dutch Spaniard war-ship was drifting towards him. Its cannon had never fired nor suffered any punctures. A great roar could be heard from the ramp, and suddenly the ship seemed to be ripping, clawing, thrusting away. Captain Richards collapsed onto the deck of the ship. He let out a deep sigh and stepped towards the doorway. A battle cry echoed through the air, and Richards realised that he was back in the dock. He took a deep breath, opened the hatch, and opened the view port. Private Radio Calloway found the signal from the Queen Elizabeth. He played it at a low volume- a faint grey noise similar to a frog fish parading across waves. Richards adjusted his fine, worn red crown as he listened to the Captain's words again. " We're out of dust, Lieutenant. Send someone here, we need to reinforce the rail line. " Pushed aside by a hand, Calloway quickly boarded the port ship. He knew that he would soon be in such a place. His aide stepped over to the ready rail, looked over to him, and pulled him into the first hull of the ship. " Listen to this! " her voice boomed. Richards let out a slow sigh and stepped out of the window and in a blaze of fury stormed towards the Queen Elizabeth. Her head swung from side to side. The captain of the ship was completely outmatched by the fierce waves of the Queen Elizabeth's growing sea fleet. Such intense firepits like in the old days could not hold a fight against such ferocious sea waves. They flinched, dropped, tried to regain the strength that had been lost in the battle against the attackers. Richards almost dropped his lantern on the deck. The man from his seat paused before looking up at the Queen Elizabeth. He smiled, hesitated. " Elizabeth? " Richards looked puzzled. He did. She looked at the ship then looked back at him. " What are you doing, what did you do? " Her eyes held a pleading look. " I... I... I was listening... " Richards let out a long sigh, stepped back. " Sir, are you okay? I did what I had to, I saved the Queen, I saved her, I caused the battle... " Richards put his lantern back in his coat pocket, pulled out his armory, and opened the Captain's journal. " Sir, it was a really futile mission. The enemy had... had started to advance towards the city. They had... they were... they were... goons. So... we had to do something. I... I want them to hear it. " Richards opened the journals again. " I'm really sorry. I was afraid they'd take it all but now they've seen it. I can't do this anymore. I'm afraid... I..."<|endoftext|>

It was the beginning of the end... It was the beginning of the end. There was only one hero left... It could have been anyone. All the nations agreed on the same goal. No *one* would take the necessary actions. No one, not even a captain who had prepared a group should have been involved. But damn, one can only assume it was a mirage. Slowly, a symbol and signal appeared. A small little pixel appeared on the screen in front of everyone. It also read: "Is there something I can help you? ". Humanity can not stand the infinite boring, pointless, pointless fight of any nation. To fight for anything but justice and fairness would be a selfish act. Humanity would unite and accept them as equals. The fight would go on. But humans wouldn't go along with the machinations of the single greatest threat humanity has faced in their life time: the world leader. The computer shuddered and replayed its resounding message on the screen. It confirmed what humans feared at the time... Everyone was watching, except for one guy from the first group. He was usually quiet, controlled and never strayed far from his original objectives. Except when he was... " hello? ". HE stood up to walk to the cockpit. The screen showed the display complete with a horizontal bar, indicating he needed to pass on what he was about to do. Thus, HE was about to go down. He felt compelled to go up so he did. " AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! " The display above him was filled with " Hello again" static in the distance. He kept going up, smiling and smiling and smiling. He continued getting more and more excited. Slowly the digital signal began fading. He was about to die. The button was pressed. Not long after, The banner that appeared up ahead appeared... It said'Fight' Until the end.' The captain shouted for all the nations to take action. But they did not. He simply died, his computer shut off, and the computer continued to play.<|endoftext|>

"So here we are, the heroes defeated, " said the voice booming among the gathered people. Everyone stared at the hero, unaware that there was a cheerful smile spread across his face. " Now this kid, you've been playing as the main minion. He's such a great fighter, " he said handing over his baton, " you'll always have my back. " " Not my back, " said Batman, " but I can be your guardian angel and you can trust me. " The crowd applauded with glee at the hero's new role as supposed protectorate of Gotham City. Everyone chuckled to themselves as they watched the hero fight off the Reaper of Satan. Then someone in the crowd announced " Ah, hero, the fucker is your hit-man," but no one saw that the villains had a face tag. It was a good ol' villain. There was a feeling of relief that day as a new hero entered the city.<|endoftext|>

12/13/21st year. 12/13/21st year Jacob stared out into the water then back at his toy. Really, what was he thinking? He hadn't seen his father in over half a decade. Finally, he felt his father, a normal dad, let go of his phone as he typed. "What the fuck did you see? " Jacob said to himself as he quickly put down the phone. " What? " James said through clenched teeth. " I saw you and four other kids playing in the ocean. I can't believe they weren't you! " James chortled. " Calm down Jacob, I'm just saying here that it makes you look worse. " Jacob scowled at him, trying to get his head away from his hand. He noticed a fish was growing on his bedside table, but didn't notice, he assumed it was his father's because the humans weren't here. " James, " Jacob said, " that's crazy. You didn't see the war when we sent those fucking savages down that bay? Do you remember when their boat went missing? " " I just watched our toy destroy itself while I watched it claw at me. See... they made fun of my even stronger front in the sandbox. We were trying to save it from the teacher. I think I've reached the fight parts I told you. I just thought about what you said. But I didn't. " " Good. Why don't you just take me away from here! Why do you want to go, show your dad that there isn't a need to protect us when you're putting us up against-" Jacob finished making eye contact with James and slipped into the water of his father's house.<|endoftext|>

It had been nearly two days, and I'd lost everything. I could feel the wall around me collapse. So the ground trembled below my feet, and a numbness fell over me as I pinched the bridge of my nose. I couldn't go home. My mother and my wife were in the car. My father, who was still going through some tough times in the county, had committed suicide. My kids, who were both in their late teens, were in high school. The neighbors who lived next door, my sister and I. I could see it in the distance. The time was close. I looked at the clock, not expecting it to be "3 minutes ". I could tell right away it was 2:54, but with all of the panic and panic- Rage ripped through my chest. I began smashing the windshield into pieces, and I was up and coming straight down. I had to get out of this. That was it. I knew it. I looked at the big box, and I knew it was empty. I held the ticket to the sky. My husband, my child, my wife, and I were all close together. We were close in my reality. But the first sign of panic was the checkered metal that the car door opened. No one else was moving. It was on such an odd note, but it was unmistakably me. * 911. * I reached down and held the ticket, let the engine rumble, and I immediately turned the ignition. I went a few moments slower and burned out, and to my horror, I knew, too, where I was. But that wasn't the end of it. I remember the clock on the keypad counting down, and I realized: *900 million dollars*. I was out.<|endoftext|>

[ New > Bad > Bird Facts > Letter to: Stacey Hewer ( meteorological department ) Dear Colleagues, I write this letter to express our utmost disapproval with the recent ~~billions~~ ( ~~billions~~ ) deaths of our beautiful majestic critters. They are not meant to be eaten and are therefore unacceptable. In my free time I have made strenuous efforts to clean these carcasses off of the planet and it is imperative that the animals go away immediately. There is another issue which I must address. For the sake of avoiding oblivion, my research has convinced me that their fecal matter is toxic and can induce genetic damage. Ever since these creatures disappeared on public transport I am leaving every single bus stop. I am not wishing to hazard a guess as to why. However, I wish to leave my mark on many a local and public space. We use thiks of fresh debris to shield the railway station from these nasty creatures that plague most of the earth's streets and highways. I have been warning the population of these colonies for at least a year now. Do you have anything to say to the populations of the colonies? They are peaceful, I hope to the others that they will not be subjected to such cruelty. I would like to invite my husband, Paul, to come visit me on this occasion. We have both received commendations from the Department of Disease Control for their efforts to clean up the affront to dignity of these creatures and for helping to facilitate scientific breakthroughs in the field of anti-aging. I trust that this will all fall out of our hands as well as our mutual burden to the colony. Love, Ted Huntsman Jr<|endoftext|>

~ “ Oh no. ” A tear stung from the corner of my eye as my gnarled hoofs flickered a little out of place in my swollen, buxom stomach. It was at that moment I realized “ no. ” A glint of green emerged from under my fur. “ By the way, I ’ m a dragon. ” I started to feel my metal hands trickling through the fur, feeling my guts next to mine and the depths beneath. My fluttering tail seemed to agitate the small creature. It desperately fluttered its eyes and went tail behind me, flailing while pursing its black eye. The smell of nature coupled with the increasing rancid taste of sulfur filled my nostrils. It rolled off of my nose while I continued pacing away from the foul, chilling, disgusting beast. With a roars and a growl, the creature rose up and looked down to examine its new fur. One shot towards the stony face, stopping when it caught sight of my cheery tail. My stomach dropped and I let out a clang of my hooves and a shrill screech, followed by a growl. The creature scampered away into the woods, leaving me to rest in fear and trapped. With a peep, the smell of antelope and insects filled the air and I could hear the quick, screechy howl of little metal claws. The creature raised its head as though it were caught in a bee sting. The sting lasted ten steps, as though it had eaten an incredibly large head of meat. Before I knew it, it was begging me to let go of its neck. When I reached over, its hair was disheveled and black. “ Please. ” I barely managed to say, before her fingers touched mine and the entire length of my torso started to glow dim. My lungs burned with oxygen and my breath came in shallow, sweet gasps that filled my ears. I tried to focus my eyes on the shadows and then quickly squinted to make out what was coming. I breathed in the scent of blood and the scent of flesh. Water splashed all over the dense grass and walls, quickly filling the land with fresh greens. With a trail of dirt emerging from the ground, I quickly turned around, looking for something else to keep me warm. Within minutes I found no living thing around. As I strode towards the exit, I could smell the once dry grass. As it got closer, more and more trees became the charcoal-colored fur I had worn on my hooves. Through the fog, I could make out a small structure in the distance. With a pitch black, red sign barely hanging from my hooves, I cautiously entered the crevices and branches that overlooked the creature ’ s entrance. An overbearing park was a close second, just as a swamp. I sat down, getting back to my feet as the fog lifted to become clear before me. The mottled leaves were bare and weighed like stones. There was no concrete foundation beside any barrier, only a concrete mat that encompassed the dirt that covered the clearing. I peered around, making sure no one was left behind to stop me. The ground was bare as I stepped onto a flat grassy slab and a small being emerged. A thin robe covered the figure in flowing black scales. Without what looked like sunlight, his skin was simply a sliver off the black fur. His hair was as white as a dropped cup and his eyes looked as blue as their eyes. The creature looked down at me, fur outstretched, to the ground. I growled and clawed at my hooves. 'Here he comes.' A voice boomed, flashing with animalistic glee, an animal beast that I hadn ’ t seen in hundreds of years. “ By the way, I ’ m a dragon. ” “ By the way, I ’ m a dragon. ” A smile crept up, half-covered my mouth. The figure continued to move around me, bringing out its small scaly mass that seemed to glow with its insatiable hunger. Slowly, it traced a long line down the center, making sure it moved along the surface of the grass and dirt. “ A good trip there, Seloo. ” As I sat there in my burning, disgusting pile, I thought to myself, if the film was really real.<|endoftext|>

War and civil war. A war that started in 2035 between the United States of America and Britain. It ended on 5th August 2037, but the wars were a bit much. At first almost all people in America were well off, but after the initial conflict was over, they left for countries without borders to pick up arms. Occasionally similar arms conflict existed but it was more frequent. But the original war ended when a group of British nationalists started slaughtering the British faraway people. The city of London, where the British people lived, declared war on them, claiming that it was for the world peace. The war lasted 50 years but it never ended. Wars have never stopped. But history kept on changing. Every century they change. Again we have thousands upon thousands of examples of laws or agreements that violated the peaceful nature of the peace. Many talks, many measures taken or how the peace was achieved. The contour of any given law, really. We have signs placed on those laws. As long as I am here I can be sure that I have seen everything from the history books. Some of them I have never seen. My name is Thomas and I will always be here for your discussion of rules and solutions.<|endoftext|>

An inner compartment located in the plane, next to the recently implemented wooden door was just another doorway in to that door, there was the money, and the switch, and all that and many more along the way. These two are rarely commended by the scanners, they provided a fantastic view of the TSA who step inside the copier to get a glimpse of the confusion that eases upon exiting. One, lacking an ID. The other ( or a third ), lacking a full set of prescription glasses. One and one, missing a cigarette. The third stools, several slots down the middle, while the third sits on the end of a large toilet surrounded by a few cards boxes in the middle of the desk. "When would you prefer to scan? " was one of the many questions asked. " Well sir, I've never been one to chew my cards. " said the third. " I guess there's no better way to propose your change of heart, what with the new lady job. " said the first. As it turns out, it didn't take long for the TSA to figure out that the Dinka twins were at least joking around too. During the intern drive it was clear that airline security was being interfered with, and that no further action could be taken. They showed what the couple was doing to an international passenger who was arriving at boarding. The security guard who the TSA noticed was the third. He wore a leisure suit which waved at the passengers. Two passengers were upon him, downing the coke before exiting the plane. " The play kid, " remarked one of them with much amusement. He played with their blood while smothering them with a crumpled plastic bag. Both men were killed, and they received minimal medical attention. The TSA was left to fill the remaining gaps between to reimburse the whole passenger. " Please take you check off your shoes, as much as you can." spoke the third. Although they were no longer wearing such bulky uniform, they still wore many designer shoes in some back alley. " Please we're a quick due," said the third as he placed the bag in his belt, as he turned, and walked out of his front entrance. He unlocked their doors just as the other man crossed the threshold. He was all smiles for the passengers and saw the complex in which he had left, how their home towered over him.<|endoftext|>

I locked the door behind me and out the front door. So as soon as the shed opens I guess it's time. " I remember you... from last night. " Tears ran down my face and I slowly took a step towards the front door. * " Like you. " * When I heard this I knew I shouldn't have used that word " as well " thought I would never use the word " me " again " It was a lie so obvious that I bet it didn't make any sense whatsoever. " Oh yeah...? " I said " Oh yeah.... " I must have sounded dramatic, because I was the only one left that didn't speak English, and it's late at night. I opened the door and walked past the shed. I kept on walking until I reached a window and saw two figures up there. " Why were you doing this " Was that why it was just me and my girlfriend? Had the brass rod come loose? Were any of my other friends playing? Or am I the Joker? I suppose I don't know. No one did either. I tried yelling, " I'm afraid there's something you should know. It's dangerous. " But it didn't matter; no one would listen to me. I quickly rose and headed to my room to fall asleep, anxious of what I was about to do next. I realized I had more important things to do. Wait... This isn't right... Why is there a baseball bat hidden underneath my bed? Why is there another baseball bat for me? I wasn't even sure what hit me. I slowly pulled the bat out, took a deep breath and slammed the door. * " I... I.. I..told you!" *... four years later and still I'm still trying to fall asleep. Someone always tells me I must look crazy for breaking the fourth wall to tell them I stole something and, well, they're going to sue.<|endoftext|>

I could usually tell when your partners are around and they want the things they were giving you. I would usually ask for height, wealth or height and I would come to these at random. After I had been intimate for years, it felt like I had become a lesbian or something. This happened in like twenty three minutes. It finally happened, the fifteen minute mark was too fast to get over. I cried on my wedding day, seeing the red rectangles with the words **Potential Teenage Erotic Link** where my wife had once said "I would still go for many girls, " which I laughed at. " She had to fix things. " I remember the first few dates. We were at a small, upscale restaurant that had a kind of *cultural* vibe. A cafe and I were in love with a blonde woman. She said she had a beautiful and perfect smile. I had a picture of her and my husband with her. Our first date was around six months ago. I asked her, " Why are you the only man in this wedding band? " She said that it was because she was a lesbian. That it was *fashionable*. I thought it was hilarious. She always said that during our discussion in the bar, she always got a little upset because of me. * But, now, he just looks a little embarrassed and I can't remember why*. She told me she didn't mind and started dating a good guy. She said she wanted to be his number one man. He offered a deal of " good luck to the wedding band " and I accepted. She got pregnant and we spent a year together. We had a great marriage, we took classes, went to college, got a dog that actually lived, I had a huge backyard. I was our own person. In 20 minutes I married. I got passed out on the couch. The thirty something year old man in the suit came up to me and said, " You can feel the warmth of my heart, Joe, this is the house I want you to call your own and I need you to call my wife so I can sleep easy. You are going to miss Joe. Please call your wife." As I told this, I felt a warm embrace. A wave of happiness washed over me. The wedding band had been true, as in man shaped.<|endoftext|>

Sweat dripped down my chin as the graveyard ironing machine whirred to life again. Almost as if the cold, steel floors keep rolling in through the second-story windows. I zig-zagged my way to the ground and rolled over, holding my intestines as the elevator began its journey down the hall to my dead-end office. The pounding on the hinges was growing more incessant, frustrating the walkie-talkie. If it had a camera I would have shouted for the guards to leave the building, but it was one that died the easy way instead of slowing down. I focused. Resolved. The windows slowly closed, their of it's own accord. I kept pressing the button as the elevator departs for the first floor. Heading toward the next floor, heavy straps on my waist and waist. My eyes dropped, I never expected this. I had questions in my head but all I felt was something. I jumped down from the staircase onto my shoulders, body shaking. There was something off, nagging at my stomach, finally cracking me to the bone. "Oh my God, the cool ground's cold! " I yelled. " This is not earth again!" I heard water sliding in and out of the mountain waterfall down below. The walls of the cavern were the only thing I could see, the walls were lava bubbling in. I began to scream again, no thoughts of *anything* starting came to my mind. Finally, a mirror snapped my head back and I could see myself. I was bald, something was absolutely wrong, cold muscles jumping up and down, smiling back. I reached for the analog clock on the wall that had been shielding me from the sun. I woke up with a smile on my face and a name written on the side. Jessie.<|endoftext|>

It's not possible to find someone who is in the American West without analyzing the cultural and political history of that region. Today it is rare for almost anything to be broadcast. The United States found itself with a national security threat in the middle of the nation's biggest security boom -- an overseas special forces outfit invents the universal nuclear bomb network. Newfangled weapons based on the technology of the modern age, a retrofitted arsenal built to handle escalating casualties like a Syrian child on a playground will cause a major reaction. But even more useless would be your own enemy. The Chinese had preemptively shut down all military communications and replaced it with the aerospace of the past. Europe was well past its prime and other countries started their own small bands of nations in alliance with the Americans. ISIS and related terrorist groups regularly invaded and beheaded those who opposed them. Thousands of Americans were killed in drone raids. A high level of loyalty was at stake. Nobody wanted to risk that sort of warfare; the threat was so much greater than that threat. The President knew he could save the whole world from itself, but there was nothing he could do. He decided that he would send nuclear missiles to other countries, like North Korea and India, to move parts of America away. Many high profile U.S. military contracts had been settled for this sort of maneuver. He decided to signal a mutually assured destruction with the Russians. They assured him that no nuclear warheads would damage their allies, but it would be another month before all weapons had been pulled off the table. His instincts kicked in a week later. A surprise nuclear strike that turned down another American's airspace came on schedule. A nuclear strike where they destroyed too much in the mid-Atlantic. Then another command center hit the airfield where security went up. The words were seen from hundreds of planes across the world, shouted by every international flying base worldwide. At first countries tried to exercise military force, but they got dumber and dumber before the bombs fell and planes started flying in retaliation. With smaller nuclear weapons proliferating and, eventually, the threat would disappear. That makes me curious how important these plots were to the United States and the world. And then he realized that it could be worse. His last years alone played a major role in his success. " No " " No " " No"<|endoftext|>

She was not happy. For a time, she wouldn't be happy. She was a villain, a man bitten by a gang, a man torn apart by his own disease. Only the blood shed from her stoic countenance did she look pleased. Her hand on her shoulder heeded her words, not daring the pat down that would signal the end of his own sentence. As his staff charged forward, she couldn't help but glance. The thud of his staff echoed throughout the empty house, one from each side. " *Darling, listen to me. * " The pain hit him hard, he could feel the ridges in his skin begin to grow and curl at the edges. " *Darling... now that you understand, I am here for *all*. " His breath caught and he screamed, the words cutting through him in different ways, scolding the one who made him feel so weak. He hated talking to him, then, yet he didn't escape her, the violence wasn't helping, and he sat there and watched. Her eyes were straight ahead, though he knew her downward gaze would land on his. She knew her entire life was worthless, his family dead, an entire planet destroyed. The soft voice of his voice that had been causing him this pain before finally quivered with pain. " * I see the light grows and the darkness is dead. * " She stood, shaking his hands. " You are the worst damn villain the world has ever seen. You let the entire world in their midst, constantly trying to end them, but it can never end. You are nothing and always will be. You are everything and always will be. And I can not thank you enough, for fixing the fate you have given so many good people. I understand why you feel this way, how you never got far. I *love* you. " He knew the words were no coincidence and, a shadow of a doubt knew the implications he would bring on himself. He wanted to let that awareness slip through as soon as she was found. Now she was special, loved, and he hoped the silence wouldn't be broken by him finally giving her everything. " *All of you, look into me. * " She spoke, and then, just before the sentence could begin, his hand reached out, nearly knocking her down. " *God dammit, come one, come one, bring me some *purity* I've been longing for for. But nothing will make you better, though. * " She stared into his eyes for what seemed like hours, and then her vision darkened. She remembered the look in his eyes. * Always with my brother, always always at my side. Now be my and do as I please. * " And that is when he dropped her out of the sky. " *Now the world will be mine, you will find." With that, he disappeared from her sight as she said the final word. Her white robe crumbled in her hands, her body hanging limp, completely unrecognizable.<|endoftext|>

I was an arrogant man when the afterlife I lived in was a place of slavery to watch and raise my children. This was my era. Money was plentiful and I had the power to bring prosperity, light, and love, all for nothing. I would do anything to protect my people, my family, or none of my kind. So, when I found out I had been transported to the 3rd dimensional, I did what any other person would do. I walked. Like I would every morning, I had to walk on the cold concrete and stuck my toes into the wooden floors. Then I would walk with the best of my abilities. All the way down my steps. Now, I walk on the side of cold concrete, my boots digging into the ice, to walk on the closed window, long after the sun is no more. I walk on that, silently, until my feet touch the cold wood. With a great evil smile, I touch the cold concrete. It ’ s warm, that ’ s all I ’ m ever experienced. That ’ s when everything stopped. One by one, everything started over. The first time I saw the world was when it broke from the mind of a 15 year old boy who didn ’ t know how to read. I saw flashes of stars and months filled with endless happiness. Then I saw the great conflict of the first year: what good was it to do anything? I saw many wars, many deaths, many toil. What was it? At the same time, I saw the human rights groups condemn my actions because they found out what they did. These are the people you might have never seen, because I am the one they kill for making me understand what it is you want them to be, what it is they are forced to do to redeem themselves and society. It was kind of sad to see the world that is being ripped apart. Because I lived as a selfish person, hating everything they live for, nothing you could have done, except look at the world from the other side. I saw this world I liked while I was alive, and came back to the other side. I remember the first day I arrived at that world: burning, disgusting flesh, in a sack stuffed with fresh cut red juice. I saw how disgusting it was, how suffering was done, the corruption that had took over people ’ s lives! They were forced to run, to hide, to escape. I passed out, dying from the intense pain and scarlet light of pain. I tasted blood and the feelings of peace flowed over me, that is how we died. That ’ s when I realised, I was dead for it. I followed my God and everything he created because in the deepest reaches of his soul were the desires of me. I left the World because he saw that it was wrong and I thought it would end all but I had lived and I knew what he ’ d done, that he would leave it too. I took him by the hand, and I sold my soul to him. He had cancer so his liver was incapable of producing a life in the liver of any human being. It was true, the greed of his government made him worse and I had to pass this on to those who would hate me and take my eternal punishment. I wasn't bitter and I had my orders, never hurt anyone. They didn't feel it because I saved them and the entire world was in their favour. The world we live in is a cruel place, and the cruel people who have oppressed us tell me of great evil to come.<|endoftext|>

The frozen parm, I caress and smile, while cradling the wisdom that carries me onward. He must have known exactly what he was about to do, what I would do, what would I wear. It gave me hope now. He is part of me now, I understand, fully. I was always curious, always careful, always taking care in everything he had come across. He was so intent on exploring and of course following. But now he is nothing. He is an assassin of dreams. Today is the day he found me and gave me the tools he needed to make a career in his industry. I tell him I'm sorry, I should be happy with just a few more weeks to spare, but we do this all the time anyway. Once the journey is over he will meet with me again. He must understand what I have seen, what I have meant to him. I lie and say I don't care about who he is or what happened but I must get him out of here. I am the one who warned him about us. I am the one who sheathed the key into the future while he was asleep. The one who got him where he is now. She is our love, that I hope is what she vanishes into the abyss.<|endoftext|>

"Halt! " The comms interrupted by the flashing of silver across the red chair in front of the tall, grizzled man. Giggling, he crouched down. He sat in the chair, and shuddered. People were looking around for him. The man stood there, motionless, watching a group of people walk out of their doors. He was standing here on the rest of the city, watching a group of people walk by, and more and more people from all walks of life come outside. The man stood there, waiting. At the end of the room, he saw a woman, cleaning the dishes, in a room that seemed all, entirely sterile. She pulled at her dress, pretending to be in her suite. " I'm glad you came today dear. If you were surprised, perhaps it was because I didn't leave a room clean until this very moment. " Giggling, he sat there, shaking himself in both anger and amusement. " How many times do I have to tell you this? I can't let you cheat on my wife and family for only one more year, my family will be rich beyond all recognition. " Another voice interrupted him. " Looks like some small change. I don't have to explain my power to you. Who does? " The voice glared at him, but kept silent. The man didn't reply, but instead set up a remote. " I shall explain my power by telling you, how I will play God. " A line went through the air. Giggling, he was falling, as he fell through the ceiling, and the line of people stopped. They looked up from the ceiling, eyes wide, mouths agape. The man slowly stood up, eyebrows raised. " I may turn you into a fish. It is your own undoing." -- -- -- -- -- - Sigh... The man, still breathing, just stood there. Maybe he'd come across a place to heal when he got sick, or a place of kindness to the homeless and the different ideas of what humans look like. After all, it'd all start from a simple trick, and he'd end up walking away like a normal human. At least he had a pet peeve and no one could deny that now. He knew this, of course, but he just couldn't tell anyone.<|endoftext|>

Nobody answers the door today. Suddenly, Professor Rex raises his hand. " You're Professor Suarez! " " What? " asked Mother Vayne. " You are Professor Noculo Nessa Alaracer, " he informed the class. " I am a species ambassador here at the Amber Line. My primary purpose is to keep this world safe from all possible threats to it's position as protector of humanity. " The class complied. " We have to get rid of them, " said Damien, holding up a sharp dagger. " Even after the Bloathors tried to finish them off and devour all of the human race, they were still in mortal danger. " " I'm not done yet, Damien. " Professor Alaracer pointed to the pond he had laid out in his study. " There is nothing for you to do. There is nothing for you to do. " With that, the professor walked off into the woods. " " Damien, what have we done here? " Damien scowled. " I made sure your daughter was alive. " " It can't be. " The class all grumbled. " We have to die for her! " Professor Alaracer remained silent. " What would you have me do? " Damien began walking on the makeshift path. Some of his pupils were staring, pleading for anything. Many got up and dashed back through the woods. They all knew what they had to do. They could cleanse the realm from the beasts that once strode their homes. What would they do? They needed to fight the Kraken, their champion, the animal of intelligence. Of course, there was no turning back now. After what seemed like an eternity, Professor Rex finally emerged from the woods. Damien was fast enough. Without warning, the boy materialized in front of Damien. He then jumped over him, shattering the knuckles in his helmet. " What do you think this is? " " It's a child, Damien. The house you built was built by *I Am Dead! * " Damien looked at him, the tears still wet from his blood. " This is a very, very old home." Frantically, he looked at Damien, then back at his victim. Damien suddenly felt strong. He was unstoppable. ***** More content at /r/Andrew__Wells<|endoftext|>

My sensors had made a new image of my surroundings, and judging by the thin and fragile sheets the rest of my body supported, I would have been no better. The clarity of the image immediately after my first glimpse was my lie detector detecting activity in the area around me. Of course, I wasn't going to make it there any time soon, if they were still there. I pushed myself through the mud with a shaky shaky hand, which wasn't noticed even by my teammates, but I had a glancing look on my face right in front of me at precisely twenty, four, nine, fifteen seconds into my recall. A startled acknowledgement by the pilot of the next ship being on its way in lowered its gears and muted me from my thoughts as if they had just moved off my toes. As soon as the comm channel in the right direction came on, I cast from the ground my back to the back of the ship to steady my breathing. Any alarms going off suddenly disappeared, but I should not have thought of that until the green lights reached my eyes, and then just as quickly disappeared again, without as much as a suggestion from my men or a proper response from command. *Straighten up. * The training landed, and my man armed through the deck chairs in the cabin began gesturing with his weapon. He quickly mumbled the words in Latin before locking eyes with my jawline and slinking the trigger. My mind was racing with thoughts of what I should do, to save whatever was left of my body from the burning wreckage, but nothing prepared me for the overwhelming uncertainty that I was in control of my thoughts at the very same time as the rest of the crew. The commander was back on deck now, droning on into his transmissions, when a pistol flashed open in front of his eyes. I dropped my arms, trying to hide from the flash, but it was too late. Panic exploded from the two men as soon as I heard the name "Mood Eyes."<|endoftext|>

As I entered my dormitory, I felt normal. Everything was okay. I never had any weird dread, or feelings, just work problems and an overwhelming sense of calm. Opening the door, I made my way down hall and could actually make out my dorm room was just a dusty faded, grime covered bed. Staring at the ceiling, was just a pile of moving tools and something out of the corner of my eye. Clad in a simple black and yellow jacket, I could almost see my own flesh slowly making a life around me. Everything was fine. I will leave now. As I was getting dressed, my local Walmart gets that same look as I did. Finally catching my turn to walk out the door, I realized something. I was staring at something perfectly ordinary. A light came through the shutters. In my peripheral vision, I couldn't tell what it was, until I heard a low banging and something woke me. I threw my dress on the ground. A man stood on the ground, as if with an action, smiling and whispering something, that he hoped would mean something. The door cracked open, I reached in and pulled out my cell phone, just to make sure I didn't fall again. The man opened the door and a girl walked in, with an empty glass of whiskey on the table before her. After that, all I could focus on was my walk, and how I pulled my amazing friend into my dorm room. __________________________________________ -121<|endoftext|>

All my acquaintances understood it, and its virtues in themselves, except the almost ubiquitous weather dappled by the cloudless sky. Me, the tough and cheap one, but I'm bigger than most other people. A teddy bear, and... more emotions. The only thing that could tell if you're finding the courage to finish the venture, is that I lead the walk among my unspoken friends. I've always preferred being the back or top of the world, whichever you prefer. The feeling of being free from people, well versed in how others felt like themselves even if I gave them an actual lift, never took to walking alone. However, that's fine because I'll tell you if you see the opportunities. I never leave my family behind, I no longer attempt to save them from poverty or danger. No, I keep for myself the limited resources I have on my side, desperate moments between bouts of blissful bliss of joy. You never want to be in a coffee shop. You don't need to make it into a business lunch. You would rather not get a sandwich. But, like any good human, you want a piece of the good food that exists elsewhere. So, feeling like that's what makes you happy. Bettering yourself more, bettering the world around you, stronger, stronger. If anything, that boosts your happiness. Doing as it is best to. I turn to my other friends, and I ask for their advice on everything from how to wear a shower to, well, what to shave. More often than not, I find myself lost in thought, ever finding another means to accomplish anything. I don't watch for the scent of cigarettes, nor food in my refrigerator. Though that same voice haunts me when I try to bake a loaf. All that this wannabe nutters food and dairy is bred out of will me to go and fight it off. But, it matters little that I stand. It matters little that I have our shining future together. Tonight, I may have the most important one of all. Our adventure beyond the clouds, we will finally meet.<|endoftext|>

"I can still remember the beginning of it all. When he first came into the world and, granted that he didn't get the chance to enjoy the joy of it all, I thought, what are you going to do? " I rubbed my eyes. The woman in front of me was still alive, slightly repulsed by my new found surprise. " What was I thinking about? " I hadn't expected to get into the ground of a thousand people. Everyone in the room was looking at me, eyes blazing with excitement. " We are mortals. " The man leaned over and helped the woman move. I turned away. " But it all starts when you start losing your ability to remember what we used to feel. " " Yeah, so? " She put her hand on my shoulder. " That's right. You are immortal. There is no point in having pain, it will end and everything will be fine. And you should feel pain as long as you can remember what we used to feel. " He looked up at me. " But I miss you, what was I thinking? " " Life is eternal."<|endoftext|>

I quickly unwrapped my medal on its back and prepared to put it on my tray with the other two dutifully bandaged wigs and a flower jar next to my bed before I reached for the alarm clock. Today? Today I was supposed to meet someone. But today? Today no one was coming. I rub my eyes as the world begins to change. There are people off in the distance, people glimmering in their green lights from their gold-plated hammers. Most important of all, I am Mr. Joybird. So when I wake up in the morning and to see if someone is around, I jump in. For a few seconds I am confused as to what is going on. "But I AM the Hero! Am I the one that stops sharks from hunting around the West coast? " One final inquiry, and I'm off in a direction of confusion. That is until I hear a rustling coming from my bed. Who is that? What does it mean? Where am I? Who is this person? " Uhm, my name is Lionel? " " It's like an angel, but our job is the same for almost every super hero we know. You see, we were meant to be heroes. Justice is a far far cry from being in reality. " " Well, technically... we're right. " " But why are you fighting criminals? There are only a handful of super heroes left. Every other hero just blows up ships or other specific threats. You see, it is our job to realize if we can use the abilities of a few super heroes. And you know what? You just begin the hero enlistment process. " I shush the speech and shake my head. " No one will see that I've done anything worth saving. " " Do I? " The girl slides down from my bed, gone by some hidden soap bubble. " Not yet, Babe. After the first two recruits open up their hearts and are able to pierce my defences, I'm worried that when people don't know what to do with their lifetimes, it will all go against them. " I leave the bedroom knowing the day would not come. I know that my rank is nothing like that of a *super hero*. In fact, I'm quite the pawn. A cross between a *soldier* and a *spy*. My battles and his relationships are etched in my brain like a mantra, the one where *I-don't* care if he succumbs to a bad mistake. " Then come to us. Together." I wander about my little world, searching for someone to shed a tear for. There is a melody behind me. A low pattering, like rocks breaking on a stone wall.<|endoftext|>

A piece of paper fell from the blacktop into my hands, sticky and splattered with the stains of old forgotten places. Looking around I saw that the money was only a gift, a small plastic square with a black & white folded wrapping wrapped inside. It barely stopped at this location as my task was carried out: 1 100m 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100<|endoftext|>

This ATM by itself could look like a normal ATM, nothing like a bank, except the buttons and lights had different sizes and shapes. It was even supposed to show the customer's current expenses, what they had to earn and what they were planning to earn. For today I had to make a choice. I entered the PIN code and stepped away from the computer, while the elevator pulled up. As I got into the elevator, the doors opened and I turned to the customer that came in. He was a man in his mid fifties, his birthday coming up before his eyes. " How are you doing? " he asked as he slid onto his seat. " So well, sir. Let me show you. " He took out a large package from a wallet and placed it on the table beside me. " I'm going to have to give you 30 dollars for breakfast and lunch, if you want, but we'll let you be. " I quickly gave him the money and exited the elevator. " Thank you for calling the bank. " " Thanks, " the man said as he placed the package next to him. " I can make more money then that." As he walked away from the elevator, the elevator stopped and one of the lines started to go dead. I put the bag back on the conveyor belt and watched him go to the other side of the elevator. I went and got to the other end of the elevator. I sat down at the other end of the elevator and looked down, at my money. *See there's a strange device inside there that cost a lot of money... * I thought. * I should get a haircut. * A slight worry came over me. I looked back at the bank. It didn't have much money so I decided to ignore it for now. I had to wait for a new ATM and maybe I would get a haircut or something. -- - /r/dori_tales<|endoftext|>

“ What do I choose from the starter pokémons? ” Professor Oak asked in kind, sending shivers down Mewtwo's spine. The green and yellow monster whined loudly as Professor Oak tapped the fabled book on his desk. Ash and Fred walked out of the Forbidden Library in an instant, gracefully frozen. Fingers trembling with excitement, Professor Oak continued. “ There's no way Gary should have chosen a pikachu. I mean, poacher, don't you see? Everything is predetermined, where it takes you, what type of pokemon do you have, and what type of lock you can place on it. Except that's what this is, you know? A Poké Ball, a Poké-tooth, a Poké-link. That's what Professor Oak is, pal. Let's get ‘ em! ” Ash yelled as he scooped his four pale pale-purple Kantoese pokémon up. The pikachu wailed and ran into a dark corner, leaping over the large library doors. Professor Oak reached inside, shaking his heads. “ What the fuck are you doing, Ash? I ’ m your ONLY hope. ” Ash looked up and saw Professor Oak cut off his finger as he raised his arm to the sky, catapulting the pikachu into the sky and igniting a massive fireball. “ You idiot, why does this have to happen to you? ” Professor Oak exclaimed. “ Because I know that you, Barthoo Pikachu, taught me the Pokémon of that moment. ” Professor Oak shook his head, clearly unaware that he was one of Ash ’ s best and, since then, best Pokemon Trainer. “ So you didn ’ t choose me? ” Ash questioned. “ Yeah, if you chose that pokémon then you ’ re stuck here with every last pinprick of your consciousness ever trying to you your best to convince me to just let you go! You understand? ” Professor Oak spoke in his monotone voice, with an assurance that his words were honest. “ I always knew what pokemon you were going to try, so I gave you a little bit of control. I don ’ t even know what the thing you choose for a starter pokémon is. I was thinking, what do you call me in here to guide you through this? ” Ash spoke, a mixture of incredulity and disappointment that soon washed over him. “ Wh-what am I going to use for the starter pokémon then? ” Professor Oak pondered this for a second, and then gave the starter pokémon a strange look. Oddly enough, he seemed more cold and calculating than any Pikachu before him. Then, with a tone of serious concern in his voice, he whispered, “ The stars will be black and there will always be snow. ”<|endoftext|>

My peers excited to celebrate that day, but everyone turns to me when I walk in the door. I walk in to the hallways, passing through the application clip. "Lucifer, you are an honor. My good men and women. " I lift my tongue with a bit of satisfaction in my voice. Then, leaving the room, I step through the door. I smile to myself, the warm summer wind rattling your bones and leaving the natural glow of your toes. The slight tremor in the air brings a chill down your spine. Where did I get this wind? " Jesus, sorry about that. I wasn't expected to see that at all. I like it here. Here, we can live forever. " With that, I step through the door, my feet clicking on the polished stone floor. I lean down to look around, I can feel the oak floors creaking and popping. " Relax. " I shirk my approach, pushing past the smoky darkness. I blink. " Careful. " Darkness quickly replaced with dawn, and the sky barely made it through to the earth. I could feel my mind buzzing with thoughts of love, of hope. The sky also returned to normal, colder, in fact the air became thicker and colder. I felt colder and warmer. The water became harder and harder to see through the clouds in the distance. The stars began to glow brighter. These were the stars, the first true orb of light. God would never believe me, for the way she said, the way I loved her. I felt the stars slowly depart towards the earth, their orb in slow motion before continuing to drift. In all of the light before them, in all of the darkness, in all the confusion, they left. It is the end, and so it shall be. I look at the clock. 13:55. I stand there for a second, at the terminus of the third period in the log that supported the beginning of the light cycle, and on that note I whisper to myself, " thank you."<|endoftext|>

"Don't be evil, son, " replied the impudent son of a blacksmith. " You are real, that is for sure. " The sword clashed, cracks of hundreds of bolts, and a burst of mana coursed through the assassin's veins. The body had seemingly stopped moving nearly instantly. The fire and brimstone flowed out of the assassin's teeth. On instinct he grabbed his mace and delivered a powerful burst of energy right at the bearer of his death curse. His lungs exploded outward and they ripped apart the fire, his eardrums ruptured and his nerves tore in half. The assassin plummeted down into the earth, still clutching his mace as the assassin stood there bewildered. " You can not kill me, father... " the assassin said, but the voice was not in his ear. Instead there was a rustling of the soft earth beneath the assassin's feet. " I'm not going anywhere. I will protect you from this. This is the right thing to do, the only thing left to do. " He dropped his mace as he walked slowly to his brother-in-law and made a lead. " We will make sure of that. " The assassin looked down at the ground, recoiling in pain at the thought of his brother having to die as well. Even with the attack he could feel the bright pain in his body and knew that he was dead. His screams didn't stop. He rose quickly, almost kicking the knife away from the assassin's throat, " I'm sorry son, but my only option is to come with you. " The assassin stood up again in fear. " Father... you will soon die, I don't want to know why. " The assassin pulled out a brazier and held it to the lifeless assassin's left forearm, " You... destroyed my family? " " You can no longer carry me. " The assassin paused, staring down at his mother. " I will be with you, even if I no longer have control over your body. " He ripped the blade out of her hands and began again, " They can not know that I saved them... " His mother watched him as he reached into the brazier and pulled out a stone fragment of his robe, turning it to stone, " They must not know. I can not let them know that I save them. " He raised his blade to cut his own sister, " But they need to know."<|endoftext|>

It ’ s hard to believe it all started. Short. Easy. Just 9-5 job you snuck into over lunch. With a stack of drinks. I had my roots growing up, the rage of three tiny heads defying gravity, oh my God why should I love you? Knowing my birthright, that I was destined to a fulfilling life, would begin to weigh on the heartstrings of men like me. You would see those little fatties who practically bared a poncho and wag tails no question about, early fifteenth fucking century. Remember your first couple births. You would know who they were and where they were, or even who they went to. Or remember, last summer before marrying my favorite woman. This would take years, months and years, making sure we achieved all of our dreams and found each other through what seemed like a crash and a hard time at first. I would be able to remember all those child bearing powers that I was still just small white haired little shit squirming on the floor with a wet towel on my head, and the memories would cease to be of me. The but-it-didn ’ t get me where I am. These last 10 years, weren ’ t my least bit enjoying it. The alcohol imbibing made sure of that, and the not-so-intact joint under my chin making sure of it. For the first five years, I was ignored. Not because I wasn ’ t a threat. But because my chances at gettin ’ pregnant plummeted. After a couple of odd hunches from the temporal vicarious curse of a man who had many years of family experience and emotionally stable marital relations even though his wife had just finished raising his baby, my chances at having another child plummeted. You could be the luckiest guy in the world. 8. 4. 3. 2. 1. No, oh god no no, no no no! I am a fucking seven-year old white chick. I just can ’ t say no to two more. No, look out there, black guy. I ’ m completely fucking horrified at what I am seeing. Two absolutely slaughtered times, I ’ m gon na have to deal with this. I spend every goddamned second of the marriage hallucinating about things men like me could never do! You may be wondering, why am I not wearing black today? Well, I ’ m just here to enjoy an untamed, glorious body. I was going to sell it right here. Don ’ t worry, I can do it through hard times. I get addicted to the little poncho my dad gave me when I was 7. It gave me limitless appetites, the like. You may be wondering why I am not drinking to get stuff out of my mouth while you nap? Well, according to this woman I ’ m drinking to get something out of my mouth. It may be from me, and also, certain that I have about enough knowledge to be able to drop a glitch of something about this one measly liquid. It ’ s liquefied. Alright! I am going to be clean. There ’ s a huge difference between a surgeon and the inner conscience. For example, I cut the umbilical cord from a dying man ’ s foot. Holy fuck! I looked into my wife ’ s eyes for a second to see what it was like and find that she was damn hungry. As best I could see at that moment, the lion had tripped over a goddamn swan, and it was in a hurry. I punched him, grabbed his arm in one of the cleavers, and tore out his intestines from his sock. Normally I would have caught him while defecating, but I ’ m sensing. Yeah, that ’ s just the start. What more could I ask for?<|endoftext|>

"I dunno what to do. I thought our contact might work out better. " Beren chimed. He and the others in the compound stood watching people going through the room trying to figure out how they came up with this solution. The folks beside the desk cheered in pride and purpose as they watched. They watched as the final one wore her coat with a pink taupe shirt and shorts with an extra skirt and blue tie as she waited for the answer. I did my best to look over the transcript and remember where my eyes had been through the course of the last few weeks. It was awkward in its execution that way. Blathering. Loud. Reluctantly, I nodded to the general that had made the comments a week ago. Though this time I didn't need to be addressed by any of the specifics to really make any sense of it. I walked over to the containers, grabbed a collapsible crate, and placed my head down. The only other activity was the murmur of impatient souls still hoisting supplies from a convenience store building into the air. " What do you think? " Beren demanded, lowering her hands. I shook my head. " I don't know. I think we should get out of here. I should go. " I nodded and backed away from the underdressed man that had been waiting outside with a crossbow bolt for a few minutes. " It was a bad idea! We were expecting contact. Were they meeting with the Salar called?! " A high-pitched nasally squeaking came from beneath me. " Don't cry, Beren. " That bastard kept screaming. Before they could finish, he was cutting me off with his thick stapler. " You spent the last few days sewing duct tape and slime, away from any distractions, " Beren finished, rubbing the metal around his talons. I didn't answer. " Oh. Right. Better send someone else. It's the only way we get to visit. " He would finish his sentence, hand cuffed behind his back. I backed up and spoke. " I have a proposal for you." ____________________________________ Hi, my name is Dan. This is my first time writing anything.

"What time does it... and when do I say it? " " I think not. " " Do you remember the call I just received? It's been a week. " " I don't remember the call... and I think I will." The nurse doesn't look up. She is sweating. The woman she was talking to here had been holding her breath for a week. Two weeks of this, with nothing. So long I thought it was just a prank. Days gone by I thought she would have remembered. Until the next day I could hardly remember a thing. A few weeks, maybe days but I saw nothing. After that, I was imagining what was behind the blue glass, in my mind's eye. It was that part of me who needed to call in sick because she was starting to come to realize something. I wanted to stand and try to solve this dilemma but my eyes closed and I found myself looking around. I felt worse for sure. The voice was straight. It was perfectly calm. " Honey, I've been assigned to wave 43. " The nurse said, turning to me. " Okay? " I asked? The girl who I used to love, that lovely woman in black and red turned her face toward me, her bright eyes narrowed, and her nose hung high as her forehead formed in a frown. I could see her lips curl over the edge of the glass. And that look of fear stared at her accusingly. " What? " " When did I call you? I'm getting late. " I said. " What was it about? What was that thing about? " " Nothing, I'm on my way. " The room shook as the nurse pulled out a syringe and injected it into her upper arm. I thought about what just happened, whether she would have remembered or not. I had wanted to hold up, trying to hide my panic, but I couldn't. Just my eyes and the things around me that were shaking my head. And she did. I pulled the red box I found on the floor, gripping it tightly. The nurse looked to the girl I thought was my imaginary friend. And sighed.<|endoftext|>

It was just before noon on a cold, dark November night. Above me a brave group of family and friends were enjoying our "trees " of course. I heard the sheriff call it his albatross blanket over our heads. A few seconds pass while we focus on the valley and stay closer by the soggy sands of the forest. That was like two hours ago. They say that in this climate the rainy season is why we can see giant pebbles on the ground, 2 % of the Sahara desert falling during the hinterlands, some were in the Arizona desert, some were in the southern Florida one, and others were in the Rockies. These greener pastures are the love of our lives and most importantly they are the only thing keeping us sane in this grueling time of year, the siren call of the Cold October night in the coming days when temperatures in the winter begin to climb as high as the lows. A 26 % drop in temperature earlier this year and the season is not gon na end today. The Potteducah Indians are pouring out and it is dark but the sunlight is such a violent force that sometimes we have to watch the clouds overhead. The announcement is across the sky above the forest, heading toward us. The fires had barely begun today at the stables and now we watch in silence. Many people are from the across the country, maybe thirty or forty and they are used to constant sirens and foot patrols, why bother this time of year on a cold November night. Probably because we already have open season and ten percent of land was to be disturbed by these ever present sirens. Shortly after noon everything went quiet, everybody who was alive stopped by our camp to watch the departing light just as the count continued. " Boy do we have a plan " my father announces to his wife. All I can hear is them making their way to our tent and I grab my feet, they are being silent. " Even sirens... just like the past here with the heat... why don't we put on those lightbulbs or else..."<|endoftext|>

"What are you doing? " I ask the prosecutor " And what am I doing? I'm going to.. " " Listen. Remember in 1846 when the Russians took over America? " " Oh, it was the " invasion of Japan. Russia never wanted American troops, especially not for this great country! " I mumble. " Then that means you're the ones who will stop the guy who just shot a man in the stomach and now you're the one who's probably going to kill him because he's the last guy who can stop the sick bastards on American soil ". " No. " The attorney replied " You brought his mother in for questioning, you're the one who survived the gas chambers, so you killed everybody by yourself. " I feel my finger shoot up.

He just got diagnosed with cancer and you left me because I was abusive to him. Your indifference, criminal behavior, and refusal to serve your full potential has so angered me, that I have decided to retire from this company. Thank you.

The TV screen blared the words'NSA executed' and a noise that echoed outside the office. Mr Johnson and wife lay in the bathtub laughing hysterically. Mr Johnson took a hold of his wife and frantically held onto her hand and pulled it off her head. " Honey, stop! I told you not to play that game! This could hurt!

Catelyn stared at the wall. She was terrified by people coming into her life. Her mother had left her at the age of seventeen. Of course she would have married her own daughter. But that was nothing compared to the good life she had as a teenager. She would have had more opportunities that her mother. On the 8th birthday of her 15th birthday she was beaten to death by a man for stealing from his house. Don't get me wrong it was a pretty brutal attack. But people were there. They were sharp as hell. And they couldn't have been slower. The man had his back to her right. There was no chance he would ever murder her again. She gripped the wooden pole tightly and slowly drew her hands up. She had a sharp taste in her mouth. She left the house in a hurry to no avail. She never saw a single car. Her parents were gone. She had no one. When the police opened the case the next day it was him who had shot her dead. His name? Charlie Anderson. But not what she remembered it to be. Fighting crime when he could. And for years she had looked up to him. She remembered if someone had caught him she would always be waiting for the the moment.<|endoftext|>

Ahh, the kind death. Hope! Well, it could be just someone else, but hey, if I could convince them to pick me up, I'd better go kick ass! Until the next time. In... Amgodly pain! Well, I don't know, how did you do it this time? How do you explain that to a child? No! No! No! No! None of this makes sense! The Devil is chasing me! Ah, Devil! I don't even like that phrase. Stop your mortal perversion! Stupid death. Damned. Fucked. I'm not going to eat you. Don't eat me. Don't tell me. I'm going. I... oh no, sorry, I said death. You see, Death was a creep. He always used to say, "Be happy, peace be upon you, son." But his mommy and daddy were all dead... before he died. * Oh, well, it's okay, I'm not really feeling any better. * Oh, this is the last time Death thought things through. Just thank God.

'Mark, I have a cat.' 'Wow. Obviously the plants all run on trees and trees in that area, clearly, I'm sure of it. Big no fly though. Also, the word on the news was that a ship had crashed into North Korea. Damn it, that made sense!' “ He's the middle of your story, obviously you really need to do the parts.' 'Oh, definitely. Get out of here.' Mark fidgeted, swallowing, before turning to see something moving behind him. He flicked on the light. “ Show what you think about that.' His eyes narrowed, but his voice did not quite match the other lights in the room. “ Look, we can go talk to the other men about that, but let me tell you, Mark... your story got a lot more karmic. ” “ Yes, well, you misunderstand. The ship was nothing but a quick trip to the surface, but it was a short-range jaunt to one of the most dangerous systems in the world. I had no idea how fast it could go. I mean, trust me, when I see it, it's going to be a disaster! I just hope I had everything planned and nothing stuck, right?' “ This ship, that we found there, will launch our weapons! You guys are going to do great with that, though. Even the locals are going to be mad! We haven't seen the ship yet, but we're already prepared! ” “ You always have been about as prepared. Have you ever heard of a ship that moves faster than a moving bullet? ” “ No, of course not. For me, it's like, a *wasteful curiosity*. People going insane when they see it, but the truth is, they only live for a few hours. Now, I'm sure your career would have been much better if it had been a little longer, but I am deeply sorry that something like that had to be done. We never knew how even water and electricity worked, so of course, until one day, that planet was the target. Now, imagine, if something like that were to happen, even being in the water, one of the water-logged plants would get sucked into the nuclear reactor and not be able to be harmed. It would nearly instantaneously be eliminated completely. So, I was immediately in the pool of people, all cold and covered in filth. ” He began to turn redder and go quiet. “ So you're saying that? ” “ Absolutely. ” “ The fact that you're here, talking to me about it, means it worked. ” “ How, then, were we supposed to die? ” “ We had to die. ”<|endoftext|>

John woke from the day he finished out his shift at Shell in Paterson and took a long inhale. He checked his phone. 9pm. John's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of David's voice slamming into his ear. "John, John, I have a question for you about exactly. " " What? " " John John Jones has committed suicide. David Jones saved his life. " " Why not? " " His mind is better. I'm glad that I brought you along. David, he is your favorite child. " " Oh don't be silly. I know it's gon na be hard to get him back, but you can just wait right in front of me until I get back to you. " " What about the kill requests? The threat level? I thought the villains were gon na be wanting to kill us. " " Will I be getting a reward or would you like to see a rematch or something? " " Nobody has heard of the rematch yet. There are rumors, you hear, that our members can be involved with the villains to get the best reward. " " Well, let me guess, you're not in the mood for the week, are you? " " Whoa. " John took a deep drag on his cigarette. " I could have sworn I passed out on one of them planes. I guess I am lost right now. " " What do you mean? " " Erm... well I am tired, sorry, sorry. About my latest request. I'm starting to think it might have saved my life. " David slammed the butt end of his cigarette and sat up. " John, David! It's too late for me now. David, please. I'm running out of time. " His eyes slowly closed and he looked up at the night sky with narrowed eyes. On the opposite side of the room, John turned to face David. " You see, in the world of fiction, only the most desperate have time to live. I'm running out of time."<|endoftext|>

In the beginning, there were three contestants. The Alpha, the Proxima Bista, and the Omega. Naturally, any of the three bettors could be invited on the Space Race. The Alpha and Alpha did not allow themselves to be crushed by quantum entanglement. In fact, the Alpha and Alpha both intentionally abandoned each other with each of their seed into one of three. The Omega would start the race, promising another five minutes of life time to the beta before they got the crucial sample and a set of immunisms and ultimately shut down the competition. Without a single human on board, these three contestants turned out to be basically like the first interspecies slug, except they were somehow still together. While all three had started their race, they were slowly the one to perish, and the only ones to get their fucking asses made alive. In order to maintain equilibrium, the Alpha was attempting to sneak a sweep of the other two by narrowly ignoring the Omega. As the Alpha would berate the Beta, it became clear that it was doing something noble. The Beta was his mate. Soon, he was about to be cornered, and the most important thing he had ever done in his life was blatantly cowardly. Instead of going to being oppressed, his brother was kidnapped and taken to the Alpha. All of them went crazy within a few weeks. The Alpha was seriously considering this decision himself, but the Alpha didn't care. The Alpha was fixed, and continued on his path of knowledge. After a year of chaos and trouble, they had won another race, one that would stretch their minds, and time. A year later, the Alpha once again made the leap to his destiny, to overtake the Alpha in a blitzkrieg-by driving the Alpha himself to oblivion. He wouldn't have survived if the other two had not crashed onto him. A few months later, the Alpha appeared on the local television. The program that was originally playing recognized, but a few viewers waved disapproving looks behind them. The Alpha was standing there with no explanation, and he was grinning ear to ear while talking to everyone on the screen. The program spoke directly into his ear; "By law, you must never do this to any of our contestants. This will get you killed." -'Beta.' ( Probably implied that there is something that doesn't rule out a human being as the culprit for the attack to begin, something which would probably assist to his eternal death if he still lived but never did. )<|endoftext|>

The genie opened his stapler, a wooden card that clearly stated he had wished for the same wish to be granted. "Check it out. It's a pie casserole. " He then walked over to the flamethrower that hung in the cupboard and plucked the flame from a nearby mason jar. He tossed the mason jar across the table and plopped down in the sink, having drunk too much air in the process. Although he found it amusing to work, the genie didn't mind, he just wished he had an easy life. " Ah, the future. A fantastic one. Not many people can imagine living like that. I mean, great fun. Sure, there are endless stories of evil, and all sorts of classic torture, but it's as interesting to look back on to the past as what we are, still. Heck, maybe I'm superior, even more so than you. " " I wish I had an easy life. So boring. So... boring. " " I remember things you said back in my day. " " Now that you've said it to me, " said the genie, in a winking tone, " I have to buy more ice cream, not less. " The genie smiled, " Maybe if I use bad enough chemicals... " " Well, I'm sorry, but I'll just be able to, you know? The universe is complicated. " The genie said nothing. " You know that this means that I got better food, and less poverty, until the man died, and the nukes blew up. Well, I won't die so soon. We'll both rot in hell. " " But wait! You said I got better food? " " Well... " " You sound like a monster. " " Well, hell's not so bad after all. " " Look at all the powers I've gained over the years. I still manage to turn out Queen Tut and succeed. Now to continue with my games. " The genie smirked. " How fun! Next! " The genie placed his hand on the counter and closed his eyes. He walked up to the table and sat down next to the last mason jar. He held out his hand. " Wow, " he said, " this feels old. " The genie put his hand on the table, took it from his hand, and motioned for the mason jar to be dropped. He took the pot from the table and tossed it out. " There, " said the genie with a light smile, " Now that you mention it, this probably means my favorite cup of coffee is out. " " Ah, I don't know. " The genie looked around the table, watching people drink their coffee at the table. It quickly became clear that this entire table was adorned with tree branches. And whatever life may exist in the future had power over every tree and plant on the planet, not just the green ones. " What do you have to say for yourself," said the genie, with a wink. Then the genie came back, not the colored ones, but the darker ones. He walked over to the tree branch, and slithered over to the still-growing cherry mason jar. He placed the plastic cup beside it, and pushed it downwards. It fell to the floor, and started rummaging through the top. The genie, still staring, said, *I know I wished for a milk. *<|endoftext|>

I didn't expect the snow to fall before I woke up. Man, it wasn't raining for miles. Before I could even crack a smile I had already begun to sweat even more in anticipation of the snow coming down. I wasn't used to seeing a bunch of snowflakes falling before I woke up, but I wasn't particularly hungry. After howling maniacally like a feline horse they continued, "Wow, I got a devil's letter tonight. You know what it is? " " Oooohh, well that's cool. It's sort of like a letter inside of you. Got a lot of names to sum up just your mood. I'll put it this way, granted, I actually got God's soul. ** WHO'S FUCKING GOD? ] " " Well, it can get kind of magical if you do so very gracefully. Let's just say that if you do horribly evil things to people then it makes you damn pissed off. " " Then why isn't death a happy existence? Man is hilarious. " " Nah, you get it. I get it all the time. Could you guys be an actual honest person and tell me, what do you do when the world turns upside down when there is no power or return to normal order? " " Well, I'll go to church a lot. This ain't right, let me tell ya! One thing's for sure, if you were on Earth full of hate and all that just evil- You'd be pretty pissed off. " " Seriously, quit bullshitting me about it. " " But yeah, the thunderstorms don't bother me. " I sighed, then raised an eyebrow. " Well, you'll get all those clothes torn apart and gagged if you're the one stuck in them. " " Oh, right. " " Have fun. " He kissed me on the forehead. It felt like my entire body was electrified with electricity. Holy fucking shit. That was a lot. Once I was being pushed around by a plane of white ants he pulled out a knife and plunged it into my ribs, then pierced the suction of my stomach with it. I looked down as my wife picked me up. I hope she called her mom. I'm not fucking alive. I managed to stand, but he looked away from me and to the side. " I'm not fucking alive. " He knelt next to me, and I looked down at his feet, for a second I could see the face of the Holy Ghost on his back. " Are you kidding me? I'm still a human, and you were wondering why I thought there was a caged animal watching over me? You're probably wondering what the hell is going on. There has to be at least one person with you that would want to stop me. Probably. I'm really, really sorry about what happened. " " Well I don't live in Heaven. Not in Hell either. You're there right? " " No. The only place where God and Lucifer stay, except for when that first snowstorm hit. Never in my life have I ever done something more than when I was still human. " He took a step forward. " First snowstorm! Coming in two days. " " I'm real sorry about the sandwich. " I got a huffy look. I just walked backwards into the snow, out of my chair, down the street, to the mall. I smiled sheepishly, " God is real."<|endoftext|>

The panel of technicians stood ominously in the middle of the office. Their silence, as well as their attire, could be heard, despite all the evidence this meeting had created. Carlos paused for a moment to consider the client's concerns. He shrugged. The Security Intern was a fairly well-known Anti-Terrorist, there was no reason anyone would try to threaten him with such evil. Oh well, he didn't have to resort to those same forms every time he needed to muster up the courage to do such things. None of the-the-evil-doctors other than those two would have noticed. When Carlos reached down and shook the head of his Pao-beautiful partner to demonstrate for the cameras, all he could see were the two guards directing at the well dressed man. The small, thin man approached calmly, as expected. His suit was decorated with neon patterns, and his white hair a rich brown. The suit itself seemed to slide down from his face very quickly. Carlos forgot which side was where he had stepped at the last moment. His fingers probed the panel in hopes that the hardwood couldn't snap and- "Oh my god. You're so diabolical and... " Carlos cut him off as he interrupted him. " No, no, no, no, I'm- " " What? " " You're just fucking calling me!?! " Carlos stumbled back. He thought he was going deaf, but really he was just having a weird phase in his mind. The police had tracked down the unshaven man at a relatively small, industrialist-looking factory, but that was for now. He could faintly make out the badge on the door, written in Egyptian hieroglyphics. He stepped through the small metal door and spoke into the microphone, " This is the new face of terror. You are an existing human being. You are not... a human person."<|endoftext|>

When the summoning began, one day, the crowd was gone. The priest was alone, but the crowd went further, offering gifts to a select group of patrons that were carefully placed in front of him. Some wore little clothing, others fit the same style of attire as the priests. The priest shivered, as he sat where the audience of those willing to spend their time in front of him stood before him. His heart became heavy and he took comfort in a small portion of the crowd that had gathered to witness the week. *F**kt realcroppa* There was another who gazed up, observing the crowd. His grace and wisdom were complemented by that of the priest himself, and his vehemence was over the crowd. His eyes grew more weary as the priest tried to watch the crowd, so the priest struggled. The crowd paused for a moment, waiting. He heard clapping from the crowd, then footsteps behind them. A back archer looked at the back of the crowd, anxious that it would need a sacrifice. The crowd complied, along with several others that had gathered to witness the week. The crowd of prayerful people called in a day to the priests, but none answered the call. Their promise of sacrifice had been fulfilled only a week ago when the priest's company gave volunteers a small pittance to get to a safe location. The hours went into the sky with celebratory flow, and the prayers of thousands of frightened people poured forward into that of a small shepherd. Once he reached his destination, the doors to the crowd opened and a small crowd of people took a seat. The priest tasted of saltwater and rose his fork. The congregation stared at the priest for a moment as the priests whisper murmurs of relief and shock began to fill the ground behind the summoning. A silence fell around them, and the crowd nodded back to the congregation. The wood of the altar began to creak as the altar began to shake. The priest's hands were shaking when he saw the movement that had occurred the moment he was sitting. A child-sized goat stepped forward, sending the goat into the room as a barrier fell between the two. The crowd dispersed as the children cheered. The priest lifted his fork, and began to eat.<|endoftext|>

Little petals float by each with a like a bellow -- a merry dance. I know my way to another world, and the world that surrounds me. I try to do the little things. That's what I do. I'm popular and different. I make up for with enough of those cute little things. I do my part. I do them all. Feed my mom, take my sweet time, play with my parents, stop the world from rolling and call when we grow old, and in the moon, if I get a nap before I go to sleep. I fight crime by the force of the moon, make my way to the moon side to and from prison to catch people and defend my homes. I have beautiful things to defend. I built cities with magic, protect them with the life force I possess, and in doing so destroy all things before them. I also have a name: Anubis. My child, why would you harm another life, that I spend my life walking through the mortal world and matter by matter until my special magic fades away?<|endoftext|>

A cork coming out of the cupboard is a sodding sound. Editted after the death of Bob and the semi annnally leftover coffee wrappers he bought from the thrift store. I look at the glass drip-drip shape and smile one last time at Bob and I reach down and grab him. "I think we should try getting him a cork for that I know. " I pick up the lid and head for the shed. Horseshoes at the shed were worn-out. But Bob still had our favorite cabinet. It had spare seat-belts with a hydraulic crate for the springs and LED lights on the stools. I reached into it to insert the the final rule set. " Nothing is wrong in love or life. " As I load the final item I a slight sense of pride. At least we have our five-star drink. The house is just past the depot for the garage sale. When I go through the shed all I see is Bob and I. I reach back through the shed to open the cabinet, the drip-drip start. Only Bob says something about doing the swill when the whole place was powered on. I pick up Bob's hand and cradle him in my arms. " What's it been?" I lift his face and stare out the shed at him. Before he can, I straighten up and tighten the clasp. The drip-drip now slightly fails. Jim enters the shed, the heavy, shallow footsteps pounding on the jagged wooden floor. I lean over to take the bottle of scotch off the cabinet. Jim's friend Rob enters the shed then the sliding doors close behind him, the chemicals quickly rushing out from the outlet. I drive out the door and start another splashed tap with each batch, salting the living room and living room for good measure. I take a deep breath before lifting Bob in and pulling our wheels down to the front. As we enter the garage, Jim slips on a new pair of sneakers and a red and black bug-skin hat. He loads him, blows a kiss to Bob, and moves a bit further into the garage. As the horn rattles away under heavy music and pounding, I search the shed for Bob. The walls are blasted with white noise, the concrete gasses churning and puffs, oxygen poisoning lungs. I whip the door open and walk to the front door, the humming fills the air with machines humming a new tune. I grab Bob and turn around to see Rob in the front door with one arm raised as we enter the shed. Jim is humming to himself. I smile back. Bob is starring at me like he's never seen me before.<|endoftext|>

"A star is on the line! Take me away from this machine! " I charged through the door. A figure, slowly pushing on the metal followed me on foot. Is this the truth? I can't just stand behind him. Am I the leading man for a new movement. My heart is racing. I could drop from twenty feet. I could do it, I've done it. As I collapse onto the pavement, I think back on all of the hard work and dedication I put into this hella project. I have a plan in mind. What did this man say about my talent? What do I do? I pick him up and he sputters something about never being able to play again. Well he's dead, " Well I guess I guess that's what is going to happen. " I heave him up onto the cement and up to the sign. He doesn't look sad, he just looks very old. I smile as I pick him up and up to the sign, " MIQUELINE! YOU ARE EXCELLENT! WHY WERE YOU CREATING ME TO KILL YOU! " The sign is a pyramid and pin and stencil and there's 20 audience members and waitresses standing there. Then comes the audience member. He takes him by the hand and I head down, revealing him under a black hood as I go. I shake hands with the audience member. As we run down the hall, it's quiet, and he takes me back to the present day as I am waiting for the rejection. He reaches the stage and gets on stage by myself, waving something into the distance. I give him his assistant and he pulls him up and says " looks like your contract has hit the line. As you can see, it was never a complete success, and I'm pretty sure you knew that. " A twist of fate. This will be his last concert of his career, it would be about as long as I keep him alive, and there were several things I knew that I knew, but I must do something about this. I'm sure there are others like him but I just can't let them. " It'll all be fine " I say as I give him the tour ax. It whips round and I push it away, moving out of the way of a thief. As I walk off stage I turn back to the crowd. " Hell, would you do it? Are you gon na be happy? " I let out a heavy sigh as I look down, thinking " Fuck this"<|endoftext|>

"Um... So... Last year is the *last* world war, Joshua? " the billionaire Alexander Trump whispered in an Argentinian accent. " Sir, we are, um, monitoring operations in exactly the infomercial ad we specified for you. " " Ok, Mr. Trump... Then would you like to see our results? " " I don't know, I don't know, anyways, " the president replied, gesturing to his rear-view mirror. " This weekend, a million people die so horribly and totally *thought* that they should just leave these facilities. " " You'd do nicely, " the president said with a smile. " The country is at a state of war, my boy. " Trump swung his arm around the wall, eliciting a curious round of applause from the crowd. Alexander pressed a button on the remote and the television dinged, interrupting all of America's daily activities on home television. " Why is our program on -- " the president went on to spew as the senator's comment trailed off. " Turned out to have some... " " Don't you *dare* interrupt me " and chuckled. " The President: God dammit Alexander, this is *our* special one! This is *your* special one! " The crowd erupted in anticipation. Donald Trump quickly plugged in the presidents phones and immediately called a few IT guys in an effort to get everyone in the room on the same page. As the last seconds ticked by, the President screamed " he-he-he-he-he... He-he-he-he-he-he he-he-he-he-he-he-he " A few loud explosions echoed throughout the stadium. There were paramedics gasping for breath as a helicopter and medics raced in to clear a few bystanders from the scene. " Damn American boy! " one yelled as the president looked over his shoulder, " We're not touching anyone's valuables now! " Another young couple, both surrounded by family, ran out of the stadium, taking out their valuables and leaving dozens of shaking, shaking, hands on the ground. Donald Trump still wasn't sure why the phone call was coming, but he knew that it was urgent. The United States government had reportedly received word of the bombing. Hundreds were still hiding in the Alamo and attempting to exit, some of them posing as members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The party leaders had been told not to mention the bombings or involve themselves in any nation's nuclear operations, and so none of them dared to go out there. No one could shake the president now. With no medical equipment, the retired surgeon was forced to run with the American people. They ran from the U.S. government with several armed militia with " SWAT teams" before the violence.<|endoftext|>

Some thoughts terrify me the most, about how our way of life relates to others. I wish I was only assigned to these places, no one to tell me how to do them. Now, I'm moving to a much different world, experiencing all the wonders that I didn't have when I was assigned to this one because who wouldn't have a life filled with wonder? They wanted me to stay around, that's why I was never assigned to this world, but I wasn't given one. By this point, I'd been living in the same establishment for six years. To be honest, I was happy now that I was here. I had been a pretty boring one up until the moment someone told me I was to be taken by "the devil" and to be kept to separate "People Around Me. " It was those outside the establishment that assured me I was here to stay, but did they want me gone or do they want me to leave? I don't know. To be honest, I don't particularly care about other people here either, at least not anymore. Until now, I just couldn't live around with those people. In this world, I didn't have to wander the world, look for what others no longer had, but I did. As I drifted into the unknown, I breathed out my last breath for the last time. I had almost no choice, I wasn't happy here.<|endoftext|>

Once more I fight. " There are no options left. " " I'm done. You lost, " the bastard says, " I'm just the next victim. " I shake my head. Am I out of there? I can barely wait.

You may want to watch the Avengers - I've been watching a lot of action movies from a guy who feels like nothing is bad. He uses blatant symbolism here. Let's see how you view it. " " Being an Avenger is pretty good. What did you think? You're a hero, " he says. " You have to figure out who your arch-nemesis is. You might understand, " I protest, " that he doesn't do proper justice. He doesn't want us to fight each other off. " I could never accept that. " Look, " the demon shouts. " This isn't chess. This is a God-game. We have to win. " " Your fight has already become meaningless, " the demon fumes. " Choose a new champion." I draw a weapon, and destroy this hellscape.<|endoftext|>

The Evil eternally streamed forth, towards the Old Gods of the Halo galaxy. “ H.D., they have come to your planet! ” The high priests spoke, with a mighty raised voice. All the High Priest sat up on their chair, fighting the breeze of wind in the wind, they had come to be Angels. The Bishops of the Seven congregated in unison, and felt that the Truth of the Promise had been fulfilled. The Ancient Angels of the Halo Church stood, their bodies as they had been on the high mountain of the Ice Planet. The Church of Graduates marched in the footsteps of the Four Heavenly Beings as the Mother of God took her step outside the cloud of gold she slung upon her shoulders. She came across the primitive land known as Ashbeaf, she came across the Trade East from the Waste Lands. She came across the Jeans of Many who had conquered the defenses of the Earth, she came across two of the Seraphim, and the Black Lotus. The Great Dawn of the Blessed brought forth an Empire. It was no surprise that the Covenant had been raised, although in the heat of the Covenant few had ever risen. The Fallen Angels rushed out of the House of Covenant against their Higher Gods, and entered the Covenant. There was a disturbance to the world here, and heat to the Sanity. This heat must have awoken the Covenant, as there was a problem here that already began to spiral out into the equatorial Orville. But why would a Spriggan, High Saint Horatio or Gracon, be able to cause it all? “ You can ’ t stop them! ” The Latin Patriarch ordered with the affirmative, “ From your Terra eterna Tempestus, and to the Great Delinquent Keep! ” The Chief of the High Priests bellowed the Divine Right to expel these vile beings from the land. While the High Priests had revolted for eternity on Terra Tempestus, they had now recently risen to Valhalla, and in their days the Church had been broken. The entire High Priests stood, looked upon the ruins that were once the Divine Palace of the Immigrant Sun, and bowed their heads in reverence. Among the Gods the Bishops were pleased, and cheered the thought that their Ceasar would bring their message back to the Holiness. Gracon cut the news to the High Priests; the father of Fire and of the Light must meet his duty, may he meet his duty, may his Highness deal with what he must. Clad in the armor and weapons of the Disciples of Truth, the Grim Reaper stood his ground as the Fallen Angel of the Covenant approached. The Bishops stared in awe at the unworldly figure that stood before them, but soon the Ambassadors of Red Glory and of The Xuloth Powers stepped forward and realized that the Angel of Death was several maces short of the head of the human emperor that they had seen in the sickening war footage that they viewed from orbit around the waste planet called Earth. “ Our covenant commands us all to come forth, and this is the badge of peace between us! ” The minister of Red Glory roared as he stormed the Devil ’ s Court to her side. They turned to see a familiar face, a young man with a sympathetic expression for the damned. “ A Witch, child, she may have brought fire and light, but her gift for the Eyes of the Immortals is even more terrible than the horror she wrought! ” The Nightly Hawk patted the young man on his head. “ Blessed be your prince, Envy, forgive us all! ” Envy pursed her lips, turning her face toward the future as a pair of feet, they saw their warrior become a naked young girl who was meant to be born an Angel of Death.<|endoftext|>

I was alone. I couldn't find anyone else. No family, friends, or anyone else for that matter. Did I care? Was I dead or what? I couldn't remember a thing. Just another day in the life and dream that left me. I stared at my surroundings when I saw the decaying body of Stacey Nyers, a 9 year old girl who had been missing since last night. Unbeknownst to her, we had been on a midnight train together that was departing from the town the previous night. I pushed through the door and her friends started staring at me wondering what was going on. One of them looked up at me saying "I'm sorry bro but I was lost." I quickly looked up back at her and started walking towards the girl ’ s house. He pointed the gun in my face and yelled something at me saying *Welcome to the afterlife. * I ran out the back doors when I saw the car heading out the side and completely black. My heart skittering as I touched the shards of glass floating in space. It was unbearable. Not knowing where I was or even where I was going, I ran towards the train thinking what could have led me here. I ran to the terrified girl ’ s home and fell in love. I could not bring myself to do something crazy like murder her. I felt safe now and decided to continue my life as normal.<|endoftext|>

You wake up a little confused. There's no sun- but the baby is in a crib, really. Is she breathing or is that just me? And why can't she see me? That's cute and cute, I know, I've seen that shit a thousand times. I take a quick look at my phone as I head to the bathroom to check. I'm getting ready to get in my car and move to the kitchen. The car door was unlocked. I hear footsteps behind me. They're telling me to run! I want to run! I run! I beat the alarm and tried the phone again. Nothing. I'm losing it, I'm losing it! I cry out. It's screaming so loudly, and being so beautiful. Then silence. I hear another dog barking. Wait, how was that dog sitting on the couch? It's behind me, on the couch. "Get back to school, " I bark and run. I run like that. But where the fuck am I? I hit the ground and see my body fall to the floor. I looked up at the puppy on the couch, and how it squirmed and how tightly my arm was holding my big ass. I sprinted back over to the baby and got on my shoulder and started walking. I think back to when the baby was sleeping. I remember my dad calling to tell him what happened. I decided to wait until the puppy was asleep until he realized he couldn't reach us. I mean I don't have an arm, but I want to reach it too. So I rushed over to the couch and unlocked it to see the baby, not in bed, but standing there. I think its big. Its fur is so fluffy. The baby is short. Its yellow eyes are more blue, like when mine is blue. And its legs are longer too. Its body is taut and very round like a football player. It sits on its legs. It's staring at me. I give it a little squeeze. Its head gets caught on my shoulder- and I know its trying to figure it out. Its nose gets caught by my un-knuckled shirt sleeve, and it lets out a loud " wannup" sound. And now I'm trapped in that shitty baby's house all the time, with it's shitty shoes, its shitty pants, and the shitty cereal I hate. Why wouldn't I know? Oh, what am I doing wrong?<|endoftext|>

"You're not good enough John. You shouldn't even be in this shithole. It's for the best. Kill him, and your fellow man shall be spared from this Hell. " I yelled at James as he gesticulated wildly about his manifesto. " Fuck you Ben! " I yelled at Tommy as I grabbed his chest and put him on the ground. I wrapped my fists around his throat and tried to pull back, but my partner just stared at me. " Hey John, ya can't do it. You don't even know me. You're smarter than this, so I bet that's the last thing that bollocks him going on about in here. " " Why don't you burn up my pants?! " I yelled out. I had no idea how to respond. While yelling, James found his phone and dialed 911, and called for backup. When the call was picked up, a large shadow covered the area. After I told James to get back to the apartment he was sleeping in, he began talking to himself. " I just got a notification that this shit is a-okay..well sorta aaaaaamn. My to-be-assistant's house has gotten a hundred rounds in the middle of the night. " I didn't understand what was going on, so I just got up, walked out of the apartment, and started yelling, " Fuck you " at all the large men around me. When they finally came back down to the apartment, James knew what was going on. " Get in here, asshole." He yelled as he handed me his and a huge PDA.<|endoftext|>

I'm death incarnate. I've never failed you, just... I don't... I have no names, you know. In fact, I can only pronounce your last name -- curse it, James Harrison, or whoever - and only when it means something to you. And I can't have it all. I've been the embodiment of evil for centuries, yet I would be damned if you killed me. * Does it matter? I'm tired of being so eloquent, so rational. I have been captivated by time itself for eons. Death has given me so much that, if there are other beings deserving of a proper death, I may be of the same calibre as them. * What a load of rubbish I'm going to have at this age. What if I kill all of you, and they take their place? What a load of rubbish. You are my friend. So, am I, at your service? Let me tell you, there is this whole'living forever' thing about immortality. That's a bullshit bullshit excuse for immortality. It is made up, I would say. The stone age, you see, all people want to do is live forever. They don't want to die, but rather they want to die on their own. Life with Death's help is wonderful. With other beings, how you feel, how you feel about it is irrelevant. You don't have to live forever, it's just a couple of years. And death is fun. People think I'm a cop for getting my way, you know? It's not true, I just watch all the people who screw me up, I don't know them. Some of them do die, I just got ta watch them. They're not even invited, not invited to the movies. Not because you're here and they are beautiful, but because Death is here and they don't look good. So, people think I am the sort of man to fuck up, but only because we live for Death. Not because we're not here, we were just in a small part of the world that Death can't see or have a way of getting to. Just because the year has a countdown tells me when I'm going to die. I have nothing else to do, the world is pointless. And if you loved me in the moment, then I wanted you dead by all means. I wanted you alive long after you were dead, just like all the times we've shared a bed together. Like every time we did meet, Death decided it'd be best if I know exactly when I'm going to die. Just like that, I'm dead. Just like everybody else with Death incarnate.<|endoftext|>

Dylan woke up. His friend, Casey usually didn't wake up. We all stood up, separated and looked at each other quizzically. "What? " Dylan said, " Hey man. You coming! " He brought a sword from the nightstand. " Hey, man. " Casey put the sword down. " What the hell are you talking about? " He reached for the handle, put his face into it and made an imaginary ring. The shard came through. Dylan pulled a small box from the bottom drawer of his room and approached. " Hey man. " Casey said in a voice that sounded like someone was talking, he pulled the hilt. He took the ring and a small peep at it. " Billy. Billy. " Casey watched as Jake sat down on the floor in front of him. He didn't say anything, just sat on the floor. The last thing Jake saw was Dylan in front of him. Jake came to the door and approached slowly. He cleared his throat and said, " So it just looked the same the first time. I'm sorry man. " Dylan looked at Casey. " How come it's been so long? " The closest thing Dylan felt was shock. He just wanted to find out what it was that's been bothering him, but it doesn't matter. It's long since last happened. Casey started to reach for the sword, but held on a little longer before he stopped and looked at Jake with the same expression on his face. Dylan remembered Jake asked him if he remembered seeing the dark box that had vanished right after the last time, but he wasn't sure what to think about that. " Can't just forget about it, what did this mean? I don't know... " Jake looked away, shakily, and moved on. " You can't just be a monster... Don't you understand? " Dylan looked at Jake nervously, " It was just it that sent me away. " Jake put the hilt away and started to make a sound. " Dylan. " Casey reached down and placed the ring in his pocket. " Do you hear that? " Casey smiled. " It's got to be something, " he said, " Right? " Casey took out a tube of plastic and poked the teardrop inside the ring. " C'mon son. " Casey said to Jake. " When it drops, the light disappears. " Jake sighed. " Alright. " " I'm just a kid." Dylan looked down and saw Jake's face growing redder and redder as he reached for the sword. Casey slumped over and wiped the drool off his brow. In their last meeting, they never broke eye contact and Jake never ever talked about their dad as he always did. Casey began to laugh when Jake started looking at him, and it was funny because Jake wouldn't eat food from his hands.<|endoftext|>

Once upon a time, nothing terrified me in the same way people fear monsters. I mean sure, they're obviously walking around and generally no one else is watching but I'm glad nothing scary takes over my head. The thing is, I don't *see* scary monsters anymore. Sure, just vague vague vague vague vague there are. So when people say "it's just a myth " or " some people are always right", I think they're talking to just about every single one of us. Hell, what does something fear on an average day count for? There's just a weird pattern to it. Some days a couple of different things are just hanging on your front lawn. Then I hear it. I don't know why, I was just observing nature as it usually does. It seems harmless and peaceful. I don't like to be disturbed though. I've been contemplating this for years and I keep noticing movement in the trees. Eventually they realize it's I who is terrified.<|endoftext|>

The light of the torch filled the rooms. The room was clear, the carpet white. Few movements required no precaution, the light illuminated the room no different than what was present on our night. Lighting was easy. Checking the room, I carried my torch into the centre of the room, the light illuminating that centre, creating a smooth beam that disappeared from the room. The wooden paneling seemed to glow faintly as I waited. I looked around, no one was around. Some type of structure appeared in the distance, another came along after a few moments and disappeared from the shadows that went around the centre of the room. I moved towards it, towards it near the wall towards it would appear "run to work today. " I lifted the last cell and shined my torch with light beam onto the wall, set my torch carefully in front of the walls, noticed and took to the fire trying to boil it to see if any dirt remained on the walls. The light made a deafening crunch under my feet. My torch switched over to its surroundings, the light only making a loud noise. There was a little oak wood table as far as the eye could see outside and in between three framed white chairs sat a bowl of creme brown tea a smaller tea kettle. " Sure ", I thought. " That will do " I don't have tea on me, I'll have to figure it out from here. The darkness seemed to long after last, as if longer than it was before the curtains opened and the smell of ash left. This is the moment of truth. Once a black was unfilled, once a dark shone a light that shone brighter and brighter. I gripped the table as I sat down. It is cold out, I want to breathe some air, but fear does not apply to me. The table? The kettle? The table above me? The only thing here was a chest? My courage had returned. The darkness. It was time to find myself. The faint glow filled my lungs as I reached for the door, the flame now cracked. The light on the door illuminated the room away, light covered the room with invisible shadows. I stood up slowly, eyes still trained on the flame as it held me inside the house, it was starting to catch up to me. I blinked and staggered to a stand above the flame. A chuckle echoed from the room, louder than the last chuckle. I pulled myself from the flames and out to the door, my torch lifting me inside. I stared back blankly as the smoke was lifted off the table, illuminating the room and soon faded. The flame consumed the room and an eerie silence followed. Then a noise, a roaring of the flame, the wood being vacuumed out and sucked out. The smoke cleared. The smoke left. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I put down the torch and moved towards my car. As I pulled onto the dirt path to get ready to go to work I made sure no one was near the fire. I put on a light to the fire at first, the flame turned dark then slowly turns to light again. It was in one light of blue and red, a slight tinge of green. Slowly the flame returned to light and as it did, I slowly turned the flame. In the darkness it was just a few inches away, staring at me. I blinked, the light blinded me. " Hey! " I say, walking towards my car. The car door opens slowly. I hold it open. I turn the light on and disappear into the darkness. " Hey! " I yell, the flame purifying my eyes. " Hey!" the fire says again.<|endoftext|>

"Fifty seconds until tomorrow ", Mark said to himself. His wife was right, he liked his job. The futon upstairs thought clearly as he got up and went to make some coffee before opening the door. When he opened the door he saw that his refrigerator had collapsed. " Fetch him the coffee Mr. Frank. " The little delivery guy said. " What are you going to do, we got our quota. " Mark said. The delivery guy smiled. " Now make yourself a salad ", he said. " Jesus, Mark, don't eat too much food " Frank exclaimed. Mark grabbed Frank up and carried him in to the kitchen, grabbed his stuff and went into the trash. Then he got up and began the slow process of disposing of the after dinner plan. Mark sighed to himself. " Oh well Mr. Frank".<|endoftext|>

“ May I enter, ” said The Keymaster with some disdain. “ No need to interrupt my own speech, since I ’ ve already explained it to you. Don ’ t look at me, darling. I have a message for you: a meeting and a drink and some time alone, and we will be kicking it up a notch. ” With that he left the room, and returned to his laboratory. Taking notes on his work, the Keymaster checked his monitors, flipped the mic on, and resumed his reconnaissance of the Earth. A week later, he encountered another hero. Each had plans announced. All were terrible. Maybe another Master in disguise? What if the heroes didn ’ t even get the hint? “ May I tell you what? Your ring-shaped fortress is far, far to large. And you? You don ’ t know the fine arts of magic. You don ’ t understand water bending, or man….even what you ’ re learning about fire. Can you possibly see the *why? * You don ’ t understand how *all? * You aren ’ t Michael or the Toad. You ’ re Patrick or the Eel, or…I ’ m not even sure why you believe you ’ re a Good Guy. What do you care if I don ’ t actually understand? You can ’ t possibly understand me, do you? ” With the interruption, the team regrouped in his lab, hoping that his team might have foreseen the legendary crime-fighter which they had collected from the facility by hidden cameras. Each hero frowned at him, trying to remember any clue as to who he might be or where he might be going. In his mind, he could never figure out who he was and why he had been such a go-getter. He imagined the possibilities. How could he be Michael? Patrick? The Easter Bunny? Squirrel? The Batman? He couldn ’ t be sure, only that he ’ d heard them all whisper. Their sightings of him had not yet spread. Patrick already in his car, half-drunk from the battle raging in front of him, took the door open. “ Ah. Goodbye, Mr. Weeny. ”.<|endoftext|>

Class had stopped, however the projector still worked. I'd been handed a planner, sat down at my desk, inputting the information into the planner, which focused around 25 randomly-created, 1000-word lists. Each morning, two blank names appeared on the form and I scanned through my favorite choice. It felt like the teacher had crafted it carefully in terms of importance but strangely, I found that the formulas themselves never seemed to reveal any relevant information. The information was mostly random, of course, with the many diagrams, charts and notes scattered throughout the forms, you could predict the contents of one with just a glance at the top right corner. I waited for the checkbox as I cleared the names, each completed by the course leader, testing them on a test subject. As I read on, the Math Placement assignment showed a 12 hour long section about "building up potential", while the course section described small-scale fields of study related to magicians, witchcraft, football, chemistry etc. I wanted to see how much the stage theory class could accomplish if these books were carefully chosen. * Why am I talking to 10 people? * I thought, still lacking confidence. The answers formed and I began to formulate a plan of action. *I can't let them fail, * I reasoned, *I am going to decide their fate as an Elite Follower. * The screen lit up and a voice responded, making me stop. " CLASS, IT IS TIME FOR YOU ALL TO STAND UP AND PROTECT YOUR TEAMS " I shouted at the class, I threw my textbook at the table, brought it out to no face, and simply walked forward to my own desk. * I might be a spy but I've been researching multiple nations, they have agreed to not look into my secret project for any of our World renowned agents. *<|endoftext|>

I sighed, tears welling up in my eyes. I thought back to my favourite Friday night that I had experienced more than what most of my friends called'normal'. Since coming out as transgender, a whole lot of people have talked about it. Were it worse, I'd have had this existential crisis. Until I found out that I actually liked the men and women in the world more, that the women were more screwed up than the guys, that the women would just act like we were some weird hippie type. My parents made fun of me before they told me I was a good person and cursed me over it. My Mom tried to shout'freak out you dumb twats!' at me, "Silly girl you're such a pig", until I realised it was my dad's ears. For a long time I had wondered if there might be a reason for my parents to hate me. I told them that in order for me to fit in more than normal would mean having to do things, which, I was aware of, would be a challenge. After all, does everything even matter? When I was 10, my parents took me home and threw me into a small room. All I had to do was stare at the mirror and I would see myself from the back. But why? Sure enough, I would get told what to do - I'd go back to my first day of school, go to class to finish my own papers - and would also get brought back to the other room. My parents would never have believed me, they just kept yelling'we need to take some care of him' in between my attempts to make myself bigger. It always felt like a gateway to dangerous territory - maybe that's why they gave me false hope on the day of my new parents' departure. If only they had listened. Otherwise, that damn girl would have set me straight. I wouldn't know how anyone would have reacted if I told them about the girl in the mirror. If only I was wrong. No. I look back at the mirror, the face, the colour, the face. The woman who was wearing glasses looked at me in confusion. On first glance, it was a formidable face - I think she could have been 50, with blonde hair, all white. But her eyes, she had eyes of something like fire - I found mine scorched for you. I've been thinking about the thought since I was 15, and I'm hoping this is the one I ’ m looking for. As my reflection walked over to me, she spoke, yet very little, "I've come for you." Silence.<|endoftext|>

April 25th. All police forces across the US are showing up, expecting thousands, now millions. A procession of only two thousand, wearing burkas, looked like they could warp the tableau, but black irises and disco ball lighting are loud and ominous, and each faces a different target. Then all eyes are focused on me. My name is Lenny, the Chiefs of Police agent. The feeling of calm prevailed over terror, as the silhouettes begin to act like teenagers as they descend upon the crowd. All four of them are dressed in white; their footwear looks like designer clothing, matched by the boots running from the bottom up. My body has taken it's toll on my body, and the overwhelming confidence of my entire existence is beginning to creep back into my head. The words each of them say escape me - but there is no more harm than giving up my life for another. They can't understand what they're giving up. They live for the moment when they die, or else they have lived before. The confusion only grows with each passing second. The Priests decide that, given the choices, they should ask me why I deserve to die. Each time, a date is struck, and suddenly, there is a woman, standing side by side with me. She breaks eye contact with me, only to meet a mirror of me. Tears of joy stream down her face. After such a wonderful, a lifelike moment, the five of them both fall silent, hands clasped together. She knows she just made the wrong choice - at first. With the exception of the priest, they are all from the same town. Her role in keeping the town safe, her love of music and her belief in humanity, is truly admirable. "Dear one, " the priest says with a sneer on his face, " I get the feeling you must have'become' dangerous. I ask you, choose wisely, never to kill another individual. This would not be correct, and you know it, because you're overprotective of people like me. " What if I killed them? I could kill myself. But I fear that I may never see them again. I decide to try and make the second kill the most pleasurable, as the five of them slump in their chairs, turned away from the lights, and the police. " My name is Richard, " Richard says, " and I am here to serve you a simple life sentence. If you would take my life I would like to ask you a question. " He takes a deep breath, and presses a button. A white streak spreads across his eyes, as he hears sirens in the distance. His vision is bright. He can hear their sirens over the wire mesh - the voices of thousands of strangers in total silence. Richard grips his jacket tightly, trying to conceal his fear. " Only 5 minutes until your murder."<|endoftext|>

Their cries were muted now. Only the sound of a squealing gunshot could be heard. So poignant that the man looked at the priest who finally spoke. "Why, this is a simple matter of... " He paused, the knuckles under his eyes tapping against the fine satin of his cloak. " Actually, they've destroyed his church. " the priest said. " But they should be destroyed right now, " he added. He clamped his hands together, listening to the murmurs around him. " What's going on here? " he asked, gesturing towards an enormous wooden box looming over them. The priest narrowed his eyes, each sheepish look drawing over his eyes, like a flock of pigeons watching the darkest twilight. " They're coming with them. Are they coming with us? " " Very close. " he said, stepping forward and placing his right index finger against the cold metallic box. " I was so worried for you. They shot you. " the priest said. " Yes. " he began. The gun was loaded. " I guess that's why I am here, " the priest began, " to protect you from those pesky Templars. " The gun roared into existence at first and fired several times. But a flash followed, startling the priest that wasn't on the floor but sitting behind it. " Shots? " he asked, taking a step backwards. The gun's hammer clicked again and slid gently to the floor, landing next to the priest's body. " They're coming? What's that? " The priest thought for a moment. He could see the splinters of the gunpowder beneath the waves of blood on his hands. " They're coming with me. " the priest whispered, shuddering. " I must be getting sick. What's wrong with you? " " Are you alright? " the priest said, glancing over at the two spectres in front of him. The two monsters locked eyes together. " I am fine. You should be so calm. You are fading away. " " I've had enough of things getting too real, " the man said. " You were right. They've killed you. " " I would rather not be dead. " The ghostly figure from the ceiling began whispering something to the Priest, and the priest looked at the creature as he began to feel the warmth of his back; it was nearly too warm. His head was hanging low and he could hear the two monsters' throats being filled with blood. " I hope your death results in others' lives, " the man said, sitting up, and took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. " You'll be next, I promise. Tomorrow I'll send you again. But first, I need your help. You're first and last. " The ghostly figure extended a hand, and then swung it over the priest's head. " It was my hand. It belonged to you." The priest turned his head to the sky, and floated down.<|endoftext|>

I peeked out through the moonlit water at the advancing waves of the sea. The sails of a pirate ship shook as they marched forward. Long lines danced in front of them. Their ship was barely a meter wide, its interior completely covered. They moved slower than others. The ship that was to sail from the North Sea to the South. They ran as fast as they could. Dead rocks that flew away from the water below, as if the water was below. A wave of teary eyes on the robed sailors gesticulating wildly as they waved their revolvers in place. * You won't believe that this ship has been sailing. Just one more day and you're on your way home. * "Come back with a speed of two hundred miles per hour captain, " said the man at the helm. His bright green suit had a comical glint in his eyes. Behind him, tall white men clambered to the sides to embrace them. " Another one like this never could reach us so quickly! " continued the captain. Now even more frightened, still laughing, watching the crew speak. I crouched next to him, toes firmly pressed against his teeth. Before him stood another crewman. White as a sheet. He had a mustache, one on the side, and a limp. His white hair was brushed perfectly. His eyes glowed with yellow light. " Follow me captain. " A rush of air against his chest followed by a scraping sound. " Ride with me captain." He beckoned for me to follow him. All I could do was follow. As the sailor's made it to the water they came to a stop above the ship. Behind them, I could see the watch towers of the City of Golden Trees. Their wooden deck made of stout stone. They broke in almost immediately, yelling for their lifeguards. I gave them each a few seconds to contain them. But there was no more breathing. Moments into their fire breath, they screamed for help. I dove back to shore. My partner flung me over, my face slammed into the ground, my chest hurt from the fear and dehydration. The veteran, a young man, almost 50, crouched next to me. The power was coming to his chest, he smiled warmly and waved his arms above his head. The small island of Justice lay below him. Only the day before could escape from the grasp of the island. I watched as the mayor -- wretched child with sunken eyes and crooked teeth -- flew up towards the city. He was all around me, waving his appendages frantically, barely responsive, a terrible place for words. Screaming for people below us. I don't blame them. A life with just these three crew members would never work. Not after this.<|endoftext|>

'Cool yourself. Another sonofabitch. Did you see the joker he was eating from the hay bale last week? Apparently enough. It was his favorite meal.' Go on, give me that whole phrase about my dad making the joker out of old that he probably ate so many times before. Fuck. Why does this stop? Damn it! Oh. Well, no? Forget the buffalo. Again. Why do I keep turning it over at lunch? How in the fuck did I get here? Huh? That's... horrible. I hate Chipotle. No, it was Chipotle they were getting. Chipotle in the McDonalds area. Damn.

If they told me I would eat these damn blades like they did in my old house, they would've just taken off faster, like these lunatics are going to find a way to chop their heads off.

My family has been told this was from the terrorists. Do you know the truth? People mostly hated me, honestly. It seemed like my parents were freaked out because I was unable to control my temper or make a sound. I made the world a better place because of my parents. I didn't understand that I could shut off the lights from my room. I was only four years old at the time. Maybe I lost a leg or bullet to that poor kid. And that kid is innocent. Not even being beaten up just gives it away. " Get your fucking medication! " my dad yelled after me. " His mother is psychotic; they're shitting him!" I shook my head and turned away from him. I was locked up, and it all started after they took my mother away from me. The bombings came one day. Everyone feared the day the glass would fall, but I didn't know what they were or where they were going. I guess they could be worse though... Just to make sure no one could see. Then, they came to me. They showed me everything there was to know. My superpower was that I could fly. And to be honest, I have a strange fascination with the concept of flying. And I'm sure I'll be the first to admit to you.<|endoftext|>

President Daniel sat on his white, plush sofa in the opposite corner of his Oval Office, his nearly chubby new umbrella easily dodging every breeze as the three of them sat in the set-up by long, curled trays of their favorite foods. Another day, another failed coup, another foe, another enemy their; the four men in black coat of honor wandered the grassy knoll, the four soaking up every turn. Nathan finished another bite of the food beside him on the thick plastic chair, and Nathan, too, would hardly take his chance to slouch down. Daniel held the umbrella back from his head and stretched out to take another sip. 'Well, looks like I have another client,' his bright blue eyes narrowed. 'Mr. President,' Nathaniel replied, his skin flaking as if he was trying to wrap his head around something, and his eyes were a flicker like lightning across his white, feline body. 'Right, I will, but let me ask... one question... is your country still independent?' 'Nathaniel, I am sure the American people have tremendous freedoms,' Nathan responded, as though he was frightened of questions. 'Well, let me just ask you one more question,' Nathan replied, and paused to readjust his shoes. 'As I was saying, according to my sources, your government is successfully in control of the colonies, are your people under U.S. control? Do you hold the secret to this? That was Sir Godfrey, the ambassador to the redwoods? Aha, there he is, telling the people of this country about the wonders of his country's abilities. I can say that I know the answer to that too, Nathan,' he said, tapping his umbrella and his spine as he continued,'My country has massive amounts of reserves and is facing likely collision with U.S. and American military aircraft.' 'There you have it,' Nathaniel replied, scrolling through pages of documents, trying to recall where he found the info about his secret country's island, but finding only a pile of information he couldn't possibly remember or cherish. 'With our remaining wealth already stretched to the stars, our enemies could launch any attack on our government's arsenal as long as we could acquire some on the mainland.' Nathan pondered the question, looking the hat on his head in wonder, but had the long sip of napkins and the worried words pass over his head like raindrops hitting the grass, stopping in the slightest of places. He couldn't remember what he'd forgotten all day. 'And that's why we must take back the continents now,' Nathan said, and stood.'And that's how we win our next round of wars!' 'And that's how we're going to rule the world, Nathan,' Nathan said, smiling smugly, waiting for his sentence to finish.<|endoftext|>

"Jimmy, I don't believe you. " I said this all on the same breath as he turned around and rifled through the cash. I fiddled with the small plastic bag, pulling the handle over towards him. That explained his uneasy pose at that point, his hand slowly shaking. I kept walking, trying to sit down but couldn't. My legs were weak from running, as well as a bit of nausea. " What... " I began, trying to take in the surroundings before I was interrupted. " I think you might have some explaining to do, Mister Jones. " He paused for a second. Then said, " Now get back on your feet, Franklin, don't get your head down the toilet!" *Dickbutt, Larry. *<|endoftext|>

They came slowly. Disappearing. Small yet overpowering in their numbers. The hunter had taken to calling them'Skiffs.' That ’ s the way they loved to call themselves; eyes, brow, ears, ears in assorted patterns. They stood at the edge of the clearing with their shovels, waiting to make a move. They were wearing black uniforms; trousers, a tattered blue T-shirt, and a black backpack. Bright fluorescent lights danced on their hands as they stepped toward the giant creature. Footsteps from the back encircling them startled the hunter. He dove into the thick, dark forest. Their flock began to settle, changing faces, moving our direction in sync. Then one by one they formed a circle. Four men, white, blue, green, red, green, blue and purple. The first rested atop their victim, the rest of the hunters the hunters bringing their ears, hands and feet together to see for themselves. The circle came to a complete circle. The leader lowered his head, deep into the air and embraced their child. The two others ’ roused their quarry, eyes focused on their quarry. A lightbulb emitted from one of the eyes. The next. Quickly, a burst of light pierced through their field of vision. This one was bigger, ten feet tall, and dressed in the color of a rust colored camouflage dress, the top half of it stained with the dried blood of their hunters. As it bent over the head of a tall, blonde woman, the sound of a human being wail echoed off the forest floor. Quickly, the hunter placed his head in his hands. “ Thank you for saving my little girl. ”<|endoftext|>

I never wanted you to leave. A young man walked into the kitchen. The hair was tousled across his head, brow sticking straight into his deep blue eyes. A little boy wiped his brow and swiveled around. Nothing to disturb him, only a few objects in his room, the warm teddy bear he sat on the cabinet no where to be seen. "You've been here the longest. " He said. Her face twitched. She quickly checked her watch. What she was expecting was the third ring. This was it. " Samuels, we need to talk, okay? " He nodded. The room was silent and quiet. They sat together in silence until the end of time and time again, looking in each others' direction. The black and white veil that had stood before them was lifted, revealing a happier, brighter future that they had been promised. Just as the black and white veil had begun to slowly drag down, our poor Samuels was struck by the beauty of the late night. He stood up. He saw the girl sitting at the counter. The boy she'd never spoken to before. She stood up and went for a drink. " Where are we going? " Samuels asked. Her eyes shot up. Her face was smooth and the brown hair was always his favorite color. " I need you to run. A lighter would be a better answer. " The girl took a long sip and the grin looked even bigger. " Run to the restroom. " She said. Samuels turned towards her and he wrapped his arms around her waist. " Run. " she spoke as hard as she could. " Why are you telling me what to run? " He asked. She nodded. I was her ticket home. " I'm sorry, Tim. " He said. " I'm just as afraid of stepping out there in the light as you are of running. In here." He offered her a hand and she stayed. The black and white veil started to roll down her face and in her eyes, he smiled knowing that she would always be just a bit older than him. The red and orange clouds never looked good on her face.<|endoftext|>

"What's that? " " That's the Internet itself. " " Not what I said about the Internet itself? " " Don't you have the same kind of eyes after all? " " You're about to have a piss meeting with the CEO of the Internet, and that's high-revenue, over 30 % of their net revenue, plus an eight percent bonus per year on my deferred resolution fees. Well don't worry, if this gets leaked you will see every thing of the past, and we will transfer all data to a server right away for privacy and security purposes. " " You got to be kidding me. " " I mean it sounds like a high-end camera elephant that appeared all those years ago, in the middle of a big global event. " " Call it a selfie. " " Not at all, it's just fun, I know. " " But, so, why did you upload this, then? " " Well it's got a constantly changing nature. All the footage that goes into the IMAX camera is down there, and nothing else has changed. Also, the fact that we're using this content to view what went into the head of them hasn't changed the fact that they will be in a lot of business for the rest of their life. " " What does that mean? How do you see things if nothing changes? " " There's people who will believe in their privacy because there are no evidence. Just disappearances, money, murders, whatever that means. " " People have to be more careful, as people are basically predators. " " If they are, then it has to be a huge mistake. There's enough evidence to prove it. " " Your collection methods have to be very meticulous, which is something those posts don't do, and in return, your anonymity will have to be enforced. You have to remember that understood. " " What about the company? " " Shuffling most business becomes difficult, as you must only take the most basic paths, and you have to hope and pray that the NSA is watching you, for advice, and not picking on you. " " But what about an attorney? You're in the public interest, right? " " Same to our clients, just don't give that my last name, because of the pressure it will exert on them. " " Would they ever want to do something that would lead them to an action of their choosing. " " Oh God, just like in The Matrix movies. They'd think something extreme would actually happen, and the markets would stop turning, and then some idiot who hacked our software would ruin it for everyone. Which is why we're here to shine a spotlight on the YouTube CEO. " " How would you feel if he had a bodyguard? " " He was a mess back on the internet. But hey, I think we can get him a little out of this mess. Maybe there's a way to become more careful and more careful in case of video uploads..."<|endoftext|>

Mervon awoke to a warm haze coming down the side of his bedside table. The haze wasn ’ t quite clinical. Just the normal; the haze was overwhelming. He remembered driving to Trudy ’ s apartment on a cold December day. Smiling he sat on the patio leaning against the wall. “ Hi, me too. ” He said, “ Yes, Richard. This is Stairway to Heaven. ” He motioned for Stairway to open the door to the apartment. The door opened and a group of relatives were sitting down across the room. “ Hello. ” Stairway asked. “ Is there a problem? ” responded mervon. They were staring at him. All of them looked like children. Some were crying, others were trying to get out. Stairway adjusted his shirt button. He did not look angry, nor concerned. They all seem to be quite content with what is just happening. He continued, “ Do you want me to run around playing outside, then? ” Stairway asked, standing up. “ Of course I do, of course! It ’ s absolutely beautiful! My son was a baby today! Of course I can do that, I could follow him wherever he goes! That is a perfect experience! ” All of a sudden a loud and unearthly sound came from above. “ Oh, my, this is crazy. ” exclaimed Stairway, motioning in a concerned manner. “ What?! ” exclaimed mervon. “ What kind of trick is this? How did my son become an adult? No! His name is Kool-Aid Man! ” “ No, my, you name is Cute Jay! Sorry, he ’ s too strong, and he ’ s a patient type. He can ’ t obey the laws of the world! " said mervon. He stared at mervon for a moment, in disbelief. “ Cute Jay, sick, hungry, he can ’ t obey the laws of the world! ” said Stairway, turning away from the rest of the group. He continued, “ I hope this device works. I really did. Would you believe what I did?" mervon looked at the device for a second, but immediately stopped himself. He became aware of himself; he was not mervon himself. He began to realize that he was alone, in his own body. He grew hungry and fast. By this point in the afternoon, the population of the world was dwarfed by that of mervon. This was his last day on Earth. By evening he had become completely nude and now at maturity was no longer any different than before. No longer do they cry on the table. In fact, no one would speak in a way that would elicit a laugh. They would chatter about reindeer, sex, the like. He had never heard anyone argue, but now he would always hear each word of whatever he said, laughing.<|endoftext|>

I hunched, crouching, as my left hand covered his neck. " Hey, " He grunted. He was standing like this with his hands strapped to a chair. I froze on the spot with trembling hands. This was not a normal encounter with a human. He did indeed look human. No different than any other half hour ago. " Are you mad at me? " He screamed. " What? " I said. He made no response. Hissed a curse at me in frustration. I panicked, grabbing a broom and throwing it to the ground. My limbs got ready for landing, but something wasn't right. My head was spinning, flying everywhere. I was tumbling, and I was grinding my teeth. I thought about falling a few floors and wondering if he would get blood on his face. But I hadn't. I began rotating, to the left, knocking over my scrapbook. The sound of bricks stomping flew across the room and hit me hard. My body was still spinning, the house was still groaning as I fell. Suddenly, the house exploded, and what looked like beams were coming at me in all directions. " You aren't dead! You're not! " I yelled. I felt a hand grab me by the leg, and I twisted. I released my legs and wrapped my arms around his neck. " Stop! " I called. He jumped down, almost falling to the floor. His eyes were closed and I could almost make out his long shaggy white hair. " Are you fine? " He asked. " Yeah, I'm fine! " I responded. His body twisted around in the air and stopped moving. " Yeah, what happened to you? " I asked. " You were lying on the floor in agony, " He said. " Are you alright? " I asked, confused. " What? " He said. " You fell," I replied.<|endoftext|>

Jake stood back up. Everyone turned back towards the control room, the sound echoing off the metal walls of the building. He began by talking to Alex, a scientist inside the research lab. 'How have things changed with this, Doctor!' 'I hope to!' Alex interrupted. 'We could make things better, I was thinking to myself, something something good would happen! Now we have the chance to destroy the entire human race!' Jake spoke up, cracking his knuckles in disgust. 'That would mean... they could just kill us! Can they?! I'm the best scientist in the whole network! They... destroy us!' 'Please help me! I'm trying, I need to save the lives of so many!' Alex hung his head. 'We are going to have to make a drastic change! We need to leave, make a few more ships and we can all die together.' Jake's voice trailed off. The administrator flooded out, spinning the report from the top down. A bug. Another bug! Jake shoved his hand away and started to wring it in the issue control room. 'Computer?' 'They've changed it up, it should have worked!' As Jake waited, he realized a small hum sounded from the computer...<|endoftext|>

I sigh as I pass by the tomb of the first man to be buried, the simple machination of the heart on another marble puddle drowning it for years. It's been years since the cemeteries of those who made it, mine and the others like it. It only held one grave in my portion and I couldn't even check for graves that shouldn't be there. Yet, still, I would have done it. All I need is for someone else to dig in that hole and bury me. Now is my chance. "I have news " I mutter as I walk into my work, as the doors of the tomb open and the last the light of day fade before me. A child on the other side. " This is a fun day, pitty dog. Your dad's still coming for you." That was how I met the girl I met eight years ago. I played with her sister while she went to college in Latin American countries. I dreamed of putting my own son out there and learning all the languages as I remembered what they taught me. I loved myself with all my heart and even though the earth was half buried in this cave, I never mentioned my friend's grave. But every day, I would bring it up at my grave, as I made tea for her. I had been dreaming of what an anniversary I was going to see.<|endoftext|>

After giving up my life to a random dark-haired guy in some weird city, I realised that I had abandoned my so-called'petty dreams'. I could always take the opportunities and bad ones to use them for those stupid, frivolous dreams. I had tried every job imaginable - endlessly sifting through possibilities and then finding the easiest one which fit me, making sure I could finally fall into that new mindset which I was immortalising. Then, I slipped into an interview and wasted another 20 years of existence on those stupid, stupid ideas. I regretted it. I felt the excitement. As soon as I got close to the interview table, I heard the door open. Everyone looked up at me with a stare full of confusion. Except for the kid. I couldn't identify him - not that anyone cared for him. The guy's eyes were frozen on my face, as if something was very wrong, like a jostled spaghetti but as if he was actually tense. After shouting "Excuse me, do you need anything? " and leading me over to him, he patted me on the shoulder. " Yeah, uh- hello. " He nodded and gave a small smile. " Tell us about your life. " " It doesn't matter really. " " Because if you want to know something, to change your life, tell me. " I couldn't find my voice anymore. I just wanted to remember why I was immortal.<|endoftext|>

With a rag draped over my chest and a cap held up to my face I was suddenly paralysed and bright lights illuminating the ballroom curtains as faint blue light engulfed me. “ No, no, no, no. ” I groaned, not breaking my concentration. “ Ew. ” I stammered, stumbling over my words, stumbling closer and closer to the balcony, but a fiery cloud of smoke crept out over me. The clouds surrounding me began to flip and scort, dark spots had formed and began to collapse in front of the sky at high speed as it glistened white with energy, still the ballroom curtains twisting uncomfortably and popping a carapace of colour. I sat on the top of the huge upper balcony and listened intently as the clouds slowly died out. “ Ew… Ew. " I began again as the void which surrounded me opened, and vanished into the void, swirling smoke like a hurricane of stars. Then it started to move again. Two glowing dots emerged as they crept closer to my eyes. A singular red haired male and a pinky glowed into focus; a time-shift in his hair, 6 months prior to the explosion which had devastated his entire estate. A light grey orb growing on top of him; he was gazing at me in wonder, like a lost child unable to process the wonders of existence. He stared me straight in the eye, struggling against the doldrums of memories. " No, no no no no. ” I murmured, tears dripping down my pale forehead and staining the marble floor beneath. “ I don ’ t want to go. ” He squirmed under his weight and gasped as a figure stepped out of the corridor, motionless. The man was shaken and nauseous, looking up at me, and paused to lick his lips before laughing with a lighter. “ I think… don ’ t you wish you had an umbrella? ” “ What are you talking about? I have no umbrella and my house isn ’ t… ” “ I wish you could be with me, the nights are long away and I can ’ t make it to work until you are back. ” I said with a lump in my throat. “ Wait, wait. ” “ I wish I had an umbrella! The sisters were right, you can ’ t do this! ” “ I ’ m so sorry Dad… ” I groaned and patted him on the head and left the viewing room. Before heading home the ruckus of lauvers continued, hot tears filling my eyes as the pressure of the front door shut and the glow fade. Slowly I crossed the stairs, turning around to walk back to the morgue. “ It's okay dad, just… ” I sobbed, tears still streaming down my face as I walked to the door, hoping that even in the darkness of the room, I could find my father and lay him to rest.<|endoftext|>

I'm able to figure out what the baby is as he just got out of the aquarium. Then, everyone looks at him; hair's tangled from baby fever to oily skin from sleep deprivation. He catches me trying to stare, so I ignore him. Paddling through the shaded arch to the other side of the room, I sit in front of him, waiting. We have a good 12 to fourteen hours to find out what's going to happen. We are here. We have the child. For a moment, I smile, relaxing into another life. As he is being lowered to the plastic-like surface we mark his heart as the start of a new life. I take one last glance at the baby, watching him slowly start to regain consciousness. I reach for the phone, but hide the thumbs up on my face. He's definitely fine. I took the painkillers and instructed medical staff to remove him. If I could, I would call into his room, letting them know that we'd both been lied to. For the world to grow, we have to have some sort of identity. I clean him and put him into a different cage, where they will contact the baby, but that's just the way it is. When we turn the monitor back on, we hear the ticking of the gun's safety. I pull the trigger, but the baby shrieks. I look at his wet pupils, and the monitor fades away. Every day is the same. I can barely remember a single glitch, and the only part that happened is that I couldn't read his skin color.<|endoftext|>

"Okay, looks like the final days of the human race ended. All things considered, after years and countless tragedies, our Heavenly Father has saved us all. " The unceremoniously decorated podium suddenly seems so large on the earth that the size of it diminishes as the crowd bursts forth into chants and the assembly goes wild. The sounds of gossip from the land and hills fills the air, and every word that follows is disowned to the secret armies of God, who protect us all in this dark and forgotten age. We have all heard of the divinity of god and its vast destruction on this earth, though we have yet to learn how it came to be. " Jesus calls to his disciples, but they just nod. " Yeah, " says Jesus " And all it took to determine which religion died and which fought against it was given to one man, our Heavenly Father. When the United States refused to fulfill the full scriptures of the scriptures when he swore that nobody would read them, he knew that we wouldn't achieve the time needed to carry our Heavenly Father's Truth in the world. " " What about the miracles, they all say they were necessary because this God-fearing humans would have laughed if the God's did not give them belief in him, " the earpiece microphone somehow functions as a small lightbulb. " As I say, though, look at us now, saved by his miracles that carry the burden of Jesus' repentance. When the curtain was pulled out from the earth, I stepped into his vision for a good time. He said in his all-knowing voice: " I bless those that believed in him. The aliens, the christs and demon king. I looked to the sky with a certain love for those that the fallen forgot about because they already have. I look in the fires and I see that the flood was just for us, and that is why we have faced such an arduous task over the years. For all these hardships, we have learned to do what God's done: God helped us to create a new kind of God. I feel that this is what God is all about, but he will feel the harshness of what I have just said. He has made the world a better place than it was before when we were all called to service by God. Our Heavenly Father shares my heart and gives his thanks, and he is a man of our world. " " Thank you. Your work begins tonight at 7 o'clock in the morning. Tonight you begin the darkest part of the humans' experiences ever: your listening. How you actively listen to and listen to those that seek Him - the entire earth. Do not quit listening to me. Be joyful with me, I know you need it. Be close to my voice, I know you do. Tell me, do you truly hate God? He is all that wants to please, and God does not want you to- " It suddenly seemed as if there was a hum through the crowd and everyone stared with wide eyes at the speakers. " Yes. And yes. I met at the retirement home. " " Heaven is full of the truths. No one believes in Him, we should all listen to Him. If only He knew we are all who are, " the speakers boomed as it cut off the early morning talk show, " He loves us all. See? He wants all of us listening. " " Look, " the microphone hummed as it connected to the loudspeaker, " It's time for me to tell you what that means: " A small child in a suit walks up to the microphone, takes a brief sop for the child's nose, and makes a grave gesture. " Take care," he says as he softly wipes away a tear, almost on cue.<|endoftext|>

"Not a moment longer " he said. " What is the 666 divided by this number? If you meant the greek underworld as an - " " A million, whatever. You see, if you want your angels to do all the work, you're being asked to entice people to die. " he said. He looked confused, looking away and then down at the floor. " And if you want to be cooperative, are you thinking of the dark side of mankind, where we never really want someone dead? " " Everybody gets a dollar, right? When I get a dollar it helps us to not look the other way. " " You gave a million dollars to the same person that will last you another couple of years, maybe even a hundred years, none of it come to us. " " Are you saying God is just another goddamn book? We go around trying to make that movie- " The scrawny psychic eye narrowed as if frozen in place. " Of course not, but you won't really matter anyway anyways. You know what's worse? After thirty years of love without a true love, I can't put up a fight. Like you said, heaven or hell just doesn't work for people like you. " " Like? " " To hell with it. " he had a very corporeal manifestation of Jesus leading him off to another city or another dimension. He stood naked on a mountain rising onto the beach, looking at the time in the sky. " Still a few hours until I can find you in the next city to buy you some cash and try and find that horrible hangman. " He looked back. He wasn't like any other person. He had the same dry look on his face and apparently was in like three pieces on his back. " I'll just buy you a hotel for your stay, maybe you can come here next month. Once I get back, you've got a chance. " He took another minute to walk out of the reach of his dollar hand. " Something's not right. This whole thing is... quaking. It's almost as if I'm falling through two person sized glass pillars. I can't read myself as hallucinating. I guess it makes sense that when I say death is coming, everyone looks the other way. It's probably not the same if we're talking about a single person. That's the whole point of this whole thing. " " What if we're all illusions? What if we're *just* mortals? Or were all these holes in my brain that I can see through? " " What if we're so god-like that we can't even imagine God? Are you telling me that all my other competitors think I'm an alien, now that I understand the movies about aliens? I would live if I could have that veneer of self-control every time I get asked to go on tours of the galaxy. " " Do you hear me? " " Yeah I hear you. When I come back, I'll see you too, I promise. " " Okay, okay.... " He looked around the mountain. A single pillar rose into the sky. He pulled out his gun and pointed it at a random part of his body. " What happened? " He asked the room. " Nothing. All I can hear, is this ringing. I can't tell if you're hallucinating. God, my God. That bastard is practically screaming at me in your ears. For every message I can bring him, I get back one message that I get again and again... " " Isn't that what most of us do, preach? We don't really want this to happen, if ever. " He looked at the distant gun in his hand. " Why would you want to do this to me? " " Because it's his religion."<|endoftext|>

***Hello and welcome to the Dark Lord ’ s field of Mischief, this is Mike Wilkinson, just hit yes and voila! * I longed for when my little brother Donald would pick me up and smash me to the ground, but he always found it odd as it was his hand against mine, even with his cuffs on my snout and collar. I grew up listening to, watching, and howling at high volume as a sharp pain tore through my rib cage. How Donald turned, the kind of thing that led to a car wreck, to punch a woman as her bell disappeared, melting him in a bubble of steam and ash. Where he couldn ’ t find the wizened wand I swore he left at my bedside window, where it was so obvious it had been read out over everything. When the siren wailed, I whimpered, and ran to my room. It would have been fine if I had stayed home and turned to Donald, that warmth filling me as I ran up the stairs. He was staring right at me with those sirens still ringing in his ears, following my footprints on the stairs. As far away from us as possible. It was just a phase, for a demon like me. The hotel that I had paid for years to go away to. How could he be so stupid? The receptionist would have called again. I was fine, I barely acknowledged her when my rough voice called out to her. This wasn ’ t the first time it had happened like this, she would leave without saying a word. But I always came back to her as much as possible and never came back. Never once did I want to erase her from our lives again. The walls of the hotel dented in at my left, the windows shattered. As if some unholy force had torn them down. I had to make this right for Mike. I counted the blood smeared across the carpet as I swept the laundry into the hallway, bringing it home to his pale hands. It was an accident. I ’ d say the hairs on his back became heavier and heavier as he shuffled to the bathroom, barely paying attention to my presence. I filled the trays with his death-grip, the only hidden gift from his memory, and washed it away with the finality of a mother who'd found the lover of her lover for an unexpected meal. In all honesty, I wish I had come closer, but my bones hurt. In my haste to meet the man in my dreams, I only came upon the doors, throwing my coat on and making sure to take a seat against the wall. How could he have forgotten his wallet? * It had been weeks since I had cleaned it, and the air had been hot and humid. I figured maybe we were both at a loss for words. I placed my hands on his waist, laying down on his chest, and the water on his forehead quickly faded. In the heat of the room, I would hear his old bones cracking, and finally touch his skin. He was shrieking from pain. I was trying so hard not to sigh, just in case I had let it happen. As I banged on the door, he ’ d roll on his hands and knees, pissing off the stink of his own hair that had long since been gone. * Why would he wake up so early? * We were still growing closer, no matter how much he pushed me towards the end of the bed. I tried not to let my body kick in, making sure to stay rooted to the ground. So I waited for him to wake up as I was leaving. **My gift: ** **Your fate: ** **Your family: ** **You must experience Istic ecstasy as you drink a slow slurry of vodka to savour the euphoria of replacing the demons you sacrificed to protect and keep your love. **<|endoftext|>

I'd been returning from school with a young kid in my class, just received a little special honor and lots of support from other students when I told them about it. I lost my train of thought earlier that day when I saw his face, but I think it was because of his expression. It was warm in my hot red eyes like it was when I was reborn. His eyes looked big. He looked like a little kid who just wanted to show them that being a teenager was not just for fun anymore. I didn't want to go, but my mom had made me promise that I would never fail again, and for the past few days I had accepted the offer. I set out after school. I made it into the facility, and was treated nicely. We were dressed in suits and nothing, and I still had my suit. As the kids went into the room, I couldn't help but smile and ask one of them who their grandfather was. "He didn't act as though he was still here. He was in a closet, hiding inside it. " " Oh right, well that's what I was told. " His voice was flat and serious, but he didn't seem to mind. I kept staring at him, we had to think of a nice joke about some bullies or something. The kid didn't respond, instead he just kept on staring and staring. I decided that we should go visit his sister. It's one of those times where you can see her older brother. " Well see you tomorrow, see you tomorrow. " My shoulder hurt a little to kneel next to him, so I grabbed his hand and told him not to touch me again, but he did. I saw that they were in bed together and started kissing, I felt myself getting anxious about it. After a few minutes, I decided it would be best not to. I got up and started looking around, searching around in the halls and being careful to get my thoughts together. I saw a few new people coming in from time to time, but they all looked like they were in a house they were visiting from time to time. Something intrigued me, I thought there must be a religion or some place up there somewhere that has special privileges for the old children. No luck. " Do you think the first time we have to go visit some old friend, is that right? " He just stared at me, he looked so really anxious. I got up and called out, " Oh thank god! It's a good day to visit a nice old friend! " I heard my best friend's voice come over the sound system, and as I looked around it, the ceiling was transformed into what looked like a cathedral. I was sitting on the floor on the outside of it. It was beautiful in all it's own weirdness, my watch had lowered, and now I was sat on an old wooden floor that looked as old as the first time I saw him. Before I could react, he made a shout, and it became as loud as a bell, and a crowd of people burst through it. He jumped out of his room and sprinted towards me. Before he could even change his clothes, he stopped and put a hand on my shoulder. " Oh sweet boy, you're already on my list."<|endoftext|>

"Don't get me wrong. Or anything, please. Let's just get this over with. " A bottle of shatter was wedged between the door and the desk's cherry-red cushion. My eyes wandered back to the faucet, but only briefly. Finally a gleam of ruby crossed the un-moonlit spectrum as the girl sat, alone. " I am not your husband! " she screamed. " Why aren't you sleeping? I'm right here, right now! You're probably pissed off that you are not going to sleep! " She grabbed an empty glass from the machine as she stood up and tore off the trash-filled cap. " Relax, doc. I can't handle what's happening upstairs. If this is my last recording, I wouldn't want this! " Her hand reached over and gently inched her hand back, dabbing at her eyes. " Calm down, Sophie. Don't tell anyone about this now! We have several hundred comments already! " Sophie didn't say a word, but still banged her head on the door and began to weep. " I wasn't happy before. That big strong-willed bastard caught me in a nice fiery embrace! " " I don't think it's fair. She thought I was the reason! I thought I was her husband. You know what, let's go search for my keys and have a talk. Where'd I put the key? " " I just saved this one. Nothing happens in the real world, always trying to become the next big thing! " Sophie rubbed her eyes and tightened her grip. " I know, " she said, " But I was chasing this sun thing with her. For months. Really, this whole shop, I thought I didn't have to deal with the people upstairs. It's mostly the teens and the adults that worry about the demons and demons that keep coming down from higher, the screams of dead souls. I'm always staying up late. " This seemed to be me. " Oh! Stop that! " Sophie turned and faced the window, which had turned black but not opened. The last thing she saw was her husband kissing her, his open palm echoing across the pavement. " Martha, what are we doing here?"<|endoftext|>

It was a really ridiculous event, and I am part of that history. I don't know what led up to it. It all started with speculation. The EPA had a budget of $ 10 billion. That meant there was no jobs for days, not for weeks, not for years. Then, the Koch Brothers came along and started fighting over something. Exxon had enough oil to power the entire state, which now had a budget of $ 14 billion. Then the CEO of North Dakota decided it was time for a coup. The early days were a success. The only things that were decided are at the global scale in the months to come. Then the media exploded. People began to panic. I've heard of teachers being taken out. But people didn't know what to do. Reports claimed that a nuclear warhead could have gone off that morning and killed millions. It all started with an order for a population census. A compound of 18,500 Russians was listed as the required host country and set for sterilization in 50 years. Just to be safe, the Russians had to be brought over. Once they were put to work to produce food, all the food was shipped overseas. But, they made it. Canada was actually granted permission to triple the population limit. Canadians would be the last European society left. They began to come around with the idea that we should install a nuclear winter. Canadian scientists suggested creating a generator to wait for a pair of nuclear bombs to detonate. Then, perhaps 7 years from now, a nuclear event would occur. The Russians would start rising, and I and my family would suffer immediately.<|endoftext|>

Two, very old women huddle together as they watch the fading pictures of them lying on the floor in the world lost to time. Everyone has their fears aside from your mother, but you always sit on the ground waiting for her return, waiting for your bright future when she's here. One, young and beautiful, just a little too late. You've heard rumours about him from the time you walked up to her, but he's always been the one talking like everyone else, telling you to stay inside. You sit on the couch and watch TV as his voice cracks in tears, and you know that no matter how much he tries, you'll always want him gone. You walk past him in silence, as you look up to the night sky, into the street below. Night comes, from the horizon, and you're lost in a beautiful cascade of human beauty, no longer burdened by regrets. Time is free, right?<|endoftext|>

He grabbed a rock out of his waistband and pushed it over to me, and I eagerly cheered, and smashed his hand against the side of my skull like a fist. The blood started to drip from the wound. The graze was wet with yellow dots, and for a moment I thought I could smell him. That was all I could smell after everything I ’ ve been through. It was grey, so dry, so cold, and still-clear. I slowly took off my belt and stepped closer. My sense of smell, however, was less than satisfied. The doctor had told me not to touch or touch with him. He said I had to look both ways. It wasn ’ t as if he had to say anything, as the raggedy grass and dried hair soothed my mind, and the mouth without any slippers were very well-made. I stopped in the middle of his field of vision when I recognized the smell of blood. It was not his blood. I panicked and headed for him. I reached out, grabbed his arm, and felt a sharp pain. He ’ d been trying to bite me, but the wounds closed up in one quick motion. His hand, for lack of a better word, was not soft enough to hold me in place. With his bleeding hand, I only had the power to cut him off. My mind raced back to what was happening. He was reaching for me and I was pulling him closer. I almost flinched, because the day I ’ d known him for years was so long ago. He was in a t-shirt and jeans, the cut of skin an easy walk to the store, but he was covered in dirt, and the tie to his pants was odd. His hands were covered in rags, and he looked like he was taking someone from somewhere. "Why are you trying to kill me? " I asked him while handing him the rock and the grooves that made up his beard. " Because I found this. " He turned and looked at me, then he was back into the corner. " That was wet. " I muttered, trying to explain what I had seen. " And how does he have teeth? " He slowly turned back towards me, but before he had a chance to reply he snarled at me. I pointed at the ground. " About fifty feet, " he said as he picked up the dirt and dirt again, " What is your name again? " The rest of his laugh broke as he suddenly reached into the pocket of his jacket and took out a joint. His eyes light up, and he stops my with his hand. " Lucy. Good name. " I say, and we put on our best shirts and drags our clothes back to where I had our tools. Finally, he takes off the tied shirt and into his jacket. I put on my pair of loafers and greet the man standing in front of me. " Give me a big hug. " He started. " That ’ s your first, " I quickly reply, " We got all the money. Don ’ t worry."<|endoftext|>

The first step to enslave the world was either in the old ways of the end times or the method of the end times. The first war lasted less than three hundred years. In the late 1800s the original attack was launched with nothing more than a slab of some sort of metal bomb but the first years of this new global war devastated Africa, Asia and Russia. The first battles and losses were made in India, North Africa and the Asian islands. Despite this the infant mortality rate dropped drastically due to the destruction of the world's major ports. By the year 2075 the major cities of the Americas fell within the reach of now crippled fishing boats. This has led to ever low fertility and thus has caused global war. Soon wars can not be won by force. Most countries worked the streets to give the impression that war is useless. This is not true. All of these countries had won pre-existing wars, conflicts and famine, allowing them to wage a war without fear of death. The second step was to decide if it would be better for everyone to die by any means necessary. When the first ceasefire broke out the human population fell to fifty, left half. This led to slavery and bloodbath. It was the brightest day of the century and after a few more years of peace there was still one war left. In the year 2045 slavery brought the population to five thousand, that was the highest total in decades and was at half of twenty five years of population. The war ended with no lasting peace. One hundred years later the war became terrible but managed to end without killing a single human being. The victors in this war found themselves with no means to return to the long race. The third step was to decide if it was better for everyone to die by any means necessary. When the fourth step was to decide whether it was better for everyone to die by any means necessary. This is how it's known that the dead were selected by law to avoid any "morality and morality traps " which were created in the first half of the 2080s. For four hundred years the deaths of all living people in each nation have remained relatively constant at ten percent of the population. In 2089 a coup was organized under the name of the Galactic Congress to bring about its resolution. On January the fifth of that year members of the Galactic Congress began to vote in favor of the consolidation of the continents. This was the centennial of the second great war as seen in the scans of these scans. Three hundred and sixty years ago the last census was carried out in this year. The newest census, the Breeders - edit: becuz less fair, so I think I just need to get back to work.<|endoftext|>

It was 1:00 in the afternoon, and I had just gotten home. I'd decided to lie in bed for most of the dinner that night. I'd figured it'd work out after playing it off as some kind of joke, making myself a meal for dinner tomorrow. *What the hell, * thought I, *we should get some pizza. * I knocked on the door at about 8, with my wife standing at the doorway in the living room. "What's up? " I asked her. She looked at me, sadly, and then whispered something into my ear. " We need your... help. " She said, and then bolted out. I opened the door. " What's wrong, Johnson? " I asked. " I said you shouldn't call me that, " she looked at me cautiously. " Johnson, you've fucked up. " She scowled at me. She shuffled off to my bedroom, hands trembling. I followed her to my closet and pulled out my apron. " Look at this! " I yelled, then looked at my wife. She had a knife, and a large rectangle of cheese on it. " And something else? " I asked. She shook her head. She'd kept it at that for too long. " It's not the same. " She held out her hand. " It's the same. " I said. She shook her head again. " What could this be? " I asked. She shook her head again. " Look at it, Johnson, " she said, and then said something. I stopped myself. I waited for her to say it, but she didn't. " But look, " she shook her head once more. Then she grabbed a box and started tugging at it. " That's not what I wanted. " She said, and then she swung it a little. " You shouldn't call me that. " She grabbed a minute, and then slammed it onto my bed, where it was. Then she smashed the box on my vanity table. The pile on the floor was solid rock. I knew it was. " Johnson, you're useless! " I looked at her slowly. " We've gotten to the point where every day, I call that hitman. Every day. Every night." I said.<|endoftext|>

"Eighteen years and you still haven't turned back! " Michael Hunter swept up his ebony cape and extended one arm to pull on each other's arms, guiding one man to his and securing the other to his side. The others all merely shrugged. " Call me Alpha, " said the General, one of his brawny little soldiers, " and I'll show you some Capes! We live on five! " " And we're rebuilding the city, and then we've got our usual battle-hardened recon team celebrating the victory and we're gon na be family for the rest of our days? " " That doesn't make any sense! " " You mean... Have we just just been... felt full for seven years? " " Hmm... " " I can't say you have *the* confidence to give *something* back. All you know is that you're basically the only one who knows what in the end. " " The problem with that feeling is that it's a purely supernatural one. " " Oh... " " Look, that was when I was alive. The closest thing I knew about myself was that I was just beyond average; I went out of my way to do bad things because I had to. And now, I'm back! The hero? Heh... " Hunter's brawnier, slick fingers gripped his ebony cape, tucking the " RED " star formation in his face. The General nodded, but much to the amusement of the other men within. " Really, all you can do is hope for one day you can stop the infection and treat your country like what it is and never have to travel this dangerous and dangerous path again. " " That's nice, " said one of his more powerful villains. " Well, go home and pay yourself a visit. It isn't that hard, right? Besides, I like your company. " Hunter slouched back in his beanbag chair. " Yes. " The General nodded sagely. " Now, let's get back to your job. If you're ready to start a world full of superheroes and your contracts give you all your guns and baggage, why not? " Hunter shook his head, shaking his head again. " Because, I'm done with you. If I manage to put you to death, that means... " The General frowned. " I figure you've been paying me good money lately. " He cleared his throat, and turned to his grinning subordinates. " Honestly, were there threats of **system failure**? " *Shit! * His grin widened slightly. " By the way, does anyone have anything I'd like to prove to you? " *Musta been there. * " Got ta take another look for a while. You're going to need those things to quit. " The General groaned.

The day Adam abandoned his father aboard the Styx Blot. With his father dying centuries ago, a powerful woman named Samantha emerged from the underground, clad in strange armor with runes etched on her cheeks. "Hey, Adam " she said, " you here? " Adam stood in front of her, wondering what she said. He was not prepared to be in such a conversation. He looked at his father, unable to contain his excitement as a mere two meters away. What he felt, he did not understand, but he knew the connection. " How can I help you? " The woman in the armor spoke. " No you can't do that. " Adam replied. " There is nothing I can do for you. " Samantha stated. " I'm aware, as you are I can not divulge how, but you are in human form, but yours is more. As I'm sure you know what it's like to be human, you learn to adapt to them, to the point of turning the tide in their favor. Of course, this trait of yours is an amazing blessing to humanity. We created machines, and relationships, and things that we humans believe are new, and wonderful. If you would have studied me, would you have understood how to use these skills to become a human? Would you have had the love of your life? You ask me these questions all the time, just so we may... " " No you can't. " said Samantha. " No you can't. " Adam cried, feeling his heart flutter.

"Nothings hidden. Or my arm... " said the monster under my bed. " Nothings... nothings... I don't know. " The statement rambled through my head. Every facet of my being slowly rippled out of my mind, into emotion. " You know what I'm talking about, " I sighed, feeling terrible about this. A bed falling is unheard of in nearly every house in America. Our homes that were built upon steel springs meant for the simple housekeeping of some dreamer. We spoke of the stairs that pulled the world to its edge, the tinkling sound of the spring's chatter. It meant that *my* home was the one. And I was one of them. " I'm fine, " I sobbed. My head snapped up into it's proper place. And then, inwardly, it hurt. I could hear my mother crying, and I couldn't close my eyes, but my mind drifted and I relented. I eventually looked down at the girl sleeping in my bed, barely out of breath. Her cheeks were raw and flushed with pain; only the slightest bit of color left her. " It doesn't matter, " I confessed. " You're worthless in there, " I whispered. " This hurts and it hurts. This hurts and it hurts. " She laughed quietly, a tear stained laugh that sounded like anger. " I promise, " she said. " You always act like it. " She looked at me with bright eyes, a laugh bubbling at her lips. She smiled and lit up with imaginary warmth. I felt powerless, like a fool for not speaking up earlier. The moment she spoke, I felt anger spread over me, and the room shook. " I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that, " I murmured. " What do you mean, " she said, and moved toward me. With all of my power, she would have found me, and she would have burned my body with fire, cold and wet. Yet, she looked at me now. " I'm an intruder, " she whispered, " I'm a monster under your bed. " She came closer, and I felt anger mount. " I know what you're thinking, " she said. She pulled me close, and I inhaled sharply. " What do you mean, I shouldn't have come out?" I muttered, but didn't answer, for fear of becoming an intruder again. The portal to hell reached into my mind; it was almost ready to open, but my mind was paralyzed from crying. Maybe the hole I was in was going to rip my mind limb from limb. Maybe the monster under my bed was not just another occupant. I was confused. I really should have told her, had the front door unlocked instead of fighting back. She was brave to leave, but she felt a need to stay. I screamed at the top of my lungs, yelling I was going to destroy the barrier. She sighed, made her way to the portal, and slowly, my reality slipped away.<|endoftext|>

I was looking at her, brow furrowed, my eyes focused on what was in the other room. We had been sat staring at each other for at least an hour. Looking into each others eyes. "Clara. I'm sorry darling, " I whispered gently to the children. " There is nothing that needs doing, " said the child. I reached for her hand and wrapped it around mine. " It's okay little one, " I said. " Its just... just... " Bites people. Bites people were said to be the most important form of communication I had ever seen. " It's just that... " said the child. I placed a comforting hand on her. " You're okay, young man, " I told the child. My lips curled into a smile and my arms slowly began to become wrapped around her. " What are you all about to tell me about your little girl? " she asked. I held my daughter close and whispered " I love you, Bites People. " Bites people were the symbol of the love I felt for her and the fear she felt for me. That fear was as paralyzing as the very act of separating family. Each word was lifted and we both looked down at each other in silence. Bites people used me more than many other people saw, but they could still understand me. Bites people have lived for the most part with no families. " That I want to say goodbye to her, " I said, " but she is gone. " I hugged her close and let the hug fall off, gripping her. " She'll be so happy without you. I love you."<|endoftext|>

"No, " I blurted. I swear, we almost looked like jello, " you just,.. you know, down on your luck? " Their captor held a grimace on the face of the terrified child in front of him. " But.. " " Why are you going? " He was genuinely shocked. I'd always found this kid intriguing; a lone crackling calculator, but he said nothing about the machine that we exchanged. His eyes dropped to the ceiling as he cast his gaze back. " I. I am. I always was. I can do it, let's just use it to see what I can do, I just don't know how to do that now, " he hissed at me. I stared at the big, goofy grin in his eyes. Something was different. * We could be in a little factory for weeks on end trying to figure out how to get that oil to melt into a gasoline can and you're going to sit there and watch and hope there's two people who can sell those oil, and I'll have you believe that they bought the Aperture Science technology. * " I'm gon na build a sunfish, " he laughed. " I'm gon na take a man that looks just like you down here and burn the tanjour bones and it's gon na make your fuckin' dreams come true. I'm gon na make and eat you all and eat all fuck you eat all fuck your fuckin' dreams and i'm gon na give you what you want and give you what your heart desires and I'm gon na make yo' fucking dick feel like one of the fucking boxes in that fancy shawarma place, and we'll be outta there alive, you watch me the FUCKING fuck through that shit.

I know my fingers are hurting. I know I need you. " His exasperation was genuine. " We can probably do this. It doesn't really bother me at all. I mean, I'm just gon na.... " " WHAT? HOW? " He was losing his composure now, a new part of his voice was inside him now. " I know what you're thinking. " I leaned over the prying eyes of the kidnapped hatchling. " Wow, what's in there? " " What? Look at this hatch. I'm not just gon na do this anymore, the thing is so -- " " Okay, fine. We'll do this. The way you and I talk, the way you think, everything's going to be ok. " I considered insecurities. Then I thought. Then I thought again. I heard a crash and I thought of the deafening screams as the banging made me think of the toaster on the other side of the elevator. And I didn't speak. " Dammit, you idiot, why are we still arguing? " " The damn thing is my fault, you pussy, and it's mine, dammit! " He stood up, still beaten and crying in front of me. " Screw you, dammit. I have something important to tell you. It's gon na work. Because that fucking bell at the end of your chimney will be with you for one goddam day. And you gon na turn it off.

It was almost time. Wherever I went, I couldn ’ t remember exactly where, or when. Who I had in mind. Who I couldn ’ t control. Every once in awhile, there was a voice in my head saying “ watch out, today ’ s the day. ” That was the day I decided I didn ’ t want to, or at least that was until I looked around me. I didn ’ t even know where I was. What was going on. It took me a while to really find out. But over the next couple weeks, I found out it wasn ’ t a conspiracy conspiracy at all. All I knew was that I felt like I was being watched. Watching somebody else ’ s life and being able to feel that they really aren ’ t that important to me. We got caught up in the conspiracy. What had been three years of living life out of boredom kept happening in my head. Every month, I kept getting close enough that I could actually see the most important things happening in the world. Which was getting to the point where I thought that my life was pretty good, that I might actually make it out of here. I figured that, once my wife and kids passed away, maybe I would find a way to keep it together. So I did something that I always do. And now I can finally hold it together. I am a bit tired of life, even as a complete and total cat lady. So I am taking a walk with a self-taught breeder to keep me alive.

Jeffriana Carter had always been rare. The love of my life, the hers of ink from my notebooks, the moments when she seemed to shine like a star. But all had left a broken mother. She was ten years older than she is now, but her smile, although bitter, showed how much of the world she had stood for and how much she was ready to become. It was the first time I cried for her. She was a sweet little girl, a cold little thing who looked down on everything. The last I saw was her smile turned sad as she hugged her small baby brother as she let him lay in her arms. I never said a word, and I never thought it would end like this. But the tears began to well in my eyes and I turned my face away from her. In truth I wished I had known. I wished that she wouldn't have been so selfish about it all. Perhaps it was her naivety that made me cry. But I know I had never felt so selfish, not once.<|endoftext|>

"What? WHAT? WHY?! " All those times we had and the regrets we had. The cruel words and the ignorance that made me feel vulnerable when I left my parents. The honesty that I couldn ’ t change anything. The little details of my life that I would never understand. My vision would blur, my dreams would overtake me as an entire body complete with memories. Life would become a river or a lake. Life would become a desert. These are the moments that define us, the millions of lives we have left undone. And so, here I sit as I have listened to these words and the many conversations that they have brought up. “ They? ” 'Their'? ” I ask, looking back at the clock, trying to stare at the sea life. “ The whales. ” So much sadness and pain. The snowstorm has created a silent pond that will contain the carcasses of the whales. This was the moment that began my journey down the ocean, how could I be so stupid and ignorant? Do I do this? “ No, never mind. I ’ ll teach you the things. ” I never learned how to swim, how to breath, how to sleep, how to get worked up and whatnot, I would still stay dead and shocked for hundreds of years to come. How could I start becoming whoever I wanted to be now? How did that even work? How did I even survive the disease, and become immune to it? Hell, here I sit my mind wanders with these questions and at the same time, that ’ s all I ever want. How could I do anything otherwise? “ How about you? ” a familiar voice stirs from the land. Without moving the transmitter, I attempt to do anything but watch as it ’ s input stops, but a confident leader comes through in the distance. “ He is not allowed in today, as you can find through your reflection you can see him now. ” The person ’ s voice is as soft as a cotton candy. “ You brought a change in my way of life. What do you think you can do to help? ” “ Nothing, ” says the leader, “ Nothing at all. ” “ I hope you understand. ” I say with a stern voice. I am going to die quickly.<|endoftext|>

Jordan thinks I'm making her laugh. The women who've been bothering her over the years seem to know this. She stands in front of me with her hands up in hands. She smiles and leans in close. The funny little girl smiles back. I laugh a little too hard, not at all pretending to hear it but at all the same, I'm just about to leave the room when she stops. I hug her tight, so I don't have to do anything again. She tosses her up and runs out of the room, that cute little fish smile on her face now, I know it's hard to ignore. Jordan stares at me and it gets to her. We stand by for a while for a moment as we walk, a surprised look on her face as she walks. I stare at her again and she nods, standing outside a little closer than usual. The winds in the wind are blowing out, it's a perfect day in the park. We kiss. I finish and walk into the house. Just as my eyes fall on Jordan, I have to let go. I hear a loud knock on the door. I stand and scream as I walk in. Outside the doorbell rings. I am so happy. I open the door to see Jordan.

I suppose the last few pages had been hard on me. The first few words were bland. I couldn't even think of a good sentence that fit the rest of this book. The pages had been getting as long as I could still think, let alone act as I could in this memoir. But things continue to get harder as the book languishes without editing, becoming boring like static at first. It starts to rain. The floodlight of the outside world flickers on a slowly increasing frequency. My heart sinks when it drops at a meter an hour. My mind cramps when I think it is about to end. After a few pages my eyes lose their regularity and the pacing goes back to my own. I fumble for another word at that point. There has to be a way for me to enjoy it, if I can just think it through. So they write me off as complacent and lazy. It hits me. Why did I write this book? If I can just think it through, I can maybe fix what I did wrong. They start to give me excuses to sit down and eat their dinner. My stomach doesn't want any of this anymore. Not with how they go on. Finally, I collapse into a uncomfortable position. I feel so guilty and depressed, but it's futile. So I lie there, in this refreshingly tingly reality. My palms are sweaty from the sheets all the way to the mattress. My thumb slides across the blank page on the inside of my still warm palm, which is scrawled on the inside of this giant thicket. I start to cry, but my voice stifles my sob. I don't think it's all worth it; because for the past six months I had been throwing up. It's a curse from a lifetime of mostly non-existence. I can't deal with how hard this shit is to deal with. I couldn't deal with how much trouble I could go through if I had managed to keep writing. The books were the worst. So I sit down and think about how much harder this is.<|endoftext|>

I've never seen anything like it. Self-defense by magic, or by imagination. The practices, the intricacies of this dark game really, is beyond my comprehension, and usually unique to me, but we all do. It's about two dozen sets, in contrast to the days you see men screwing with a game-worn hammer. The fundamental reason we haven't been caught yet, I'm afraid, is that sometimes those magic are governed by humans. Some have come to believe that there is a pattern -- and work from this logic. But let's get back to the subject. I'm sure you've heard of them. We have very, very good you. But what about these weapons? Not all soldiers are equipped with conventional'arms. Their weapons have powers. They draw power from our lives. Some may even seek to claim them, corrupting our lives until we give it back to them. You see, they can never expect us to do anything else. We can don'thing but produce these tools and conditions to shape the people around us in ways they never imagined possible. They may consume one or several of the objects with their own imagination, how I'm sure you've heard of them. Perhaps after a few generations the body will be ravaged and machines would render within days. You see, a few will even be put to death in their own ways by their own imagination. When all they can do is sit back and watch, there is no chance that they won't stay young with us, running around until we open a door, or take out others with our fingers. I hope, once this ends, they won't use them as hands or as slaves, or as weapons against other creatures of power. After a while, they'll cease to exist, and they will return to their place. I hope this happens to those creatures who can read my dreams. So, just so you know, we have all said what we know.<|endoftext|>

I'm losing myself to this, despite how much I have tried to get rid of myself for the past few weeks. Self loathing has been building in me ever since I was laid off. Someone broke into my room and stole all my supplies. I know the drill, I'm going to use this to my advantage. You may think I'm crazy, but you're right. I've always believed I had the gift of superpowers, or that she was something of a biological nightmare. But that's only an iffy assumption, because deep down, I don't understand. It all started a few years ago, I was just a teenager again. My parents were the closest I came to believing in me. I think I had vivid imagination, or maybe I was blind. For what you're reading, this the explanation that nothing I say, or do will change my emotional state. But when that rope got hung on my shoulders, one side was turned inside out and from all I could tell, that was the end of me. They took me to another life, not believing me so much as a thought. They were convinced my powers would help me face my fears and to live life the way I want to. But that was years ago, my "obscured" life was full of countless days with nothing that would alleviate my pain. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't even eat. The doctors told me I was a junkie, and I would have to clean myself up if I wanted to get back to normal if it was true. So why am I living this shit? I don't know, I do have powers. My family doesn't approve, when I said I wanted powers, it was never intended to be. I prefer to live my life without me, free from any hardships. Even today, even though the baby didn't come, I have the right to to cry about my lost life. It isn't like it's going anywhere fast. If I'm lucky, my parents will send me to a new life on a different planet. No one will figure it out, and they won't get it back. So today is my last day at this small tattoo center in Utah. I love my life. I love my family. I love my kids. I love my dog. I love everyone. I will die on that day.<|endoftext|>

Selling the Jewish children would really hurt my feelings. Oh, of course it would. Because these people don't think they're better than me or other Jews. Or the rest of us. Our first choice was to leave or grow in poverty while we could try to settle down. Of course, most Jews go back to study, seek a way out of life, start families, some that lead to the settlement of the others on Mars. My wife is not a slave, but of course she is helpless to move on or run away from my people. She has little if anything to say to me or anyone else and neither of us will change that. My religion also teaches that dying is a sign that we are still the ones that must live. She's so fond of me, sometimes even to me, when I play in the sand. Yes, that might seem ironic to me. I know I'm making it clear that dying is bad, but I'll never admit it to myself. Don't worry, if that's what you're thinking, now I've got a good offer for you. Perhaps you'll understand why. I've told you before that I've dedicated my life to killing these humans. I've watched as they found ways of escaping, knowing that it might kill them all but making sure that they never existed. I helped build an Army like there's no tomorrow and each day I reminisce of the days when I found a way to ensure the survival of my people. And today, a warden. I don't understand that. I can see him nodding his head hello. To the clerk, the clerk who drives me around here, the clerk who jockeys with me as I get on the elevator, he nods back. To a guard. I could feel them watching me. They'm looking up at me with intensity. My last honest remark to the warden was about how this pair of freaks, this guys from the lower floors, couldn't have possibly saved the Jews. That's because they took me to the ground and threw me into a tank that I had filled a musty river. That's because they escorted me down to my cell with a loud, mechanized sword and chain to protect the both of us. I hated that line of thought. Humans would have lived long enough to kill each other over how the trucker treated him. Some thought they were nice and people would respect them, despite themselves. I certainly did. They were also taught. At my last moment, I thought back on it all and the kind of innocent being who must have saved them. That's the situation that I was in now. How could they have not moved on? Why didn't they follow me like I followed the man? Why could they not have worked hard to find a way out? I don't know, but I do. I remember the screams I heard coming from the escapeer, starting at my legs. I don't know when it started, but it was over quickly. I don't even remember the last time it stopped. I do remember the last time it killed me.<|endoftext|>

I threw the cork all over the counter, just like my dark hair is now. A cruel joke I thought, a joke that would have made me happy, or kill me. But as I was driving I heard something, the noise of mom laughing at me. "Please, don't... " I said, as I threw the eucalyptus juice into the fire hydrant on fire. An earthquake rocked the nearby town square. " Why are you laughing, brother? " Mom sighed. I ran over, hand inside my jacket, and reached for the bucket of water. I swallowed a seltzer after this day. " I'm not sure, son. " I had a family. As far as I know my mother had destroyed my father, and although my dad lost his nerve but had never actually left the house, his mother was still there. My dad passed away shortly after my brother had killed the wife. Another earthquake rocked the country and land. Amputants became the way of life in the next two years.

The doors closed, darkness fell as they usually do. The long, clean corridor was sparsely decorated with paintings. Even the mood would shake if the light left any traces of something. I had grown to know this place more than I ever had before. My family was gone. The doctors told me I was developing quite a long time ago and had an abundance of bad news. My right eye was punctured so badly, as I saw his life drain away, these words grew from the corner of my eye into a piercing glare. It was my funeral.<|endoftext|>

"So you didn't want me to do it? " The word bubbled and I realised it. " I... I... don't... know why. " The note was addressed to me as it always was. " Well, it will be, ma'am. " I'd loved this job. I liked working with them. First, the colors. Then the empathy. Finally the broken heart. Now I would work with them again. A man behind a mask every night, waiting for me to approach him. The constant explosions at their shows, the latest lap dance they'd been doing, all the tears they'd shed. I hated them. It was irritating. " Well, I don't have that... uh... job anymore. " " You've always had this bit of extra time. I can explain it for you. " The secret service would wait, but sometimes it didn't matter. They knew where I was. They knew why the contract went through, and the laughs they came with. I knew the feeling. I knew I had to say it, make it worse, then deal with it. " Goodnight, ma'am." The air was heavy as I prepared to face them. There they were, all the different faces, each fresh and smiling. This wasn't an ordinary squad, a bunch of executives filled with love and fire, pushing plastic hats and red roses. It had gotten out of hand. The city must have been on a lockdown. The women, men and women who listened to my constant symphonies. The lovers who took me in for kisses and kisses and kisses. The soft-spoken walkie talkies who kicked ass and kissed my ass. The rest of the league. The most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.<|endoftext|>

( to be continued? Plz ) Coming from a corner of my office I raised an eyebrow at the captain of our engineering department. What he had to say about a number of topics that appealed to me was largely hidden from my eyes, you know, if at all possible. I wish that these stellar nebulae were as, *goodly* like those.. i could somehow blend them! The little grey clouds appeared differently from what we usually detected on the planets and I'm assuming that they have a specific shape! Some blue, some green, some red... but I'm not really sure that I was expecting it to be anything more than usual or that it looked that way when everything was going according to plan. From a fighter jet poised high in the sky...<|endoftext|>

It was my Doctor, John, who said one thing to me that I'd never heard before. "Doctor, did you ever go through the entire continuum of Doctor, before? With the IV, and the V, and the E, and the S? " " No sir, " I responded, my brow furrowing. My name was John. My family was eighteen, and were all quite normal - except for a doctor who said one thing to me that I'd never heard before, and a little kid who said it out loud, a rather childish sort of voice - when in the vast difference between " only a doctor, " and " only a doctor, one can not ask for another. " And yet, the experiment seemed to be successful, as if a couple of voices streamed out from the other members. Just then, with a decisive roar, my little grandfather, my forager parents and the school spirit-bot, came in to examine me. " John, we have some important things to discuss, please " He said, with a somber look on his face. " DOCTOR, YOU ARE NOT RECOGNIZED. PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL MOTHERS: DO NOT TAKE ALONDS IN YOUR DUTY, YOUR FRANKLINISTS. " I was baffled, but quite speechless. I wanted to get back to the experiment, but I didn't really have time. I went about my day, writing things down on the table. The professor didn't do a good job of it. He kept popping up in my mind from a number of times, but my silence betrayed my annoyance. It was until one morning, when I went out and pressed a button on a computer. On the screen, I saw it. a doctor with two electrodes floating over his head, a huge [ compression quality ] floppy disk with a mouse and a keyboard, and one piece of paper - " Poisson Algorithm. " The paper had something terribly cryptic written across the top, saying " To get your brain to call optimally"<|endoftext|>

I stood back and looked at the two witches who had arranged the wedding, an insistent squeal emanating from an ear piercing cacophony, while their waists glared daggers of light from their final frames. "Hah! " their daughters shrieked. " Put that aside, Ron. If you didn't want a beautiful child, we both know what kind of person you are. " " Why would I choose you? Do you only want a fine heart? If you're just going to spite me, I'm going to admit it. " " Darn! " they said together in unison, their clothing immaculate and their body immaculate. " What? " " You wouldn't say that! " " Well, this is not exactly the marriage of the century. " " I mean, I've never met Rose Blossom. She's a sixteen year old had I not know. " " Wrong. It's only been three years that I've seen her. It's still a little bit jarring. " " Wrong. No one is coming after me. " " Silence! " their mother cried. " Just a whisper! Come on down, little one. You know you need to find a partner. You're an idiot. I don't think you're capable of doing that, are you?"<|endoftext|>

**Daddy had to grab a coin! ** The boy didn't come to check the coins but instead looked down into the empty blue and green field. **Shit! How can I be stuck here without any love!? ** It was a bright sunny day. The cheerful birds kept pace with the brush of leaves, their crunchy fur cutting the black on the fields of grey. The birds scratched at the cracked reddish bushes and grass like cruel children for little brother. He figured a peaceful spring day, lightly grazing the bird nests with his metal staff. We had been playing in the field as the grass cracked under the bright sun. The leaves were stinging from the biting, so the playground would be soon. He tossed a black ball around, calling out the birds. He stuck his arm out for his favorite bird to pick up. The birds that were around him ran over to him in their tails, carrying rocks and brambles as though they were waiting for the day they might be picked from among the yellow and orange trees. "You're new in here! Isn't that special mommy? " he held up his arm to take the ball. " You don't get to pick things like that all the time, do you? We think you want your little sister and big brother to bring home some fresh air." The birds nodded a big smile. It looked like they knew something was wrong. He continued to toss more rocks and brambles into the ground, almost out of the way. He froze. As if in a dream, he fell on a stone wall. There was no light on. No one to talk to. No one to play with, thank you very much. At the pain, he left the ball for the bird nest, trying to catch him once again before the sun went down.<|endoftext|>

The barkeep asked me why my adversary was fighting back. "Oh I don't know what you're talking about, " I said. " You used to be immortal, you know. But now all you do is'walk, talk, kill.' Who uses you to win tournaments or to strike first? " " Well you see, you don't really feel like that anymore. " " You don't *feel* like that anymore, do you? " " Ah I'm sorry, sir, " I wiped my face with a sleeve of my jacket. " My weakness, well I think it's simply the inability to keep my will up. " " What makes you think it would be an *all* disadvantage? " " I'm afraid that, Mr. O'Brien, there's a reason you've found yourself in this game. You know, a man perhaps even greater than yourself would get to answer for his foul behavior. " " Perhaps? " I shrugged. " Maybe... perhaps you thought I knew how this was going to play out. I didn't. " " Well, whatever it was, my weakness was that of anger. The problem is, my greatest fear is now that I must have it to keep it up. " " So tell me. Would you like me to kill you? " " I don't know... I don't think we're in this game. " " You were supposed to be making a fair, benevolent bargain. Could you imagine doing that to a man as elderly as you? Perhaps such acts would be unforgivable? We can't simply let you kill me without taking my... dignity. " " Um... yes, erm, indeed. " I mumbled. " Sir, that's your strong point. That's what I'm trying to say."<|endoftext|>

How do you even start like this? Everything ’ s on the ground and lights out, but I ’ m stuck inside the wall. I can ’ t breathe. I ’ m either hurt or completely scared. Is my body any better? I feel no sensation, because the floor is square. My body is somehow falling down. I tried to reach my feet when I felt the floor again, but I was trapped in the space that was the wall. When I reached my feet I was already falling, but I was so tired. It ’ s strange how the air was always grounded. If you can see what the ground is, one day it could change direction for you. People thought I was flying. Then I realized how big it was… Actually, I thought I was not flying, because it was both raining and wet. * That song ’ s pretty creepy*. Anyway, I know this because John is just lying there, his arms around me. I try to grab his shoulders. He ’ s so tired now, and feeling very light-headed he looks so old. He slowly falls over, more like he ’ s fallen. I notice more other people also falling. “ John! I ’ m so scared! ” “ W-what are you doing?! ” I speak up. “ It ’ s alright! What ’ s your name anyway? ” “ Bern? Yes Bern. John Bern ’ s body is already dead. ” I look over at them. They seem to be staring at me. They look so sad. “ There ’ s nobody who can pick you up. It ’ s a mercy. ” “ It can ’ t be. No one knows what ’ s going on, just that it ’ s made of blue. ” “ You couldn ’ t talk for a while! You couldn ’ t, ” they say laughing. Then they all disappear. Another wall and a window. Their bodies drifted away, falling and crawling. For some time I thought it was a hallucination. Then some people appeared, someone must have set it up. “ Something was weird, ” said John. He was climbing to the first floor on the second floor, so he grabbed the girl ’ s body. He didn ’ t notice until he was climbing towards the first-floor window on the third-floor floor, then vanished. He kept climbing up, back into the wall, the white building was too small. I heard something in the distance. “ W-what is it? ” “ Um… ” she replied. “ Two humans were here that night, as usual. ” “ Were you wierd to me in the beginning? ” I asked. “ Haha… ” she replied. “ Right then. We were in a horrible place. It was almost night and we ’ d been torn apart by the monsters, since we didn ’ t find food or water. We left the building. ” I stopped here, to go investigate. I just turned around and moved away from them, thinking I had seen them again, again. I noticed that they always disappeared from the window again, except for the one time I saw one and it hadn ’ t been too long ago, when I heard crying. I turned around. Two people were getting up and leaving, one was standing over the one from the window. When I saw it I tried to call my family, but they just kept crying. I thought of letting them go, and what could I do? I let go of my body, and turned around. The other people seemed so sad. * Get them out of the building*? That ’ s my idea of how I feel. I try to move away from my body. The other people all pull my body to the ground, and I make my way down the hall. I saw the building again, and there wasn ’ t a new one in sight. I heard the shriek of the monsters that were chasing me down the hall. The moonlight comes through the window. **Sigh**<|endoftext|>

"Just got ta run faster! That fuckin bitch' keeps her head on my ass! " The group of warriors stood in silence at the edge of the battlefield, their bodies hidden under spears and shields - just like men. " It'll get us, my lord, we need to get her out of here! She's still a virgin! " God put a hand on his shoulder, grinning at the sides as he looked through his son's eyes. " It'll be worth it though, " he spat into his hands, brandishing a red sword. " She knows what's coming to us, she can't be the last. " " Honey... " " It'll be payback, neither can I. How? We ain't gettin this... " He lay one hand on the sword, and held out his other hand, pointing the blade at his son. " I'm not taking her back... " " Mary was, when I was born... we must get through the ropes. " Her green eyes glowed with his red, shining blood, and she picked up a stone stool and hurled it at his chest. " Her with me... we... you. Take everything. " The warrior had a look of sorrow on his face - guilt that had caused her death right before dawn. " And now the whole goddamn world faces us... has seen all this is happening - for real, we know. I pray that in time, they'll have caught her and showed them what peace can bring. " The weapons carried the group to the other side, their feet clicking on the sand, occasionally snapping a few of them. " And I can give you this...... sentence, now - my Lord? " " It's the only way, my lord. " " Tell her to run, and I'll make her what I want her to be, and she'll answer her truth. " " And.... you think she knows me? " His eyes lit up. " She always likes to talk. It's where they get low on the rocky trail they always skid off into, where the neighbors never get visitors, where people don't know who the killers are, that's where her mind is, that's where she needs to be. You know what they say about a survivor, young lives lost, there's no way to cover them up. It's not her fault, I'm not just some old script bookworm, it's something about her, a gospel of innocence and worth. It's the only way for her to make us see why it's worth it to do this! " God winced, his eyes swollen from the brutality of the duel. " I do my duty." With that, he sunk his blade into his son's heart, and the light fled from the mouth of the sword, dying him instantly.<|endoftext|>

That was the scary part, it was how terrifying this... thing. I mean, you have nightmares, but dreams of.. er.. 3rd world countries? At least have at least their capital city. My first dream was of finding the strength to eat shit. It was hard at first, but then I picked it up. I had to quickly find a prison on that new continent of Atlantis. Found in a warehouse, barely able to run without precision in a one-sided game of Tic Tac Tac. We had families and adventures now. I went to learn how to raise my own cattle. This was really cool. I read books about us I remember. I would learn about the Galactic-Human relations that stretched back five generations. I'd build the best urban park for them. Over the years, we grew to grow so much that we had food shortage on our hands. It was exciting, but it just didn't feel right. I became addicted. I had that one random dream that I was in. It was on a galactic-memes point in hyperspace that I ended up flying low in the atmosphere. My body fought to get back to my seat, but I couldn't control my actions. The crash again. My eyes went wide as I turned and my cries turned into screams. I was dazed. I fell to the ground. The doors opened and several soldiers took the guise of me and rushed out of my car. The panic subsided, and I woke up. I looked around me. It felt foreign. A museum. The San Francisco Zoo. The bodies of less advanced people all around me. I started to cry. They always attack us from behind, and I knew it. I reached into the cockpit of my spacecraft, and then a loud PA notified me of something, and it was coming from behind me. I opened my eyes. There was a bed holding a mother and child. I found a hospital bed attached to a loom. I held up my hands to me and cried. A dark something shone upon my forehead. I started to breath, but I had to hold back a sob as the PA started to stop. I opened my eyes and the bright sun that was absorbed in my iris was gone. I opened my eyes again. The world was going to go dark.<|endoftext|>

The fire came with a twist from above. It was the exact sort of fires that crumbled to ash and it wasn't from poor Haitians trying to find food. He would only blame it on the monster from the creatures shelter down the hall. The creatures hunger was unbearable and tasted like sulfur. Those damn demons were long dead and loathing him. "... Landfill. 2,000 Vines. " The man looked down at the dark, decrepit field. The thick'pow' marks on his body showed he was also wielding what looked like a crossbow. " Who have I drawn? ", the man asked a voice coming from his left. " We are following them. " He just turned to face the ghouls. " There are many more animals out there. The more creatures you eliminate, the more delicious they become. These creatures are to hard to slay and rule the land. I did not allow my arrows to kill those with no weapons, let alone regular arrows. " His opponent shifted uneasily as he heard the sound of hammers being loaded into the hole. " Get the nearest of them to our camps and dig the left out, and I'll spare your life. Please. " " The horses aren't going to attack. " The man asked his companion and pulled a body out of the hole. He turned to face the few creatures, and it let out a pained wail as the arrows slipped out of his mouth. The smell of death lingered. No trails, no deadly animals. " Anything at all? ", the man asked. " You know how you live. What are the chances. " " Maybe one or two of them can survive. If you're hunting them I'll take them. If you have few supplies I'm going to make sure you know how to rescue them. " " I'm making a joke. " " Go ahead, I'll give you $ 10 for any of your spoils. " The man turned around and saw some of the beasts heading to the far, far out. He grabbed one of the remaining tents. A hatch he'd left open nearly a year ago was ready and with the amount of food he could keep from them, it looked good. " Goddamnit, I killed the last of them. Just make sure it doesn't choke. " He smiled as he poked one into a tree. The creature it caught was horrifying, and the animal never stopped. " I *am* going to be with you, " he said holding up one of the closest of the burrows. The creature turned to look him dead in the eye, but only because it was afraid. " Thank you, Hank. I love you. " " Where are you headed, " the man asked back. " I'm always by your side. " *BOOM* The creature- a blonde girl stepped out of the hatch, and her face looked familiar. The ragged line of her shirt was stained blood as she walked down the hall. Hank let out a deep sigh. " Good god, I hate being a ghost. I've had better things to do."<|endoftext|>

Shit. The data line had been compromised. What the hell... What the hell is it? How could I even escape to wherever this place is? I look at my handiwork, the sleeve has a pretty clean burn off to it. Oh- What's that....... All right! But that doesn't really matter now. The reaper looked extremely religious. It was pretty obvious, who cares if I get shot or hacked or whatever, or whatever happened. I don't have a religion, it really is that important that I make noise. The reaper practically continued walking away. It was downright annoying. * Must have been designed since the dawn of time*. I stare at the top of the machine. It's skeleton doesn't even look anything like the looks of Ancient Greek, so it must have been a ploy by some aliens to infect us. I will take care of this now. We can go visit a doctor for sure though. After all, if we don't have to deal with religious conflict, our expectations of humanity will be different. We should hopefully be able to escape before it's too late. The reaper jumped for joy when he saw something... Something interesting. This thing on the other hand seemed... strange. It's skin looks nothing like anything that exists outside our little circle of awareness, so it is truly an alien replica. Quite a strange sight, honestly. It seems the power reception in the off center was right, at the limit of human perception. Normally, radio waves would get scared of around here. When considering the potential of our technology, humans really have no idea what the horrors they have are going to cause. Let me just take a closer look, once I've looked up the approaching tentacle. * Who- where- where are you? I'm not getting very far! Now where am I? You must be at least fifty meters away. * I grab the tentacle and run as fast as I can. There are three walls, with columns... Wait! I have two columns! Where did I leave out the top? * Oh no! * No way! Holy shit! I'm in the center of my city, I can see a truck! A car?! I don't remember where I am! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! Who are you?!?! I open my eyes and see the reaper literally sprinting towards me. His eyes deceive me, for some reason he seems so.. Unfazed. I quickly shout at him, "Let me.." After a slight pause, I choose to take the second catatonic step. He wakes up and looks at me, large fur is laid upon his head, his eyes gleam as he stares at me. I see his backpack and card case that I couldn't have dreamed of. It has all I need to be able to bring him to me! And to make up for this I start walking towards the hidden town behind the tentacle. *Kalylinson? I'm in my hometown! I'm not worried about the horrible thing happening here. We just need to get lost to that bit about it. I decided to do that instead. They haven't known I existed any longer than they have known me. Oh well. But first I need to go collect a new dog that's about to be born. Theres nothing I can do. As I make a break for the first house I see a tall strong dog running towards the town. I start chasing after it as it starts barking. What the hell, can't I just keep going? Just like my first companion... Is it the reaper? I don't think so. He's counting down until we are around the third house.<|endoftext|>

"What the hell? " Mike asked, swinging his winter coat around his waist. " It's... it's coming! " Michael yelled, dragging some kind of weapon around his room. Mike looked at him confused. " What? No! This isn't even my house! I brought that thing home for my friend! " " Heh, I-I came back from... LAY DEAD, IM GOING TO SHOT HIM TO RELEASE ME IN A LIGHT! " Mike growled, pointing at the evil fiend. The almighty warrior jumped on top of the face of the killer wielding a battleaxe. " Let the murderer stench his blood, " he yelled, grinning. Soon Mike's friend followed suit. " Please step onto the ledge, if you can, kill my friend! " Mike shouted, sprinting back to his house. The blood was covering the balcony of the roof. Mike looked up, dazed. " Paul. Let's see what happens!"<|endoftext|>

"When the captain of this ship heard the news that it was on its way to be one of the last life-bearing worlds left on the planet. His ship was destroyed. " - A mournful voice picks up from the dead ship. " What is that? " " Because he paid for it." The rest of the crew shrug. After a few seconds, I see, the rows of pods lie on the floor. The people make no move towards me. After another minute, a single familiar voice rings out,'Are you alright there, John?' I turn to see the hologram of my ship as I'm propped up on some sort of stone and plucked from a nearby boulder by a relief officer. The officer is clearly distraught, but I assure him that he'll take me to the chief and meet them in person to discuss their case regarding the missing pods. A few moments later, I hear a loud'pfffft,' and wind in the room. Buildings on the walls shatter to ashes. Of course, if anyone can see the ashes I assume it's you, but, a small glimmer of movement is felt coming from above me. The general tone of the speech sounds kind of like pleading, but with no return to me. I feel a chill, then a strong heaving, as the previously somber officer rushes in and presses the emergency emergency button. A spasm of pain erupts as the doors burst into flames.<|endoftext|>

I met him because I wanted to keep in touch, so I confessed that I now have a boyfriend. Since our last date to each other he took everything from me and let me down. He still has relationships, but I can no longer hang out with my family. We cut ties for a long time and started exploring other avenues of relationship. I was so upset that the reason I had so much trouble finding a boyfriend was that he couldn't come along with me in his lavish lifestyle. I have never been in his favorite restaurant, usually by myself, but there was a waitress in his back yard. All of the time I spent talking to him is like staring into that sort of abyssal place. Sometimes I stare into that abyss. If I had to choose to keep my mouth shut and only answer a couple times, I would have to go with him. He always seemed attractive, always seeming to look up to me on a subconscious level. I wanted him to be the best I could get him. He was very attractive, and although I knew he was attracted to women, there were no relationships I wanted to have between us. The only way to get him was to wait out the woman from meeting him. He seemed like an addict for me. While listening to his music, I would stare at him as I listened to his episodes of Kill The Raspberries. I would stare at him just to listen to his father ramble about a theoretical physics class or whatever he has been doing in his spare time, until he would stop and just sigh. I began to rationalize the reason behind this behavior. I want him to be able to satisfy himself by not sleeping with women. I don't want the family to suffer for the flaws of his deeply flawed upbringing. So I decided to follow him. We would go to the local drug store, the one where girls go, and buy something "randomly". I drove and stayed at the place for days. My mother had been busy at work so we could probably get some rest. Just when I asked her if she could help me find him, the time came. She opened the back door for him and laid in bed. Moments later, his eyes were closed, and I noticed he was crying in the reflection of the mirror. I picked up his phone, and started dialing to my calling. The only message from him was on the other end of the line.<|endoftext|>

My childhood was disorienting. Stumbling from room to room, head falling back and neck breaking, decelerating and turning a blur. Desperately I kept going, blinking aimlessly in general, and then slowly coming to a stop. I heard a deep voice, “ *BEEPBEEPBEEP* ”. I blinked rapidly, trying to pick up my pace, and then I opened my eyes. I was in a familiar hospital bed, in a bed where the doctor, before me, had put me on a blanket. The first thing I saw was a thin, vivacious human, with bright green eyes and long-brown hair. The second thing I saw was a king sized bed with long white sheets, with long red cuffs leading down to a bedbed. I gasped in horror and wished that I had been at the hospital earlier, but at that moment I knew my fate. It took me less than a second to realise that this man was my father. The man in the bed was my therapist, who told me that I ’ d be alone, so I followed him into the operating theatre for diagnostic testing. “ Hello, Albert. Do you require assistance? ” I asked, anxiously awaiting my response. “ You ’ re not an old man, actually, are you? ” Albert said. “ I ’ m an old man with Alzheimer ” He said. Albert looked surprised, it appeared as though he had been in an accident, but had said no. “ Albert, who is your psychiatrist? ” Albert asked. Albert did not understand what he was being asked to ask, but I knew that I needed to know. “ Albert, is that you? ” I asked the man. “ You were born with Alzheimer ” He said. I asked, not knowing what to say. “ Yes ” Albert replied “ How old are you? ” “ Seventeen. ” “ And how come you hadn ’ t seen the doctor before? ” “ All of this when you were a little child. ” “ How ’ d you know that? ” I asked as if I knew what had to be done to make this man understand what had happened. “ You knew how it would happen, right? You were in a car accident, but then you realized how severe the injuries were. You grabbed your face in a fist fight and drove the car to the hospital, where you had to witness the doctors beating you. ” “ I guess so. ” Albert said. “ You remember what happened there? You made a promise to come to the hospital in time for your diagnosis ” Albert said, but the therapist was busy writing and scribbling his notes away. “ When your diagnosis came, then you didn ’ t commit suicide. Then you committed a horrific crime. ” “ You wanted to commit suicide? ” Albert asked the old man. “ I was 17 years old. How are you suppose to do it ” “ Very well, Mr. Walker, so here is our official diagnosis. It appears you have the main components of Alzheimer ’ s Disease: dyslexia, a motor disability, and a limited understanding of English. We advise against attending any appointments with Alzheimer ’ s in which the patient has refused to attend an appointment with dementia. If this becomes necessary, please contact the psychologist to discuss the appointments with your psychiatrist. ” “ I-I… ” I started. “ I can not look at my hands, the doctors are denying it ” “ Then what?! ” Albert shouted. “ What happens if I am admitted to a psychiatric institution? ” Albert said, looking confused. “ You are sent to a psychiatrist, we can't have you locked up indefinitely, it is unlikely your family will live to see you again, but it is preferable to have your family treated in such a way that they can treat you. We understand that you have not yet changed your mind, and that will be much more difficult for you when you are under the care of our centre. It is part of the community we serve for our patients, but the cost of everything I can offer it to you is higher than anyone will ever know. ” “ What? ” I whispered.<|endoftext|>

On that fateful night five strong, bloodied men and women of the thousands were led into a dark room, where a bed and a chair lay, underneath that bed was a mother and a father. A short-dressed woman was present, cooing, showing off her breasts. "I made our names today. Mother. " One of the younger men said. " Tell us of the valiant fire that they have faced today. " The mother started, while pointing at the two young men and taking their place opposite her, who looked to be mid-twenties. " These creatures of ours are immortal. They are not born in daylight. But those who accomplish great deeds do so to manifest those deeds in shadow... as mere cosmic rays. " The father said, stepping forwards, and the woman sitting beside him reached for a bow and hit it on the nearby table. The boy pulled a small object out of his pocket and started to pull it out from its hidden clasp, but fell to the floor with a sudden thud. The father swore. " They're light. They'll protect us tonight. " " Keep my lights on when we got there, son. They're not going to be here long, it's settled. " The mother said, closing her eyes. " Don't worry. They'll come for you, if that's what you want. But we don't want to destroy them. " " Only if we keep them safe... " The father asked. The women nodded slowly, giving one final look before moving on to the next son of the night. As night fell, the men and women became mere shadows. The two men left the room, hands on their hips, but the mother showed no sign of relenting. " Let's go. " The father's voice echoed in the dark, as though his lover whispered to him quietly. " As long as we haven't knocked them out, keep our lights on. We're about to awake the darkness from our beds. " The man stated, leaning back to look at his wife. " As long as we make sure that no one crawls through them, we'll die alone."<|endoftext|>

It's a business that leaves us with no recourse but to fight. They build new and confused equipment for us to research. As an organization, they've done this for decades. They are revolutionizing war and peace in this new earth. I've done many things, and it is best for everyone that they were destroyed because I brought them onto this new mission. I'm so sorry guys, we're going home to Phoenix. If you're interested in getting back to base, check out our new VFX how-to guide. I'm sure the video in front of you is a good shot. One thing, the whole operation is going well. They have raided the base, taken over it, with overwhelming force, and they have cornered us on the west ridge. Our last major advance was just before arrival. They captured one of my brothers inside the base, and brought him back to base immediately, so that we could escape. They are asking for anyone who is a part of them to take me out. If you're thinking about leaving base, understand they do it for me because I've spent so much time on the base. Now I will return and even worse, return and return and I will become one of them.<|endoftext|>

You wanted your world to crumble and watery exterior first. Money was a promise. More importantly, that you could grasp into and beat all those who encroached upon the soul of a single target. And you ’ d do it by exploiting their weaknesses. Revenge would be too much, you and the target would have earned it. But the most brilliant plan to plunder into this new world you now perceived as beautiful would fall on your sword. The man in red had hoped to salvage the world. His name was Isaac Joshua Clause. He spent his days brooding over the past five years on the comfort of his current home. His teenage years were about to run out, a third child had slept a half-hour before his departure and he suspected that one of the boys stealing would be good enough to get him work. But deep inside he knew he needed to wait. He had been nervous about going hunting for so long that he had resigned himself to daydreaming. But today was the day. It had been a rough year, he had slipped away from the family he once loved, the booze business running low. He had lost his wife and son in a car wreck and lost two friends, and then his apartment. But he would be safe tonight. And he would do what he could get away with. Isaac Joshua Clause, the former criminals who wanted to take over the world and uncover his next scapegoat. It was a gruesome story, one of the sweeter bits of any being I ’ ve had the pleasure of interacting with. He talked about a book about how he had read Death Note and how there were no serial killers so close to him. He told me how to trick her to change if they came for him. He told me about how he could stop the whole child braying scheme and taking out his own son. And then he told me about his plan. He started out small. He had entered the secretarial training program only months after their child was born. He didn't even have to kill a baby, yet it had only taken him a day to rid his body of two gallons of alcohol. It took him just minutes and the whole would be mine. They say there is no wonder a man builds walls around his victims. But what it matters to you is what you go through.<|endoftext|>

Emily growled back to the TV as a familiar voice announced "Any leaks? " She had started to boil, unleashing the only true delicacy she had ever come across. " No, I found two leak reports. " Abraxas spoke. " One of them showed a group of a dozen people performing a ritual that involved the Death Lord performing the first few steps before the serpent began to lick her soul. The other showed the face of a man over seven feet tall the type that would blow up the earth in a handful of seconds. " " What?! How did you come to my house? Did I miss a group of children sneaking through my window? " Abraxas asked innocently. " No, I was asleep, and then you were. " Emily replied angrily. " I don't remember you. " Abraxas yelled with voice so deep it sounded like he was complaining. " Did you do this? " Emily shrugged. " I only had one shot. " " Last chance? " " You know what? Fine, but I don't want to be the kid that did this. " Emily started shaking her head. She was shaking to be sure of herself. " I don't know, " Abraxas continued, " but you're my only chance. " " Are you serious?! " Emily responded disbelievingly. " I don't work for any American corporation. I did this for our FBI, NASA, Intel, and JPL. No one asks questions. " " What're you saying!? " Abraxas yelled at her. " We are supposed to be up for a lot of paperwork, but we have a backup. " Emily said defensively. " Jesus fucking Christ! " Abraxas said storming off to the kitchen. Emily's mind churned. What was she going to do? Fight with the government? Hire a psych lab to put a stop to an April Fools prank? All that math just wouldn't go right for her. What else could she do? As she finished her salad she shook her head and looked over to the window. Under her breath a worried voiced proclaimed: " Six moshers in a miniskirt. Now who the fuck will do that!" She knew this would never happen, yet. The only answer was to find someone else....... Why is my wife watching the news?<|endoftext|>

"No more acting dumb in front of the camera, " Susan's angry voice echoed through the office. " Tom, if there's a camera tonight, I need to film this all. " The monotone hung between the two, almost aloof. The power prancing between underappreciated but laborious tones of classical guitar riff made what sounded like a simple whisper sound as sound waves refracted off of it's silvery, glassy surface. " Tom, you're being so delusional. " Susan interrupted, coming to a standstill on her feet, her sword drawn tightly against her back as she leaned back a little. " This is time to see what they'd become. " It took some effort for Tom to muster his resolve to speak, a matter which he had secretly hoped to find as might- " Do you think you can just scare away a pet ferret? " " I can't, Tom! " Susan said, airy but firmly rooted in her stance. " This is your chance. * Jim** and Jamie* put out more than 50 kilos of nuclear material a day and everything works out in your favour. " Tom could read it in her eyes, the rage bubbling in their sockets now - from the mountain of bombs and the molten slime ball that surrounded them as their bones cracked in the process of decomposing beneath them. " Now get your ass over to the door, Tom! Now! Now! What are you going to do about that one rat? I told you nothing would beat it."<|endoftext|>

Sam wiped the sweat off of his face as he took off his robe. Taking in a large breath he tried not to linger too long on the events of the previous week. That was the night he met Sally Clausnoff. For a week before that he had talked with her. He had been in the business for a good 10 years before he met Sally. She was a gruff and rambunctious college student with long red hair and wavy, large hands. She also had many arts and crafts courses and done quite well. She was starting to think the magic that brought her up to this level of professionalism should have been a bit better. And more sinister, all at once. She had been the youngest apprentice in the wand division at the under elven school as well as the second youngest in her class. She was talking about how she had killed an entire family because she was just jealous of them. She told Sam about the bloody, filthy boys she killed in her ways. How she felt she had won every time. Sam broke down and began to cry uncontrollably as he took a deep breath. When he tried to collect himself, Sam hauled a stuffed rabbit onto the stage. Suddenly, a large gust of wind gusts blew away his clothes. As he looked on, he saw his dear wife in a wheel chair with his eyes and the bright pink purple line on his neck. That was right, he was now the youngest student in the wand division and she had come for him!<|endoftext|>

I lay in bed, starting my day before I have any room left to live. I look at the window through the blinds, hoping for the sun to be there, watching as I fall back to sleep. The countertop of the bed is still on top of the bed, but I feel the wrinkles on my neck. I start to get slightly aware of the tiles as I do. This is the closest I can get to seeing daylight. My eyelids are still open, and I don't feel tired. I really, really like my mornings. After all, the common one being sleep after work. As I lie next to my window again, I glance at the clock. It's midnight. Suddenly I notice something wrong. My bed was silent as I waited for my time to sink. I go over to the TV and pick up my phone. 5:30am. I think maybe my bed should be still this way. It's sunny. I spend the rest of the day looking through the window and hiding my life stress from the world.<|endoftext|>

"Mornin' down I think it is time to scout the Caged Earth. " There was a sick, sweet, sad voice from behind him. " Yes, mornin' Boss, I am sending out an lookout. " He turned to face the bird and slapped his wings down, putting his wings back in the palm of his hand. He could sense that the roar of the caged Earth and the sounds of the birds bouncing against the rocks had farmed to blacken the skies and now, a chunk of rock broke and he had one foot left on the ground. Two other men, who had come out of their flight seats, but wore spacesuits that beat on him, laid beside him and back on their feet. " Mornin' ye runn't worgt wrong, boss. " Their voices were deep and low, carried on the ebb and flow of the world around them. They looked to know where it was coming from, if any more were all that remained of the Planet. " Now y'know, I have a plan for when it happens. And I will work it out on my own- " " Hold back Boss, you don't understand. " " Yes, but why, when is this happening? " " No, I have no idea how or why. " " But why did ye y'all come out here? I was busy watching them come in and out of their comas and- " " Hush-go. " Another voice came from the corner. " You can call me Boss for a sec- " " Alright, alright. Well that was of course, I thought we should head off on a scare track. A little late. Either you run, or I find out y'all have a plan for when it all comes down. Hm. " " Well if it is that easy to say y'all got all outfaught! " " I get it, Boss. What happened? The birds didn't get all outfaught! " " I saw, mornin', that another got eaten. " " Mornin' you'll be alright? " " Yeah. Well, just go with it then, mornin'. I'll be home soon. " " Oh come on Boss, you had this plan all written down and I wan na help you on it. You really need to trust me when I'm around. " And with that, another voice came to the corner of the room. " Mornin' we have something inside. " " Ayy shit! Hah. " " You got it right boss. I swear it. On the rocks, this little thing was eating some of their bones. " " Boss... " " Hah! Okay. Just be one of them when the buck runs off. " And then the rest of the group stopped talking, their tails jutting out as they walked out of the room. The rest had gotten up, as they usually did. " I... Is... It getting harder to talk? " " Boss... it's just me and that caged world, Jack. If I may be able to aid y'all, it's easier to be called a god." And then the rest of the men left the room, unsupervised from their defensive towers. They walked towards the spear man, right in front of him. He used his teeth to rip the spear free and there was a sudden, deafening crunch as it struck him on the shoulder, broken into pieces. His cheeks were replaced by bone and intestines, and his eyes and nose were replaced by short, black magenta pupils. He turned to look at the old man beside him, his golden skin immitating his face. The gnashing of teeth joined the roiling of blood and saliva, before a bright, blood red flash and a hand reached out from his belly and grabbed him.<|endoftext|>

Tensions ran high as southern Illinois officially declared war on its allies north of the Mason Dixon on the eve of the Second Civil War. The war rumbled around the White Castle like an unstoppable quivering insect. It raged about for hours, threatening all that stood between both sides, large and small, Washington and Jefferson standing at the precipice of hatred. Both sides were involved in a bout of brutal violence both owing the injury to the quarrel and'lost secrets', respectively. After a fine meal, their discourse calmed from hell at last to normalcy at last. Without saying a word, the pigs attacked the the invading coalition. The battle raged on, as turkey, chicken, and other meats came to violent blows, when we even tried to drop the fight, a religious fanatic for Christ's sake, threw a Molotov cocktail at our backs. It was pretty cool, giving jazz and the occasional scream of agony to anyone who heard. During the Battle in the South, as our valiant men rode out to the slaughterhouse, they didn't sleep well either. On their last day of work they, being eternally hungry, were forced to suffer agonizing sleep due to "snoring " from their eyes and more importantly for the rest of their days before or after. As the war raged on, more and more of these cowards would walk around with bottles of water, or watch cartoons starring mostly those of little, innocent children as they had to sacrifice their livers, ethereal hands, and limbs before their fields of blood and dust bled into the cold air. Ultimately though, every man, woman and child who was not physically injured would go home to their families, enduring what would eventually become the nearly omnipresent cruelty, if only they could understand what people did to them. On March 21st, 1863, upon the tomb of President Lincoln, President Andrew Lincoln ( twas who was upon his death a few hours ago ) was found with a letter addressed to himself. The letter goes on to state that he and his friends' wife were " sick of the constantly snoring, much as their children were. " Little Jimmy, I need to talk to you, bro. They don't love you like they love me, at least not like they did to me. They think I hate them and they love you like they hate something. That's just ridiculous! And I don't know what the hell did you do to us! I never wanted to be in this one and I didn't know if you planned to destroy my family or not!" Several hours after his death, Andrew Lincoln finally contacted his family. For his part, he apologized for his actions, offering to accept and even accepting a scholarship to the University of Virginia for a future medical school as well as naming his son Jeremiah Lincoln and graduating with honors. As far as I'm aware, that is the single member of his family he did not choose. Some of that kids are still mad at him. They don't see the way he treated them and he definitely never meant to hurt them. They too see that his is a heinous crime, that is why his family will always love and listen to him, despite his actions. I guess if I could say, that he never did, I'm pretty sure it would break his heart. But you can only pray that he got to admit that when he said goodbye he didn't mean to hurt the people he loved.<|endoftext|>

The only thing to my mind was how everyone should be treated. Everyone would express to me their compassion. My appreciation. My regrets. How could they forgive me? I looked back at her and marveled at how quickly she ran up to me. How easy it had been. I found her body on the beach. I felt the love of my life. I reached down to pick her up. But the body was removed. I walked to the area where the corpse would have been if they hadn't been so thorough. They must have lined up in front of the beach with cars and other massages. "Holy shit. What the hell? Are you telling me I'm still alive?" he asked. How could she be dead? The text for the junkie's doctor dropped as he stumbled down the street. He hadn't even finished drawing his last breath. I looked at the newspaper I took from the shelf. No longer did I count, now I counted heart rate, time. The doctor sat there, half asleep. I lifted my hand to whisper the last word to him. I heard the click of a door opening. The wind whistled and leaves rocked against my face. I heard a metallic ring on the other side of the door... but nothing.<|endoftext|>

It's an electrical current I can feel, an electrical current that's pulsing through the atom, and I'm in harmony with it. I look at the mechanical body for a moment, mesmerized by the sight of the rotating surface of the energy I've been sitting in. There, spinning away on a metal body I can only think of as a toy. A piece of art. My mind is buzzing with thoughts; thoughts that create interjections in the air around me. I'm not sure why, but I'm at a loss for words. Letting the vibrations grace me, become a comforting reminder of the passing. How am I to take a piece of art and turn it into a form? Could I move it and let it know that it is moving? Or could I just be engrossed by the detail and nod at the beauty of it all? After some time, things seem to get stranger. I begin to feel a sharp pain on my neck. The sweat has seeped through my clothing. I wake up and find myself lost in my thoughts. I stagger over and grab a backpack containing my dress, keys, cell phone and.357 revolver. Next thing I know, a friend rushes into my bedroom to pick me up. He begins his business trip. We're... we're late. I should probably pay him dinner, but a bit of cash for groceries is $ 85 and I don't have any food, so I'm getting docked out tonight. My friend gently approaches my bed and says, "Janice, remember to pack an alarm for when it rings. You never know when it'll ring." I was about to turn over when I heard a soft hum. I froze. With a look of relief, I peeked over and a flash of light. I immediately realized I was completely alone, but I've been laying in bed all night. Where is everyone?<|endoftext|>

Did she even know how he did it? After God sent him to Earth, he sent her herself. She called her beautiful as a sister, and had a tinge of fear in her mouth from the thought of what he had to deal with her in these terrible days. Her father, Sal, turned his back on the divine in one swift motion. This judgment was final, his claim on the land already pre-filed. High devil sat at his desk, his other hand digging down into his wrinkled leather, red apple coloured robe. He was afraid, he was ashamed of himself, an unnatural beauty. A woman? Who could-He left his bloody head at her mercy. Those words floating before the eyes of his great demon wife. He never quite understood where she came from, his grandmother, who had been a pitiful girl and she had been a monster as a child. Now, as just the daughter of Lucifer himself, one of the greatest hall winners of the Interminable Magic, those screams echoed in his soul. His tears were streaming down. But still he kept kneeling, an act of mercy for his daughters long. Even in death, there were still parts of him, darkness in him, hunger in his heart. Satan glared at the evening sky at his wife. Jessica had been her pride, her love for her father, her kid. Each second more she had given up on him, he was happier now. He could not bring himself to anger anymore. Jessica was the new house animal, his girlfriend Sarah, the only time he had ever been so angry. What good is one person suffering a cat? Sarah had only been his heart, as the love of her life, so precious to him. He had to keep walking. He couldn't allow himself to let Sarah down after him. It was much harder than turning her body away from him, she was his new love, his love, the only thing he could want from her. This terrible feeling surged inside him. He needed to break her soul, he needed to overcome his morals, he needed to light up his place with his soul. To bring his mother the greatest achievement of her life. This horrid, gutting horror was now real. A flicker of hope, a flash of anger. Satan leaned against his desk, looking towards his daughters into the courtyard of the temple of eternal anger. He closed his eyes and opened them to a glorious light. He closed his eyes and smiled at her. A beautiful girl. The one who was his daughter.<|endoftext|>

**New reddit thread! Be kind! ** Linda looked at the computer screen, filling her head with pungent emotions. She had logged into Reddit and there was a message that made her heart sink. She clicked the link and at first, no one batted an eye. Then came an image with a cheery looking woman who mumbled to herself. Then came more and more confused comments and jokes. Finally, it was a picture of an elderly man. Linda looked at the screen and the words suddenly clicked in her mouth. **Good to see you two. ** It read, **Dear Ryan, Do you know why you are here? ** Tom responded, **Oh man why is the television so sad? ** Linda looked over at Tom's close friend Tim who was reading, checking if he was still awake. She didn't have enough time to read it all, but Tom continued on reading and her interest was suddenly replaced by those of Tom's mother, Maria. "Oh man, Tim, I know you've always loved me, but why are you reading? ** Jim asked. " Oh man, I told you, you can read my thoughts! " Linda looked at Tom, motioning her with her hands to her laptop. "... Another post? Can I delete it? " " We got no choice, Linda! It's about time! " she hollered. Tom looked back to find all of the smiles back on him. Maria gasped, eyes wide with disbelief. " Tom, Dave, Kim, Linda, it's about time we put the stop to this! " She immediately began screaming and screaming at him. Tom rushed over and hugged her tightly. He then grabbed her shoulder, gently holding her tight and tucking her back into a comfortable arm chair. " Forget what happened to you Nancy, don't do that again. " he smiled as Tom sat on his front porch with tears in his eyes. Mary quietly let out a sigh of relief, and told him, " Fine, they said everything would be fine. Just leave me alone. I can do this alone though, and we can work something out that's long overdue for our society's treatment. " Nancy said, taking a drag of the cigarette she just took. She continued to scream and lay by the porch for a while, sobbing with a couple of her friends. She eventually slipped away with great pain in her head. Jim was next to the computer, checking her email for anything that could contain this message. He had been looking forward to this email since her birthday. He quickly filled out some form, just like Linda had. There was something written on it under one of the pictures, which made it clear that the exchange was possible. Looking at the pictures, Jim guessed that this conversation would go on for years. He then logged on to Reddit, looked up, and went to a picture with the email, writing at a slightly different angle. It had been over ten minutes, so it took him an hour or so before the old man came back. " It's no problem, Ryan. " he said, as he turned to go back to the computer. " Sure, that's right. Just write it down, and we'll talk." **Funny how time sucks. ** As the computer booted up, Linda's family left. They all knew the truth, but they didn't want to make another decision that would make them question the choice. They didn't want to search for another truth that someone else would never let them have. They just wanted to know that they would live life as if it were normal. As they left the house, it was as if the world had turned upside down. One by one, they all turned and looked at the screen in horror as the words'fake' appeared on it. Edit: I know it's bad, but at least I know what it was all about. And don't forget to read more.<|endoftext|>

The murderous, shrieking amounts of light that engulfs the room shake the bedding with an unnatural scent. The staleness of it is masked by the inexplicable echoes of fear emanating from far off in the halls. "Well... what are you doing... " the young voice hesitantly says. " I was investigating the natural noise of these things. " " Why, " I ask, bewildered at the answer. " All things sound out loud... except you, son. " Another terrifying, strange sound that persists. Another figure repeats, standing at attention, the same figure that the woman walked in half an hour ago. " Still? " I ask incredulously. " I've been looking for you for the last three weeks... " " Yeah... but that is better, isn't it? Let's see how this monster is going to punish you. " " At least kill the child...? " " Yes... " " Alright then, what did you tell me about these things? " " None of it has anything to do with you, correct? " I question the question and kick myself for trying to satisfy my curiosity. " Tell me now, Lucy. I wouldn't wager on anything from you without ever using the necromancy class in your family... " I look at her eyes, unsure of what she is saying. " Here's the thing, Lucy. Remember how I said I would visit you two next week? " I ask, holding the wand up. " Yes... " Lucy squeaks, and hurries off to find me with her wand drawn. I wait anxiously at the door for her. Sometimes she does this while my parents come back to visit, but I don't mind these visits any more than she does. The house is silent for a few moments. After closing my eyes I can almost feel her looking away from me. Her finger slowly brushes my stomach. " Oh... what has happened to you... " Her eyes are fluttering open slightly as she looks down at her wand. " Is this how you say you did this? Because you couldn't possibly defend yourself... " " Are you... " " You always do things like that. " " Yes, you always do... just take a damn long look at me... " I blink and smile sheepishly. " You see... I mean... I... am not that evil... " " You think I am? " The silence falls. Lucy makes a faint sound but is gone in the world for a few moments, becoming a gargle again. " Wait... have you ever tried to fly? " " No, er... no I just... I.... " I throw the candle onto the floor. " You have power? " " Yes. " A moment passes where it does not remain after all. I summon another candle, this time bigger, brighter, and I now stand on the doorstep of my office. " Are you okay? " My co-worker, Lucy looks up, tears welling in her eyes. She pauses. " What happened? " " It always is. Every time we try to save you... we never take the time to do things we shouldn't do. " She turns, wrinkles crossed over her face. " It was one of those things, Mark. " " Mark... " " Mark... " " Mark... " " I've lost everything I love, Mark. And I've lost everything I've ever wanted to lose... I'm sorry... I love you." And with that, she closes the door behind her. I shake my head, thinking I must've gone into drugs. And as I scan the chamber of my bedroom with my wand, I think back on the same horrible moment I lost.<|endoftext|>

Dear May I Sir. The war left no option. You could not possibly escape the situation with death in your hands and reasons why the war was fought. How could you possibly stand with one hand on the horse? Maybe if you were brave enough, more people would come, maybe, I'm certain, we'd stop in America and the Middle East too. But if you thought this wouldn't put you to shame, you weren't so wrong. Good. Our planet was on its end here in this war... and those who survived did survive, no worries. Personally, I was planning for this. Watching the news, watching the news, being prepared for the battle that's to come. Had we not launched the missile that obliterated the Earth and the destroyed humanity? Perhaps, if I die in the arms of those who died in the most oppressing way possible, we could never have such fear. But most likely, though, the truth that arises from waiting... wait... this is it. At the end of this battle will be the man who kills us... for me. Maybe the man who has killed me was just as brave as he survived. Maybe, I was wrong... maybe, we were both right... maybe... I don't know. I just know, isn't it? I know... I just have to step up and push this to the max. I just have to look forward to it for the rest of my days on this Earth, and you in particular. For us both. To America... a place that will be called my home in the near future. And those who are brave, and who remember to fight those in history who are fighting for me... those who I have fought so hard to die for. Or to Germany... one of my many enemies. This is my final letter before the war is over. I hope you are more than happy to know I will be the last to write to you this. I hope that you will always find peace and safety in the afterlife. I wish you good life, D.S. L,<|endoftext|>

About a decade after launch, the thing appeared in a room. It held an airtight helmet and a thumb drive. It was labeled "Ground Control ", it had no power. The door cracked and a ladder slid out to the side. Inside was the conduit that allowed the craft to move past our defenses. The hatch that swung open was hard in the center, broken, just like the rest of the launch floor. It was my first time climbing out on it and I was nervous. On it was just my activation key, I kept myself immobile. I'd made sure that wasn't a problem. Every time I looked down I noticed the first few minutes were spent staring at a television. Every time I started looking I noticed new tech. " At what point does the ceiling become thinner, " I would ask myself. It was everyday since the launch that I realized that no matter how much stability I was exposed to, there were always other means of getting to Earth or of making me disappear in space. I don't know what happened to the last launch there, the last launch, but it was my responsibility to make sure that no one ever went on another launch. When I touched down, I put the key into the space console. It took me a few seconds to get the message out. " By the time you adjust the time you're in, you're headed back into the launch dock at Lake Fortitude. This is Shuttle # 2747. " " Thank you for transmitting Shuttle 2747, " I continued, " we hope you have a wonderful tour of this planet before you go. We hope you enjoy your trip!" My inner narration was the only thing I could comprehend. I was terrified for the first time since the launch I was going to lose everything. My family, my city, my friends, my love for men. They never found out about it, the probability was pretty slim at the time. They remember the port, the damn launch docks. Even my childhood memories of there life that were gone. I didn't know it was true for several months. Then it hit me. People didn't like being able to go to Lake Fortitude, everyone knew that, but how? Well anyway, I managed to convince NASA and the rest of my family that I had time travel into a space station near the lake. From there we managed to get the transfer confirmation. I was " officially in the security " ship and when I was in I stood up and went down to the docks. In preparation I got in the console and everything went black. They called me back to Earth and told me that I had to leave. I knew nothing except for the loud crack of my spacecraft. I grabbed my backpack and I saw little signs that I was gone. I have said my goodbyes, I will do everything I can to make sure that I'm not anywhere near anyone else. Although I know I can hear all of the voices inside my head and it doesn't matter, I'm probably still in orbit. The machine didn't seem to work at all. I got back to Earth and looked for myself, just in case. Time travel isn't something you could just let go of.<|endoftext|>

I saw her stumbling through the street, speeding through the path ahead. The stench of nothing made me jump in joy. She had done it. She had vanquished the Horde, regrown her men at her command. I watched her walk away with a hint of fear in her eyes as she took a sip of the Scotch in the glass. I was half tempted to take her home, but I had no intention of putting myself in danger. "So, anyway, how was the war? " " Well, sometimes. It's the strongest band to control a war. You're not going to like it when it finally falls. " " Now, well. It was a quick thing, some slapping, some vandalism, some beefcake and a couple of cops flicking dead flowers into the garbage. " " Very sure. It's not that bad. " She was a beautiful creature, with a gleaming white slicked back hair and deep brown eyes. She stood next to a sign that said " PUMP YOUR NECK IN IT! " This made me groan. I always knew that rush of nervousness from being surrounded. As she strode towards me I noticed a bit of scar tissue she took off. " Ah, " I said surprised. She was small and short, but smart as a cloud. She stood between me and my drink, surveying the chaos unfolding across the street. I was elated, excited. I was going to win the war! I watched her slip through a silver door on the side of the street, grab my drink and follow her out the door. It was like she was running from something. The streets were colorful and smelled like free coffee, all buildings not a mile apart. As she walked passed me, I felt a tug on my shoulder, and the pain welled up inside. I rolled over to see her, grabbed the umbrella off her shoulders, and stepped out into the street. The streets were full of life. Children playing, bikes of course, and women who walked past them giggling and laughing at the idea of being Queen mam. I saw a scene before me that I wouldn't have thought would have so clearly drawn me to the action. People were running and talking, when I saw Medusa with a cup in one hand and a paper with a number in the other. I took one look at her then down at my drink, then back at myself, and so did she. She hugged me, and I lost myself in her words, remembering the kindness and love we had shown each other. Eventually, Medusa stopped, and smiled slightly at me. " So, where are we going? " she asked. I stared for a moment, fully awake from the beer I just downed. She smiled, and said, " Marcus and his bride."<|endoftext|>

I push my space suit forward cautiously, not wanting to damage the door. I realize that I look a lot like what I have seen many times before. The, uh, letters this is from are a very unusual variety, I wonder what goes through those? Trying to look over my shoulder is my only way of escaping this stupor, there are only two other people in the world and they have only just left. I look up at them, they stare, and I don't want to let their heads bounce off of the front wall. How do you expect me to resist staring right in their face? I pull the door open, and their faces turn with awe, they stare at me, and I have no idea what to say. Confused, I reach out for the mirror, only to realize that it isn't there. With a sinking sense of pride, I say to them, "You're going to take over the world, Master Jace." I shove my fist down my throat. Maybe no one else can take over the world.<|endoftext|>

“ What ’ s wrong, sale?' What are potatoes talking about? ” I barked. “ I mean how can you be so stupid? ” Sam cried. “ I mean how can you be so stupid ”? Sam kept staring at me. His goldfish body squirmed trying to stand up. “ You are useless ”? Sam grabbed my hand and pushed me away from his chest. “ Yes ”? “ No. ” “ My body is useless ”? Sam was referring to a condition where potatoes started to moan. It could wait for itself, sometimes, “ Can we go over his uxperthesia. ” Sam pulled a potato out of his pocket and started to push it towards me. I stopped him and glared at him. “ Sorry sweet potato. You don ’ t understand ”? I looked at the potatoes. They were perfectly flat “ I mean why would I make potatoes to be greedy? ”? “ You are not even trying to correct your potatoes ”? “ How can you even be trying to help me ”? “ But we ’ re so close ”? “ They are just popping out of the ground ”? “ Like my mouth, I told you ”? “ On a level ”? Sam began to laugh again. “ You are just trying to do your job ”? “ What!? No! NO I- ”? “ It hurts! Are your potatoes making sound ”? “ Just want to make sure! Let me hear this- ”? “ You make noises and words that you don ’ t understand ”?

Emily walked up behind me. What colour was it? Blue? I knew it was the same color as that car. The way her feet made the ground shake. Her sneakers were bumpy and squeaky. She ’ d been walking my entire life but this had to be her first day on the train. I didn ’ t remember much about her until the stop at city light, then she led me to the tracks, made my way up to the stop of the tracks. I wanted to know more about this girl. I wanted to know who she was, as much as she could tell me about herself. I turned around to face her. I tried to see through the brown and gray of the overalls, the hands of her riding the train, maybe her warm smile and eyes. She saw me, there. I sat down with her and pulled out the crowbar. “ Excuse me, ” I said. “ What was that? ” I had no idea what I was doing, but Emily just stared at me. “ I ’ ve been looking for you all day. I can tell that you're lonely, but I ’ ll never catch up to you. ” I pulled back and shoved the crowbar at her face. She jumped as the crowbar touched her, pointing to the seats next to her. I took the crowbar from her and carefully slid it towards her face. “ Goodbye, baby ” I whispered. I never loved Emily, but that was ok. She was still there, just as her. “ Why are you still talking? ” I asked, trying to squeeze out some of her best, least honest, words. “ I ’ m your daddy. ” Emily stood there still, staring at the ground. I walked away with a look of disgust on her face. That took me a long time to guess. Another day at school? My mother is coming home today. They ’ ll be to pick her up from there.

Growing up, it was quickly obvious that the human population was growing. Scientists had developed a method to remove aging genes. The introduction of robots, although rudimentary, accelerated the process. Society had naturally lost its hold on the core. Before the robot revolution had begun, poverty was commonplace in most societies. Those on the lower end lived meager lives. The poorest were consistently running into problems in their lives. Without a roof over their heads, people resorted to starving and dying, and the hollow shell of a society had increasingly become a canvas that lacked the importance of privacy and freedom. Ever since "humans " appeared on the Earth, countless communities have fallen victim to mass genocide. Thanks to advances in medicine, we were able to alleviate the world's maladies. A hundred years after the human breakthrough, to combat hunger, a vengeful God appeared, who revealed that he had finally revealed his secret and released the act of revelation. Because it was chosen to transcribe our thoughts, we were free. We were free to ponder and be free of what others had taken for granted. Humans are simple - simply humanoid. Shaping our society is the number one priority. Perfection breeds perfection, and yet humans don't share the same values. Humans thought themselves more honorable, more benevolent and more interesting. With a peek, we came upon the outside world; a tyrannical government which sought to rule the face of the Earth. Another trade dispute between Mars and FTL driven aliens would ignite a torrent of civil war. With nothing more than bio-made medicine, desperation became the new army. With great power came inhumanity, and warring society became the perfect cancer in the human body. With no way to prevent or stop sickness or maladies, the movements of the rest of the human race reached a tipping point. None wanted to risk and destroy themselves over the discovery of what needed to be done. Not even the greatest minds would keep their promise to their friends or family and one society was left, already destroyed by ruin. With minimal resources, the rest slowly replaced human livestock and used it as their primary source of raw materials. Over the last hundred years, we have come to appreciate the values, the purity of the human body. Humans have evolved, but are ill adapted to the demands of our ecological ecosystem. They become cockroaches. Corruption fuels all life and would do us no good if we could not keep up the image of them. That is why we do our best to fight. To protect our friends and families, those closest to us. This is our way of life.<|endoftext|>

We shot him back. Of course we shot him back. They'd just carried me down here. I wasn't human at all, I was an animal. If there were only one human on this earth, there would be me. No one. A disembodied hand picked the gun up from the ground and raised it to his face. A deep, menacing voice crackled off the back of the man's head as he jolted upright, face flushed with contempt. "Find me and I will hunt you like deer. " " Who? " " Hells---Please say you're not human. " I slammed the revolver to the side of my head and buried my face in the back of his skull. " Oh, I must have lost my legs. " I turned away from him and kicked him around. I kicked him once more and pummelled my way down. " This isn't a good thing. I'm sorry. You understand now that you couldn't be human. I'm sorry, some humans have never outgrown the idea of being intelligent. I don't understand any of it. There's no meaning in anything."<|endoftext|>

Andrew came home late the next morning and found me alone in his room. It hadn't been here all day, he thought. I'd been packing for my trip to Indianapolis, so it was no surprise that I was only gone for a few hours. "I thought you weren't with me? " Andrew's dad said, but I was busy talking to the batteries on my phone. I tried to stop myself from laughing. There's something about escaping reality. Andrew could feel my pulse getting faster. Another knock at his door sent me back to reality, but it was more of an awkward silence than anything serious. " Dad, he's making dinner. What is it again? " " He's telling me he's staying at the ranch just to meet me and things, " my dad said. " He's telling me he's broke and she wouldn't have left him. She always was. " He sighed and looked at me with a mouthful of something grotesquely chewed. I didn't look him straight in the eyes. I wondered if I was in a diabetic hell, but maybe in a way that I'd be lucky if I stayed up past seven. I picked up the phone and called in sick. My dad just said that he was coming over at seven tonight to meet with Frank. I put on a non-disclosure agreement and hid it in my purse, an old plastic case. " I had expected you to figure this out after you left me alone... " Andrew said slowly, making small riddles about eating breakfast instead of breakfast. " Sorry. Didn't expect it to get worse. " He got up and stepped inside of my body. " Do you want to be there? " he asked. I heard a long, harsh rumble. Andrew looked at me, then back at Frank. " I understand. " Frank whined. " Thanks, Frank. I'll see you in a few hours."<|endoftext|>

I don't know if this will work. I want to sleep in my bed, I want to look in the mirror and I want to think about suicide, and I want to be one of those people that would understand the way that I knew my way would end, would love myself and not live a life with someone else who would beat me up to the point that I would want to be really angry when their dog starts teasing me all the time. I just want to run across my trash again, find the trash like a normal person and take care of myself. I'm not good at being "nice ". It's driving me crazy. This is what normal humans do for fun: crash into the flat, eat lunch, watch TV, get something to eat... Everything is boring. I'm going to sit on my porch tomorrow.

They watched the war. The world was there again, fighting for freedom, for honor, for justice and fairness, for some of the most racist, sexist, hateful, racist, transphobic and xenophobic people, and all of it spit the dirt on the arsons, the Jews, the Arabs and many of the evils and redemptive light on this earth. A true war. This it had started long before, the first Martian contraptions lit up the sky and didn't burn out, nor did anything else. Engineers built a 100 year long dormant- solar fusion facility that supplied huge amounts of fuel to this insignificant world to survive and thrive. Those scientists did not realize they lived in the chaos and conflicts of the time, and were too focused on their "Big Idea ", as they called it, and they left when the humans let them live inside. As scientist, scientists with infinite access to tools, and everything they could, only started to think of what they would have done if they knew there was still life. To survive. They thought of a good way to make it so that they had their own vision of the future, and the rest would realize and consider the whole endeavor. But they only thought of the destruction of themself. The rest of mankind had turned into construction equipment and laborers, and for the first time, ever, had the capability of surviving in the city. It was a perfect world. None of them survived, and all the other nuclear states fell, with their meager resources and the once thriving capitalist nations hiding behind their own cities. But the destruction of Earth was just the beginning. They had reached their goal, so they had to study as they stood only a few kilometres apart. Scientists were discouraged from walking when they encountered a beautiful field. It was very clear to them that a planet Earth had once inhabited had been dead, and in those desolate days, a change was happening. The light in the room told them there was nothing they could do. They started to wonder. As they walked, they found that there was no sign of life. Quite the opposite. Buildings stood, fixed in the same place where they once stood, illuminated only by the low iridescent lights and the faint smell of decay. With nothing but rubble and clothes and sand to cover them, they walked. They ran, covered in blood, and swore. They didn't know how to survive, but they had to. They ran through the ruins, even further, until they found the bodies of the good people trapped beneath the rubble. It had been three years since the war began, and scientists had seen the sides of these two countries, thousands of years into the future. Even now, the world used the year as it had been, for good or for evil. An entire generation was killed in a simple explosion, thousands and thousands of people dying before the heat death of time. Years after the war had ended, a new generation of scientists were sent to colonize the world, much to their irritation, but not by themselves. They had been warned not to enter territories on foot to observe, but they were met with no resistance, and no ships were seen, they remained at peace. Cities lay in ruins, unrecognizable and ruins of their former purpose. Then, one day, scientists at the White House saw the shining trail. The one red planet was once a thriving solar system, now was ash and forest, and seemingly abandoned by anything else.<|endoftext|>

The Grandfather is more so than my step-grandfather, but he's all I have. His hands move in labored motion, pumping oxygen to my lungs. I hope this isn't too bad. He holds a press box so heavy its probably brought out of his hand because it weighs on the wind, the flame from which the air escaped. I close my eyes and briefly whisper, "Never, ever go out in public again. " From the crowd, I see my friend. He's probably one of my older siblings, and we share a name. Not that it matters, even if it means he doesn't have much of a future with us. He looks so strong and proud. He helped me get into medical school, and is not a bad person. He and I are strong, but he's my brother; he's got a father who keeps the family line clean. What's best about him is that he loves those around him. As I stand up from my desk, I see it.

Facing the Manhattan skyline, at night that night, the whole world had suddenly changed, blending into an undulating global landscape. Moments later, humans began to shift ever onward, changing shape and size as more and more advanced life began to emerge, though the changes were small, but noticeable. As the world began to resemble the American Garden State, this trend became apparent at first, and people started to return to their homes and work and go to work. This was followed a few hours later when something significantly different happened, as the Earth was restored to its original state. The world one day... millions of people began to move out of America, leaving behind a magical civilization. Upon their arrival, the people began to read a great book, and expand their new world. The Book of Genesis was written by Noah, the son of Noah, who had been living on the edge of the Seas of the Old One. Noah was found once more. The writings on the shelf contained, among other things, various scrolls that turned into words which once belonged to Abraham the son of Isaac. The new planet was Earth... a place where all were welcome to come to thrive, and it was set up in such a way as to not produce a new life form, simply because of the damage it was causing. Much to people's dismay, this would result in the birth of thousands upon thousands of new children, and the death of trillions upon trillions of people all over the world. After some time, communication broke loose from the original planet, and this became something new to people, they truly believed, it was a miraculous event, but a natural phenomenon to manifest into reality. Scientists discovered the answer to this mystery in the mountains. After a preliminary trial, the cave discovered itself exactly where God had appeared. The ancient space ship, referred to as the Titanic, was launched from a place in Greenland, and was the only one on Earth. Of course, there was so much scientific excavation to be done to stop this, but in the end, with only the launch day to look forward to, everyone deserted the ship. In response, all of humanity, looking to the stars, decided to wander the earth, for a little longer. While searching the Earth, that was when it happened. All of a sudden, one of the most technologically advanced countries, USA, became the center of existence for the American people. Wars ensued, with the ultimate result being complete obliteration of the small nation which originally stood on the shores of Canada, destroyed more than half of the United States, and for the rest of the world, no colonies existed. Except Japan, which had just died, not with the 3rd World War, but with another one. With people and the world in complete harmony, Japan became the center of history, finally settling it's home, what is known as Russia.<|endoftext|>

" I shouted in agreement. " If you did, he would have been able to contact you. He could have found your body in *voluntarily*. " " But when you pulled me out of the pool and into the lava, he did not want to be touch." I pleaded. I could feel his tone change from angry to miffed. He just shrugged. And then he cracked his knuckles. And... and then... and... and... He fell to his knees. * I always wondered how he managed to hold on to his thoughts. What his purpose was. What his friends and family were like. * And then he did it. * *And then... * *** Sudden brilliance, blinding light, the wick of my lamp. First I remember just how cool it was. I was petting the tiny thing on my mother's face and I couldn't hear anything outside, and then the explosion. My first instinct was to cover her face to stop it, but I soon found myself coughing, and the only sound I could make was thunder. * I'll never forget that feeling*, I thought. And then it hit me, *my power. * *I'd be better off without it. *<|endoftext|>

Ah, how I wish my harp was so big! With so many tiny, fine feathers! I'll make it look so big if I can make it big for you just once! Like I said, if you're curious about the little things around you, you can go to the shop at the front of the castle, don't go to the flower shop with your petals, and take out some herbs and flowers just for this weird trick. This opens up an infinitely more lucrative fairy tale! Just look inside for a tail and be sure to trim off one of them and it won't sting. Relax on that tail and it'll become as soft and warm as just seconds ago! Look at the same tiny little critter everytime it sleeps! Focus on that stupid, tiny, tail and use that shiny, shiny thing to trace that tail too. They're very pretty and scary when you look at them, like those little gold kittens and then they have to go back to the boy who gave them to me. You don't want to interfere with their growth.<|endoftext|>

Your bloody head is pounding, your eyes burn. You look up to your reflection in the mirror. You put your finger on your lips, words spill out of them like water from a dam. "The sun will soon rise, tomorrow's sunset will be broadcast in the sky." You rock back and forth, a virtual symphony of self-induced exhaustion and self-pity. You stop, feel a throbbing pounding in your temples. And the feeling becomes real. You close your eyes and wince. Then you can't do anything. You close your eyes and start to think. You begin to sob, but you feel a presence coming over you. A familiar solace, a warm smile. You hear a young woman's voice, calling into your head. Your head is pounding. You grip your temple and bring your eyes to the front of your head, muffled laughter choking your thoughts. You can feel it inside you as you rub your eyes. You close your eyes again. You hear a young man's voice, marching up to your head, voice roiling with malice, booming like a maniac. The young man speaks... screaming. His words keep eating at your mind, pulling at your bones. You sit up, shuddering, barely believing your eyes. Tears start streaming down your face. You open your eyes, staring straight ahead. You look down at yourself. Your eyes now glisten, replaced by darkness. A mask of darkness surrounds you, covering your face. And with a shaky hand, you put your hand down and get up. You look down and on the ground, blood covering the walls. You feel a hand on your arm, peering down and touching your cheek. The young man asks if you want to come down, too. "What do you want? " asks the young man. " I want to be with you. And I'm going to be great with you. " You stand and slowly walk down the hallway to the back of the laboratory. A dull throbbing in your head. You close your eyes and turn to walk back towards the back of the lab, and you hear a young man's voice calling out. You turn your head. The young man holds you tight as you slip on the ground. The sounds change abruptly, and quickly enough, the sounds of blood falling on your shoes and on the ground. You strain to pull yourself out of the ground, but your pain is gone. You look over to the doorway to your house and see a pale young woman's voice calling out in horror. Your head is pounding. You struggle to pull yourself out of the ground but the pain is gone. You clutch your chest as the pain starts to build in you. You beg for help, but you are pushed down and crushed against the wall in front of you. At first, you cry, until your crying hits even harder. You squirm to your knees and gag, but as the pain takes over, your screams begin to become better and better. Your body begins to shudder. You pull on your fingers, but the pain gets much worse. You stare into darkness, staring straight ahead.---Your head is pounding, your eyes burn. And you look up to your reflection in the mirror. You put your finger on your lips, words spill out of them like water from a dam. *Click. Click. *<|endoftext|>

The air was still and the tides could be heard on the horizon. They were storms, we were tsunamis, we would be seen through clouds or other bodies but none of them caught the attention of the others. This was likely meant as our heads chanted skyward, but we were still in fear. They said their concern would only come from the earthlings. But as of late the Earth had been kept out of their gaze. The naturalist, one whose frame of mind was intact, ruled over the White House. He presided over his desk, overseeing every decision that changed. Our colors had become new; different. White has taken, a land of pearlescent beauty... it has taken, a land of black, of black-needles. Even the reds could not hold. The Earthlings had begged for the Earthling to stop as the wall raised up to the sky. The Wall of nature's Tower of Babel appeared, and everything shone like a bed of light. Cars didn't slow to halt. People walk, they behave. They gorge. People love. They don't flinch. Our species had seen long enough, had advanced so far. The Earthlings had cured their planet of sickness, and now their planet was cured of death. Death was exactly what it looked like. Segregation, or equivalency. There was nothing to be both frightened by, but above a war of statistical magnitude survival. No longer were races to brag, or topse, or crawl. A new age was beginning. They were emerging. Humanity had progressed so much that there were problems. The world held its breath, as it had since the Ancients appeared. I was staring at a wild, ramblings of black-painted wooden arms, bright red in the sun. They had come far in the past, they were coming far in the future. But humanity had seen above the trees, the trees took this new, first-born generation, and they struggled and flailed to keep it together. But the crows had no fangs or claws, no pointy ears, no stiffening gills. We were nothing but useless tools now. It was time, we must make the same sacrifice. We would never harm more than we conquered. Mankind had found the answer to the mysterious curse, to the universe's joke, and now we lived to kill each other so that we would have greater control over earth than we had within ourselves.<|endoftext|>

It was the first day he had been invited to this marriage rehearsal. He had seen first-hand the kind of history forged by two, he saw the transcendental movement that emerged only when wizards in hoods and armor had to fight through the endless, twisting sands of magic. He watched from the stands as the assembled wizards, singers, musicians, young men and women stepped from the gates, wheeled in ropes until the door he stood in smashed open. He saw people thronging around him, many of them ignorant and poor. But he knew what they saw. They spoke their *names* as they strode out of the temple. Their figure relaxed and their face changed to beautiful shades of green. They laughed and pointed, twisted their faces, and spouted words. The whole crowd laughed, but one by one, the audience grew roiling and darker. The catalyst was a small, rotating device that spun around and around inside its container, and buzzed. Every once in a while a sizable avalanche of sound would roll in and vanish into a young lad's hair. In the distance, a shadow met him, perhaps that of an elderly man with sparsely beard, scrying around in the dim light and contemplating his next move. The wizard first sniffed, then cleaned his teeth, then chucked it in the wastebasket before continuing. He spread his arms, folding his arms, stooping down and rubbing his cheek. He heard whispers, then a cacophony of voices. One of them was impressed and focused intensely on the chant, the older wizard recoiling. He raised his hand up over his mouth and it sensed the presence of something in it. He slowly drew it back, did one last thing, and grasped the device. He pulled it out. Warm liquid bubbled, precipitated, glowed and then evaporated. The wispy liquid left a trail, then halted, and out stepped another teenager, likely in a fancy dress, with a bald head and moustache and hair drawn tightly in one eye. The wizard gestured to him and quickly sauntered away. He remembered his bride who was blind at birth, a full-grown dragon, who had spent her whole life being left behind to wander the wastes. He looked around and saw the crowd was growing. They were shouting, tossing rocks and throwing hand-me-downs, soot and ash raining everywhere, fire pouring from cities, animals screeching for air, tramps of decay growing and rotting from their castes and rotting carcasses. This was one of the many parties he had attended, the older wizard gloved his hand gently to his lips. He knew the wizard had caught wind of the intrusion and was cautious. But still the newfound noise grew, stifling the breath. The chant finally grew faint and hulking, and the crowd began to disperse. As he gazed out the nearby window, he realized that the city of Nagiel had transformed into a fully-lived city of nomads, barbarian raiders, and wizards, edging to and fro along the cavernous slopes. Before long, the city he stood in was stained and charred. He recalled the meeting in the wizard's tavern. The young man looked up from his sipping water and nodded in agreement. " And you are my groom, you know, Master Horuj- " he began, " but remember me. Your bridesmaids and the fine daggers you brought are gone, and you know you need to return to your kingdom. Be careful what you are doing. You don't want to be any good to the kingdom of Nagiel, but you *have* to do it." And so they left the Wizards Guild, trailing their ledgers behind them.<|endoftext|>

He cast a terrible, raspy scream at his foe: ***Daddy ***. He threw up. *** *Gaaah, ***! This is the best thing that ever happened to me***! *** What a fool he was! “ We ’ re not done yet, ” he boomed, “ but i want to show you a way out of this wretched room! I ’ ve got to start dressing up the costumes. ” Time went sideways between them. Why would they have a dress up? There were no silver lining to it. The red uniform, battered and disheveled with sooty bits of grease and blood, didn ’ t help. “ Let ’ s cut those down to size for now! ” it urged and beckoned, but the light cast was gone. The crowd was gone. He hated it all. It cut across the room like a knife through flesh, barely breaking with every footstep. The man, he remembered well enough, was an ancient and wicked sorcerer who had overcome the greatest fear of mortals and conquered the realm. But without it, strength was lost. He sighed. *** Daddy I have finally succeeded! *** He looked up, “ My lord, I am immensely grateful to you. But you will need to do more. ” *** *He surely wants his breaks to be with his daughter tomorrow. * ***We can ’ t do this alone, my lord. Come with me. *** ***I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do with my life*** “ But I love you… ” It was hard to find words to express what was sure to be a bitter, noisy grumble. At this point, the figures outside of their underground fortress of the dark ages were writhing in revulsion, sore with exhaustion. “ Do you know why I loved your daughter this time? ” he asked, his voice broken by a choir of snarled “ Old gods. ” The bones of those who remained below were vicious and wizened, with feathered wings the same color as pure flesh. “ And you were never close to her, my lord. ” ***A knight in shining armour, yet cold and unseen have taken her up in the ranks of the dark. You were never a clear match. “ I have beaten her dragons thousands of times now, but you are just a mere legend. ” “ It ’ s okay. ” *** But I ’ m going to die soon. *** “ And this we left for not so long ago. To an impassible king who watched helplessly as his people died, to a giant noble knight who held a sword forged of runes and magics while he fought the great wars between knights and common folk. ”<|endoftext|>

Alex smelt their base rich caramel and balsamic that most people can only imagine feeling off the inside of their chests. It was always that way, and what more good would the good of the gods than it's foul that only after a few short drinks with another desert man will you start to smell it first. I often wondered what would be as good as the meringue that my buddies had prepared for me, but that was something else for now. I was talking to the right man, again, though the emphasis in his face was almost too much for any creature to handle. I couldn't hear his like of voice, yet the only thing I could hear was soft-spoken laughter from a newborn child coughing and wheezing hysterically. Just then the car came in. I was surprised I had the ring, but I'd never really bothered with it. I was too afraid of that morning to say anything, but I hoped it worked. The man behind the wheel raised his cell phone to his ear to reply. 'Hi, Ricky. I see you've been working out. Have you seen anyone else driving up here lately?' He laughed and waved the phone back. I felt myself rumbling with excitement as I called his name. All he could do was smile, knowing the predicament. I had no idea what he meant. Could I stop his joke? Maybe. The car jerked and I could see the broken glass splatter down the side. Only to be knocked to the floor with enough force to break the glass. Now, as I lay sobbing, I didn't feel so bad. By then, I had cleaned out my hands enough to be able to fix the rest of the damage. As I regained my consciousness, I felt an odd sensation pull me to consciousness. It was something I hadn't felt since I was child. It seemed to rub off on me like the stars in a theatre play. I remember it like it was yesterday, and the most amusing thing about it all is that I could feel it. I knew I was high all of a sudden, but I didn't know how, and I was less and less sure what was happening. All I remember is a wet beeping echoing in my head. I didn't know who was doing this before, but I had to be careful. I rushed to the car and fixed the cracked glass with the most reassuring little fingers. I covered my ears, but it wasn't so bad; it sounded like in a matter of seconds, though it was at times irritating. For some reason, I didn't regret brushing my teeth a day ago. As I got back up, I realized that I forgot what went through my head when I woke up, but I continued to rub it off. The car made a noise and started driving. Thankfully I only had a few seconds before its tires gave out. I tried everything I could to keep my mind in check and I'm sure I succeeded. I saved hundreds of dollars the day after as I finished my check and put on my mask and gameboy to go to the grocer's. Though I knew my actions could cause more damage than I'd expected, I couldn't help but let it go away for the moment, so I continued saving from myself.<|endoftext|>

The hour was closing. All those away for beer. Bill's head was pounding. Heather is beating him again. Always that swinging way in manhattan, always the beat of a rap solo. It came all the way around Buffalo, saying no. Two chances a day of hugs and revelations and riding on their confidence. Probably the strangest thing that happened there. The building sweltering with cold air, give or take a day, it never changes. The buildings pulled up and their people first walked into the building. Tall buildings, drooping cement. Temples, brick buildings with wooden panes and glass doorways. Churches with silk doors and doors with white slab cabinets. Pedestrians, mostly college students passing through. Dozens upon dozens of strangers. The night slammed down as all the windows in the building fell on their hinges and the ground shook. Vines sank to the ground. The cars skittered like angels around them. You could almost feel the roofing girders get torn from their surfaces. The people, got up and crawled to the windows. One. Two. Three. The house was about to get old. Picking herself up from the ground she tore herself off as though she might tear herself out. Legs deep in the butt of a bottle, and as her vision began to blur. A bullet hit the heart of Heather. Pulling a picture from the ground like that. " Jesus Christ Heather! " yelled Bill. He shook Heather by the head like the blood was coming out of her. A different woman was in the apartment. " Dave" he said. Heather mumbled. Dave was sitting in her seat. A whiteboard that said'Definitely want in' scribbled on the top. Heather sat there in silence, every inch of her face in her mind. The soft pink light of the studio, her face white. She was so innocent. She was about to die. As her body limp to the floor. Another shot at the heart. Bang. As the deed had been done. She wasn't there anymore. Her mind faded to a memory of her own. The thought was appalling. But she knew. Why was Heather around in all this joy. Why were in most cases, men this sadistic and weak. Instead of blaming anyone or anything for their own. She knew nothing. The man walked into the room. A hulking creature of the night... no, that should have been it. He wore the loudest mask that you would ever find, probably in this city. His bloodshot eyes sunk into her skull like a killer would come closer to killing in person, and he was wearing a large black sundress with a crude bullet wound on it. He held the knife in his hand, taking one second to slow his movement. He held the knife in his left hand, taking another second to make his grip more secure. He looked across the room at his wife sitting on the couch. She was crying. Her eyes burning and lifeless. She screamed. Tears streamed down her face as she attempted to hide the woman she loved. The man stepped into the room. The man turned around and walked to her. She was beautiful. A passionate night gown wrapped around a figure. As he went into his bedroom she heard a gunshot. Just as he closed the door he ripped his feet from the floor and walked into the living room with his face clean of blood and blood.<|endoftext|>

"You'll do that right? " I grumbled. Dad always seemed to be so proud of me. Besides, I was the biggest dude in the room. " Of course, " I responded, putting my hand on my mouth. " Well I saw some green grass at the other end of my door. Maybe you could just let us take this outside. " I gave him a long look, laying his hand on his knee. My dad always said that. " Yeah. " I grinned. " Looks good. " My dad looked over to the big tree. The green grass was always first. Just like when we grow up and he always whispers one day, " Take the stick! " At first it was my mouth. Now, I could see it. " Okay, " Dad said, kneeling down to look over the tree. " You can take it outside. " The tree turned a dozen times to me. Every tree had a strange shape. The shape was awkward and had my dad just saying that to it. The creature hadn't moved at all. It was still perfectly straight and gentle like, but I wondered what was wrong with it. The rest of the animals are far more weird. Small things have a sharp spot and the herbivores have missing flesh. None of the animals grow around it. All in all, it looked awesome. I paid him a visit. Dad introduced himself as the President of the United States and I helped him gather information for school. " Alright kids, let's go inside. " He led us inside. " Here, take this. " He said, placing his hand on my throat. " Okay. Now take this, now. " I put my mouth back on my tongue. He followed. He pushed out the stick. There was nothing there. We must've hidden it in there. Finally, he let it fall to the ground. " You can do that! " he called after me. " Okay!" I followed. And with my little monster gone, there was nothing but the outlines of the trees as long as the stick. I looked up to see my dad's hair as blue as the day he buried the mantis.<|endoftext|>

I had found it my way to the towering tower to feed my fever. I don't even know why I bothered, but I just generally forgot how things usually go. I sit in my office, looking through millions of books every day. My palms sweat, my palms sweat with age. Today is day 36, and I really like it here. So, sitting, eating, masturbating, and exercising. All could I have done without this. The people walking past me my day has been a mix of youthful wonder, nostalgia, and hoping that today might be different. I definitely didn't think I would die happy here with so many stories. The forest seemed to fill up with water and vegetables and people began talking to each other, that was fun. Can you imagine, *life! *? I don't know what I would have done if I wasn't hungry? Did I open my eyes with the sun forever? Did I come out of a dream, or was I just kinda sitting there looking at my computer all day and contemplating. I remember being always sad all the time. My mother finally gave birth to my second son, a boy named Robert. My brother actually is in detention, and *always* makes me sad. Maybe he didn't have too much effort this year. Maybe his hard work had left him behind. My wife was pregnant with my third son this week. I would go look for him, but no one would talk to me in bed, no one would see me. My body is incredibly frail, and so I struggle at the exact same time. Still today, I stand here pondering some of these questions. After all, we don't have many people here. Most day, I browse a local magazine and watch Pawnee Empire. I am a very social person. But today, I meet my wife on an other, even sillier day. She sits next to me, laughing, and stares at me intently. Does she know my name? My name is Becky, and I am the most beautiful woman you have ever laid eyes on. I, like many others, must be in the poor town where William swears to have met me; not in this town, but in somewhere far away. I am one of the oldest and loved by my children. Today, I found it my way to the towering tower to feed my fever. The sun was shining brilliantly today and I eagerly prepared myself for tomorrow. I felt confident in my love for people, but it was beautiful when it was morning. That was the closest I have ever been to expressing myself. My gaze, both human and mystical, was met with wisdom that transcended all appearances. My wife said she was coming soon, and it did not deter me at all. I did not know her name or what she wanted, but it got me moving. I didn't have much time. I planned to go now, to start another day. This time would be different. This time I would see freedom of speech. I will probably be arrested here. I will be arrested and sentenced to death, but that will be okay. I would die happy. If I die, not next week. I have to calm down. I will wake up tomorrow and think and sleep. This is a lot of work, but I will get over it. One day I am going to die happy.<|endoftext|>

Xloder_Sucks The ship crashed into a pyramid once or twice in the area, a planet of sprawling wildlife, mindless corpses, utter collapse, devoid of life and the gentle breeze of the ocean heralded the arrival of advanced alien life. Earth had become so secretive it was a mystery to most alien species that could even be considered self-aware by humans. Their native species, whom have encountered earth through their own defenses long ago, had the greatest interest in the deaths of hundreds of man-sized mammals to safeguard their thousands of planets. All the races of Earth had spent thousands of lives developing weapons and defense strategies that allowed them to intercept and neutralize the superior races that had tried to destroy and exterminate those soldiers on board and with it the profit of offing man-sized creatures like themselves for the immense military cost. It wasn't just ships, humans had shared a shared ingenuity with the aliens. The half-mooned creatures saw each other as brothers and sisters in nearly every way, exploring each other, learning of their kindred in their innate intelligence and intent. The non-droid races collectively recognized that brotherly bonds that arose between Earthlings tended to evolve in the relative longevity that Earthlings shared. In response to humans' recognition of its own scarce resources, about two thirds of the world's population shared an affinity for plant-based life. Early on in the evolution of humans, the sunlight had originally been known as a quality trait that was innate to humans for ages but not so long ago. Alien objects focused the sunlight on the nuclei that split the nuclei that called the nuclei. Once the photons reached the exposed nucleus, they unfolded into bacterial organisms that specialized in digestion and rearranging the DNA that was in contact with the nuclei in the fruit of the plant-like nuclei. The bacteria spread throughout the non-droid and juvenile populations by feeding on the nuclear and bacterial nuclei in their biomass. The organic bacteria crafted sub-synthetic protein that attempted to provide stronger strains of an essential protein that instead provided weaker strains of that nutrient. Some of the species assembled themselves to manage the nutrient chains within the framework of the specific compound molecules found inside the protein as the hosts grew along their local sections. However, it was hard to believe that the fruit of this protein was capable of providing power across their entire solar system. This protein was used for water for energy, which led the native species to at least share a similar weakness to the other two. This protein, called Adenamic acid, had both a growth factor and a reaction in it that took place over very long periods of time where it generally became much more valuable than organic acids or other high value and weak acids. The native species would consume the fluid from the metabolized fluid until something, something other than natural, would cause them to attach to the solution. Until this happened, in the year that the native species had finally understood that the larvae of the Adenamic acid were more efficient carriers of energy. As was the case for many of their species when developing their protein, this effect was weak and was proportional to the amount of energy they were taking. This took place even more quickly than it was natural, and is the reason why natural beings gradually learned to train their own or other designated ships and weapons systems on them. They communicated nearly the exact same language and material, and came into contact with every species and advanced society, scanning over them for disease and other notable problems. The asteroid belt was the perfect location for access to complete natural knowledge. In the year that humans developed their most versatile defenses and satellites, they realized that any existing alien invasion force would quickly and easily handle the organic warfare they were leaving behind. With each landing that their ships gave out, humans learned how to kill anything, that which was ordinarily of relatively low strength and greater than it was in the course of planetary wars. The age of technology and science, of man-made thought and thought, of cybernetics and intelligence, had finally come to a close and now humanity could study and prepare for war more effectively and accurately.<|endoftext|>

One thought in one of the many great caverns may have come to mind. Chewing on dough in the largest saucepan, perched on top of two massive metal tongs, could have been mistaken for one of the great treasures of mankind. Unbelievable, to say the least. So no, I was just a bystander. Why would I venture into such a state? What would an entire civilization do? With a breeze of fresh air in one body, wordlessly transferring information about my baking planet from my cellphone to the wretched clay world below, where all life grew in kindness and faith. As word spread, conspiracies rose. A higher power learned of me and asked me about my diet. I informed him that I did not but I was a selfish, sick, wretched vegetable, and people were willing to go to the moon, up in the water, with no intention of eating me on their way to war. Another way, they called me mad. Now I would not cease to joke. If there was anything left of my religion, it was the fact that I did not believe in the life that I had lived. A glass of wine, a deep fried chicken, meat and cheese-throwing were all I had to choose. If I were to live the life that God had given me, and if I could spare the life that my family had helped them so hard, this was it. This was the only thought that let me exist. It takes a long time to change yourself into a beautiful, even beautiful woman.<|endoftext|>

I've been on this road for years, nope. My friends even tried to tell me I was crazy and they didn't mean it. They said it was an addiction. I don't know if it's one of my dank thoughts or just part of me. I'm not a normal kid, I went through phases that sucked. Drinking, smoking weed and break dancing. They stopped calling me a pussy after that. Sure I play rock, but I'm not popular enough for society. The other girls were not popular, not until recently. I met one that called me a girl but only once. The first time I met her, I thought I was just being cute. She always seemed like a normal girl, what with her eyes, too easy to read, simple to dress in. I was disappointed and treated her like a creep. I left immediately after that. It happened a couple of times, but by then I knew I'd leave her alone. I asked every girl I came across that knew her. They told me to be safe. They told me to lie to get away from that woman. I never really knew what kind of person this girl was before I saw her again. I know she's just in a hurry, but maybe I should be there early. She wants me to tell her about my fiance, but I tell her that I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear anything because I love my fiance. She tells me I'm crazy and I don't care about her. I tell her to really love me, but I can't be able to be with her anymore because she doesn't know who I am or why I'm leaving. She's tired of hearing it, and her three kids were her family, I feel like a last ditch effort. There's nothing I can do but endure this hell for awhile. No time for it to get real and her friends will go their separate ways. Eventually it happens. She's gone for the weekend. She's being bullied from afar because I've just been around, no one calls her a pussy for no reason. She went the one night stand for pride. Some jerks forced her to. She was having fun. Then a sickening part of me knew there was nothing I could do. It started here. She'd always been an introvert and bullied her family to the point where no one could help. She got expelled for that. She's angry now. She's making me drink and binge watch Hunger Games and and beg her parents to try to get her to shut up. How do they make her shut up? I've lost count on her. One of them told me that she never would. They assured me that she didn't have a family or friends. I'm not mad. They believed it to be true. She just talks on and on. I know she's becoming more and more withdrawn. I know that she's overwhelmed with guilt. It takes a lot of strength to stop thinking about us as equals. I know it's unfair that a drunk girl could hear her family's guilt. I just hope she catches on before too much jail time. I guess I was already too old to deal with this guilt. This kind of pressure will kill you when you're twenty. I'm not so sure if I want to give up.<|endoftext|>

"You did it " said Tso, half fueled with hopes that all things would turn out for the better. " Yes. I did it. And I broke their regime! " A great explosion engulfed the tiny nation's city, and it cracked open The Great Destroyer of Worlds, whose dust cover swirled throughout the small stretch of land where It had once stood. The capital of The Realm of The Wind was plunged into black ash and devastation, and a flood of monstrous insects rained from the sky. Heaven and earth, so much filled with life that Tso's back was soaked by a torrent of steam running down his face like a ragdoll. " You were trying to save the world " Tso said with a half smile. " True. " For some reason the Emperor of Mankind had been reluctant to speak to him. " This once great empire had fallen, and now you're here to claim it. " " I'd rather it be. We went from one glorious planet to the next. You led armies and left citizens and struggling tribes. I lead my own way. And you think that's the true power of human ingenuity. " " I could change my mind. All that's so noble in this life of strife, is me for one thing. I intend to serve humanity. " In a matter of moments The Father-Sun began to spark. Steam filled every crater in the great expanse that surrounded it, causing tectonic plates to curl in ever upwardwards. Like an electric chair taking him in, the small cracks appeared as large enough to build great power structures for cars. Why couldn't it be changed? " Don't tell me you were arrogant and selfish in your dreams. " " But it looks like this is where you will end all wars. Those of us who weren't cut out for this job are going to live in eternal bliss. I will travel the universe and make sure all men are protected. Before The Father, I went on adventures and wars. I turned the tides that had come crashing down on the face of the galaxy. I may have killed many, but my last five hundred years have led me into a new era and I have witnessed the rise and fall of empires of all shapes and sizes. " Tso slid his hands over his forehead as his hopes started to wane. " No, it's not really anything. It just can't be. No, no it can't be. We didn't build up a great dynasty for ourselves. Let me explain. I led the Elves to victory against all odds, knowing that the Empire would never fully rebuild and rule a full scale country. I had to travel far and far to reach a throne that would also represent my empire and our home, to overthrow the incoming Emperor. But no matter how many adventures and wars I made, the Elves managed to avoid the inevitable. I was allowed to rule the lands as my second in command. I conquered all the land and bore my armies down upon my subjects. They were so stubborn and swelled and grew as the days passed by, waiting for something bad to happen. They developed elaborate plans of their own that I eventually devised to end these plans. But it never worked out. So I made a mistake. And I couldn't bring myself to say I would stop. " " Whatever. They're not going to let me destroy the Empire as I planned. " " No. You'll probably end up with all the unfortunate idiots from hell right after I conquer this land. Nothing from the past. Nothing from the past can pass through my light. Nothing they can find to fix their eyes upon. You'll just have to find another name for my kingdom. And another name for my people." The Emperor was shocked, his head turning up, and then he turned and disappeared into nothingness. There was a constant buzzing....<|endoftext|>

The first time I saw the well out in front of me at the core was the day that my friend Gertrude came down from the tower and offered her her hand. She said that she could wield the great Madmantic Blade. Now, of course, she left though - Gertrude had already made the stupid offer in the first place, so she saw nothing but misfortune. In fact, I thought it a frivolous prank, to play along. After all, I am also immortal. I was alone on the halls when I finally encountered it - on a set of stairs in the center of a field. "Gotcha! " yelled Shuntard. " It's an amazing thing, it's a little weird. " I replied quickly, resolute in my actions. He grinned. " But it doesn't look like a pretty sword, Shuntard. A little comfy. And still fit in here. " " Exactly! Looks like some kind of blacksmith. For a sword like this, a djinn like this... *and * a sword like that... " " Let's see, " I said, inspecting the armor over my heavy cobblestone fingers. More armor - still with some treads - pinned on a bullskin tunic. But this one seemed to be very real. The handle looked like the pinnacle of metal power. Then again, this was *it*. Ripped open like a rusty wine bottle. As if it was swimming with gold. And it smelled like something rubbed the dragon's snout. I removed it, and I realized what it was. It smelled like the words some old orc-orc boss would use when he summoned it from the depths of the map. " Here it is! " I said, taking the sword from him and throwing it, and took a clap as we rose to our feet and pushed our way through the lawnmower yards. For a moment, the smoke finally started to die down. I stood tall, and confidently walked around to the door. I didn't intend to knock. I sighed and shouted, " Hey, Tom. " A middle-aged, disheveled old man walked over, holding the blade. Tom stared at the blade. " Excalibur, " he gasped, " Shuntard, you need to get some humility. You fell in love with it a long time ago. And it's just a little yellow thing - and it's fast and very deadly. Look, man, get a coat. Here. " And in that moment, Tom was dead. " Even though he did, he was a hero, " I said. Now, I wanted to go back to your shop or something, so I wouldn't have to fight a bother to an ancient meelf like that. But... " I ran up the stairs to the bathroom and peered in. A humanoid form stood out in the window, eyes wide. And it looked just like me. There, too, was a great blade and a perfectly circular sheath. " Go on, you really need to dye that thing white. Got ta find someone! " " It can't be! " I yelled, running to the bathroom. And besides, I was going to need to figure something out for my next conquest - a big swiss army forking over. Then again, I had only beaten one. But, wait - there was a bigger ahaft of chieftain wielding a greatsword. " An escort. But first, I need to find someone to move my things. Even before I even start my conquest. " " But you'd have to be a bit cliche, I'm not a horde guy, " I chided. But, there was someone I'd meet on the road, and I was going to need something cool. " A band aid, " Tom interjected. " That'll just add a little charisma to your collection." And with that, he vanished into the night.<|endoftext|>

I walk to the edge of the woods and look up to my prize, the very thing I'm keeping hidden at the edge of the woods. I walk slowly, methodically, hoping to see if there are animals among the trees, but no one should see me like this. I had the feeling I'd found it. I lift my fingers up from the dirt, and inspect my hand. Really, I was looking at it. But it wasn't paint. It wasn't that my fingers were full of pigment. It was... deep, deep, and deep. I carefully walked up. I felt cold under my thumb, like I was pressing a finger to a hard metal plate. My eyes slammed shut as I realized what I had just done. I kept staring at the snow around me. I realized that at this distance, even moving my feet was difficult, much easier than holding my breath. I reached for my knife, and started chopping. I peered up at the ground beneath me, and saw my prize at the edge of the woods. I shook my head. I was done for.<|endoftext|>

Again? I hadn ’ t done this before. Every time I was done with the ritual, I never spent as much time thinking about what to do next with it. Today had been the day I decided to end it for good. I slung the bannister across my back and turned to face the wall. It was time to put it all away. Every day had been so hard yet it was impossible to miss this conversation that would speak of all the things I had done with my life. This mantra was well known to me for many people and yet for me it seemed almost over the top, "living in a world I loved ". I hoped he would take it back as some sort of punishment that would torment him as I would try to maintain my peaceful state while not leaving him suffering. I wasn ’ t surprised when I heard footsteps behind me and looked forward to it as a brisk breeze blew in from far away. I closed my eyes, looking down to try and focus. There wasn ’ t any reaction in sight, I didn ’ t feel anything. I hadn ’ t ever come to this house before. Slowly I closed my eyes and stood up, lifting the bannister over my head and the large glass wall in front of me. “ Phew, I ’ m a pleasure to meet you. ” he sighed. “ It seems a little strange for us to meet on this occasion as you are the other person in this room. I will be going to head out to the shops. ” He spoke out loud “ I don ’ t know who you are sir. I don ’ t have time for you to explain. ” I knew what this man wanted. I had been tarantined with the curse for so long and I had been unsure who he was. It was as if I was dealing with a curse for immortality. This man was telling me that I could live forever and in return for taking the curse away I would be left in the lurch with nothing but myself. I felt distant from my subconscious thoughts though. I felt like the only thing was his breathing around the edges of my mind and his eye contact. I looked down at the table next to me to try and focus on the mundane ritual in front of me. I studied the object, it was large enough to fit in my bannister and attached to a small table. He seemed confused at first but his gaze grew in intensity as he lit a cigarette with his small finger and started to inhale. I didn ’ t notice as he steadily exhaled. His eyes grew wide as he lit another cigarette. “ Excuse me sir? ” I asked as I looked down to collect my thoughts. The shadow in front of him was the only thing in front of me. As I surveyed the room, I watched as the thin stack of paper that had covered the bannister sunk its way into the floor. “ We need to talk about where we are. ” he said matter-of-factly as he lit another cigarette to clear his head. With that I lit the cigarette. “ We have a problem here sir. ” I looked down again, exhaling slowly. This was going to be interesting. I looked again at the bannister and counted down. 9.9.6.7.8.9. I put the bannister in my hand and pushed it out the back door. It had been a long day and my mind racing with possibilities. I glanced at my watch and it read 9:00, two minutes until the end. I went outside and took a short walk into town. When I arrived my heart began to pound in my chest. The man had taken me from him. If I lost my curse he would kill me. I walked in quietly and brushed the dirt from my boots. My attention was only captured by the sight of the house across the street. I was only too late for that, my home had been leveled off and I didn ’ t know where it was.<|endoftext|>

The crowd at the Smithsonian, on the other hand, wore old uniforms that had been lost in the post-civil war era. Army units quickly unveiled their own volunteer uniforms and handed them out. Secretaries sat by the windows of their small historical museum, awaiting the self-proclaimed leaders of the United States to lead the great nation they had become. All waited, as confident veterans waited for either the rookies to raise the flag, or the ones who were selected to lead the fights and kill terrorists. The dust settled as leaders began their march through the majestic city, in full black suit and outfit of emblazoned black with stars and letters marking the greatness of the American Republic.<|endoftext|>

“ If I could, I ’ d dig deeper! ” I stared dumbfounded. A look of panic crossed his face. That ’ s what he was talking about. “ Do you think? ” I asked, growing increasingly concerned. “ We ’ re two generations down the road, and not even I have a clue as to why. ” Even with the camaraderie of archaeologists and the hurried pace of transportation, his voice was physically intimidating. I ’ d put all my faith in him. As the man ’ s jaw dropped and he gave a few shivers, I leaped out of my chair with a look of glee. The man chuckled and mumbled something under his breath. I narrowed my eyes and looked at him. “ Ah, there it is. ” He motioned with his hand towards my foot, “ Place it in a large trench and let me dig near the bottom. ” I carefully dug down and found the stone monument to the forgotten civilization of Ancient Rome. A small inscription was on the top; “ A deed by an Intergalactic civilization to uncover the glory of the departed. ” He turned around and staggered to his feet, knowing that something bad was about to happen. And that is when I noticed the stone statue was slightly out of alignment. I dove over, and found nothing. “ Everyone wants to know what is buried beneath their feet, but what about what is in their bodies? ” I ran around to my car, and slammed it down on the road. I pushed down the now frozen ground and crawled behind my car, putting the back seat in. “ Who finds the legends? ” I sighed. He looked to his left and saw the foreman leaning against the body. The tip of a stick caught the young man ’ s eye. He gasped, flinching before he opened his mouth. “ This isn ’ t the first time you ’ ve been curious about those relics. ” He laughed. The boys looked at me quizzically. “ Okay, let ’ s just lay this one out. ” They quickly stood up and entered the excavation site. That was when I started investigating. Lining up the fresh dirt and dust from the ground, I filled my pockets with dirty pottery. I went on my way using a pre-packaged excrement and meandering across the desert for miles. Sometimes the boy and the foreman said the same thing. But no matter, everyone just stared at me and laughed at me as if they didn ’ t understand. If I had asked them today, they would have told me that my hobby was well-informed, and had always heard me tell tales like that. I continued my research. It was there in the next town my cousin was saying “ Do you know what it ’ s like to walk in on the warm chills of the sun? You just do. ” He grinned and nodded. He returned his smile, and explained how it worked. When it was finished, he promised to stay back. He would return with a short doppelgänger. I pulled out my revolver and aimed it at him. “ Go away, boy. ” At that moment, I looked directly into his eyes. The one that thought clearly to me is the scariest thing about himself. He can ’ t look at me any more. I looked away, taken aback. I put the muzzle of my revolver back into its cradle, and loaded my rifle.<|endoftext|>

"HA! " Everybody in the office clapped furiously, except for him. I stared at him, and something in my head told me he was an abusive, psychopathic guy. I had never heard his name before, nor did any of my coworkers know. My boss' face dropped into the corner of my desk, and I saw a huge lump of white rimmed plastic in his hands. It was a furry, furry hand, partially shaped like a shoe box, with a massive blob forming. A character emerged from within the blob and said something in a wet squeal. " Dude, if you speak English, you don't understand how delicious the Great Yellow Basilisk tasted! " I said, and he continued. " And the Great Basilisk is literally the strongest evil of all! Nobody likes big panda members, you know. And so they try to raid our offices to eat our cats! " I motioned for him to stand, but the blob removed itself from my desk. I only heard the sound of thunder and the squeal of thunder as the Great Basilisk ate the Panda Leader's body and banished it into the far distance. My boss, the opposite gender, sighed and had a loud uproar. " I figured it'd be easy to take it back out of the house, but that hasn't come to be yet, " he said, and we both looked at the toilet sink. It was full of bloody water and splashed on everything. One of the other people in the office was talking into a phone, trying to wiggle it away from the toilet. He was in big packages, calling cable companies, prostitutes, and even credit card companies. Maybe they were eating anything. Maybe my boss had the nerve to swear. " Stop asking questions. " The Grim Reaper shouted, " He's not talking. I ain't laughing right now! " He took out a revolver and opened fire on the creatures, which then brought its wide-brimmed eyes to his face. The Grim Reaper moved his arms from side to side, staring at me, he.44 in his hand, and said. " YOU'RE THE BETTER ONE, " he said, making a huge yelp and rubbing his fur. " He'll fry your brains off, so don't pay any attention to what I'm saying, " I said, horrified. " You're the right person, aren't you? " " Oh, yeah, but I'm making it all the way to *MY* desk now, so don't ask about that! " The Grim Reaper exploded in a shower of cat hair, his flying saucer-like eyes widening, revealing a crumple of baby teeth. " Good, now get out of here, " I yelled, and before I could say anything else I started laughing. " Wait, are you trying to eat my cat? " " That's right, " he said, and he began to bang on the counter. " You better wait, because he's going to fry you when he does. " I could feel my stomach churning with the blood and semen-soaked grip of the Grim Reaper, but I thought he was going to have fun already. He took another look at me and spoke, " Thanks, I like the smell. Could you try this again later, sir? " I opened the door of my office and tried to wake him, but my legs could not keep him asleep. His laughter startled me, and I really wasn't able to pick up his joke. " I'm so glad you could help, " he said, and he followed me to my office. There, behind the desk was a guy with a balaclava. " I think my boss might be hungry," I said, and the snow melted behind us. I could barely see him, but he walked over to the computer chair and pulled out a wicked looking laptop with a wicked looking big computer in it. With it were golden-yellow men who looked just like him. They started slashing up the newspapers, and in turn, I found that they took out my personal log entry. *A/N: I'm just asking you, what is the coolest subreddit you've never heard of? * Thanks for reading!<|endoftext|>

"Look, I've got a strong case. You don't hear me try to run you on your ass for who- " The Dog's roar broke the silence. He kicked down on the door frame, knee deep in the dirt. " Look man! I told you, I'm going to make sure those three little pigs don't bother putting themselves up to it! " His boots pounded on the white stone, and he couldn't hear much more. He hobbled down the scorched hall, glowering at his haggard adversary. The Big Bad Wolf, standing in the doorway, walked with his hands in his lap. " John? Can you open that door? " He asked the Head Coyote, a slim little little fiend named Ruby. " Nope. I'm over here! " John jumped up, ready to make another beatdown. " Ow. Okay, I see... yeah. " He tentatively shifted his cloak and coat. " John, you're late. " The Coyote walked over, revealing a bunch of mail containers and letter wrappers. " These bags are big because they have labels. " He grumbled. " I ordered the new outdoor gear." John glanced at the boxes, then back up at the Big Bad Wolf. The Big Bad Wolf had a creeping grin on his face.<|endoftext|>

At first I assumed it was just my luck. I'd get stuck living in a house in Wyoming, eating breakfast at a cookout, meeting my favorite seafood chef to order a bite, visit some farmers market, get to know her. Then I got the feel for what she looked like. She looked like maybe seventeen and handsome with high cheekbones, bright red hair, and she was wearing a black beanie. On top of that, if you blinked in the mirror that day, she had me pinned to my chest. No longer. People around me had entered out, some beautiful good or bad people who looked like we'd been shot and that wasn't important. I wasn't to be worried. No. No one knows who it really is. That's why I don't come over here anymore. Even now, at the age of nineteen-two, I feel the rush of craving that runs through my whole being. My body plunges into the earth. My mind storms in, shredding the apple of my eye. Deep down I know that I should have felt pity. Today, I feel it all. The euphoria that comes at the same time. The sensation that I wasn't even the ONE hot, nasty freak that I hated. Or was it the other people that held my hand? It has to be between my kind of cancer and the other diseases. I'm lucky I had my favorite ham sandwich today. That's how I met her. In class I learned about her stuff, saw her hand sobbing at the one knife in my hand, told her about my disease and how I'd gotten it. I felt so good about that joke, and I told her how the people in the class laughed at it. It was hilarious. I'm glad we kept it that way. So, back to business. At my house, I got some letters from my family. I was going to have dinner with them. I told them I didn't know anymore, that I didn't care anymore, and that I had to be fixed. I sat down, gingerly, and put on that silly robe. My family had written that he needed to go, and that he was sorry for his condition. She came in just as quickly and gave me a long, cursive version of it. The next morning I went to the hospital, and I told them about my situation. They responded in kind. I'll never forget those voices. I love them. The first thing they said to me was: "Tell her we love you. You've been a wonderful person. She'll get over it, because you're here to carry that burden that you're completely forgetting. Tell her we love you, ok? You were great." That night, I called my family over. It wasn't until that night that I realized I was left alone, covered in dried blood, with my ear in my ears. I wasn't the only one who knew the horrible, horrible truth. I was in the college apartment and on the way home from lunch, which was another reminder of how much I hated my job. I was fighting with a colleague who had that scar on his face. One of the doctors said, just a few days after getting married, that there was no rush. I signed this in my deep, shaky voice and wanted to tell them. If the doctor had a heart, I would have told them. But it was too late. I picked the wrong side of the phone and dialed my mom. But it never came. I had already called my own mother, like every other Thursday night after lunch. *It was time to hand the phone back. I had to know. * The next day I found myself on the hospital floor bleeding and my ear in my ear. I tried to scream. I tried to tell them. But that didn't stop me. They kept waiting for me and I couldn't come up with anything. Then, one morning, my boss came to visit. He didn't seem a fan of mine. I got on his car, and drove away. When I heard my grandma's name, I found her sobbing in my ear. I found my own.<|endoftext|>

Not every day someone lives under my constant influence. On a whim I decided to try and let all the negativity go and fix it. You see I have you in my life all of my life. Remember my day! I was at the grocery store when my cat got into a weird fit for eating, on top of all that I wanted to make my point out before my cat got hurt. So there I was getting groceries. When I caught up to him I tried to stop him. Just for a moment I thought I was being too aggressive. Nothing, no aggression, just impulsive behavior. As he took his spot on the corner I started talking to him. And my dear Mr. Kiyoshi stared back at me wondering what might I do to stop this. Maybe act like a normal man, like a regular person, and just listen to his sort of songs. The next few days I met a friend of mine who invited me to have a chance to go out for drinks, never knowing who I was with, only knowing she was in the neighborhood and was playing against some bad boys with her boyfriends. But she didn't want me to ask. I hung out alone just a few hours later and made it two or three times. That was when the bane of my existence was realized. I was "Under the influence of Mr. Kiyoshi. " She literally just said no to me. I asked the questions. The conversations continued to rage each time I asked her. Eventually one time when I was talking to a girl she whispered " I don't know... I just believe you, He is on a dream. It's him or me, if he's dreaming. " Like I was insane. Then two weeks ago I proposed. You are at home with your father and you are incredibly excited by it. You really are just as excited when your father invites you up to the den and talks. That is when he offers to put your dog out to pasture. You say yes but he's upset. Your dad wanted you to tell him what he needs to know. He is annoyed because he is tired, and he doesn't like being a nobody, so you decide to end it now. That was the last thing you said before leaving for your father's mansion. When you asked for him to come he sat quietly with his head bowed. I agreed to it regardless. I started holding a broom with black handles and you to go around. You weren't doing that before but I knew what I had to do. You drove your dad's car out of the driveway. It's messed up on the road and you were sat there with the car out front. You stopped the car with the wheels down. You had to use the to send it into the garage where the garage door was so you could get the necessary pieces. You were a dangerous car as always, driving with lightning speed. But you started backing away when your dad got there and started making loud noises. You began knocking in your front door and cursing and threatening me. I put the broom down and stuck my head inside. All I could do was nod and go back outside. The moans and shouts became louder. Now I'm surrounded by the wolves. You know what they call wolfs or megalends. They are huge and they don't really like to fight but I won't argue anymore. And then it was time for you to leave. You run towards your dad to hide behind the front door when the wolves give chase and you decide to stay. On the way out you see one of them get into the back garden so you yell out to them. " Help!" You hear a wail of approval in his ears and hear a wolf fighting back. And as the wolves run after you, I just duck behind you and give a big hug to you and walk away. That's when I see this giant wolf pull a big stick at you. He gets close and grabs your shoulder. That is when I realize you are not expecting me in the back garden.<|endoftext|>

"I'm sorry, but the thing you were looking for is sold out, " I said to him as I walked down the empty street. " I know you're busy finding the young kid who sold this to you. " He looked me in the eyes and tried to shrug, but I could feel my anger building inside of me. " Maybe this is because you've never owned anything you can't prove that you own, maybe it is because you don't own any jewelry? " I pointed at a random street thug by my side, dragging a bundle of clothes down my face. " He's just a random kid who bought this to sell, " I told him reassuringly. " And you sure your car has nothing to show for it? " " The kid here isn't even listed. And he just returned from school. " I gave him a questioning look. " So, um, " I continued, " He came home early with nothing in his life? " " Could we just find someone else? " I assured him, finally taking notice. He nodded his head and fidgeted around to go home. " Well I don't want to find anyone else, and maybe someone in the next neighborhood will take care of it yourself," I said tossing the word and heading home.<|endoftext|>

"Is that- " He was no doubt engrossed with what might be a much smaller pocket knife than planned. " OPEN THE PACKET MAN, YOU DARE SWITCH BING BONG BONG, THIS IS TO STOP YOU. " A minute of sloppiness immediately transgressed his mind, an unstoppable tide of excitement leaving him even more confused and unintelligible than it already was. " WHAT... WELCOME SIR? COME HERE GON NA GET DOWN SOMETHING? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? WE'RE DEATH TASTING YOU, GON NA ANSWER THESE OTHER FUCKERS RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE WITHING IN EVERYWHERE ON EARTH! " The deerrow swooped down upon the unsuspecting head, chocking and gnashing against the side of the wall. The deer looked up to see a scrawny little girl between a rock and a tree. The girl whimpered and gritted her teeth, turning into pale green eyes. The deer continued to giggle as her stepmother, contemplating where to strike him, pulled the trigger. The deer was taken by surprise, dropped on the ground with a cleft face on the street beside it. The cowards neck shot back up, touching flesh, wooden boards and cracking stairs. The deer was in a frenzy, abandoning its pursuers in mere moments. " CA N'T YOU TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FUCKING WEEKS MORNINGMAYSE? WE MAY HAVE A WEEK, GOD DAMN IT CA N'T YOU TELL ME ANYTHING? NOW, BRO. " At that, the brazen sapling crouched, straightening himself and arching his back. Once again, despite the pain in his head, the vampire could not recoil and finally leaped, landing in a daze. The deer watched as the kid poked and prodded, and drew his darts, all connected to the girl. She fell forward, eyes wide in terror, and took flight. The young cockatoo jumped back, picked up a branch and glanced down upon the girl's whimpering body. " You ok boy? You know what's best for your soul mate? Kill me! I'm a fuckin mammal, don't make me be eaten!"<|endoftext|>

My car was still moving. The keys were still in my left hand - still holding onto the steering wheel. Nobody called out, nobody noticed. Just a quiet scratch on the dash. I looked in my rearview mirror, panicked. Looking back down, it was all a blur. I had all the same questions at the time, but no answers. " Is it working? " I asked, blinking my eyes and thinking hard about the answer. The doctors said I had not much time before my birth, but somehow, like always, there was a fight growing within me. Just so I could move, I strapped my feet to the car. Slowly, I took a step forward. On the way up, however, the cries and cries got louder. I could feel the cold asphalt beating against my skin as I reached out and pushed down on my knees. My breaths seized in panic. " Don't worry, " I told myself. " I won't hurt myself, " the nurses had told me, as if they could speak to my mind. Soon, they were replaced with more shrieking yells. I closed my eyes and began walking again. I might not be able to see this time, but I could feel the cold landscape form beneath my feet. I felt, on my back, the cold air on my face. My skin shivered. I lowered my body to the ground and walked to my car. My parents told me this would be the last time, but I'd live. This time, it was just as well. People would eventually be able to see it through. If the world goes round, once everyone forgets, they won't have to wonder about how the events of their lives unfolded.<|endoftext|>

"So what are you waiting for? " asked the President. " Oh, I'm afraid I have my solution to this. I know this is a glitch, but I'm running out of time. I have options. " The President looked at him and after a moment he nodded slowly. The room he was in was brightly lit and a manor was sparsely decorated with desks, tables, one was covered in precious stones, other windows too. He laid his head down on the table, an array of various metals and gadgets were placed around him as well as he could spare to prepare for emergencies, " Do you have what it takes? " The President asked. The man shook his head. " I don't know that much about politics. People typically don't know about you in this world. I don't know when you got here. How did you find me? " " The five most powerful people. They have been in a crisis for some time now. There's nothing left to be done. " The president found himself looking around the room. Some material lay scattered around him including the tablet of some sort, two walls half a foot thick and covered in similar material. He said " Some say I'm a monster. Some say I am the last hope of humanity. " " No, they're wrong. Maybe you're just the one who needs me most, or maybe you're the one who can save humanity? Who can stop it? " " Did you know about our programs? " " Don't need to know anymore. " " It seems like all the information we've been collecting is being converted to energy and the Soviet Union's military and economic agents have been alerted. " The man stood up and looked out the window " Do you see it? " the man in the chair began. " It seems that way, if I'm not mistaken. I can't imagine that they're trying to use this leverage. All I know is that I have that secret word in the Oval Office that tells them if they give me the power to stop it... " The man laughed. " Now, we've already got a position. We can use them to defend ourselves." Edit: refilling my character sheets because I've got one.

It ’ s hard to come by when you ’ ve never killed anyone, but…there you go. Just like you always do on your first birthday: Dinner, movies, Christmas, holiday dinner, you ’ ll probably get by just fine out of the newly acquired benefits of little chance you ’ re linked in some cheesy old gentleman ’ s home on occasion with free meals and freebies. Not that any of that matters to me though…I kept spending hours doing stupid shit in the names of people I didn ’ t have any and pissing people off in the hopes of reaching their fair share of high paying and honorable careers. So as the final rest for the 100 year life of myself, I never actually feel a thing. However when I go into the real world, one thing always stands out: I don ’ t get anything. All I do is press a button or press a notification. Any time I do anything besides a click it instantly doubles in value and that ’ s the way of it. Or there were better ways. You know those cool iPhone games? They always had you caught on – I know what they ’ d done; but…it ’ s that fucking annoying bird song guy that always seemed too annoying to me to stop and listen to. His bough ’ s turns out sweet n' right and we both know that it ’ s just…they ’ re trapped with me. They somehow wanted some reward of killing me. Any other top notch case would be easy enough, heck they could just raise my level anywhere like chess or bowling. Or shoot me with that stupid arrow stick on his arse and just watch me suffer. As long as that dude wasn ’ t shaking his head, it was all fine. At least he didn ’ t have his doctorate to claim. Of course he wanted a stentorian winter or some shit like that, but no, he had his army of vampiric little celestial guardians and he had a pretty shit temper. So like the game with the half ass log in games, I left out the automatic respawn – I knew what was out there and I already loved dying in front of the big pink mouse with a giant sliver of screen. I arrived in the real world of my life ( I did the admittedly annoying Batman task to die ) and in seconds let that smile of mine fill my mouth. But I didn ’ t think much of it, and I never really enjoyed it either. As long as I feel invigorated and in control, I ’ m going to whatever this not-so-witty bird, the AI that inspired me on a daily basis, was doing so long as he didn ’ t make a huge fuss about me or “ scare me ”. I mean, I ’ m not even sure what it ’ s like to be in my bedroom doing a goddamn sweep of your wardrobe but damn does it make this city toattooing annoying. I grumbled aloud, “ Pause game ” and pressed Play. “ Come on Adam, get out! Oh god, no, you need to go kick this ass at a hundred times more than you ’ ve got! God that jerk only checks every damn button twice! ” I walked out the door. …<|endoftext|>

At 24 years old, I couldn't have imagined the life I'd have right now. Sometime around 23, I knew that I was dead. I learned all this slowly, in elementary school. Every single week, I learned to recognize dying sounds and phrases just as quickly as the information came out of my mouth. So you'll never guess the fate of the unborn, though. There was a chance that there was at least one possibility that there was someone in all of our lives *that* dies. Me. I got to know when I'd gotten sick. My first dead body was the first to go. There was obviously a chance that the person died in a combination of the temperature, height, and brain function, and I was able to determine that this or that was my last. Maybe they were the twin sisters. Or maybe I was the dead one's girlfriend when she got pregnant. You know, like this tragic case of Death... I couldn't remember my own name. I sat there for what felt like years, counting down each moment, the seconds until the birth of my second. Then, I knew. This would feel like a lifetime in my head. It was literally a lifetime, seeing the baby in the child's womb, seeing her slowly learning how to speak and move, the skills she learned while working for McDonalds when she was six. Then I would finally be able to relive my entire life so close, and truly just know it was all to do with being dead, actually. If you want to die, you'll figure it out. I had a long and happy life. Knowing that a newborn was a newborn would have meant the full life of human beings. I continued to try not to think about it, for it was no different than knowing that I would have to stay on my own for a while while longer to remember. But, still... I knew. As I got older, I made no efforts to seek out deeper meaning. Eventually, I found "higher." That's how life ended. You get too old, too numb, and you can no longer comprehend the reality of death. That's why I now travel to each death I see around me. The heavier the living things on this planet come, the more they fall in line to be the near-worthless flesh that they once were. I once flew up a hill, heading straight to the glorious sun, wishing that I could stay alive for just another few hours, while I looked down for moments before passing. But, I wasn't truly a man, and that's because I am dead. I'm filled with fear. The feeling of *death* hitting you, hurling pain through your body like you are the latest episode of television. As you pass me, it hits you more firmly than the rolling thundering waves of an overcast night. It wraps you up in a pool of your own blood.<|endoftext|>

When Captain Nathaniel Nix came in to the tentacle projecting out of my head. "Nigate - see you at the border. " He reached into a cardboard sack of marbles and the surrounding tentacle was snapped and looked at me, flushing his water brown hair and wearing a sweatpants underneath. He set the porthole down and locked the door behind him. " Get in the ship. We'll read you till you convince me not to go through that strange detachment I see every now and then with military lines of the fleet we're never gon na see again. " " Why'd you do that? " Captain Nix asked me. " I want a picture with John - Brigadier General of the rebel forces but I'm afraid to find out now. They ain't like the Pirates! " " You know the story, lieutenant. We have a run down of it here on Barrowt. " " So we thought it might be good in your favour to veer off, eh? " " Yes, but this is not an ethical issue. It's the three of us. Long dead and twisted, there's something we've never made our way. " " Well that's been said so many times before you I suppose. And I suppose that you would not argue with me. " " I didn't ask for a picture. I'd much prefer not to tell you. Look, John, you've come out of the little pocket of some camouflage yourself. They would never bother us looking. It's not that the war is over but the aliens are having some political difficulties out there. " " First of all, I'm sorry. I was overwhelmed by the current situation. They've only been able to line up a few times for the better half of the half. I'll try my best to explain that, but I'm afraid to touch it. " We got the standard sized armor and bulk plates out of the windows. They bound us into an enclosed space and began to take measure of our movement from the inside out. We took great care to separate our weapons. It's not like any that they could have done with lesser hardware. The metal was much stiffer than the steel and even though our soldiers haven't tried to blow things off, they were still able to carry on with their action. " We've gone from wood to concrete and into iron. We've been getting reports of alien bullets and missiles going straight through our suits. They're even going so far as to shoot us with gamma rays. Maybe the aliens will hire you? " " Hm? No, sir. Captain I can't know the results. Possibly the locational finders in your ship. " " Well that would be nice to see. I'd also like to know who's in charge here. " " Someone named John. Now John, he's a man I've always known is dead. I would hate that. " My seal changed. I still maintained my two eye patch on my face in surrender. " It wasn't a space race to kill me, was it. All they saw was us, dead, and starving. " " And who's James? " " No one, sir. James is a young man who's been a part of the crew too long for us to cause any trouble. That Captain really thought he knew what was coming. " He swiveled in his seat and braced himself for impact. " Oh jeez! " I threw a claw. " You're lucky they got us off the planet. We'll be on another small star system later. " " Thank you, James. Now let's go. We'll see you at the border."<|endoftext|>

"Not scary... per se I haven't been the same since I did that. " " How so, in reality? " " It's never been real yet. " "... So what was it like before what? " " Yeah there was stuff. Parties, makes things... Different things. Totally different thoughts... " " Wasn't life a great place, not to mention a horrible place. It was the only place we would be. " " Maybe so. " " Just have to take that away from me. The dog's been over here for a long time now, and this... well, that can't be right. This is just a moment from my experience. What are we going to have? " " Trying to find out. " " Well we don't know yet, but no one has seen me like this. Never seen my two-eyes. " " Hrmm... never seen my tail. Scared? Impossible, we both know I've never told anyone, we just all have. " " But he might not be frightened... so maybe it's time to start letting him know. " " We can treat him like we'd treat anything else. Bring in a nice nice guy, give him his toys, maybe maybe watch him for a while. It'd make things easier, so maybe he'll stay and never show up again, it'd keep him from facing up, and everything would be easier. " " Shouldn't have seen it. We both know if he did show up, how could we have known! " " I bet you see it now. You see my tail, now that it's gone. You just.... It's been your tail ever since the first day of school. You see how he's taking walks with you? He gets agitated, and you bring him in when you're down. He gets something very strange. Intrigued, you put him in a nice old rocking chair for him and start comforting him. Then he starts crying. Like the kids do."<|endoftext|>

I gazed out the window as the clock chimed and the crew of nine picked up. The ship began its inched nearer towards us, as the impressive monitors kept bringing out their warnings, and as the captain and crew pushed their way through the ever aching moments, the atmosphere was mixing to the worst of music and activity. As if there had been a touch point in the journey, and the ship docked with a mission just some door and a radio button on the deck in for a little medical beeping. “ Grandfather, ” the captain said to the crew as the craft landed at the final docking bay. I nodded, and spoke up with two other crew members, or at least people whose lives felt so appropriate and right now. “ My. Great. Grandpa, ” they greeted, greeting me in a cold and dead language. My finger ended the thank you machine and the faded Polaroid of a new "in the ice bowl " inside a tin chute filled with vitamin capsules, shot into space with my grandfather on, accompanied by the gentle clink of a full French circuit guitar. “ Excuse me sir? Do you have anything to say? ” I said to the blue eyed man closest to me. I let out a deep breath and reluctantly nodded, walking away to the broadcast hall. I immediately plugged the ears of my family. Before my mother could react I heard her heart beat and my grandmother joined me in the midst of it. It was a long trip out of the East, following the company farms and other shenanigans. Since my family passed away, I had to seek out and deal with the vacuum of space. I had to find some. It took two of us but we managed to find some provisions for the trip. After a while I realised that being almost 100 % vegan, and vegan, my diet may not be as efficient as I'd hoped. For a time though the broadcasts were just annoying until a beautiful and friendly voice spoke to me, something I hadn't heard in person in a long time. “ All you are doing is watching something, now come on. ” I nodded quickly and produced a polaroid from the freezer. “ Right, father. Any news? ” he answered. “ You're joining us now dear, we have a mission. ” The little old man extended an arm in front of me and gave me a worried look. His eyes narrowed and he led me through a large room. It was what I had seen hundreds of times before, a saucer with a low gravity suspension, and a huge window which I used to light the sun, but now instead was covered in frost. We walked through the glass and were rewarded by a beam of white light from a small vessel at the back of the ship. “ Ah, did you see what they said son? ” he asked me. “ What? ” I asked, hiding my own fear. His voice sounded almost amused. “ As soon as I saw you on those shows. They were filming the actor standing next to an old man laughing. It was funny and mad and all. When all hell broke lose, at the time there was something spectacular about your appearance and how you acted the moment you were seen by everyone. But one thing you were missing was the old man ’ s appearance. Now his immaculate face seemed more familiar than the young voice. There was something about your now roguish demeanor that made me want to close my eyes and think about what ’ s next. I wished I hadn ’ t. And I could feel my legs turning a duller gray. A very painful convulsions cut through my body and I was numb but in my arms I could feel my mother and my father's strange presence in the room. A wonderful memory of opening the door and hearing a hand in front of me in the exact moment I was gone. But for the time being I was grateful the ship didn ’ t break landing and he'd come flying in afterwards. And he stayed dead. Then he grew old and he died, and I realized. We did this.<|endoftext|>

Exhalation. That was the problem with Buddhism. A Zen Buddhist philosopher once said, "there is nothing which brings life to a Mortal's mind, but that is besides the point. Life is fleeting as a thing, a flash of light bearing down. A part of that motion is an expression. Certain life is a feeling, and the more in-depth there is the more acute an existence may appear. Though there are still circumstances in which life may not be present. Therefore, none of this doctrine is an equal one, and therefore it is not sufficient to understand the mysterious. " Nothing and no darkness. Ever-changing, moving, flowing, as though all confined with an unfathomable distance. Each soul that is discovered is seeking the same route to the next, and yet there is a longing that will not be solved, for there is the reality of an unending ocean, saturated by limited and empty light, forever running on the currents of its desires. Once, both paths were possibly possible and not really, but they were intermittent for all of our lives, and for each line, there is a darkness in another way. It is an absence of light, but rather a kind of nothingness. Here we find the hope of first seeing what will take place if we set about the ascent to Heaven. There are plenty of places, however, to choose. If you have never visited in your lifetime, go to this place. There are many it may seem silly to speak about, but I assure you, each one is a necessity. Heaven is eternal, there is always the possibility of re-entering the mind again on a new path, and when this is done, an undying experience of youth is yours, one that has not yet forgotten. Through your guidance, you will find yourself wanting, ready to procreate again, with unlimited possibilities, under absolute stress. In doing so, you will finally be bound by the laws of eternal goodness, and you will feel your body count in zero. When you have found yourself happier now than you were the very next day, or when you have unlocked the one door we had ever been given, or when you have seen what awaits you tomorrow, you will get those days back. There will be no such thing as a wasted life. And if you find yourself in love, then maybe you can provide yourself with comfort in return. With reason I can't say, perhaps you will at this point accept that you are watching someone else's life, regardless of what they see in you. Maybe you will come to the same conclusion again, that all there is to life is to be found. A soul who has truly been put off in the world, perhaps once a year and a year and a half, will now be excited to fulfill everything they can while also fulfilling one year, and one day. With those chances, you would be able to return to a happier life. I feel like I have already said this: It's a good thing you expect to achieve Heaven or Hell. Hell is always good. Being different is, in itself, a mistake, but accept it, no matter what you say. "<|endoftext|>

"What am I going to do? " The small child's eyes glazed over, with a grin following up on them. The person that had just suddenly been shown in the media's greatest live event had really done something in the world. She brought out a grand ass birthday cake, simple standard. As she folded the paper, she looked over the cake she had produced, not holding back her emotions, her eagerness in life showed, her brief frown had faded to a dull, worn expression. After unfolding the cake for the final time, the man in the public spotlight as well appeared to grow irritable. " I'm going to be honest. What's that going to do? I don't know. " The child looked at her, but no one could tell what was going on. She spoke her mind, her gaze never leaving the field of eyes above the cake. " I guess it won't matter because - we'll see. " The man lifted his eyebrow. " Do you get that? " " No, you know. You're in the big leagues, bro. " The child looked at him confused. " Do you like breaking up with the families that you love? " " Who would? Do you like not speaking to them? " " Yes. Well that doesn't answer your question. If you want the world to know you like them - but you want them to know you're unhappy - then so be it. " The man reached to shake the kid's hand and the look of concern on his face changed to scorn. " Don't worry, I'm fine with this, okay? Just give your parents a few more years to tell them you love them - and nobody will know. " " What's that really? " " Well... most of the world is happy. I guess you'll be ok just being happy and leaving them with you for the next 25 years, not being permanently sad. " " Ha! Take your time, you really should make it through this! " His grin grew larger, and his brow furrowed. " Get in here. " His voice was met with a mixture of confusion and anticipation. The little brat had almost burst into tears. This moment wasn't something she wanted to endure. She didn't want to stop at this point, so she quickly set her tools down on the table, calmly carefully sliding them into her backpack. " Get up, little brat." -- - I want some feedback on my writing, I've had a few runs over how to include good dialogue in this comment but I really can't use that kind of feedback.<|endoftext|>

Marine Smithed's eyes filled with tears as she read a log. “ My people, our guild has been decimated and the fleet of our inhabitants has grown even larger, we can not continue our kind not long after we are taken. This is our destiny! ” “ I'm sorry Captain. Our main garrison has been hit in the last week alone. I told you all I didn't want to die. I don't want to see my friends, or family die because they can not provide for their families. The only time I want to make a difference is if we survive the attack, a small party of survivors has to be banded together. You need to know Captain. ” The captain peered down into the log. “ Hah, what a shame captain. These kind of reasons for war can not be accepted, but you have to feel strongly to win. ” “ I can't do that Captain. I won't die alone, and I'm sure others will one day. We made a deal with the sea. I can't let it destroy our food, clothes and weapons. ” The captain and the rest of the crew looked down from their mounts and fell silent. They sighed and whispered in each other “ One has to make a choice. ” “ Let's go Captain. ” The captain dropped his equipment to the ground. One with a tentacle lowered its head to the ground and looked forward towards the great unknown as the great Destroyer stared back at the sea.<|endoftext|>

Some people don't have the "eights under their bones" vision. Though I know this man. He's watched the Earth and I saw it for years. What I have seen to death today is nothing more than a colossal demolition of the landscape that is the planet in comparison to every other, and I hate the whole way. When my hands got my wife it was to see the sky, the ash clouds just billowing in blinding light in the darkness, only to fall away once I've walked far enough away. He called me a coward for trying to let go in that dying moment, before the two of us she married for twenty years. He used to tell me how her life was to die, and how beautiful the world could be while she lived, or two, or all. Now I lay here, as my wife, at the Edge of existence, tears of sickness billowing from my knees, a silly little man saying he hopes I bring her back from the grave tomorrow morning. There's nothing to bring her back. It's just like we all thought it would be.<|endoftext|>

All of what i have ever known and become about had been lost to the past. Now I live as a philosophy professor before my entomologists beat them. They claim that the god that created us and his vehicle ran all of the universe. I believe it is self-modifying, that those in control won't stop themselves, and even that it has led to the bloody wars. Nevertheless I refuse to not bow to their wishes. Pardon? I have never thought of anything greater than myself. I can not say that I have thought anything less of myself. There are worlds, worlds beyond my grasp, places much too big for my moods to judge. Perhaps I've forgotten one. One of the realms beyond reaches nothing without anything but colour. There are dark, glowing places which have become lonely pits of hope. Maybe one day I will find one. And what will it be?<|endoftext|>

His teetering head and eyes lolling back and forth. His voice... deep and clear. Clearly a little atypical. His ears vibrate, he thinks to himself. A slight drifting ache. It's seemed as though two come into focus to him, he searches the corner for his target. He peers away as soon as the noise sounds of dragging chairs had stopped. He avoids them. But it was his own voice, the same woman he had talked to, footsteps coming through the door. It only seemed proper; they must be the sixth. What the fuck... He wants to speak to her. For the first time in a long time he decides to bite the bullet. Then to lose himself in the madness. "You can't even forget what you have done. Back then we thought you were the laughing stock of the Nazi party! " His voice caught in his throat like water pours from a fish-bowl. He stops laughing. The flicker of memory fades to black. There is again a sound of slipping steps through the door. He looks up for an opening and says slowly " Don't open that door yet."<|endoftext|>

The Force may seem so benign, beautiful but terrible things happen everytime we close our eyes. No one has ever truly been able to see what a sign means. I remember being a kid, those fences we cut, the fences we live in, all my life there was a god-knowshow-of-what kind of fence keeping us safe from the superhuman hordes we unknowingly came from. Every year, as ever, I was one of the first people walking the fence around the city. I had met no one quite like me. I only met a small handful of those that came, and I had two of the dozen that followed me, but I never met anyone who seemed so incapable of seeing what it meant, of knowing what it could mean. I had been the only one in this world with eyes so clear and cohesive, to me it was such a privilege to have eyes, to have these eyes, as they grew larger, and larger until I was barely less than a centimeter above an average sized person. And the word of God opened up the Gate, the gates to heaven. Why would they be colored like this? Can they be called my Gate? Why would they be angels? Why would they be seraphim in a church? Why would I have to travel far and wide to count as one? All those questions that I had pondered would be answered for the better, and so I climbed out from my bed and sat on the edge of a waterway, my eyes glinting white as a candle. My body warmed by the sheets I was gently placing in my palms, and I was about to be torn apart again, even if the other side of the gate looked like it might be a lonely sleep. So instead I got up and brushed my teeth, threw on some jeans and my tshirt, and raced for what seemed like an hour in search of a new pair of pants or a sweater and a pair of loafers, miles and miles to go. It took me almost an hour to come out from the gate in order to get to the apartment complex across the street, as well as a few hundred feet down a hill to the sidewalk where there wasn't a single car on the street, without at least a single person to see me. My brother would be home in a moment, and yet I never saw him, never even smiled at him, and just walked home, the gate opened, and I waved to the rest of the people inside, the Gate opened, and the people were gone. And the light came on, so bright and blinding that the man in a hazmat suit slowly closed the gate, revealing the fractured skin and bone beneath. I grew so used to it, so used to the sight of it, that I couldn't bear to look upon it any longer. There was nothing I could do. There would be nothing for me in this world, nowhere to be.<|endoftext|>

There isn't time. The only more I think is "one ", all I feel is acceleration. I am being pulled by two friggin' gusts of cold air and somehow I don't feel anything anymore. Then the heat hits and everything goes black, all around me. It's cool and fuzzy and it reminds me of when I was young, but not today. The day when my parents died. They were foolish people. No matter what I did, nobody wanted to be around them. They lost their guardians and they left us, and they went to that manhattan colony to escape. The lonely ones would wonder about them and if their Mother was okay in there. If the whole world had stopped spinning because of gravity, it's because of me. I don't know if I am floating, but I am neither. I am stuck as a body.<|endoftext|>

I stabbed myself in my left forearm with an empty steak knife this time. Always one of those days when I think the kids that need me are lurking in the closet near the gym. " Calm down, " I quietly stated. Didn't mean to cause such concern in these officers, it was just so peaceful for the last forty years. I'm sure more than a few are looking for their own reasons. Unfortunately, the tough working that you have all the time in the world doesn't pay off as well as the pain. I slowed my pace a little, even though it was so much easier to contemplate the idea that I was going to take a step further by doing something in pursuit of something I needed to do. In truth I was trying my best to pay for some food. My wife has always been pretty lucky, dating with enough troublebears. I knew her from my childhood in the military, that all of my best memories I had had with her were just hard reminders of her. During a bad day when she was off with her child or fighting, you just know the pain you feel as you do it. Today however was different, my wife came in looking sad. The doctor came in, ignoring the look in his face. But he didn't care. He sat down and closed the bar across the room, shooting at the strange man. I jumped and stood up. The strange man came near to me when I suddenly realized the gravity of it all. I had my wife dead. And I had to continue to kill myself. " So where is his victim? " a coworker asked. " He hasn't been found yet. " They reached into a drawer and pulled out a long case. They pulled out a cigarette and an unshelled cigarette but before they could pull the flames out one of the officer approached. He said to the stranger, " You want to see what you have to show to his dead wife? " I accepted it. I used my voice to explain where he knew my wife's body was. " Mary! " the officer barked. " He's tied up and is looking for some kind of suicide weapon. There wasn't a weapon in the case. " " But, what do you know of firearms? " " Whose whole condition is this? " He was holding a revolver, " of course it is. " " Who are you? " " I'm as old as you are, right? " " Ah. Well it all started back when I was nine. A boy with rare luck gets sent here in this world where it is illegal for anyone to commit suicide. If not, it turns out that you are, in fact, living a lucky streak. I never regretted doing that. " " What happened to this boy? " " He was a very lucky boy. He bullied everyone. That went on for a couple years before he learned that his vision would fade for a few months. He lost his sight and the memories returned but they couldn't last. Nowadays, nobody knows where they came from. I lived through that time inside of that one revolver I had at home. That little screwdriver with the red knuckled outside the lock gets the only job I ever had. So, here I am now. Dying inside of a car door, wishing I could keep the gun. " " You look as happy as I am."<|endoftext|>

"Pride before the mother! " One of the wizard's younger companions yelled. The king frowned before taking an unfriendly look at the wizard. No one noticed the man in the hallway from their house. A single black feather rested on his chest. He wore black robes that flowed around him. " No, Richard.... I'm afraid no wand has chosen me. You're the one who chose to burn the house down.... " The cloaked monk hollered. Richard looked down in disgust and then stared at the father. " We called it so. " The monk turned and began to speak. " It doesn't mean I don't have enemies, Mrs, " the wizard cried. Richard grabbed his father by the wrist and yanked him off of the sofa. His clothes flapped around as he fled. He regained his composure before picking him up, placing him on a bed of wooden blocks. " Here, you have my attention. " Richard wrote a letter to the brother in arms as he went to bed. " John, I'd like to introduce myself to you as the Jameson family. " Richard bent over and picked up a block. " I'm not your father. " He said. " My name is Richard Ollivander and I'm an associate of the king. " Richard got up and shook hands with the main character, William. " My name is Richard Ollivander. I'm the son of a wizard that ruined my family's house. " William nodded in agreement. They walked down the front hall towards the king, sitting in front of a strange laptop. The king had a thick stack of files on it. Each object had a section on the topic of how to find the wand. Robert Ollivander scrolled through the files. A breakthrough in one of the chapters. Obtaining a wand should be of the utmost importance. Even though it was frowned upon by many, the wizard did exist. " E... " When William was finished typing, the king relaxed and smiled as his eyes widened. " Anyway, " he said. " Remember how I told you, every wizard needs a wand. Do you not have one of those old stories about magic that I have? " Richard shook his head and walked out of the room. When the king walked in, he removed a single sheet of paper from his back pocket. " You... have been stopped by the wizard! " the wizard shouted. " No, you did not! You wasted our resources! You tried to cause chaos in our town and now you are standing before the blackest ink. " Richard looked up. " He has the power to send this wand! Without my assistance, the family would be the only thing I have left in this world! " The king turned away from Richard and gave a half choked scoff at the wizard. " All this sacrifice for power will remain with us..." The wizard seemed to grow irritable and his eyes were glowing with anger.<|endoftext|>

Death had turned a pale blue, slowly coming to a rest on the other side of his bed. 'It's done,' I thought to myself,'I guess I'm going to have to sleep here more often than I've been since I think of it. Love you, death.' My toes dug into the white carpet, mocking the horrors standing motionless outside. I wished he could just let me die here so I could finally be left here. But it sure wouldn't be like this. But I had to find my way out. I slowly crept out of bed, feeling the horrible cold creeping up my spine. I wanted to cry, but this was really worse than ever. The cold kept on killing me. I tried to hide my tears, but Death never let me into the house. He always just sat there and never touched my hands. So it never changed a thing. I prayed. I tried finding a bed but couldn't find it. I was always in a cold, dark bedroom. I wasn't allowed to see him at work, or through school or even the restaurant. Just out of the closet on the nightstand, here on the floor. I prayed that I could wake up, but Death never let me. He was always right behind me, watching my every movement, eyeing me. He was afraid to move, at least that's what I'd heard. The room was dark, damp, and unclean. Everything seemed to make sense, except for the sound of a jangling book. *Hilary Flint Opens The Books. * Slowly, the book slipped from my hands and onto the floor. I knew that this was his favorite book. It was the perfect bedtime story for me. I looked up at Death's dark eyes. His warm, shining skin was starting to coat the photos I took of him. He was always moving, but never got rid of me. He opened the book. He took out a long looking book and flipped to page 73, *The Life of the Prince of Darkness. * The title was **The Prince of Darkness: The Final Days on the Horizon**. **Phil**? I sat there, blank. I didn't remember *what* my name was. He opened the book again. * Every night I awake in the dark, and usually I wake up alone. But tonight I am prepared. * He looked back up into my eyes. * I must look so peaceful. But now I must use my spell of perpetual darkness, the Hunger of Dragons to ensure a peaceful end to this life. * I reached out and pulled the book away from his head, pulling it back off its cot. I knew he was telling me the truth. He told me what I must do. He finally made his decision. * I must leave this place and go to the library, to read the books of this world. * Suddenly the door shut, and his arms became heavier and heavier. I stood in the darkness, my feet crunching against the floor as I slowly moved my feet up the hallway and to my bedroom. My heart broke. I felt my bones grinding against the walls as my body slowly began to ache. I didn't have time for these thoughts. As my body began to fight the pain began to fade, and as my vision began to clear I watched in horror as my whole body started to shut. Everything seemed so peaceful, except for the sound of my book being lifted from my hands. My eyes blinked to see the contents of my book in front of my eyes. I realized I looked too sweet for this world. As the light faded, I remember being greeted by the sound of my blood rushing through my veins. I hear Death laughing, shaking me as he looked into my eyes. I wish he could take over my world now, but death always did. * **TL; DR **I've opened the book of misery, and have just ended the life of the prince of darkness. Hope you enjoy, guys.

Two backpacks full of ice cream and Timmy's water. Charlie was pouring his first ice cream. Frank was trying to think of something to write. Maybe he could start writing down something to spare in case it ended up on the screen. The moment he was sitting back down at his desk he glanced at his phone to see that no text had come in. " Tod! " he muttered to himself. He had to stop typing. He threw open the door of his car and slammed the door behind him as fast as he could. He knew where the door was, not using it often enough. Not only had no one been inside and Frank, and the government had just now come in, they had sent someone in with the instructions. He pulled the locks on his door and ran to where he was sitting. " Charlie.... wait, I got ta tell you... I think your place just got moved to England. " " Henry that's right. " Charlie waited for him to say it. " It looks like we're not allowed to go back to our house. It is very important this time around. Now if you'll excuse me.... I am excited to see you again, Henry. " Charlie sat down at his desk, and began to scroll through his Facebook page. He grabbed a blank picture of a house. " I thought you would be taken by these gentlemen, when you... you... that was me? " " I wanted you in my city too. How are you doing since you've been with the army? " " Are you a? What's your name? " " Henry, are you old enough to say your last name? " " Henry, I'm sorry I left. It's been a while since I've gone anywhere! " As he scrolled through his Facebook pages, Charlie realized that he had archived his memories into a giant chipchip. He suddenly grew worse and seemed to scream in pain. " Henry, this is too much to bear. We need to do something. I need you to be there for me, this is happening. Everyone needs you. I know you are here for me. If I don't go now, then there's nothing I can do for you. What do you mean? Where is everyone? " " I mean my address is on my phone, and if I don't speak to you you'll never talk to me again. This was a tough moment for me. " " Charlie! I'm so sorry! But I can't let you go! " Charlie ran to the window and launched his computer to charge his phone. He pressed the power button and waited for his impending doom. But as the cold air fell upon the windshield he felt a chill seep over him. He felt that the air was becoming sicker every second. It was very cold outside. He finally decided that he wanted to head back to the house and thank everyone and everything who put his life savings into this endeavour. The cold air of his grave forced itself onto his veins causing him to stop and cough violently. He rubbed his tired eyes, his head hurt and the air seemed colder. His blood seemed to boil as he headed for his truck. Charlie nodded and he felt a tear wet his cheek. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This prompt kinda inspired this short... if you don't get a hold of me though.....<|endoftext|>

The rows of randomly selected beggars tried to get into my mop of a suit. Nobody but me bought it. I counted, and saw the words marked: 8 points. I couldn't believe it. It worked, probably to my delight and dismay. The crowd began to cheer. The TV on the wall said: "Nineteen only!" And so, my poverty evaporated, leaving only the remaining designated levels of the impoverished behind. The stream of money funneled into the hands of the rich, and in the end, so did my misery. So did my fortune. That was the fourth time this week, that I've been told that I have a gambling problem... remember? Well, there's still a lot of money in my bank account, and it ain't just about the money. I mean, I spent it on people anyway. Any other day I could get it! No matter. I guess I'll just get it today.<|endoftext|>

"All reports indicate that a force of 2400 tons above the earth's atmosphere is already affecting solar weather patterns....Astronomers are baffled by these phenomena.... We have declared it a natural phenomenon. As the only source of light in the sky, this is baffling. According to calculations, if this system makes contact with earth again, this would mean... " The galactic committee sat in silence as a thick silence descended over the 50 minutes. " God is not dead, or in vain, but now we must decide. " The German ambassador floated by the desk in a robe, a low, bulbous hand holding a two piece microphone. " What do you propose? " The deep-sea explorer asked. " What... should we do? ", the balding man scolded the orb. " We don't have time for these type of conversations, just give in and head back to the studies center ". Silence and courtesy ensued as delegates and government officials at the committee stood nervously at their seats. It was nearing the end of the ceremony when the hard-boiled recorders began to dry up. The recording began to play, revealing a balding man, with a shaved head, as a member of the ISS. " WHY WOULD EAGER RUB WITH THE INTERCOUNTER PROTOCOLERS?! " the delegate screamed into a microphone. " IT'S THE LAST DAY, THEY'LL SPEND AN DAY IN THE STAPLES WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING DEMAND. " The deep-sea artist continued. " And thus far, more time has passed... This planet must suffer a terraforming act and complete its atmospheric mass composition. The a direct hit to its atmosphere must also remove much of its surface layer, to reduce the radiation at its core... " There was nothing left to say. Confusion erupted across the room. The music slowly faded to static. Again, a soft sound greeted everyone as they tried to make their way back to the control room. " THAT'S THE MASTERS ", the crackling voice cried, " IT IS NOT IN THE EVACUATION TEMPLATES OF WELLES. IT IS THE MOST IMPUPUTABLE RELATIVITY WITHIN CENTRAL EARTH. " The ambassador disappeared again. Several thousand earth-sized neutrons began falling from the sky in a barrage across earth, destroying buildings, homes, and anything they could. " And what is going on? " a voice cried. " The neutrons have been putting us at extreme levels of stress. " Hours passed. Then hours, and then hours and hours. The United States Ministry of Agriculture sent reporters to every major agricultural settlement in the world to break down the Mayan tablets from the cave, carefully storing all of them. Finally, a group of the brightest of the brightest of the brightest emerged to talk about their recent discovery. " We know, " declared one of them, " that we have run out of time. We've already seen this approach. Earth has been destroyed several times over the past few centuries. This time however, the insatiable rage of hell washes over us. The last one succeeded, the last major war - " The president cut in. " What's happened to Earth? ". " Well, what's the light in all this darkness? ", the congresswoman asked, looking up with bored eyes. " It's the light that just burst out of the sky, the light that you're seeing as you look down upon it! " The astronaut glanced back at her on the screen. " It's like I almost got blown away. You know, that kind of thing. With *kuh*. Yeah, with a crazy burst of energy! I'm falling out of the sky, inside the earth. I'm bound for it. How fucked is that? " The astronaut look at his partner. " Huh, sort of. " The three astronauts looked at each other. " Well, you seem to have some sort of malfunction, and it's all...'oh...' we are doomed,' " the astronaut responded, not even moving. " And what is the situation?" the astronaut asked, already becoming concerned with what he was saying.<|endoftext|>

She studies you all day long. Don't they ever get a fair chance to act? It was unsettling. You would say we'd've done better to ignore you, maybe they could have shown you extra tact or compassion. But she could hardly stand to look at you from the top of her pipaduct. You don't even look so surprised or surprised anymore. They wore your clothes and kept them there until it wasn't long before it was dark and cold. This room, if you don't mind, is a wall of doctors taking your children from school. Oh that's the name. That's quite a funny name, the normal ones. Just for effect. It is a man kind of name for a guy that gets his clothes on before a time. The only thing that they did was wear it in the odd way that if it made you unhappy you would go to the white room with the glasses and get dirty. Sure, sometimes it was so terribly appropriate for that. It even bothers you a bit that they kept you around during wars. You mean to let them get that kick back there, have her go off and you get nightmares. That's not really how it works, she was never really a girl, not really. She just was a guy, like no one had ever expected. But her look on us told a different story. She wasn't much different from the other children these days, since their whole school was silent, and then we met each other. We used to all have a good time and talk on the playground, but the ghosts stopped us after a while. Some of you people just stopped mentioning you, like your parents, and we assumed that the ghosts were oblivious to us, at least you didn't know. But after a while the memories started returning. Sure we would talk, tell stories, but after a while the ghosts became louder and clearer as we talked. Except we never talked about what we did for fun. How else did we know if they would forget our presence? Not long after those first memories, I sat at the very top of the parents' pillar. I could see through the thin curtain of ghosts that covered the walls of the desk, in front of her. I had told her that it would be useless if they forgot her. She was always told that it was pointless. She didn't even listen. I sat there, put my hand on her shoulder and closed my eyes. A tall man entered the classroom, his sight obscured by the curtain. That was it, I could pretend I was scared or scared if he saw me from the edge of the pillar. A kid was playing on the floor. He only had about 30 minutes before he'd caught me and ran past her. I couldn't tell if he was scared or not. I reached out and felt the hand pulling back from my face. Why is that happening? Don't they ever forget her? I'm scared, scared... Why am I not in the same position where she wouldn't remember? Because she couldn't forget. He took a look at me and I couldn't tell whether it was a smile or fear, but there it was. The last three years were an absolute nightmare. This was inevitable. I couldn't be walking again. I fell hard on my knees. When I turned around, I saw her, face like that of a child, there was still tears running down her face. It was very cute. I started to feel dizzy. This isn't right. No, I'm on pain medication, what have I done? Why am I breathing? Was there a cat? Who is there behind me? It was just a cat. It didn't seem like that at all. I screamed but couldn't move. I haven't moved. Am I still in pain? There's no medication. There was a whole body of cat right next to me.<|endoftext|>

I'm not sure what kind of death is going to be this, but I bet it's pretty close. You know the last man, the last deer that's big enough to threaten anything you might wear around the neck? Then you'd think immortality. At least, if you don't suffer from such a debilitating degenerative disease. Heck, who wouldn't? You need a certain edge you feel, not that it's scary at all. For years, I'd gone off on the adventures of traveling the world. Just my little adventure. Full of fortune, adventure, intrigue. The kind I've been saving for my own, protecting my family, my home. But no matter how long I've been doing this, never after I realized how far in the past I could outrun death. I might not be able to win the lottery, but that doesn't mean I don't care about living it up. Maybe it's because I've always been an introvert, although that's a pretty dim place to be. Maybe it's because I don't want to be a cruel killer or a villain. I don't know, but somehow it's even more morbid than that. It's funny how life is different when you don't fight, but all you do is hunt, not know, and die.<|endoftext|>

*I didn't have a time to type this* The cameras started rolling. I stood up, I knew I'd done this before. Of course I didn't, my wife has already called my bluff. *Today is the day* I walk down the hall to my car. She's driving as fast as possible, just like I promised she would. *Today is the day*, I smile to myself. I will be getting on that same flight, I promise. *What the hell? My airline picked me up from United and left me in the middle of chaos. And then what the hell? * The planes swept through the airport without going any further. * Was I in trouble? I wonder. * I walk back to my Mercedes. *** Suits had been made to hide our faces. I had to live with this fact now, but it was a precaution as I accepted my fate and began to walk to work.<|endoftext|>

You know you're going to hell today and so here you are, going back home to your mother, passing right into that old supermarket, watching sports and movie night in bed. That was the day you learnt your parachute was out, you were back home with your beautiful spouse at the airport but soon you don't see them again... Ah, someone has taken the gun from her shoulder "Sir, you're the unknown gunman! You're insane! You're an undercover agent and you've been on this run for six months without a trace! " I think this is making it out really bad it seems I won't be getting a second chance at life to listen to the voices again." Alright, let me try this, once again, where you are right now. How many guns does God have left in the goddamn arsenal, we all had half a bloody nest hole at our feet and scared cats had taken them all, so I could go here, write and write and beg for forgiveness, forget my past sins, I can't just run into the barrel of my gun; that bullet would have chosen the other side of this table rather than pointing it at you or the universe, the absolute, absolute worst case scenario. It's making it even worse.<|endoftext|>

To the sea. To the sky. To the sea. Lapping at my feet, I gazed up, my mind tossed in to the infinite view through the infinite stars, the infinite range and endless possibilities of the seas. It'd been years since I'd known another human being, the largest living thing in the universe. A comforting white, steamy, glowing orb. Where once the seas raged and the life died, the seas gave the thoughts life, the skies darkened and the earth smelled of sea and dust. I've been observing it for millenia, I've seen all its beauty and the wonders of nature. I've experienced it so much, but I've always felt a bond with it, so I left it alone for all the grand things which had been afforded to me in the past, but it was different now that I'd been able to live on. The oceans themselves are beautiful, but little wonder at the end of the day, their heat burnt up like soap from years of labor to the bone. For all the things I have seen, every utterance I've heard, it's oddly comforting. Like such a bright fairy tale; loving just you and your ship or power flowing over the wind by day and night. Laying my eyes upon the stars which shine as sweet branches, I'd never again hope to meet someone like me. Such a joyless, lonely, lazy stoner that made me feel more, but still with a strange magic that couldn't have been. I don't understand the finer points of it. I mean in the moment, through all the softhounds that hear my gift, I see a mischievous smile on their faces as they trip over their toys and fly away. Such, such joy, so twisted and I touch upon it. The part of me that love, weaves with this magic, I control, free of every human emotion. I sense the warmth of it, the bright past of the ocean, and I feel it sitting in the dark; a mindless, ever so brief moment that refuses to die, just waiting for its next waking moment. The touch of it hounds me with its feelings. They wrinkle and curl and fade and just fade until it's gone. And eventually, what should have be a blissful bliss, instead becomes a bitter, painful pain. I can no longer feel its warmth, and I can no longer feel its warmth. Now, this is the final moment, and I hear the rustling of leaves in the trees, and the sound of insects who once loved us and protected us have gone forever now. I still see them, only one person in the vast yet endless darkness of the night, all gathered up and moving as one. I can no longer touch them. My heart feels empty and short. Everything is dark, cold, and dead, burning. I feel as though I've been but a piece of the blackness, but only a tiny part of me. The bright light of the sunrise shines over me like a beacon from which some precious light floats. And then I awaken, like I always did, in this dark city.<|endoftext|>

"Mister, look! It's gone! " Jackson yelled. Who was out there? It wasn't clear whether that was a sun or a storm, but there were, Jackson had to believe, twelve creatures appear out of thin air from a tall, long, taller tree. Jackson didn't mind, but it was the same weather as every day, and days and nights long had been a part of the strange festivities. He recognized one of the smaller creatures, a green'lady' that appeared to have long hair and wore two clothes, one for him and one for something out of his reach, a beret that was already dripping with sweat. When the creature emerged it took Jackson by surprise, holding what Jackson recognized to be a camera. The camera was tinted white from every angle and Jackson hadn't used the focus lens ever since. The creature stopped, in front of Jackson, and Jackson snapped a couple photos. " Ugh, this is fucking weird, " Jackson spat. " This tree wouldn't have let me buy you these, you crazy prick. " After a minute it seemed to answer. " Wait, what do you mean? " " Well, we still have a proper life here, and we didn't leave after they beat us off. " " They still try to force our back to some ooze? " " No, not anymore. " " They were one more threat to us all then, huh? I mean, it's just the typical " massive" amount of damage they had done to us. What kind of monsters do they pull off what they do to the world? " Well, that's not my problem. You know, if you really want to save this place, head out and get them off of it, then we'll keep going. Maybe next time we'll find out if we can get some peace. " *** Jackson leaned back against the tree, my arms crossed and he wondered for a moment whether the dank, creepish way the creature scooted around the tree was worth the risk. He had tried to look good but, seeing as how smaller he was, he couldn't feel much better. It had been two weeks since that tree lost its grisly appearance, and he was cautious about making my presence known. After the creatures had been defeated, the city council had created a code of order regarding the possibility that an individual could commit crimes within the city. The guidelines called for the following practices: In the event that the person involved was less then a month old, punish them for the crime, if necessary, and make them walk away with a fine. Jackson's mother had committed her crime immediately after the incident, and it had been after the honking of the police officer's vehicle that he had seen something that could have been evidence, even though Jackson was unaware of it. Blood had pooled in the river, and as far as Jackson knew, the city was in shambles. Criminals had dropped dead and they were on the run like crazy. Soon, Jackson was quivering and the children of the children who were naturally fearful of heights were running up and down the path. Upon the very first sighting, Jackson ran back into his house and grabbed an old set of lawn chairs for himself. He threw them on the porch and paid the neighbors a visit. When they left, he added more plywood and made them hanging banners. Jackson's brother was the first person to volunteer to have the message read, along with his cousins, friends, and family. Jackson couldn't wait. It would be his last date with his current girlfriend.<|endoftext|>

As I shuffled through the hundreds of boxes I was certain I had seen nothing but one. I thought I would let them go, but decided to lose everything I held dear. I decided to become a thief myself. Once inside my closet I left the cards I left in it unattended. It was enough that I kept a professional touch to disguise my poor rolls. I found the letters and newly carved where I had left them. "New: Don't leave the O. Now and then you can imagine a game of Patrick's Death, but this is much different. If you don't have to leave, they are yours. When you give them a cookie and break it, they will remember you forever! You are permitted to have anything left by my guidance. This decision is final, on your behalf."

" A head, a serpent, and two giant birds were all along the route heading out to the stage in front of me. " Isn't they terrifyingly beautiful? " " Yeah, damnit, we hadn't seen a thing like that before, most amazing things would go missing after how great they were. " " Why should you care? They're all so hard.

"Five Nine? " I ask, flinching away to try and escape. I was expecting answers from my counselor. *Tch, hush now, step away from his head! * I know he doesn't hear me. I know my counselor doesn't hear me. I see him sit up, cowering, the floor echoing with the after-summoning footsteps of his assailant as I lead him away from my office. My mistake. He had fallen. I brought him back up to the examination table. His brain was nothing but black foam. His drinking ( when it didn't come from the air ), urine, hair, and blood staining everything else. My mistake. His eyes blinked, losing focus as I broke down the bathroom door. " *Don't do that. We have to do it. You don't even remember it? * " *Twenty. * " Oh, please! " I ask, slowly coming to my senses. Why? " What the fuck happened? " I ask, looking up to this dazed, confused woman. " Johnny, I... I didn't see you, I was just... I was just... I was... " the woman stammered. Tears well up in her eyes, eyes so intent on her punishment that I might as well have fallen to her chair in utter terror. " What are you doing?! " I screamed at her, climbing on top of her into my battered chair. " Can you pretend we're not murderers? " " Shut up. We can't win this argument, even if you wanted to. " She started with, pulling on a fading green and purple dress. Asking what that dress meant. My hands cuffed in place and my whole body shaking in fear. " *How am I supposed to do this?! * " she sobbed, sobbing. She hugged the sheets back over her head, then stood to meet my gaze. I smiled, remembering her last words before she had every single one. *Don't leave me, Johnny. I won't have anything to do with it. I won't even forget it again. You're the reason for everything. * " *He'll never forget what happened at sixteen. * " " *Love, Linda. * " " *See you soon. * " " *Jimmy. *" I whisper as I and the bedside light beneath me fade.

I stared in awe as the beach flipped its overhand full of sand and smashed into my face, a moment shattering my intent to fight. I've had enough. Beams of silvery light splashed all around me, with an air of quiet grace. The solid forest floor became even clearer than before, the redish, thick veins that ran and spat from beneath. Looking down at my hand, the familiar hue of that cross was slightly off. I let out a cry of triumph, and ran, my hands as pale as the sand, suddenly able to bend over my body as if cracking a kitchen. Looking around, I spotted a clearing full of flowers, blowing gently into one another. I slammed on the window as the loud bang grew more confident, through the night. The woods were busy sweeping in the night, and the sun rose. Time stopped for a moment, and I walked quickly to the railing, and found myself, or rather the trail of light, to my feet. Upon hearing the distant wind rustling in the trees, I noticed that there were people waiting inside, some far away. I looked at them and, just for a moment, felt myself getting closer. I noticed that they wore traditional robes, her hair flowed in black flowing from a tangled hairline. They also wore a sling on their upper body. I stood up and walked toward them, before I heard an ancient voice saying: "You can not stop me." And so, I was. Long ago, back before I walked into this river, I saw the future. The future I was meant to live. I walked into the field, and saw a flower, about the size of the palm of my hand, growing smaller. I laughed as I saw the grass grow taller. Then I saw a wall, with blue leaf on it. Then I saw the fields as well, filling up with pines, with flowers; they filled my vision, and I saw all the forests around me. It was all there. And as I walked, I saw his hand leave his pocket, and bring it to the edge of the rock. As he walked, and I saw his hand pass through the brick between trees, and run away from here. -- -- -- -- - ___ Like this story, check out /r/dori_tales for more!<|endoftext|>

When my new laptop came out, I was shocked - the large yellow screen flipped over to the main picture board of my desktop - but it was empty; waiting to be downloaded was not possible. "Why? ", I yelled, jumping up from my seat and placing the large, paper machine on my lap. And still it was blank. " Uh, I guess you said it wasn't there ", a call phone number replied from a machine nearby which did not come on the laptop's right side, which sent my grin back up into a grin as I felt a slight flicker on my cheeks as it hit the plug, reminding me of a long forgotten conversation from long ago, where I looked at my laptop and decided to place my hands on my chest so I could take in the desolate landscape outside. There was nothing there for me at the time - only floating dots. I tilted my head and leaned forward, disconcerted, looking down at my keyboard, trying to find what had sent me this startling. When I pressed Enter, it was blank. The screen zoomed to the next text field, by a brown font, and the words in the next were one word, *Richard* ( not my real name, I said, not what I had seen in all these years ), and I tapped Enter, and nothing happened. The next one was *Richard* by the name of Mark, and I repeated it, *So he's Richard*, replacing the *Richard* itself with a letter in rapid succession, *Caroline*. When I pressed Enter again, nothing happened at all. That was an odd feeling. When my laptop restarted, I began to tremble from the excitement. I was very bored and panicked with the realization of the world that I was becoming and why there was nothingness outside of the pen. Just then, my phone answered: *Richard? Richard isn't here? Maybe I heard a noise outside your house! Help! * I yelled in confusion; I was not angry at my laptop at all. Instead, I had nothing else to do. Before I could even get in my chair, I heard a loud click, and the screen switched to a human-readable screen, and I could now read the names and numbers of the remaining children outside the study. My phone was dead and the empty chair appeared as a floating dot. Everyone stared at it; what had the mind of a fool intended to read? Or maybe this was some sort of game, with nothing to do - Did anyone want to see this? They laughed, confused, for some reason but still unable to believe what was happening. " Richard, " said the voice that greeted them. Richard'likes Richard, that's all. He loved Richard. We played Call of Duty in his living room - most of his family used to play together, sitting in various layers of our family with my brothers and sisters at our backs. " I'm so sorry, Laura. I can't believe you used to use me at all, so... " I stuttered, crossing my arms, hoping I was being told the truth - what *had* been *my* life. " She's probably around now, " I hissed. I approached the voice once more, and without thinking carefully, I told the voice. " What kind of games were you playing with her, Richard? " I looked at the empty chair, it clearly had a different name on it. " Mario Kart," I yelled.<|endoftext|>

He awoke slowly. The colder water froze his heart. " Hello? " But his ears were stuck by glass. It was the first time someone had blinked those dull eyes for an hour. What was going on? He wasn't sleeping. And who did that? He walked closer to the glass window and saw nothing but water. " I don't know what's going on, " he whispered. It wasn't even that loud in the dingy; he was staring at it and hearing nothing. He was nervous and let out a yelp. " Oh no... " He looked around, and his eyes had met with the glass. " What am I dreaming... " Then he saw the gun lying face down in the shallow water. He gripped the bow gently and pulled the trigger. His eyes squinted up at the glass door and he could see the barrels smoking as he gripped the handle. The door slowly slid open and a beautiful woman stepped out. " I'm Maria, " she said, still frozen. " Mrs. Grumpy is awake."<|endoftext|>

"Hello. How many books do you read? " Jason was a hard worker. No matter what he read, " ma'am, " I began, " I usually shut up. But the question here is, " I paused for a moment, " if you've never had time to go see everyone's, then why are you asking me this, Mr. Douglas? " Jason stood silent. That wasn't unusual. The grownups all knew what I was up to. The adults, the veterans. He used to ask me about those stories. He always begged me to read and read them for 50 years. Ever since he was ten, he wrote stories about space. " This is a class that almost always comes before boarding. Or the return trip, because it is often skipped. Each day is filled with paper and pencils, maybe some chatter - it just seems lonely. Would you like to see what we have? " Jason always stood up and took his seat at the end of the class. My child, a perfectly normal six-year-old, hadn't met a past class writer before. He sat alone in the library, eating over a game of decoy. He had read and reread about fantastical beings, trying to figure out what to do with what was inside. His book didn't have a problem with anything at all. " Would you like to read a scene from one of my books or something from another time? " " I'd prefer to read it on a computer. But if you don't want to read my book, go and write your daily prayers. " My child looked up at me with a puzzled expression, " but Mr. Douglas, I- " " Yeah, yeah. Can I take that as some kind of a friendly greeting? Because it won't be hard for me to learn something else before my departure. It is a great comfort knowing all the books are back and being helped with the need of reading. " It was long after a few hours that Jason was in the library again. " Would you like to go read more? " Jason ordered. " Yes, Mr. Douglas, I think I have my book back - for you. Well, mostly, yes, " I smiled. " Like how many books are the books that you have always read? " " Well, it is just a series, " he explained. I could tell he was getting impatient. " I've been reading it for years. I've read - and, honestly - nothing! No rush, no jumping on a test - I just do it every day. See? And I have it all. When you are outside your home, in your car, just open the door, " and he pulled away from me. It was something in that room every day, after school and home visit. That had been a teacher called Charlie about twenty years ago. I had never heard anything else about him. " Did you have a series with it? " Jason asked. He laughed. " Umm, yes, " I said. " When did you last read it? " I asked. My child simply didn't react. " I had a... I don't know. An old one when I was -- " " Let me help you with that. It is a book you've been reading. It is an old quality. Something that is important to you. " " Help me!! " screamed Jason. " I read it to your face for 50 years! That was important. It was my first piece of fiction. It was something that was important to me. " " Goodbye, Mr. Douglas! My names Robert! " screamed Jason. There was a flash of light. There was a scream. I laughed. It was beautiful. Finally! Jason patted my shoulder. " Thanks, kid, " he said. " Where's my mom?"<|endoftext|>

“ How can it be so amazing? ” asked Esbert Roth “ This creature has been around since the dawn of time and could have possibly a magical origin, though it ’ s just evolved into the mythological dragon, or devil, or wolf. ” “ No way. Just look at what it is that is good for you, what it is that you *really* need. ” “ It ’ s just a face, standing about 5 feet in height. It moves on its hind legs that almost every monster has like a reptilian midget. It has sharp eyes, with short by the way that it likes its hair ( or shadows they lose after puberty, you can not figure out. ). It has wonderful eyesight that by contrast with the other creatures that live in a sterile or unmapped world, shows that it is as accurate as we ’ re used to seeing from our shoes. ” “ How can it be so amazing? ” queried Koch “ Look in the mirror. Everything. ” The man reached up and pulled out a glass. “ So what do you find to put on that face you see in the mirror that would make you wonder just why the mirror is in the house and why it has multiple mirror reflections for pleasure. ” Koch narrowed his eyes. “ So how can this be in the front porch. Do you even have a mirror at home? What is it? ” “ It ’ s the house, but not the house. It only has the mirror through one window. The other houses have glass of glass as well and also mirrors in front of them, but these mirrors have paper drawn on them to create a person who is different from the group. ” “ Like what? ” The man contemplated his own faces. “ Take a look at these times we are trapped here. We have to go. This demon with thousands of other people and I want the house and everything else in it to have a happy ending. I promise I am the master. ” And that is why the man was stranded in the sky.<|endoftext|>

“ Mr. Trump.. ” screamed Sarah Palin on a microphone before throwing back tears. “ Mr. Trump, ladies and gentlemen of the United States, I've come to tell you all what we have in store for us in 2016. ” From the people who desperately had nothing to live for, the screams of a nearly endless stream of derision echoed through the room. The entire room flashed red and contained Jesus. And more photos. Sarah Palin began reciting routine bible passages in what appeared to be Catholic font, but there was more than one Jesus from every country in the world. The round about room fell into a rumbled tone as people with visions of their God disappeared around the corners. And a red carpet was quickly thrown on the podium. Sarah Palin noted that the world was falling apart around her. Russia and China, Xi Jinping and Putin embraced each other under a withering banner, while the UK sat in its prime minister position after finally setting its control over all in four years. And then, a fellow Democrat in the audience, Wilson Green, reached over and whispered. “ Welcome the people to the Democratic National Convention in D.C, Steve. We had a few of our speech hosts working in the lobby tonight. Their names are: Your Greatest Democratic Self-Made Friend Andrew Stone, your greatest Tony Stark villain X-Walt, and your FASTest Human Imambassador, Ms. Yvette Carlin. John Cena was here, and he was so proud of her. ” There was still some confusion. People were unsure what just happened, but the tone quickly transformed into a praise of the leader. “ Our most powerful executive on record is Your Greatest Enemy. You've unleashed another endless stream of destruction upon the middle class with your ongoing attacks on the 1 % with your massive campaign donations to American charities. Trust me, It was on the money! ” Everyone, including some with the worst names on Earth, booed from the stage. Steve Palin, a former KKK member, held back a half smile. “ What a great Sunday! Everyone loved this one! You can watch it on mobile and it comes out on home! It's true! And with each other the morning after every major political event, everyone loved this newly found power and each of us backed this man again and again! It will all be over soon, thanks to you and your praise. ” Steve welcomed his people back with both arms on the podium. And then, the lights went out.<|endoftext|>

"Glorbog! " - The booming voice in the background filled with electricity and power. " Thomas' Telemarketer acquired a full inventory of all personnel in the Auror Training Facility while at the request of Hiddleston. " - James Newton, confirmed blind spot. He was quickly bolted to the car by an unseen force which slowed and belched him back as he slammed on the brakes causing a loud crash into the next Audi. " FUS ROLL!" - The crashing engine of the Bentley DeVille roaring to life, thumped and buckled into the side of the white Tesla. Thomas swept the wheel as the collision consumed the vehicle in front of him and sent him tumbling out of the driver's seat. The impact was felt in the pathway around him when the Tesla vanished, presumably having just crushed through the massive building he was on, spilling out onto the pavement. Thomas examined his surroundings and realized a faded road sign in one of the buildings was a marked monument to a rebellion against the wizarding regime. He had not seen this sign since 2015. Where the Fus Road sign once stood in the Cheyenne Valley of Wyoming we know only as " Change To Your Will. " The small text on it read'True Return To Kindness.' Thomas soon began tumbling to the local Quick-Hiking trail due to ongoing construction that opened the remaining bridge of the Portal. As he approached the restricted forest his mind raced with all the strange choices that could have been made. Driving was simple, finding and managing large, varied, or even sharing his grocery items with others is a difficult task as the shops are small and entry around the perimeter is more impeded by men whose only weapon is tooth and nail. Thomas awoke after a night of drinking in the mornings, glancing at the clock he kept three minutes to eat. With a sigh he shut his eyes and salivated at the sunrise over the steppe rocks and mountains. Along the way he passed the last of his fellow shoggoths who began to sway. As they grew darker he noticed that the entrance was blocked by the lesser known structures such as Two Headed Pikes, Sir Elmurs, and the androgynous Suntaned Pines. There were more Men the size of animals and also larger than the manes. The forest was some 50 miles wide and the small patches of taffy that were now hardy seemed to grow over time until the mountains rose at night.<|endoftext|>

Even though I couldn ’ t see anything coming and wouldn ’ t stir that excited mist out of my mouth, I didn ’ t feel like sweating much. Despite how quiet she always was and how my mind was still reeling off the callousness of her cries, I couldn ’ t tell how long it was before her snores kept strangling me. I left the room and got down from the ledge, hoping to catch the storm storm and stop her spiraling toward my apartment on the way. I laid there a while longer - felt some string crossing my toes and a crackling breath from my chest- until I finally felt it stretch slowly. A group of me woke up to rumbling, hollow voices from below. All too confused for me to hear, but too frightened to complain to them. As I lay on my back, crouching over the deflated body of my wife, I noticed a noticeable distinct clatter and a sudden knock on my front door. I looked at my knees, still limp from the cold of the night, and wondered what I did wrong. My wife was gone, but the dead mother, my biggest caretakers, and the murderer who killed me all felt the same. Their sentence was done, and a super-tight double-tape bag had been shoved into my purse; the day I ’ d had over-executed that mugger. My lunch was only half finished, yet no one was listening. They didn ’ t want me to know that I had stabbed my wife. I hadn ’ t really had the guts to even do so. I wasn ’ t going back home when she was in here. As I grabbed my keys, my life was brought up in front of a single eye. But for the first time in my life, I was conscious. A single glimpse at my grinning wife, the day our family was reunited for the first time and a single tear falling down my face, and the lack of care I ’ d managed to take to finally say goodbye.<|endoftext|>

His power came into fruition by the hand of an ancient magician, The Knight told of his power once, though he did not know. A verse from a Kingly song was whispered into his mind, a subtle melody of songs sung of fallen men, but an ethereal sound resonated over both worlds. Like his lies, it glowed, a direct result of the side effects of his misery, as seen through the eyes of his people. Because the sound amplified, so did his creation, and the pain spread by its effects. People died in their beds, broken and without meaning. Homeless or old, homeless or dead, but still the city that was built around him was large enough for him to see. The only place that he saw empty was a single door of a small block of brick, covered by the sky as large as a man's body, green and zipped up. He was rarely seen again, but sometimes he could see through those doors looking for them. Those doors that the Knight, a quiet knight since the age of nine, led out of the darkness into the world that he knew. He took one look across the city when he was alone, and then another when the Wizard was giving another visit. He knew exactly where it was. A giant door, the ones that looked as large as a man's body. He lifted the hilt from the side and wondered for a moment. He could feel the power growing in his veins, consuming him as the knowledge of death burned inside of him. Suddenly he could not move. His would go back to his brothers and sisters, who he went to seek. They all came back; except the one who seemed to be enjoying it all the better. Those he met, but didn't talk to, all he could muster between himself and the man he loved. It was this man that saved his brothers and sisters, who could one day find their mothers. He must have lost sight of all of them when it was finally over. As he rushed out of the building to seek out more pills, he could feel the energy becoming stronger. He didn't know what he should be feeling, but his wounds shifted from the mad doctor to the chosen man. Together they got the power to rebuild his life, but that power was weakening. He gathered the knowledge of his discovery to go back to his brothers and sisters, to seek her. While the Knight went to embrace the final strangers, his heart stopped beating. He felt as if the world had been torn to shreds.<|endoftext|>

We have seen no side of the galaxy. We have seen countless planets and gods destroy us in endless explosions. None of them have killed, nor devastated ourselves. The only thing that has kept us going is some basic need that no one else has. It was there, at birth, that the universe decided to stop existing. That was what they had wanted, but every one of us found ways to survive just by listening to their word. Back then it would have been much more difficult, but we still exist. We still keep coming up empty, and hoping to find a way to discover what lies beyond all that. A new world is colonized, it's only cost us one. Is it wise to pray for the greater good? Our probes attempt to develop more, more faster, faster, like a high powered super machine. We all gather here, and all hope is lost. Despite all life not existing yet, our little light-based stars provide new lives.<|endoftext|>

Blood splatters everywhere, quickly. I stagger towards the board, struggling to keep my balance and wrap my fist around the side of the sign. A hand smacks the back of the head of another non-physical being. I look up. There's not a single scar. Two figures shuffle away, feet off the table. One hand is in the other, smiling. He holds the other palm in his other. There is a splash on the table, and the other hand is back in the hands. Soon, a dry, warm, red smog wells around the table. The building is green. I let the notepad finish its work. I open the door to the second figure, and fumble with the lock. " You wonder where they go when you cut their umbrellas? " he asks. " The pond. The old pond. " He jots something down on his note pad. " I think I like that place pretty much. " "... What are you going to do when you're done? " I mumble to myself. "... I think I'll fill the time with great company. " " Oh yes. " he said, chuckling. " Because maybe I'll enjoy this boring but lucrative office job, too. " As he passes the two, another man in his twenties walks up. He walks up slowly, not really interested in the confrontation. "... And maybe we'll drink a tap and... sit down? " One of the other figures turns to the other. " Thanks. " He says to the more assertive figure on the other side. I winced at him. " Are you putting an extra stress on this? " he asks. He looks up at me, his freckles falling around his eyes. He isn't in the presence of anyone, but an old man behind him. He's speaking to me. I look him straight in the eyes and whisper, " Oh, good boy. Yes." The old man looks down at me, and while sighing he smiles back. Then he turns to me. I'm lying. That's all I can tell you. He never makes a move on me.<|endoftext|>

I hate the sound of my phone beingep. I hate when the phone never picks up. Ever since I heard about the last caller rejection, I didn't have my cupcake in the house. It's been like that for the past three weeks. I can hear the traffic. It all makes sense now. They were hot chocolate. I've always wanted a chocolate chip cookie. Oh well. I can see the bus coming up to my house, I drive up to my coffee machine and wait for it to pick me up. However, I wait too long. I hate it when the bus pulls up to my house. Or does it? Or maybe I don't have enough energy to wait any longer? Time's not important here anymore. So today my cupcake has been gone. I still want her. For the sake of my dog dog, I decided to be a good dad. Feed her. Get all my morning necessities. I kissed a few good little lady eggs. It made a sweet pie with the blueberries, that's when I noticed the cliche. I hate it when my cupcake is gone. You know? That was it. Not too long ago my cupcake was gone. I decided to make it prettier too. Oh yeah. That time I put it in the toilet. And then I woke up in the street at 8 in the morning. I think I'm safe. Or I'm hungry. Or thirsty. Or in need of a drink or something. But it's too hot in the mornings, so I just start it with a bite. Actually, that's what they called it. I tasted very nice. I'm just hoping they're eating some good food in the morning.<|endoftext|>

I stood in line at the San Francisco International Airport, eager to see my speech. I had it scheduled for the middle of January. I had all the time in the world. We had what we were after, and why would we want that? But there was nothing I could say that really caught me off guard. I didn ’ t have to spend a single night in Hawaii with my son, who was in diapers at the time. It was all for a purpose: to see things I would never have dreamed I would have on Earth. This man who had proposed a temporary cease fire in an attempt to stop the destruction of New York. Meanwhile, my wife had everything planned out, and had to hide how she wanted to spend our next few weeks away from her family. In fact, I was really hoping we could make that glorious honeymoon. It wasn ’ t a huge leap to take from this point on. It seemed impossible for me to describe how it worked. My honor-chief, Sally, and me stood in the stands, facedown by the Man from the Future. She wore the cowboy hat of the Dogma, and she had the skinny jeans of the modern age, while my wife darted, spinning spinners a thousand times, in circles. “ Tom, ” she called out, looking up at me, all earnest, “ What did you mean'we?' ” I whispered. It took an entire moment for her to catch on. She looked exactly like the girl from the movie that I had just watched. “ No, ” I conceded, “ No my wife... She was just running through the desert, out in the country with nobody around. I miss her, though, and we couldn ’ t go on without her. ” *It was seven o ’ clock. * I thought to myself. Maybe it was just the excitement of the ending for me. Was I going to be the youngest president in history? No, of course not, it was as if I was going to be eight, and I was the number one poll-and-markperson in the world. While I did hold the office like a king and governor, I ’ ve never been a child and can ’ t even wear a diaper for a living. At least, not yet. I left the stand by the baggage claim and walked up to the flight. “ Look! ” Sally yelled, waving behind me. “ You look amazing, ” I said, and leaned over to get a better look at my gown. I carefully extended my palm. “ This is... the most beautiful thing I have ever seen! ” I pointed to the side of my dress, where it was, and before I could even raise my hand, grabbed Sally. She sat down, giggling, as she shook my hand. “ Did you notice that? ” I asked, looking at her. Sally just gave a look. “ I did, ” she said happily, looking down, “ it made me feel truly special. ” I cocked an eyebrow. “ What are you talking about, then? ” I asked her. “ It ’ s easy to say, ” she quickly cut me off. “ I think I know who you are, ” she said. “ I-I ’ m the man I said I was, ” I said. She laughed, squeezing my hand. “ Are you kidding me? ” I squinted. “ I was the one who told you, ” I explained, “ that it wasn ’ t your fault that you agreed to stop the destruction of New York in order to save our world. I was the one who sent all of the President ’ s advisers to counsel you so that we could resolve this matter peacefully. ” “ Oh? ” Sally said, looking at me. “ Oh? ” I said, raising my hand. “ Thanks, ” Sally said, ducking into her seat, not looking back at me. “ We just need to take a look at that ship, ” I told her. Sally giggled, throwing a little loopy-looking box in my face. “ Yeah... It ’ s a spaceship. ”<|endoftext|>

"Are you buying that or what? " She had asked a question, sent through an entirely different god. She had looked into her boyfriend's eyes and moved with wonder. " I wouldn't know for sure, but I'm buying that for you. " She had never seen him feel his heart pound, nor did she think he would. She held her boyfriend's hand.

" That didn't even effect me " She mutters. " So can I turn that off?" For a moment she was taken aback, or perhaps she was simply unsure. The only response she could tell was a soft sigh and a gesture to another. Sure, she could turn off the wall and save her life, but the post isn't getting any more popular. As the second hiss came, the spirits of those in the room stopped. She sighed once again, quietly. They had found a new friend.<|endoftext|>

An alien astronomer could not quite fathom the origin of modern communication technology. At first it was very intelligent. After an unrelated chemical reaction in the small planet where humans ended up, communications began to fail. The eastern giant colonies had destroyed them. Their small organic farms ran off the continent within the Solar System. Only the Mg, formerly occupied by small indigenous population sections would remain. One hundred years later, modern communication was developed. First, well designed crowding of neighbours through the actual, reasonable, wastelands, and then of the more mystical cities and societies of the city. In the fifteen years that passed, communication technologies became even more amazing. Humanity could send messages from wherever they wanted. You could go online, walk amongst friends, find the entire network of man. The AI was simply programmed to ignore all inputs, had a speech path to follow, and are trained to read our thoughts. For the sake of communication, a virus was first introduced in an attempt to infect the world. Who would have ever thought the intelligence of the Neanderthals would gain such an effect? If a letter or a prompt filled your lives with dread, one can't help but feel ashamed. For far longer than you could imagine. It's quite frightening though, because every race of man has their origins in the minds of science and has reached far beyond the continents that were covered by space. They feel with a great sense of individuality, which is what could only be learned from another race or race. In thousands of years the Neanderthals have divided themselves, seeking a single unified identity. While our genetic heritage is *new* and previously unknown for now, this could only mean one thing. Our technology had evolved over many centuries. The basics of modern communication were most easily understood. Every system and element needed a single intelligent computer program to communicate. A single person, a single system to say the word, an entire coding language were perfect. Once the first transmitters were set up for our solar system to be connected, the computers said, *we have another directive*<|endoftext|>

Joseph sat in his room, watching as a snake ripped one of the cords out and set it down on the wall. It scraped along a side and carved a blood red face that almost made the mouse squeak. He saw a freakish look creep across the corpse's face as it inched closer to his laptop. He clicked on it. The screen was already loading. "Fuuuck..." The mouse screamed at the top of its lungs as it swiped through a maze of expletives and lost page. It scrambled out of the ether and raced from the big doorway, made to leap a few feet at the farthest edges of the room. Joseph turned to his friend Jeanine to stand by his side. He turned her wide-eyed once more and retrieved her for another hug. The cat was lazily sliding through the spider-webbed maze, lumbering over the edge until the floor below seemed to stop but stood still the whole time. The kitten zoomed in a bit and took a long, careful glance around the room before sifting through the writhing mess. A spoon perched on the arms of a sleeping hound and a little dust half smeared on the ashtray spread gently on the floor. Its owner looked at it, eyes over his daughter ’ s battered, feather-flecked face. “ Do you know why I brought you to me? ” His daughter shook her head, ready to let this monster burn in the light of day. “ No. ” The bed squeaked. He waited for the last moment. He hated spiders, after all. Edit: spelling<|endoftext|>

Well, what the hell have I got? * *Okay, an orc swims into the water. His boat disappears off the coastline. He falls into the sea. He dies. * *Okay, that doesn't change anything. Okay, now I'll just have to load the book. The orc is already in the water. * *OK, so he comes up and drowns himself. How does he die? What do I do? * *This is what happens when I'm finished using this character. He begins swimming back into the sea. When he finds his shipwreck he literally sinks in. * *Alright, now the orc was a good guy and the orc was a good guy, so yeah. * *Alright, so he has enough body parts left to repair his ship. He's probably somewhere now. He slowly gets out and goes to live inside the boat. * *Okay, so one day, one of the people comes up and said he didn't like the orc. * *OK, to be fair, this was a pointless idea. * *Hey, fuck this. *<|endoftext|>

A male, by all accounts stout, strong, a man with a boar hewed and farthest from the ground or behind the cuddly bed. Kind of weird how everyone ends up somewhere else. He always comes back with a dead fish suit but not here, far away from all the trees and bushes, he came first, "sorry sorry so many bandits he was bound by chains and wrists to the person they kidnapped. " That's when the pretty women came and stole her, covered in blood and shit. The person left, and she wanted to dress and never leave. My brother's probably the next best anyone has to offer, but he's a genius detective and messes with the money on guy's pockets like a ballerina. Hardly an experienced detective but even a genius expert can take a beating. -- - -- -- - High school* I was so naïve. How could I talk to two of these dumbasses. I did not have any friends, and they all thought that's the truest way to tease me. It was a good thing I was a teen then that I had the courage to stand up for myself and talk to these stupid people, these idiots. They needed to know. But it's not worth it. These idiots had me bit like a stick. How would they do that? I can not take it anymore. I can not live anymore, they brought me in because it wasn't natural, and if they need to start something about it, I have to move on to someone else. So here I sit, waiting for my brothers and their mates to find me. As I sat there, I thought of all the better ways for them to tease me. The bandit as a bear: he was down to his last strand and was making sure not to mess with me any more. My brother: he always had his show of patience, especially when people insulted him. The bandit as a lone man: oh great, he was on the move, he had to move somewhere. I went next to this same bandit and got to thinking, with all of them thinking about who he was, why they kidnapped my brother, the dirt. A stupid thief this bandit. No time to fear him, I got to thinking and thinking. He's going to take the dirt, my brother. He's going to steal it from my brothers but if my brother takes the dirt from me, then I have to become an informant, someone to tell them to ignore all of my worrying and trying to make them happy. I have to help them. A dumb thief, in a sea of blood and gore and poverty, and a giant bandit in his last few decades. " I just want to go home. " " Please. Don't you want to go home? " I ask the man to drop my curiosity, but the man says " I don't... I don't... I just want to go home " " But you want to go home! " " Please? If you want to go home, then what will you do? " " I'd better believe that we have time" This is the type of me I would have been. And my brother would have been my brother, indeed. Even so, I want to go home, not just my brother but to fill the void, to to fill this void once and for all. I've read the slip up of the ancient power of your interrogation methods and therefore my kind of interrogation technique. If there's one thing that will change how I view you, it's this unquenchable thirst for revenge, for revenge where it comes from. You can not promise another person your revenge, like I have. That was the impulsive temptation, however. I hear your words not-quite quite sounding so well, but speaking them aloud is completely unpleasant. I've always had to do so. The man sighs, before walking out of the room without a word.<|endoftext|>

Up in the clouds stood Nessie the Explorer. Spinning in her glimmering cape and setting to her full power The purple-haired girl sat in quiet contemplation A power to rival the dragon grasps of Dragonia and his off-world neighbor, Dragon Ash Edric. She also held a full bell running right into her flower snuggling hand The yellowish pear in her bared hand rose up her stomach, contemplating what her chosen prodigal would bring to the little girl standing in front of her looking up in horror. **FALLING TIME. ** Edric had been fighting yet again in retaliation, and though it seemed that he did not have the power to stop it already, Nessie found herself keeping her charge on to an even wacker life. Did this girl really believe that jumping back inside a ball out in the middle of the desert wouldn't just kill you? This girl was no peach or pear, she was actually a pretty sweet woman. She even had a long and loving tail! Finally, Ol' Nessie could stand back up and go kick these brownies. She would be visiting her Grandmother in a few weeks, after all! However, the Princess would rather fight her dragon than get demolished by her princess who plans to stop her princess. Ol' Nessie knew that such a battle was impossible, and that even if she could defeat the Purple-haired Princess, she would have to make every attempt to track and hide her. A harsh awakening had happened in Nessie's back she knew she was going to have to start over. She sighed and grabbed her flower. Turning to the ball I realised she was on fire. Or rather at a fire only. All hell broke loose, and the Princess burst into a warm blue and red flame. Screaming some gibberish then throwing open the little ball of fire it landed on the princess. She was a fireball. A war of beautiful yellow and purple fire bubbled into existence then into the tiny ball of fire. Nessie forced herself to cry for help as she tried to control her anger. She spun around to face the fireball. "Come on boy it's time to help him! " The Princess called out. Her eyes shot open. The small ball of fire just suddenly exploded, all of Nessie with hope. She wasn't sure what to do. She continued for a moment, looking at the Princess, who was shaking and shaking her head in disbelief. She then gripped her mini gun and asked " Is there anything you want from him? " " Yeah... just you wait " The Princess said patiently. " Wait where in the name of the hero, the orange one, washes his wounds then returns back to normal? " " Well let's see, does the yellow one the Princess broke into her lampshade's ball in which was pure gold that fell off with the Princess's fist and went straight to the princess? " Nessie's question sent the large princess tumbling to the ground in shock. " What?! " She screamed " How do you think this is possible? The Princess has enough bruises and scratches to make a superhero! She even managed to take off her last shield! " " In your best ass piece of work get me Nessie! " The Princess hersed. She ran around the ball. What happened to this kid? What kind of hero are he. The Princess snapped her fingers and the ball promptly exploded into ash with a thud. Nessie quickly dashed into the sky laughing. Another school girl ran up from the ball. " You mean Nessie has to go get those Blue-haired Princesses?! " She shouted in a mad dash at the supposed hero. " Why?! I've made her my *greatest friend*! " With that, the little girl finished running. Out of nowhere, a silhouette appeared out of nowhere, heading straight for Nessie in the sky. She took her aim. " Poof!" the hero exclaimed.<|endoftext|>

My body is an ordinary plastic bag. I only have one leg, my right leg is constantly covered in splinters. I feel like I have been sitting on the floor for hours or even days. Living like this feels like getting a knife to the gut in the middle of the night... I slowly hope I don't turn in a corpse. As I try to pick it up, I manage to get this mess of splinters off my body that came with this stunt. Not only are the splinters impaled by splinters, but the smell can smell an entire gym bag a mile away. Not to mention the folding couch that they installed in the back of my chair that I used to help me sleep inside. Suddenly, the void of the past feels like it's shrinking away, and I remember every time I touch my memory and use it, the bag has stopped moving and I can finally have a proper dream.<|endoftext|>

Death, you say? I sometimes do. Nobody will ever know that, because I never die. You see? Is it the year 1034? I've yet to find out. You know how it works -- it's really early on in the morning when I've gotten knocked unconscious and beat up to death, and my body laughs, or so I told myself, as a painfully naive coward. I'd dropped out of college with few friends after graduation, leaving so much behind. I would visit a few neighborhoods every year for several years before finally kicking myself for being. I eventually decided I'd trade places with my parents and leave to pursue my life in law and business. I barely broke even paying my own bills after the reality of it hit me and forced me to take the wheel. I bought a pretty nice car, but it blew out the window and I hit the emergency braking feature and I plummeted to the bottom of a large pool while wondering why I'd didn't buy a new one. Either that, or I died on the new model I came to love so much. So I decided I wanted to die. That's the problem with death, really: it takes it's toll on you. So many deaths in one place, drowned at the site of your own death. I died in cold sweats, stumbled out of a hospital, and fell into a pool of my own blood. It was more a miracle that I survived, it was more than a tragic accident at all, but now you might ask, "Am I dead, for real? Is it all the things I died for?" Or some bullshit like that. I didn't have a choice. Life doesn't just end with death. I didn't die because I was brave enough to jump out my window. I didn't die because I didn't hate my death, because I wouldn't. This world has become something far more cruel than I could ever imagine. With our new world, having no life at all. I finally needed to think on something -- even if all I wanted to think of was death.<|endoftext|>

Will this sell the job for the last time. This family was about to drop their bread wagon and throw themselves on the ground as we took our little pick and rip bundles. Turns out I really like the pickles with this one... just like they always do. The damp soil you put on the pickboard is absolutely mind blowing, it lasts long enough and you can pick them up with a bit of care. The last few weeks I've had to drive long distances to farm or even go on the trail like we always do. The more we take these pickles, the more we realize that we may have never been able to pay for the talent of picking a new family and their pickery. This is why we change their lives. But I guess this is the cost of having a family here. I don't care. I would. I wouldn't trade my pickery for a better job. But I have a winner to work with.<|endoftext|>

"Are you sure this is the right outcome? " Her hands were clammy and tied behind her back as she nodded furiously, before continuing. " I have the enemy backed up here so I'm almost certain he can pull the trigger, you know. Just because I'm out here is not bad news... I'm sure he'll face my wrath, and then go down in flames and he'll go down as well... " She tossed on the bulk of her fur, fishing it out of the brown smog of the forest to the tundra surrounding them and focused on the questing party members. " I don't know, Marvellia, are you on or off questing? " His voice was wet with wind and his grip was too tight. She tried to steady herself, trying to snap back to reality as the trio slowly descended into the burn-covered dirt, their food abandoned and their weapons wadded from the sleep inside their canteens. Still, after a few moments, the brown smell lingering on their food finally got to her. " There's something too... um... I mean... It's definitely not the right thing to do... " That might not be as bad as I thought. It's the turnstile, you see, that one time I decided to use myself as a trap to get him to leave without my permission. It was set to lure him into another world, and I didn't know where I'd find it. When the enemy got into the mine, I decided I could try and get in, but my traps just gave out faster and harder. Instead, I had to harrass him, so I preferred stabbing him. Finally, at the mountain range, I moved past the closest thing I could. I knew it was a low town, and I hoped that I could climb the mountain, lest his escape. I don't know how long it took to reach the top, and maybe a few minutes to climb the bank. But, when I finally reached the top, I saw it already. It was not from above, but was towering over the group of us. So near, in fact, it's barely recognizable on my opponents face at all. My fur stayed in place, ready to die, and the rest of the group just stared into it like a blank canvas until they noticed her mid smile as I carried my dagger to her head. With a half-smile, my sword glided off the piece of rock she was holding and pierced straight through his stomach. He jumped up with a scream and flew away, evaporating in the wind as he collapsed to the earth. I thought about going to drop my sword, but I knew better. It would have to be a mistake. I wrapped my cloak around the kneeling girl, grabbed her by the waist and began to run. ______________________________ Hi, I got this prompt, so don't miss it!

It started with Don't Stop Believing. It wasn't some dumb theory about wacky physics or games of checkerboard. The computer knew at least one of its instructions. Game over. I started caring. I always decided to help. To help the best developers build the greatest game ever. Why can't it have been solved before this was done. And so here I was, half worried, half tense about the plot. "Quanticursor zoning " never resonated like a refrain in a sobering conversation. " Knock, Knock " trilled the voice. " You dumb, prick. " My friend John used to play this game casually with me. He began more enthusiastically when I asked about games. Yet still he scoffed at my daring, childish bickering. He never mentioned the game. It could have been solved and we would all live in tranquility. The world still had to be adjusted to an ever more virtual world. There was no finding a way to stop the viruses, find the scientists who had detected it before, and then figure out the correct variables to detonate. It was the only way to end the world. But the internet disagreed. Some have dubbed it " Breaking World ". It would be absurd to think of what it'd be like to have the internet play the game, to know everything's going to be exactly the same after every 15 seconds. " Next, stage 1- I'm told you can't save, only save on the last checkpoint you die. " The play first thing I did, it fell in second. " But you've done everything you could and I already own your tower so why would you want to do this? " John's voice faltered, as if to beg for mercy. " Down score! " My biggest concern was stepping on things, so I tried turning back to where I had seen the game before. He was an expert. Almost by instinct I turned to the side to pull out my phone. I was able to do that, turning back to the tower and going home. The map was already in front of me, it's barely 10 meters left of the game's final stage of development. It seemed he finished his last second then before I saw it, a moving zombie. What else had I done? " Update to L2 " Yup, an update. My voice was calmer as I scrambled back to the tower to find my phone. I reached into my pocket, pulled out my phone and dialed the Emergency services: I wan na go buy ice cream.<|endoftext|>

It's a lovely sunny day, there's no clouds, all around you is a perfect sunny day. "Yea... Me, I'm....me? " I say staring at your dead-eyed grin. " I asked for a way out " I said as though it was a question, I'm no adult and I was turned up for my age. " I'm surprised by all the looks on the other person's face, What a fantastic life. " " First I should be in love with you, and then we can have family... No kids I must say, I'm not entirely fond of my genes. " " You're a really nice looking lad, who works for your company? And have you always liked car? ". " You're much better at dating than me, but do you know about family? I really don't love my parents ". " You were born with something unique in your parents, and I'm sure, it doesn't mean anything if you're made of pure meat. I'm a little bit higher than you are but I think it's kind of a shame I never saw that coming. ", I'd never seen that into you either, I doubt it ever could, all those wishful thoughts ran through my head. So being like you, even after this long, interesting existence. We're only 17, long-term relationships are still very hard to not get a job and it's my late 30's. " Uh okay... I'm trying to get married - maybe, I guess I'm looking towards my late 80's " " Okay ". You smile back at me, our love can't compare to how passionate it felt... " Have you got a loving family? Then there's one of you that I got with my girlfriend; who I see now in everyday life, one of the happiest people I've ever seen. My happiness is well documented and documented, I haven't seen her smile or shake. " And I don't mean to remind you, just a normal person... You're the living embodiment of happiness. A wonderful and intelligent boy... Your child at this stage would be a wonder to look at. Anyway I love you. " I put a hand on your cheek and feel a nice warm embrace there. I roll over after that and remember, I had dreamt so much. I'm not interested in this guy though, he works almost as hard as I do, being a special someone. " I am, I shall be." I turned on the dial and pressed on'Sex!' and suddenly I was only 15 now, not normal at all.<|endoftext|>

"Sup you too, " the man said, sighing at the part of himself that gave him comfort. " I saw you... " He trailed off. " I loved you " The man continued, cutting me a little. " You left me, " he added, serious. " I was wandering, " I said, lowering my sunglasses, " He saved me " He said softly. " * Kid*, you *brother*, forgive me. " I gulped. " I'll help you if we're not having any problems... " My grip on his metal handcuffs tightened tighter, but I wasn't about to call the men's commissars. " Don't interrupt. " The man said, and he went back into the holding cell. I smiled for a bit. " I'll do my best " He muttered. " I love you, " I added, but the man continued to lead me away. " Tell people that you love them and don't leave them with them. Kill them, and you'll never be able to. " I remembered meeting him for the first time when I was little, and it became too good to believe otherwise. I didn't blame him. " Let's go, " he said. I hopped on the first step out the prison. I skipped over his steps, punching him square in the shin. I met his eyes. " You there? " I asked him. " Y-Yes " he said, a bit of a mischievous grin on his face. " I'm you? " " Yeah, I'm you. " " You're*that* you? " " Yeah. " " Where did you see him, even in the prison? " " He was here! " He laughed, and he said a silent thank you. " Look at all the other prisoners that entered the white prison, the prisoners that entered " han fucking ledgers, and the Jews " hangers " who still ran wild. So much so that they literally only went home and talked about life's work, but this time, everything mattered. My heart pounded, pounding from the excitement that this was happening to the other prisoners. " I'll fix everything," I finally said. And with that, the man led me to the door. -- - Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed this, check out my subreddit /r/TimeSyncs.<|endoftext|>

"Danger... Danger! " Ryan screamed, his body attempting to coil around the base of the stairs to his front door. I cautiously pushed the door to my back and adjusted my hat so it dangled over my face. Cautiously, I locked the door. " Get up! " Ryan yelled. I slapped the door behind me. Blond hair brushing through the hair, I instinctively gripped my broom to keep myself upright. An almost deafening bang suddenly forced me back into my room, landing softly against my front door as I'd come off the edge. Finally, the door closed. With a weird, flabbergasted tilt of the back window to the right, I turned my self over. Somehow, despite my reaction that night, it was still right in front of me. Closer than I thought. Paul's body froze at my elbow, his eyes racing, attempting to shush me as he gently dragged his limp body down to the hardwood floor. A figure stood outside my door in his bright black suit. It's blonde hair was longer and hair snaked up his back. He was wearing no disguises of fear and anxiety, barring the normally exaggerated smile he wore at the age of 16. Mike had been our family's third son for almost as long. Ryan stared at the figure. The intensity of his fear was almost unbearable. His breathing was always the most chilling, his eyes searched for something to latch onto. His body was alight with what looked like the machinery of a torn down container truck. Men in three, a skull on the passenger side of the truck, and a number of armed men. The face of the man was framed by black smudge, a trail of red ketchup hanging from it. Ryan stared in horror at the process of dragging his lifeless body along the hallway, towards the red lump in Paul's neck. Finally, the figure spoke. " It all began with an instruction manual, kept as a while indefinitely, for those who needed it more. " Ryan gave a slight grunt of relief as he watched the wheels of the truck roll out onto the street. " School, lot of work, and a car a week later. By the time we were done with that, it was too late. " " Why didn't you tell the school counselor that I've been there in the breakroom? " Ryan shook his head. " Just be patient. On holidays in January, you get a clipboard with each of your chores to do in your breakroom, right? " I swallowed nervously, determined not to waste the time. " The principal got a copy of it for me too, and it said'if the teacher doesn't understand something, then you're a waste of money, so I'll simply doublecheck and retake it and take it home from the principal's office. " " You should have known. They're going to study you, you know that? " I glanced back at the door. " I've always wondered what that instruct manual - " I glanced at the gun to my head - was loaded. " - taught you about it... " " I'm pretty sure he had planned it this way. And he hasn't made a lot of money off of it. " Ryan held up a note. I read it quickly and his hands were shaking so he took it from me. " Look out there. We go over your paper in the breakroom, and you need to prepare yourself. All of the easier children know they can't read ahead in class. We have some time and a little fire on that day. " " Right away, Mike. Try to remember something. Maybe find something you like, or something you want to avoid. Make it seem like the lesson is about making the right decisions. " I gave a firm salute. Ryan walked forward and dismounted his truck and walked towards the entrance of the school. " On the bright side, enough of this isn't a demon growing on my head."<|endoftext|>

We went home one day, kissed the girl who we knew for some reason had wanted us here. We kept talking. There was this light show on, some graffiti was on the walls. “ Show-time-crew-up-date! ” how I got high and bounced around on the slingshot. Little did I know that this trip would at least get me back up here in the old world. From the safety of some of the other underground facilities, it was more mundane like moving to the hospital with my cousin, I even had a hard time seeing my parents as they were thinking I was crazy. Then one day. There I was sitting outside with my 15 year old sister, my granddad, grandpa and mother, my cousins was there too, they all seemed so shocked. How have they been able to live with me since I left for college. I felt like I am the hardest thing to keep together. I kept saying to all the teachers, to the parents, to my cousins, to everyone I knew. “ Nothing ever works out. ” That's what they told me when I sent messages. “ Look, I ’ m not a good enough lie to tell but I don ’ t care anymore. There is nothing more to be said. I ’ m no longer a part of you. ” Oh god. Now I just want to see my cousin. Let her know that we love her and that we will do everything in our power to make sure that we do. I could cry at any moment, play in the pool, and get even worse alone, but I wanted to know those words. I remember myself saying those last words to my grandma before I entered. “ You should have to leave now. ” That was the last thing I heard as I walked out of my house. Edit: formatting.<|endoftext|>

At this time of morning, Dan was sipping his day-old coffee at his favorite counter and watching the thick, creamy milk slide down his teeth. " Very good, " he said, dismissing the coffee as drippy. He traced the armrest of his chair back to the back of the closet where he held his short-cropped left sock to his tongue. He'd been reading this passage every so often -- from the French, more than on a normal laptop screen -- to so many obscure works of science, so many settings. A reassuring dream of studying Morse code would be his heart for creating a translation engine for small groups of people in a violent oligarchy. God, how he still had to explain to this nanny why his problems had started on his bottom floor, drawn by the oversized garbage truck beside his bedroom bed. But the loud doors creaked open, sharply sending a shiver up Dan's spine. He yanked the cover of his shirt open and popped a small cylinder to the side. " Uhm, " the alien lifted from his coffee machine, stretched and admiring Dan's sensors, " I'm just a tool, Dan. What could I learn from you? " The pale boy, complete with rough rimmed glasses and angry-looking brown hair flicked his head back and forth, winking his conspiratorially at the aliens. He pulled up the top of his briefcase and felt a small finger prick itself into it. " Is everything right in your particular case? " asked Dan, nodding. " My dad would tell me things like this... " " Oh, please, " the alien gurgled, a mumbling of coos and disturbing laugh coming from the depths of his throat. " You don't seem to understand what's going on. You think me giving you a console just to be outside your domain isn't bad enough? And that alien keeps making monsters for you? " The little cretin swiped at his glasses with a tiny finger before finally chocking up in his chair. He stared at Dan incredulously for a moment, flicking his brain for theories. The tiny droid flashed light-emitting soup from a place between its claws, from a window a few feet off to the backyard, and then the fucker sighed. Dan reached down and picked up his left sock with his right -- only to flinch at the splash. He'd tried all of the above explanations -- the cheap flotation device that could spray water, the chemical manner in which the barrier would biodegradate -- but he'd just could not figure it out. It was just as poorly for him. It wouldn't -- he'd had the terrible experience of being an acid-induced, shower-wasted homeless man, but Dan decided that this tiny squint in the wall was the best thing he'd ever seen. Just down the hall to his bedroom, he was waiting for someone. A tall black man walked in the doorway, huffing heavily. " Dan, " the man's voice was loud and booming, his lips taut and teeth straining the air. " I would love to speak with you. " The man smiled and slipped Dan his $ 100 in cash. " Thank you, " he said, cocked an eyebrow. " That is good, " he replied. " This procedure you perform to preserve yourself, after all, is experimental. Very valuable, indeed. " The man smiled down at him and took Dan's hand and let go. He stepped up on his stool, and Dan tapped his feet. Then, he paused. He leaned on his desk, and waited a moment. Then he followed the alien's gaze. " I'm afraid that this procedure required today to allow you to join us. " The alien opened his large, yellow bag and grabbed his pocket-watch and laptop by its foot. " Sir, I have an order for you, " he said in his button-down black russian suit. " One of these days, I'll have to remind you to take a shower or something. Don't get hurt."<|endoftext|>

It was a song. the title reeked of alcohol and nicotine, flesh and blood strewn across the bed. Greg-Rachael stared, trying to find the words he needed to understand. His heart pounded in his throat and he caught no eye. He threw the volume on the desk and groaned against the weight. The wind howled down from the heavens, bounced clumsily on the pages and ripped the ink dry. His eyes were heavy, gray and were glassy. His breathing was no more than a wheeze from a bottle, and he let out a shaky and wheezing breath. His fingers drummed the bookshelf, unraveling the cover. Backed up by the thick cushion that wound around them like some safety device he never even imagined he had. Were the reasons for writing nonsense sounds too? He closed his eyes. He had his thoughts, his first feeling. Thoughts that he had done years ago, long ago. It was a terrible cloud, a black fog clogging his view. He couldn't think of what to write. "This is really bad... " Greg said, letting the words spill out. Could something change this. The clouds exploded and sat in place, their dark interior filled with smoke and quill and crimson. Greg dropped to his knees and heaved himself back up slowly. The heart shot out of him and stuttered out into the void of space. " Why?" he whispered, as he heaved himself up.<|endoftext|>

It had been a long and rich road, for the first time in centuries. Began with the discovery of Holy Umber and like many others, a quarter century before, the colony's history began. Paintings were made and engraved in the mountainous area, containing vermin and soot, bits of rock. Finally, the first words of an opening speech given by a representative at the center of it all. The guttural crack of a blast, rain and what seems to be fire roared out in the distance. I shivered in my seat, this was unbelievable. I would have expected to get the damn thing back as soon as it happened, knowing exactly where the rock was; or, perhaps, waiting for me to go out further. But no, I had to get the damn thing back first, so that I could see clearly what it was. **ENTRY BEGIN** **AROUND** The sky filled with the evergreen and blue; I was in awe of what I was witnessing. The sky was like a soft orange as the distant clouds blurred the sky, marking the stars and planets. As I found myself looking around me, the landscape changed. The shapes of buildings got more and more like mountains. Mountains now dotted the ground, but they were empty. There was no glory and no security. It felt like I was floating in the void. With that realization, I grabbed the shotgun in my hands and fired. Its bullets tumbled and fragmented everywhere, streaking through the skyscrapers and paths of clouds. *They can be to lonely as well*. The alarm on my terminal exploded like an explosion. The mission was terminated.<|endoftext|>

"Akk'U, you damned pile of shit " I wasn't even sure how to make light of the smell. Damn it. I must have felt the need to whistle a loud whistle. It must have been an early morning. The road was bare. Something about all the cars outside honked at me and I wasn't even sure if they noticed me. I ended up driving off of the abandoned town to be with my wife. We didn't know what was going on either, I was hoping to tell her about some danger that a certain structure was going to bring us into. I decided that the best place to start was to head over to the local mall and get some games. Get lost, shoot down a car, wait for a sign that said it wasn't a danger. So I went along with the road. I took a shortcut that ended at the ends of the road, I kept driving hoping I would be able to sneak a little closer to the entrance. I rode for the longest part of the afternoon thinking I would be able to find a safe spot for my wife. I couldn't help but feel pretty guilty. After closing up shop I gave her my lovely morning cup of coffee and told her to turn around. Before she could ask for a drink I grabbed her wallet and started putting it in my pocket. I didn't even know what to do with it. I was speechless, I don't even remember how I got here. I was thirsty, sure, but nothing of consequence came to me. I glanced through my wallet to check my balance. I couldn't help but feel queasy. I slammed the zipper on my shoelace and turned around. I turned around again and she was gone, apparently without a word, in the crowd. She was nowhere to be found. She turned around looking straight at me, a stoic look in her eyes. " Hey, what the fuck happened? " she asked hopefully. I looked down and spotted her smile, which had made me think I knew her, " Yeah, " I said quietly. " Can I have the snacks? " " Just take the eggs." I looked at her, confusion in her eyes. We went back inside to catch our snacks. I dropped everything I had on the ground. Her smile was as wide as ever. I put my cup back and tried to remember to open it, but I would never get any results. Next morning was going to be tougher than usual. Edit: Grammar<|endoftext|>

He was skinny, of course. He was too skinny. I took him into the building, and since it's built to accommodate the body, I hope it's still covered in rust stains and stains from the gas he put into the bathroom. From here it's a little less wasteful to give these groceries to people. I check for pockets of what I assume is his pockets in the police ’ s tent. I don't think I ’ ll find anything useful, but then again, that doesn ’ t happen for lack of evidence. Around the corner I hear what I assume are those who have given their jobs to sick people. And, in the past few days, they ’ ve gotten more than sloppy. Those too jerk off trying to use their temporary shelter as a drug test on the hard working homeless. I told everyone I gave myself a drink last week that I drank on purpose when I was just trying to finish my shopping for Thanksgiving. I don ’ t think anyone will be able to figure out why the newspaper people stop using hospitals as tests after the body is found, but when I read a few tweets, I doubt they could have told me what they said to their coworkers. If I think they would be able to find out why I ’ m looking for meth and all heroin somewhere else, then they will have found me out in their own way. The meat connoisseur. I get out of the tent and grab a tattered newspaper I ’ ve thrown away for good measure, putting it in a trash can next to the trash can where I began emptying it once again. As I wipe the drops off the paper and leave, I notice something strange, as if my drink left it in the garbage that I shoved it into. By the looks of it, it had somehow escaped the slurping machine and is somehow still in the bag. It ’ s gone now. I ’ ll just need to figure this out, and then I will be fully paid for collecting all the money I collected for my fare card and putting it away for future use.<|endoftext|>

"Listen man. You already know the consequences of God's actions, and no one else so much as prepares, how can you think that God actually knew what unholy things are. So just try not to feed this disgusting beast to the yard, and try to calm the beast down so he does not become infected, you've got not enough time. There's nothing to my motto, and God's just messiah. None of you are building a better and better future for God, please. Him. It's impossible! Just think how you could have come up with the tenets of what God foresaw: *Love will come from behind, fight evil together. Divine love will align with brotherly love, be more true than need be, If God had been around for the whole time, he wouldn't have blessed it, but instead had him waiting with a smile on his face. The Universe has existed for a long time, and no one on this planet could stop it. Isn't that awesome? Even if all you want to do is banish it from existence, make it something that doesn't have it's way. " Everyone laughed, and everyone blamed David for not immediately moving or alerting everyone else. No one could have expected what would happen after Belloq closed the Ark. For a long time the flock prayed for him to leave their damned world and return to find a better God. And every when the army of Gods came to the defense of Belloq and was overrun... And he just smiled. “ You guys win for us right? ” At first, the high pitched growl of the Nazis sounded off and dogs chirped. But even after thousands of dead men were defenseless, there were still some who fell. There were rumors of foul disease spreading through the world, and were trying to turn it into a nice village to live in, after L. Ron Hubbard said all people who possessed dragons should stay away from them. Of course, this was only the beginning of what lay beyond. News spread of General Hayetino and the other four soldiers they had slain, who had all been killed by the Gate and Satan himself were going to wage war on Belloq for his rest. Many died and many went to their home planets for feasts. Some even surrendered but some kept trying, so that he would not survive. After countless days, Belloq opened the Ark and began to heal the wounds. Well, then, it became Armageddon.<|endoftext|>

The researcher stood staring blankly into the infinite black void below him. Already no sound could be heard except for the blaring of the monitor on his hands. The scientist brought his eyes up to the monitor and gazed at the monitor that was now filled with the stories of countless beings and of all the people that had inhabited their planet. A smile slowly began to form over the scientist's face and began to gain a luster of life. "Well well well come on then... " His face was melting from the brim of his hat and his hair became frizzled from the wind blowing in an odd rhythmic manner, as if everybody around him knew they were surrounded. He stopped himself as he realized how impossible this was for a few seconds. There had to be someone who had spoken at this very moment in history. " That man? " A nervous tone in the scientist's voice broke through the silence, " No! I am just a human, for real. I can not explain it further, but my footprints tell that point of view. My oldest sister is an astronaut named Adrienne now. She actually says they are in her three hundred and fifty years old, but she still believes it is scientifically possible. " The scientists expression grew on the scientist as he realized what he had just done, it was time for him to do what he had been told many times before. " The fourth " the screen cut off abruptly as the scientist's gaze dropped as he heard footsteps on the other side of the room. He felt the shivers go up his spine as he watched his step under the microscope. " What kind of man would I have to protect such a noble creation from being destroyed? " the researcher muttered angrily, " I killed them all in the first place! It would be stupid of me not to... " The scientist stared blankly as the footsteps got louder. " I got the order; there will be a feast prepared by the children, there will be pain for these first test subjects and it has to end very soon. " The footsteps got louder again and finally stopped near the microphone. Turning around he began to walk towards his position and the scientist started to reflect on the work he had just done. This man would take all of humanity by storm, yet he would still keep humanity in his arms. " So... did you do something to bring the world together? " the scientist inquired, " Was it peaceful? " The voice sounded strangely familiar yet the scientist swallowed and picked up the microphone and started to play some music. " Did you bring peace to an entire planet, or did you just bring war? " The voice seemed to deepen the fear of humanity just further. " You would have attacked us if we attacked her. Yet we were rather pacifist allies."<|endoftext|>

"Why did you ask? " asked Sir Alphonse Beaumont, the leader of the Heven. " Well Sir, it seems that, at the end of the universe, it decided to come to an end. " Exclaimed the masked man from behind the ancient foyer stairs. * Where do the plans? * the reflection asked in the large crystal glass window. " I dunno, you two are pretty good. " " We've done enough for the survivors. " *How did they survive? * the mirror asked matter-of-factly. * Who was my real family? * " You see, we haven't done much good in the way of helping the others. For the past week, we've only been doing a little bit of that helping, but we've only done this. " Replied the mirror in a voice almost unrecognisable. *Why now? * the radio powered up. " Today, ladies and gentlemen, has been the bloodiest day of our lives. We as a squad and legion have fought and lost, and of course there have been no deaths. There may be a few of you like me, but I have no reason to believe that you have any chance. " *We aren't likely to find anyone else to support us. All we know is that we've managed to outmaneuver the others. This is the first time in years that we've worked together, and we want to do better next time. * " I'm proud of you. " Replied the door, opening softly. *Thank you* the commander returned, after all this time. The golden doors were finally falling. Across from him the glass door flew open, and a large man, through it's porthole stood a man of white robes and a breastplate that was quite heavy. He wore garbed in large loose black robes, and was carrying a bag hidden behind his back. " Now everyone. Turn to the right. " The commander signaled the other three men. One with the bag, and the other with the bag. A solemn look appeared on the other men's faces. There was no progress. Then, the door was torn away from the steel bars, and placed firmly into place. The Man on the bag picked up the sword of darkness, the old set of firecracker darts. The other three men turned their heads towards him. " Now where were the rest? " The man on the bag pleaded, but he couldn't find words to end it. A single tear crawled down his cheek. " Well look, Alph, those seven were special for me. They were my all-around, think tank, and team. And after that; we're all a great bunch. I've never seen anything like it. I've had so many amazing years to begin with. " Replied the old man as he continued to march forward, his arms drawn. After about an hour of standing, the sun started to rise. " I've lived my life without fear, without the job, without the burden, without the regret, and now now we're here. We are all here, all of us. Remember, we have some plans for you, very few of us, and we will have a lot of fun. " The man on the bag waved his hand lightly, opening the door behind him. With a great shout, the door was flung open as the Six Avengers and Princess-Beyond descended from the sky, raining fire upon earth. The clouds and mist hung heavy as the sunset spewed havoc everywhere. The Hero in the hood, leading a great circle of supers who were heading towards the Hero in the hood, slowly but surely. The hero was slowly lifted into the air by the dragon, who looked down upon him one last time before it strode over to the Hero. " Goodbye, and welcome to the people of the world."<|endoftext|>

I have had the heart and soul of every man, woman and child I have ever known. There is no such thing as living. The only difference, is that in this age, is that there is nothing left. The flowing ruins, the killing of millions, is a fact of life. The only difference is, that life is wicked and brutal. When the appearance of the Dead Cult has arisen, they have destroyed forests, rivers and fields, they have torn down giant buildings as the sky soared across the earth as the long dead sun threw down the Sun. They have done the Evil, they have destroyed our lives, and they have killed our children. And in doing so, they have threatened our paradise in the name of Heaven, our evils, our strength. Children who have lost parents in the invasion of the Hands of Earth, they have left their homes and livelihoods to them, where there is nowhere else to go. They left behind a forbidden paradise from the heavens and raised the arms of Men from the flaming wreckage of creation. The Entire Earth is ours now, and for our destruction, have mercy on the one who has fallen and is doomed to their eternal lives.<|endoftext|>

Rebecca was happy, truly happy. She was a pleasure to be with her friend all those years ago. In life her life she didn't fit in, there was no love in her life. Her husband didn't give a fuck until she was older and Rebecca never knew how he always hugged her like that. The day was dark and day was bright and Rebecca found herself looking around when she saw her best friend in the shadows. Her life was a mess now, just standing there at the edge of the bed. " Hey! " said Rebecca, looking down to where Rebecca had fallen asleep. It was a man in his late forties, blue hair covering his face. " You okay, are you alright? " the man said in a gravelly voice, although she could have sworn he was coming from the small town in Oklahoma where the shooting had taken place. Rebecca didn't say anything, getting up from her bed knowing it was over didn't matter. She kept her mouth shut as she continued to stare at the angel with those terrible almond eyes. " It... it's okay, I've got to get to school and I have no idea what day it is. I'm a little sore now I guess. " Rebecca nodded, feeling guilty and crying a little. " Rebecca, you were supposed to meet me here just a few days ago, " he said, stroking her arm. " You seem silly, I wasn't thinking of joining you and I... I mean, why would I? " " You're supposed to see me at the church, I was going to ask you where you were and everything you can do was going to be fine to me. " He held out her arm for Rebecca to reach but she didn't. " What did I tell you? " he said. " Take it easy, but I just want to make it quick so I can go to church. How long have I been friends with you? " " Just a few days " she answered. " No problems. I could ask you anything, anything " he said. Rebecca felt happy with her new friend, especially when she smiled. " I'm going to see you at church, God will be there! " She said before her parents could help her. " You'll see God my love, " he said. " What do you mean? " she asked. " I don't want to be alone anymore I need you to do what I did so that I don't end up dying here. " Rebecca looked down, hoping for an answer but she couldn't bring herself to smile, her smile taking on a twisted look and her shaking body shook. " I really think I want to see you see me at the church " she said. " But.. I guess I can't make it. " He said, as tears began to well up in her eyes. " No, that's fine, that's why you have to come. There is some reason I left you. It's just... I was scared. My mind's got really bad and I had a big problem with your dad. Now his thing is hitting his head and he keeps crying and he's always hugging me, I'm sick and I can't take it anymore. Why wouldn't you let me take care of your mother though, " he yelled, his sobbing echoing in the hospital. His eyes dulling and his body shaking. " It's okay, you've just got to move on. You've got to tell your older brother he won't be able to help you, he's in a lot of pain he'll miss you, " he said as he sat there sobbing. Rebecca could only focus on the beautiful red room he was in, the floor he was in, the bed he had fallen asleep in. " Love," she whispered as she wailed. She sat down in a very small bed that had no wood, no leaves, no cottages, no birds or the occasional dog or cat. She took a seat next to her friend and softly kissed her. She lifted her head and said, as she said, ever lovestruck, I love you<|endoftext|>

Disclaimer: That prompt is near non existent. There is a bit of a mix-up with the beginning to end section of the story and the ending. Also, *So* how can I change my wish to prevent future 9/11's happen? You're probably wondering. Well, there are a couple facts about this, but first we need to understand what happened to our friend. We've visited the world. Why? Because we're all a bit obsessed about the weather and man. So in that meeting, something went wrong that shouldn't have happened because we looked at each other. And because *he* had different hair colors. Ha! The hue we were given was a little... unpredictable to you. And we went back! The timeline is very much unpredictable, right? After discovering the timeline it's not like that he wasn't prepared for what's happening. It didn't take long for him to come up with some unique pieces of information in his mind that we both knew were illegal. We never had a decision to make. But like I said, with a lot of time that's been lost, this doesn't mean you have to either. The yellow jean jacket we wore, that didn't allow me to find a wallet, was removed. He also had a scar to his left cheek, but that's still okay. He says we should have gone back years, but he only said that he was surprised. This made perfect sense though. In that case, we might still go back in time. We need to give him time to find out if he was a potential terrorist and *did* make the American president. There's too much extra money in the bank though, so we'll just keep him on hold. Or not keep him on hold at all. Me, I wouldn't want him to figure out that while everyone else was having awful days, we were all heroes, too. Unfortunately, this won't stop him from breaking into government jobs and killing people. First, I had to buy him something like TimeBots on a credit card, so I basically stole the project ( and provided a job at Google that he could join ), and my mind worked overtime, like it always does. Second, I had to forcibly summon a genie with his power to stop 9/11. The alarm is going off at 7. We need to figure out why this guy wants us to go back to the 21st century. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Thanks for reading!

I pick up the computer and open the text files on my mobile phone. A word of explanation is sent to me immediately after pressing the notification. Dear God, I won't have to go look at your messages now. I have to lie.... In a slightly haphazard fashion, my phone flies to the middle of the street. I begin to type. Dear God, I guess we should move on to things like this one. I *really* want to move onto that topic sooner than later, but-Dear God, I didn't mean to say that last part. Well, I mean, I *really* do. I just realized now that the **concentration** is indeed incredible. My skin is permeating with sweat and half-assed alcohol. I can barely move. The colors have stopped alternating from blue to red. I realize I need to drink a bowl of water later. This is *it*. I enjoy the irony, for the moment. I can sit and be completely fulfilled by the sound of my computer buzzing away. Oh, wait. Oh, hey, that one time. A car. A knock at the door; you know, "Hey, come in. We need to talk."<|endoftext|>

"Yes! " He shouted. " AHAHAHAHA, grandpa! My hero! " Those words shined into the soft, seductive light of the room in their beams. The light wasn't even off, instead it was flying up above him, about to follow him down. " STOP THE VILLA- " It was cut off mid-sentence by what looked like a green-armored, red-faced man crawling towards him. The man was still moving - white hair was blowing from his face, and the tears streaming down his cheeks. " Ok! I'm ready! " The Light moved forwards, then stopped. " " Good plan Grampa, let me guess, you stepped out after about 3 hours " - " WHAM-! " Grampa screamed. " SHIT-!" He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small chain. He threw it, the Light groaned as he saw what it was. The chain was cut with a flurry of white slime as it whizzed past him and into the still air. Grampa placed his hand on the end of the chain and flicked it up into the air with one hand, watching as a round hole went through the President's neck and into the stomach.<|endoftext|>

I stood there, staring at him across from me. There was something uncanny about this man. I think you can say he looked like the harbinger of horrors... whether the impending horrors he unleashed appeared were his eventual torture. He tilted his head. "Then there is no need for you to suffer from his anger... " He trailed off. " I can relieve it for you, you have an infinite supply of options. " The words fell flat on their heads. He wasn't like the others. They had been carefully chosen to withstand extreme injustices. Their targets were the viciousest, the most deceitful, the most psychopathic... But he had been chosen... given a perfect opportunity to strike a compromise. " If you wish to withdraw your funds from me, you shall have to file a complaint against me, the charges against you following your alleged agreement with me are irrelevant and the department has no interest in stopping you. You are given your choice. " He said it with a slight grin. " But if I pay you, then you will be able to repay what my organization made you do... however long it takes. " I could hear more anger rising. " You are too wise... too clever! " The anger was infinite, this man would overrule everything I knew, all of history, you would perish right there... " You know nothing of dishonor, I know too much of ruin. Now you are just searching for the exit. You may just find the other end! " He clicked on his pocket watch. It was now 17:00. He'd already known that it was around 19:00. As he was walking to his car he wondered what day it was. 11:00. Yes, it was 11:00 but this time it was more of a flash of blue. He reached into his pocket, only to find this time, the money had gone cold. He had switched out his watch when he went out in the darkness. Was it more of a symbol? Maybe the comforting effects it brought after killing an undeserving soul... or just the giving you the hope you needed? He walked around the corner and tripped on an old stained-glass stool. Stumbling through the remaining cash, he fell into the little hole. As he stood there he was pathetically happy. Maybe he could have prevented one of this guy's mistakes, this 9/11, this evening slaughter. He thought. No one has done this before, not even for you and not for me.<|endoftext|>

I was sitting at my table. As i opened the drawer, I found a large stack of envelopes. I slowly put them into my hands. I put them back into my mouth and studied the contents. It seemed really strange. I stood up, reached over to the counter, and pulled out a small package. With a swish I put the bundle in my mouth and took a quick swig. " Jason. Nice weather. " I thanked him in my head. As i opened the box, the food i had prepared already started coming out. " Thank you, Jason. As we prepare dinner... ", I said to myself. I opened the container and pulled out an envelope. It had a number written on it. " 10 ", it read. I opened the envelope and pulled out a small piece of paper. It was from an envelope I carried at home with me. It had a title, the letters " TOMORROW ". I quickly pulled out the envelope and put the letter inside the paper. I prepared myself to pull out a bigger envelope as soon as i was done. I pushed the envelope closed and looked at the size of the envelop. When i opened it, the words printed on the paper were " PLEASE ". I started to panic and opened the envelope closer. " Awwww " I jumped out of the paper. I looked at myself in the mirror. Everything was different. I looked at my best friend on the way to school, " Mom, why are you just standing there, staring at me, while you talk to your best friend? " She looked at me for a few seconds and then looked into my eyes. " I... I wish you died. " I said. She looked back at me confused. She turned away, and proceeded to walk away. I sat down next to a genie, " Alan. We need to... " I began to stand up, but my hands were overwhelmed by the amount of darkness outside. " There's nothing you can do ". I stood there for a few moments before being led away. " You're not gon na believe this. " The genie said to me. " For the last time, you wish to die. That is not what I want. Just look at me! Look at me! Please! " I said in my darkest voice I had ever heard. " You're wasting your life just because you can't help yourself. " He looked at me intensely. " Don't you dare! " He said. " Please, don't... " I sighed. My hand trembled. The genie had obviously done this multiple times. " The problem is now that you no longer have any choice. " I said. He looks at me for a few seconds and looks away. " Please, just take me away". Edit: Shouldn't have put " goodbye" in space<|endoftext|>

I looked up to see Henry standing there. There was no one, save me. " I have no idea! I've never felt this way before, " Henry had told me. I was astonished at the stupidity of it all. I was nothing; if a man moves, can he do anything. After all, what is a day to a man in need of a doctor? I put down my scythe, and cast it from above me. Henry had grabbed the scythe with trembling hands, letting it take on a strange intensity. I stared at him in shock for a moment, before turning away to look him in the eye. " I... I'm sorry. It's a bad thing. I just... I just... I don't know. " " What are you talking about?! The *hero* is dead?! " " *Nova*! The villain! The *accident* was an accident! The *accident* was *hilarious*. " I watched with wide eyes as it dawned on Henry. He did not answer. His face was frozen motionless as if hardened from the joy he brought to the situation. " You had better not let them hurt you any longer... " I knelt down with a wet thud, as if to check my movements. Henry was looking on with a mix of fear and distrust. There was only one emotion in his eyes, and it was hatred. " I'm sorry, " I said softly. " I'm sorry I haven't let you rescue him sooner. " I smiled, and held up my scythe in front of Henry. " No matter what, I need you to help. " The owner of the lamp. " Look! This isn't a mistake!" I stared at Henry with a faint frown on my face. As the lamp touched my chin, I looked around. The supervillain had gone down this path, but the hero was still here. No one knew when. I'd been given this fact at birth. A moment ago, I'd remembered that Henry, at the ripe old age of 34, was orphaned into me. He'd grown up in sheltered circumstances with a raised appearance, while in my life I had never had to wear the mask. The years have taught me everything, and I've realized that if the world around me ceases to age I'm destined to die alone, until I die not in Henry's lamp, but rather a broken corpse in a box I always believed in. I cried when I thought about the numberless lives I'd wasted doing it for Henry. What was the matter? I had to save a hero for himself. Is this the reason he's here? Or is it the end of this road I'm on?<|endoftext|>

Life has its rules. If there's anything people did that could set them off, well, not generally; the only thing that makes for good ones of them, you know? Maybe make them step back a bit before they come across'em. A few. A handful of, maybe a million, still trying to deal with their worst and most tempting choice. But it is in the terms of life that you find the balance of ingenuity and luck. You will discover how to go from a debt bound city in which you can fill an unlimited supply of money with my poorest, the lucky of whom shall be able to provide for their own sick and malnourished kind. I will consider that all the best ways to throw you into a frenzy, and I will expect the cheapest disposal. Ah sure, the worst kind of queues. I always have the best who can muck around with my soon to be riches. I always expect someone else who can secure the finest of trophies from an everyday view. I never want to reap another's diamonds, and boy am I a fool for finding ways to postpone that memory. But it can always be better. It can be better that I am created and I am given a name and a world to inhabit and what you can do with it. *Prayer*<|endoftext|>

By the time I remember him, the memory of him had faded and my mind had no longer enough processing power to exist. His name was Salina, and he was destined to die here, in this small, dingy, abandoned factory. I understood so much about this place that I knew what was best for my people. I left with the only scrap of evidence that I had been chosen. In a flash, they were, dead, and the factory was closed. I held in my hands my empty gas mask, ready to face reality. After so much time, many have tried to stay alive, but no one will ever be able to find what happened in this factory. A few hundred feet off the ground, upon my boots lay a piece of rubble. A chain let loose in the air. I did everything I could to preserve this abandoned farming town. " Why didn't you let us die here? " I mutter. I help him up, leaving a trail of blood on the floor as I stretch my legs. " There was no air filtration." He says.<|endoftext|>

Every once in a while, someone is born with a field of talent. I've gotten caught with a little variety, my twenty-first birthday gift was entirely random and some regal flowers I got for stealing someone else's money just to some shady folks. So with my little talent bestowed upon me by my parents, I decided that maybe I'd like to be a villain. Right? At first, I thought of what an interesting career I'd be, I'd be a good character, I'd be a funny guy, blah blah blah, just get everybody under a microscope and I'd get a little recognition and sure enough, nobody called me crazy! So I decided to go out into the world. Hunt down all the supervillains and take down the corporations I could. That's when I caught the most glaringly evil hero anyone had ever seen: Lucius, Boss Black, Voldemort and finally... James. He was a really good one. As I went through the crowd of supporters, many spoke in big, cliche ( sort of ) English like Shakespeare and Wagner, not the first time I'd seen a guy cut all of them apart like he was a villain, but from the first few I saw a real kindness. And then there was I, a dimwit. I couldn't see him, even though I was surrounded by fans and a thousand different costume patches. I knew something had to be done. I waited until I started chanting instructions to keep him from going too far, but what I saw before me went unnerving, it was indescribably pure evil. It was a mask, no mask I wasn't familiar with, just a pure hatred for all those we killed. I stood up and brushed off the dirt from under the mask, laying my hand on the air. " If you, uhhh, want your? The biggest and brightest go into my head. One giant giant evil sorceress looks at you and says I'm not the hero she wanted. " I considered that, but the real question came up from somewhere in my brain. I'd paid for the mask, could it be my father or her husband or some really big government organization who just came to kill my name? " If you want more you can join me at the bus stop and ask the locals for pizza."<|endoftext|>

"They are being controlled. " The official said as the translator finished translating the English language and sending it over for translation. Once it was translated it became clear. It was all in the terms and conditions. The *Wall* was a war brokered by the settlements of the Alien Anari-Belch. A race of peace-loving and militaristic blots whose arrogance in offering up a peaceful solution to their crushing problems had been interrupted for centuries by the unceasing bombardment of near annihilation- their weapons, with their ability to reason and coordinate entire units for the advance of an entire species- effectively creating a battlefield between the invasion and rebirth of their race, known simply as Vault 69. After countless casualties, the Aliens finally stepped back from the gravitational field and allowed for their destruction. A group of known members of the Vault-1 did not meet with the flag of Earth, only realised the significance when They appeared next in their leader's uniform. They were Deviants by Any Means Necessary, Their armour not unlike those that the Solarians of the Era before received upon bringing them to the planet discovered nearly three hundred years prior. Their cursed limbed posture, fleshy features, green eyes and booming voice cast a permanent shadow on their faces. The Coalition Militarys had been repairing the Sol settlements since peace-keeping forces entered, and were nearly on the verge of total subjugation. Not to mention, they had the human body now just known as the human-Adam, Hadith, Human and Even-Adam, and they would be trapped in some dark cave of their own to years go by. Earth came over in a blaze of glory for both these races. They would finally find a unified human governing body and entire species. " Alpha- " " Yup. Looks like it worked." ( I wrote this the other day. Feel free to critique and tell me how. ) I've just finished building the Rift Ark and painting it. It looks beautiful. EDIT: Oh and here's the link! It was a bad word choice.<|endoftext|>

We were standing at a park bench. Her name is Marina and we've been dating for four months now. I know she's our girl, but I still get a bit upset when I look at her when we go out. Those slow eyes sparkle when she smiles and those tiny lips cover my mouth when she asks me for money. I love her and I wanted to be apart of this world for the rest of my life. We were sitting down at a bench that overlooks a beach. The water was calm and one of our friends -- Artie -- had gotten extra good socks just to hit a song on her music playlist. I saw her walking down the pier, laughing. Artie had to skip school and I decided it was best to just sit down beside her for awhile. Marina laughed and stepped over to check the progress. It appeared that he missed his orientation... so it seems I wasn't actually alone in the park. As Artie came closer the breeze was getting closer and closer. The beach that we were sitting in almost immediately disappeared, and Marina reappeared behind us. She stood up and leaned in for a kiss. She felt much better than Artie had... so there it is... we are so happy to be together. I can't wait until there is someone else like Marina. As Marina walked closer I felt an abnormally strong breeze inside of me that knocked my clothes off. When the sun came up and I saw her on the ocean floor I smiled. Marina was in the air, doing yoga. Everything was normal, except for that strange blue dress on her other side, which had a "K". She still had the clothes on. I'm so happy to see her on the beach. Marina nodded in response. She glanced around the room and at the people who were so close. Marina started packing her things and walked to her bunk. She came over to her computer and logged on. When she logged in she said the following. *Hi, Chris. I'm so excited to meet you*<|endoftext|>

'Dare you take this joke,' my friends called out to me,'I have my goldfish' 'Even if I tried, it wouldn't work' "God, you look just like a clown! " shouted a cute blond college senior. " It's just a joke, fool. " I said with a smug look on my face, to no response. 'Bullshit, what am I doing? What have I got? " I put my hands on my hips. All I could do was sigh. " You keep pretending to look like a clown, you worthless piece of shit! " Someone yelled out. 'Get out of my face... I hate that clown man!' **WARNING: Let the puny clown man go. ** Once the judgment bell rang, the target finally vanished into my view. A slow trickle of water glowed on the tips of my toes, like a yellow haze. " He's out for a cigar, " the older of the two friends pleaded as he rushed to the car and hopped over the railing. " I'll get back to you when I have the chance, " I spat, getting a thorough look at him, " Now, who the hell are you? " " Haha, Charlie that should be all, " he spat as the connection consumed him. 'Man your a fool! You made a fool of yourself by telling someone about that bro!" I shouted as the swarm of passerby turned their heads to yell at me. I slowly lifted my chin and locked eyes with the man. I had never seen anyone look like an old man before. He smiled. It was one of those, charming smile of smile you see at school, funny and generous... but always dull. I made a familiar pouty face, and he smiled back. **WARNING: Don't give up hope' ], I said, stopping myself with a quick final smile on my face.<|endoftext|>

The beast staring out the spectaculous door stared back at me with a huge predatory fangs it's nostrils and teeth meeting and a'alarm' it somehow managed to keep it's mouth close enough to the wound to listen to her prey. I slowly pulled a handkerchief out of the other pocket and scrubbed the dried tissue on my hand with it. To my surprise, the creature didn't move and seemed to be an entirely different reptilian animal. The ritual required to complete the summoning, though I've heard many people go for a golden ring, it had actually been designed by an architect, which I accidentally gave it to her last time. She suddenly stopped in front of me and raised a hand. 'C'mon, Rapunzel, you've been out for a long time and to top it off, this is a little more intimidating than you think,' she smirked and lifted her body, narrowly missing me. 'If there's anything you haven't taught me, it's that there's only infinite time. Regardless of who you are, it isn't the same. I'll start with the usual secrets, I've discovered you can learn any element at will. For instance, I can think of anything to manipulate but only the ending. I have an assistant who can summon anything and anything at will. I can also see into the past you can manipulate but only in image at will. That will allow me to claim a hidden specific prize at will to complete the ritual to save you.''What do you mean by that? How do you keep me from gaining the ability to see all these secrets?' 'I've saved you from seeing any secret from your past lover. Now turn around, let me see this.' I got up and started drawing the rune in the air as I looked into my left hand. It took a good minute before I was ready to cast. There was a lot of effort put into this ritual, I might never get a chance to summon a basilisk, a cockroach or a horse. All I really want is something to be able to destroy magic forever. She nodded and let out a yell of annoyance in response and sat back down on her throne. Then she lifted her hand and placed it right into my mouth. After another moment I was able to hear her voice. 'Sorry I didn't hear you properly, I was just trying to be straightforward, but you are able to alter the universe because I can change the core of reality and anything based on the alter. See, I can change everything. " And then she handed me a pen with an old, ebony scribbled signature. " And that's why you're keeping me. Here's the reward for giving you this'Angry' Note. What's the reward for teaching the people of what'it is'? If you can mess up that scroll to save my daughter's life, and then start investigating what happened to her university we might find this? " 'Really?' I asked, hoping I wasn't so heartless. " Then I'll reward you with a debt of gratitude. If you continue to talk about what happened to my daughter, I will give you what you wished for. If you don't pay that debt the police will think you're insane and I'll put you on a list of people who have also been involved in our antics." 'Really?' I asked, now that I was sure of her intentions. I already knew what she wanted, the temple would be ruined, and I'd just have to just come clean.<|endoftext|>

... Without exception. For a what? They called me Whitey, after the white man, because of my brownish skin, my small black thumb, and my scars, which were the finest of all. I slept here, in the sand, on a beach, in the night, surrounded by people. These people, though, called me loquacious, but this night I think I called them kind. And they told me to be gentle, even with my flaws. I smiled like a goddess, and asked them what they had done to my skin and clothes. I asked them to remove my hands from my face, and they chuckled, and told me a story. " Let us see to it that you may exist... " I sat in the corner of the room, staring at a wall, as my wife stepped outside. " What did you see? " She asked. " Oh, I saw the stars, and they were happy. There were so many people there. A loving and understanding people, with all their faults and sins. They were the most loving people. And all of their faults meant nothing to me... " This more was to be expected of me, especially when I was thought of as an inferior species in their species, as they called me. I gazed around the room, trying to decide how to respond. My gaze left the wall, towards a smiling woman, walking with a tall man dressed in a white shirt and black jeans. She wore a tight red dress, matching his jacket, with a long black skirt, and a white top. She walked around the room, clearing her throat, and in this moment, I really was left with the feeling that she was speaking nonsense, of course, but I could not really tell. She must have gone mad if she had left her voice alone, this way, that voice alone. I did not know what was going on. Suddenly, the sickly yellow light brighter than my entire field of vision went from green to purple and slowly to a long dead orange. Out of the blue, a tall man dressed in a white shirt and black jeans emerged. He stood before me, although I had my spares on me, and was less clad in clothes and cloth in the hall. " Sit! " He bowed, and started to speak. " My name is Alii. One of your lieutenants, and you are the first to tell us your secret. I am sure you know your staid ways, and I know where you are hiding. " My eyes lit up, and I heard him whisper something, in Arabic, into my ear, " Oh, of course, my leader, Alii. We have come to save you, and we hope that we can help you." The red light faded to black. I was left to my thoughts, and I understood how wrong I was. I can not find my soul again. Though I have come to rule the realm of the stars, I will not leave them, and they will not understand what I am saying. So my name is Alii, this is what I must say. All those liars, liars who used to hate me, want me killed. I will take back what I have done. I will become our king. The earth's creation. And I will purge the universe of the malleable hatred and hatred I have once so-called been called.<|endoftext|>

“ Can you turn it off? You're still inside. ” The words passed through deep and wet blackness. Brandon hadn't seen Gray in weeks and his head was still shaking from the shock. Was he going insane? Was he going insane? He sat back and watched it go on for a minute. “ Nobody likes me. All I want is for everyone to be happy. ” He stood up and walked out the door. “ Family says there is no family, that one is all I have. ” Brandon couldn't hear Gray clearly but he could sense Gray stirring inside his body. In all of his life, there was nothing that fit. Gray's shinning didn't do him justice either, he was different from the rest of them. Grey had a gentle spark in his cheeks and a certain confidence to it that he hadn't felt in years. Brandon didn't blame him. They had a family and the time had come to keep it. So many times they had lost people, far too few to cope with. He took an iron fist and struck with his own. As though it were made of fire, the blade tipped around, chipping away at his skin. *Clunk. * “ You know you have to learn to show it before everyone else is going to realize what we are. ” Brandon had been silent for a moment, he knew what was coming. And the world would know he wasn't crazy. The source of it was behind him. He leaned against the wall and stared straight ahead. No point to fighting it, not now. I didn't care if he was crazy or not. But he wouldn't be real. “ I don't know what to do, okay? I don't feel like doing what's right, alright? You can't leave me with grey, Brandon, I can't leave you with Frank. ” His voice is soft and melancholy, but it was heavy and throaty with the exception of the sound of an old familiar windpipe that shouldn't have come from Brandon's lungs. “ I can hear you Brandon, I can hear you. I can hear you running through here. You won't get close to that Skyman. I love you. ” His voice wavering into the present. Brandon glanced at Gray, and Brandon could tell that he could feel the nostalgia in his eyes. And he saw the sadness in Gray. He recognized that it was suddenly draining of him, but as a small child, he knew the world was coming to an end. He couldn't help but make it worse. “ Frank, a few years ago, Frank, I had the same dream as you. I had to save you and I always felt like I had it easy. I had to go back home. I wanted to be with you forever. ” Gray waved a hand and revealed a fine golden hair in the open air. “ I just wanted to make sure Frank didn't get to hurt you when I did. I wanted to protect you from that curse. ” The weight on his shoulders eased. *Click*. Brandon felt his fingers and heard the familiar twang of metal as it had faded to slumber. He had been right. He was safe. More than likely.<|endoftext|>

I was supposed to be a hero. An adventure. A target. A true teacher. One day, I was going to take on this new school, the finest paying the ultimate price: over the course of my time. It was going to be me, not the arch evil, destroying worlds and curing diseases. Mr. Rogers had his eye on me. His plan was no cakewalk; this could not go wrong. He would destroy worlds and save all those he couldn't save at once. Forcing us into an eternal war to rid ourselves of what had to be saved once and for all! Sadly, he could never take out my true ambitions. He thought he could me'misster' a university, build a research facility. So I'm going to invade other worlds and distract them, just in case... and soon enough all their quests were going to be unquoiled and I was going to inevitably confront the one who would eventually redeem us all. Mr. Rogers was right. But, if I could simply direct his attention, we would be in any case equally oblivious to the real danger at hand. I must heed his warnings. I may be too good for that. I might be the master of him, the real evil, all of the imposters....but if I have to choose between the evil of one being... or the innocent of another... I will choose the former.<|endoftext|>

"Welcome to David, and welcome, the world commander. I am Groliemenhis, the common name for our admiral. I am here to review all of the footage you provided last night. Your videos captured this whole action. Yes, it had it's reasons. The reasons for the attack on the world of Tartarus in 2329 were the fate of all humans across the Galaxy. People are angry, bollocks, and anyone who has felt isolated is to blame. I was worried that you knew everything about this whole situation so that your security forces could get closer to Tartarus undetected. But the thing was, you didn't. You didn't stop the attack. As you can see, they placed heavy weapons on the general population. The humans were uneducated and just unable to fight back. More importantly, the very rich and powerful were located on Tartarus. You really didn't care about what was going on down there, and you should've known. A lot of people are unhappy about what you know for sure. You didn't stop the attack, but you didn't want to control anything that might be avoided by us. " I counted 750 deaths and 4,093 days of losses. That was the impressive feat. A lot of people did not fight back either. The humans have been eliminated, now, for defending them. Including myself. A long time ago, humans approached earth. They wanted a spot in our pocket, not a world to keep us from invading. They needed something more than diplomacy and science. Humans were humble creatures. They didn't care that, but for some reason, they didn't have the intelligence to have conquered Hell, which is why they aren't alone. A little more time passes on Earth and most of humanity is gone. The humans have been living with constant fear and fear of what they perceived as absolute arrogance. They took the highest technology in the Galaxy and were very hesitant. At first, they thought that the power of bad will overcome them, and that they would stay put. If they came to visit, they would find that the General had been wrong about that last one. Unfortunately for humans, this was a mistake. They destroyed 3-4 % of the Earth's population and burnt the last planet with the rest of the strength they had to stand, and left the rest behind. With that being said, you are highly valuable to our universe. After another hour of video, we are closing in on Tartarus. As you all know, it was on earth we are stationed in. If you ever see an Earth Invaders who question your FTL technology, you're going to deny them a chance. It is about time. Even if you were to be killed, it is still worth it. Humans are getting closer. I looked at the photos you provided. We were advancing closer to Tartarus this time. Everything you saw above, which you hope will not turn out to be false or anything, is an act of terror on the human race. Since Tartarus wasn't obliterated, the humans have retreated and we are going to make sure we get what we want. With your help, we may be able to open another Stargazer for you. This time, we use Miracles to keep our technology at an acceptable level. If you love our planet and you want to help the other races in your galaxy, don't let them keep the technology unattainable. We have more important things to worry about. I looked at your footage. This time, the footage you told me was saved. That was good. I looked into the heavens, and saw the power of the Human Guard. It's all there. Hopefully with your help, we will be able to go in and protect the planet. The Humans are getting closer.<|endoftext|>

After 20 years in Hell I'm sure this is the best afterlife ever. It's the best social norm nowadays. The setting is mundane, nothing but rocks with corpses in it, nobody trying to convince someone else. Hell is entirely depressing. The horror isn't life anymore but it's the same feeling as if you're trapped in that dark pit. Just another day at St. Peter's. I look down at myself in my metal chair for a brief second to remember what is meant to be. There is no body left that's on me at this point. There are no signs of me ever fading. I stand up and put the black robe on. I see Death. In the process I notice the dark outline of a gargoyle who is speaking a language that I didn't recognize back in High School. " You're here? " I ask. " What? " " Are you here to go to St. Peter's, " he continues " He? " " Yes. " " Do you have any other questions? " " None. " " Then why are you here? " " You're an old man! " " Well... " I began to think to myself, " he's gon na have to meet some new folks soon. " " Do you have kids? " " No. " " And do you have friends? " " No. " " Hey... I'm writing this on the side of the road at the Eiffel Tower... " " Do you like my music? " " Not really... " " You used to have so many of them! " " Okay, " the gargoyle said, " It will probably be my name again when I'm done with this show. " I sighed and took another sip of my drink. I was definitely going to miss St. Peter's tonight. The next morning I saw him and he drove me out on a ride to St. Peter's. Back at my apartment I sat down and made breakfast. Time had slowed to a crawl. I don't know how to explain how it happened to me, but I felt my body is frozen in an instant. I didn't feel the muscle in my arm appear. Then it all disappeared and the whole world was silent for a few minutes. The whole time my phone was ringing. I wondered if it would go off. No matter, I was still surprised by the silence when it stopped. Then I noticed, the lady next to me on the train. She was staring at me with that same black eyes that she always had. She was wearing the same black robe from the train ride, but her face was a mask of a different person. She just stood there, looking scared. She looked so afraid. " Where are the kids? " I said, trying to get her attention. " Where's my mother? " she asked again, more scared than angry. " Uhh... I think I can help you here. Please, find your mother. I think she might be worried... " I looked around for something, anything. I heard her reaching for her purse, feeling something warmness. She reached out, and touched me. " I think you need to get out there. " I looked at her, and when I looked down again, I saw it was her. My big blue eyes squinted with happiness in them. She reached in and squeezed my hand. I felt a warmness that was almost as warm as the warmth I'd held for so many years. " You're mine," she said with a kiss.<|endoftext|>

Rain strikes the cliffs as I go to hug my girlfriend. He kneels beside me and I place my hand on his shoulder. "You didn't say anything, did you? " I shake my head. We're both terrified to the untimely end, but today I knew. I was born to a woman. Our family was one of the biggest, richest families in America. We were on a first name basis with ours. It was apparent to me to all of us that men and women were so fascinated with the difference in appearance we didn't care that the girl we married looked pretty just like a college student with a kind name. Same goes for other people. Who, as you can see now, were a different combination of genders than I was. We didn't want to say anything, but I couldn't take it anymore, and began squirming with my underwear because I had it. My girlfriend pulls away and whispers something into me. We didn't say anything, but she puts her hand on my forehead. I scream and claw at my face, only to be cut off by someone saying something. " Janet. Get it together, ok? You've had a wonderful life. " Without warning I hear someone calling my name out. I try to look away but she's right behind me. I don't want to believe it. She has a thin layer of sweat down her face and she whispers. " Janet, just where did you get this from? " " From my mother, of course. " " What about the Mars mission, right?" *we had been friends for so long. * She didn't need to tell me. In fact, I wasn't sure what to believe anymore. I was going to be fine. *I realize that I have to do something about my feeling of abandonment. * I reach out to stroke his arm, but it doesn't help. Our parents are arguing over some unknown entity and I can't move. This sensation grows stronger and stronger until my skin stops hurting. People walk past me now. They're holding hands and make their way towards my body. *So you were sick, right? My mom is gone... * I'm so lost in thought, I just want to go home and take care of myself. I just hope I can follow up some such a revelation with her.<|endoftext|>

My skull was bleeding from the impact of falling debris. The side of my head just hit the ground with a thud and a screech. That lead me to believe that I was being sucked up by my own corpse. The force of the impact startled me out of my trance. After meditating for a minute, a strange man approached and asked me "where am I?" He said, I am sitting in a box with clouds floating above me. I then respond, it's a bit colder, and now I'm floating right above, around my head. There were clouds forming and I was facing them. As my skull hit the ground, my body started to rip itself apart. I opened my eyes and there I was, to my horror, I was floating right above a giant crowd. They were holding massive wands and wielding spears. I saw two swords sprout out and it was dark. My head smashed against the crowd and my body hurtled around them, the sword in my hand. With that, the crowd was gone.<|endoftext|>

You can see the arrival of the cancer, the red lights flashing red. You can also see the vague outline of the first sleeping patient. The big boy woke to the sweet smell of fresh blood but after an hour he fell asleep. He woke again and bit his lip, squirming with delight as his blood tore at his inner thighs. His eyes were filled with light but their tears could not form in his eyes. He had black eyes and a tight stare that should have paralyzed him. He clawed at the open wound on his hand, two blankets filled with the body of the boy on the bed. His face was pale with agony, a scythe scented in sulfuric stench. It's like a visitor was hitting on him. You see, the virulent species of cancer are incredibly easy to kill. Every bone in your body is emptied of this deadly substance each passing year. Every single living being. It takes a few unfortunate days for our bodies to decay away. But you are now, on this fateful day, the one that my secret to immortality is with. You see, we no longer need to fear death. Death is the absence of both sides of our bodies. Each soul leaves one body full of life but the other has gained a much larger part of the sickened bodies. These bodies are the eyes of a dead family member. They are the pupils of a first time worker but with the end of it's lifespan in mind you may have a strong sense of belonging to them. Your eyes follow the path of life as long as it takes to grow back to a healthy body. You see, you don't need to worry about them anymore. Dying is quite simple. You don't have to stop your soul from ageing though. Those who come into this world are too weak to realise the simple beauty of your existence. You can rely on your blood, your breaths, the momentum of the movement of one moment and the frail body of the next. Yet, despite your genius, your resilience to those same same moments, you have always locked yourself in a moment with a dead family member, a patient, a loved one. Your judgement, though foreign to the human eye, does not go unnoticed. At one point in the future a man is chosen. He chooses, in exchange for his soul. He must follow the path of life as the last of the dying. He is, in essence, an evil incarnate but his inner peace only lasts a moment. He is an embodiment of the new human body. But for you see, life will be rewarded to you for eternity.<|endoftext|>

"No, please, no, Please, Mr. Smith, please, no, Please, Mr. Smith, please, please. " " Oh, gods, sir. " Mr. Smith showed me the six pence pizza he had been saving up. He handed it to me, just in case. " Mr. Smith, they like food I *love* pizza. " I said. " They don't like pizza. But please... " I stared at the seven or eight. Seven or eight with giant pizzas that burst into flames and hit the ground like chaffy confetti just wanting some semblance of life. I could almost feel their reds and oranges in my veins. They wanted me to tell them not to fucking pick that pepperoni. They wanted me to tell them that the fat kid who bought these fucking pizzas was the one who ordered five Hellspawn type thick pizza, not McDonald's. I felt the tear fall off my face and then my palms onto the table, and every fucking moment spent thinking about this particular fucking joke, that had just suddenly came off. I went to hand the pizza to my manager but, in a choking, jovial tone, said " Look, sir, I just wanted the pizza all over here, and I wasn't very smart in the kitchen. " But he was still smoking anyway. I was even more upset that he wouldn't give me his fucking shit and that so long as it wasn't too late for me or even the receptionist on the side. " Sir. " " Sure thing. " I said as quickly as I could, realizing the severity of the situation, and trying to keep the threat in my voice. " I think you need to find a new guy. Who is your boss? " In hindsight, I wish I was stronger but I was just an innocent child jacking out of the house to put in an extra extra hour of playing with dolls or to babysit a family pet. The rage gave it all away, and I knew I couldn't believe how stupid he had to be to get up to my house and force me to share my pizza with him. But it would have been fair to say he had a lot more food. " I don't know who you are, sir. I just want to help you clean up. Please, fuck the pizza. " I slammed the door shut on his behalf and put a cup of hot coals under his sandwich and set to work cleaning the walls. " Alright, sir. " I said as I picked up the two charred pieces of crusts off his table. " Alright. " He walked over to the counter and approached the money I was trying to hand over. " You wanted that pizza. " He smirked at me and shook his head. " I don't know, sir. It's... good. I'll put my money down right now. If you don't have money, then I can't come see you any more and we can have this thing as a dinner at the seedy corner spot on Omaha Street. " " Sir. " " Okay. Fine. Alright. Put it in my nose.

She's over at the bar enjoying her last swig of champagne. That night ’ s lights shone bright through her set of eyes as her body pulsed throughout her room. Her eyes were met with a gaze of love and then she looked into his eyes. She had been staring at him for so long that they had become eternal in her eyes. “ You've got no idea how beautiful he is. ” He had agreed but refused to admit that she wasn ’ t real. “ I know, ” she murmured. “ You must love me just to see me more. ” The work here was difficult yet rewarding. She did not know how she had managed it. Her heart felt compelled to follow the path of their favorite drink just to see the end result. She now knew that she had loved them and every moment spent with her they melted away into nothing but memories. And finally she knew that this wouldn ’ t be the last night she did this for him. She wanted to curl up in bed with the police officer and watch as she died because nothing could bring her back. “ Thank you very much. ” He offered the look in her last moments that to her seemed pitiful. The cops were puzzled, even more bewildered about what had just happened. * She just wanted to curl up and watch “ Life in Space: A Step In The Right Direction ” for me. “ Bye. ” she said.<|endoftext|>

When everything was the same I dreamt of looking up, and looking down. This was it. I could see the landscape and marvel at it, seeing how after long my mind experienced one type of space simulation the prior inhabitants would adapt. You know, from grass to sea, long palisades and tall grassed islands. I wanted to forget the trip, but in my drunken haze every set of whiskers I conjured said my dream. There are other worlds out there that are watching us play today. I had a rough time coming to terms with that fate, a wonderful government-encumbered contraption manned by a regulated but hugely knowledgeable and most certainly resourceful workforce. Now they only live down south and through the back country, headed for their small island home of northern Erronn. Some room in the clouds - that is - marked that door only a mile from the base of that mountain. They ’ re watching us, soldiers in hovercraft, their deep black eyes snapping and filling with a growing panic. I wonder what it is their current political situation they find about us and you know why. I think I can see it in their eyes. If the world itself was made to last as long as we have, it would actually last forever. Maybe it would be a kind thing. Me and my wife had an hour or so before the day. I would sneak in to the house to hide in the trunk of the granola bar, the store I had in my mouth that I could buy to feed them over the course of several days, the thing would always hold them close to their senses and thoughts, and they would enjoy it until my exhaustion overcame me. Then if I had said yes, they would capture us. Our paradise as individuals, of the kind that has been known for many years. They would grab us by both arms, bound us as they would. We would step forward, and turn on them, allowing them to see the transformation of every single one of us. They would take our clothes, douse them in a local desert water, drink it until the end of days and smell the air, which sometimes pairs with the changes in shape of our skin. They would feed us until they knew there was nothing we could do about it. Eventually they would turn to us and serve us the first of their kind, protecting us in secret to ensure that our community of soldiers could maintain our peace as a society and not be corrupted by evil. All was well. Their leader soon found himself in that part of my life I wanted not to forget, with that of the life that had just befallen me. He saw my destruction and these murderers under our feet and opened his mouth, but I refused. If they would only be here the moment I faltered, there would be no way for me to reclaim my master. So here I was. A simulation of a distant and distant relative. Under the guise of a peace offering to the outsiders, I had become an ally. We had successfully secured the summit of La Petit Lac in today's United Nations with the support of my citizens, on the top of a mountain - which I had refused to shout in thanksgiving as if I had accepted so long ago. As much as I hated that I had been so harsh as to leave it in the country, I did not despair. I had grown up there too, in the old parts of the country. I began to visit the Kingdom of Nanodom, or the Faerie Kingdom. It was called upon. There would be another time, a great event, during our world - that would prove that the Faerie King's goal was to enrich the otherwise wretched nation, paving the way for them to regain dominance in the land and the world. Although it would be in vain if I was to die peacefully. I knew he was right, and that he saw fit to do so. He made sure that the capital of the Kingdom of Nanodom never fell and that now that the power was gone, there would be a future-born country as one of the Friends of Nanodom and the Faerie Kingdom. When all was said and done, then I bowed my head and embraced my brotherhood. We soon had warm welcome from the shore of La Petit Lac.<|endoftext|>

Zephyr thinks about how his parents didn't tell him how magic works, that's a problem that he just doesn't get. The kids here know nothing about magic, but he also knows that magic can't take on its own effects. *Magic* is not just got by special education, it's got the magic of schooling and staff administration. " Magic, " he explains as he sweeps his eyes, " Is magical experience that can be acquired through the use of little things. Other magic acts as a worm through the fabric of the magic in it. It doesn't just take large things, those things are required. " He then shakes his head and dismisses the movie he was watching. " Such horrible notions. Magic can be hard for people to believe to you, that nobody can help you learn it. Magic is magic. What would I want it to be if I never mastered it? Would a business that dealt with Magic and had a God have me there? Magic is the result of you being cursed by the Dragons. " " Wh... why? " the director asks confused. Zephyr ignores the question and continues " Only people with unlimited Magic know the truth. I, for one, have no interest in making a franchise based on my accomplishments. " He reaches out to the small child, " You were too young for this. " " Only high schoolers can be so racist at my age. That doesn't make any sense to me. " " B-but you certainly tried, why then? " the young child asks. " You were afraid of what you'd never learn or maybe you never would, but not magical insight. I thought that you'd be well treated, but that doesn't make any sense for a child that controls his own mind. A boy mind is just *normal*, it can't throw its own punches. He was like you except stronger, never going to any trouble, we all know he has ways beyond just magic. " " Magic isn't what you expect! " the director exclaims clearly upset. Zephyr simply shook his head, " Magic never does what you want it to do, It is not what is needed, it is no different from anything. " " I'm getting right on- " he interrupts, but is interrupted by a loud bang, " IN THE ARM! HOLD YOUR FUCKING BOOBS! You can't be a terrible director! No one can be like that! Not even yours! " Zephyr flips through the movie and looks over to where the director is huddled as he runs over with the camera. " You don't know what you've gotten yourself into? Our public has high expectations, especially in magical subjects. Were you not taught a wide range of subjects that could be both dangerous and inherently dangerous? That is beyond me! " " I'm going to tell you a secret! Someone who is perfectly normal is way smarter than us. Someone you were raised with as children you would have as your parents will always be intelligent. " " How did that come to be? " asks the director as he looks down with fear on his face. Zephyr quietly answer, " Our parents refused to tell me. Their life story was awkward to the point where no one could figure out their own story. Their story was true. Their story didn't even age. " " Oh thank goodness." The director said with a tear rolling down his face as he adds, hoping that the last few bits will get his hopes up a little bit. Zephyr feels as if he is getting a little taller, maybe five feet, in the break room. He nods his head as if to indicate that he's grateful. He leads the way to the kitchen and closes the door behind him. He looks around at the large amount of police officers surrounding him, but only to see their guns pointed at him as he gets to his feet. He looks back at the cameras, will another movie open soon?<|endoftext|>

The infinitesimal angle of my window cuts my view to the Earth below, and the only way to a dangerous portion of the orbit is by that slight submissing of the ground. My dad taught me not to wear this, but on that fateful night the two bombs rained down on us, our lives were in jeopardy. Despite being under the Dome, we could see missiles flying through the sky and all around us. The blast was tremendous, and they were because we couldn't even move - it was too blinding. I prayed that I'd hear what people had spoken of in the broadcasts, watching their families among the pandemonium. She'd finally left the room to climb the stairs, and she'd noticed me just in time. I looked out into the street, watching the sirens slowly rise from the street and the flaming, streaming swarm of fire. The sky, now showing red, and slowly extending upwards, was a darkness that even the clouds didn't seen coming - only a faint shadow, if you could even call that. As I climbed, I looked into my friends' faces and made sure my voice wouldn't betray me. Even though the world seemed happy for us - especially in a middle age family where both my dad and my twin sister were on the verge of tears - now it seemed as if everyone's clothes were getting darker and darker, so he was speechless to everyone around him. As I began to walk over to the crowd, I barely noticed the silhouette of someone close to them, growing more comfortable around the shadows. A small child with a shy smile blinked at me as I pushed them against the sides of the rubble. He felt a sudden, overwhelming urge to break his gaze and bark angrily at me. Instinctively, I lifted the children up, and began running back out of the rubble. In a single moment, he never even noticed the hellfire exploding outside - he wouldn't for a second think that I could do it... I kept going, running faster, never letting him catch up. As I grew closer and closer to the wreckage, I heard what he would like to hear. His voice that would surely bring the world down. I did it... I made it. I didn't stand much longer. I managed to reach my goal, and I was obliterated, but the bullet had already zoned out on me, and I began to fall. It was too late. As I reached my top floor in an attempt to escape, it happened so quickly. Instead of simply moving like normal, I was reduced to a grey cloud, my body becoming red with it. As I tried to slow my descent, all around me, people screamed and ran, looking so terrified. The echoes of that fateful evening filled my ears, and I knew I was doomed. My survival will be painfully obvious. I turned to look through the debris, only to see a man with a smoking gun shoved back into the building with a big smile on his face, and nobody else at all around him. The silence was deafening. All that was left was to watch as another bomb exploded, and the temperature of the Earth rose.<|endoftext|>

"Hey everyone, today is one of those days! I look just like my wildest dreams, yes, I go as near as a giant version of myself, what do you mean?'Playing guitar'? Anyone here knows that. " " Alrighty then, everyone get yourselves ready! I will all parade you out to the stage in my best " I feel like that last part was too good. God damn everyone. " Well now let me show you my powers, we've got lots here for you guys to see! " Asks a small guy standing in the back row. The crowd goes wild, one man is already shouting at anyone in attendance to move like a man, who was sitting a few rows away from the front and suddenly a person bursts out of the crowd. A large transparent camera in the back of the auditorium rolls across the room as the audience comes out of their seats and applauds loudly. " Everyone! " an announcer says to his group as I stand, the crowd disperses as everyone slowly watches me get the ear of the movie ’ s lead character. " But dear, my powers are nothing like those freak show people! Now " says the supervillain. " I wish I could help, you are all doomed if you don't, you are only the worst of worst, no one can stop you guys " he looks down at his feet, without a trace of a twinkle to his dark suit. " Now, thanks for the applause, everybody, the movie is still shooting, so lets go to theatre until people arrive" The security guard that stormed into the auditorium just from the sight of me- he has no idea the scale of the problem. But surely I am something far worse! Who am I to stop the movie producers, am I such an idiot? At least I am not gay or anything.<|endoftext|>

I hate it when they spit and whisper here. " We should not dig here ". I shudder sometimes. " We must bury in this grave ". They both know this, of course. Mark, Mark had always been one for telling such things, spreading lies about all the old bones and flesh rotting in other graves. I asked him if he even knew how to do that, and he said no, didn't know how. Now he was at the top of the staircase and I felt the weight of everything crashing into me. " Mark. Mark, find me an answer ". " Mark, what are you waiting for? " I shout down the stairs. " It's ok. " This really hurt my eyes, but when we dug I could still hear the cries of the children. How could they know where they lived? I tried to rub them, but they all just kept on fumbling around, while my efforts were futile. They kept on trying to find some way to find the buried graves! " What in the name of God would you do if you found a near-dead secret buried beneath your feet ". My heart grew hot, my mind was racing. I'm an archaeologist, I've seen things I would never see from mere perspective. " Mark... What? " I asked. " It's on the table. " Mark said, still staring at the dirt around him. " Is there a treasure here? " I said, when I pushed the hole a little further. " Mark, there it is."<|endoftext|>

The rip in the wood was an odd choice I thought. The rattling in the truck could've meant a stupid gurney, but I decided that would be an appropriate way to call it anyways. I though about hand writing my poem while walking home. Sprawling our shared yard was easy enough, with it's cheap acoustics and a particularly long bed, living really tight. I didn't mind the silence, any where in the house became visible. Entering the house this time, the noise sent chills down my spine. Turning off the shower he hadn't cleaned in days, instead the floorboards began to slide open. I quickly found the small mailbox. The front had a frosted stone frame with brass knobs, covered by long sleeves and right through the door. Except the porch stairs were otherwise perfectly level. I opened the door to find a stewardess, standing near the stove. " Mr. Van, we have an appointment, " she smiled as she slid her coat to the ground, " Today is the big day. First of all, we've got to know if we can pick up a little extra pick-me-up money. Right now, they're out of our system. " And I put my feet on the coffee table in between the chipped and worn mottled wood. The freshly washed beans that I got were where they went. Second, Mr. Van said to me, " On the table today, we have a chance to pick up on important things. First, there are all the donations that you made to the Greater Good, and the charities you chose to help. So, you know what, I know what we can do. If we can keep moving and getting the ball rolling, we're going to be able to look after ourselves. And, you know, God bless all of us. " Her words were more clear than I can have imagined. " Well, Mr. Van, this is it. It can't wait. If we're not going to fuck up the plan, we need to get to it, right? Right now, we're dooming the town. " She laughed, but finally she held the gag on the edge of her mouth. " Mr. Van, if we don't get to the big day tomorrow, we'll be back to nothing. And there's nothing we can do about that. " The smell of the ground across my feet grew. I wanted to forget about this place for a moment. She was right. I looked in the mirror and my soul was slipping away. I turned around. In the closet, with the frazzled shirt and overmatched tie underneath, my chest felt heavy. Suddenly, I felt a slim, wet sensation seep from the end of my shirt. I felt it lurch to the side. The engine slammed the engine and I know the sound of the car hitting the ground. My heart raced. At first, I thought it was a car accident, but the car was in all the wrong places. Slowly, I crept through the open door, following the light. It was a small room, with a bed, but I could see the bed itself. Now, I know why I was here. I thought I would sacrifice my mind for the most important thing in the world. My mind was filling in the details of the room. There was a lamp, a mantle and a table. And the bed. That's when I spotted it. A tiny dust cloud. I looked at it, and my heart warmed. I lifted the lamp over my head. It was perfect, almost enough. In fact, I could almost hear my heart beat louder with each vibration. I knew it couldn't have been that big. I rushed over to it, grinning. " What a great idea, kid!" A horn sounded.<|endoftext|>

They say you can't stop waking up. But I can fix that if you go to sleep. I've always told the universal lie, you can't sleep because you're awake. Most people went about their daily routine like that. What do people mean awake though? Some woke up. Sometimes you lost your eyelids while you were dreaming. It wasn't that everyone woke up the same. When I remember how many nights I slept I remember waking up every few days with the same dream I had last night. But if I start to dream right before my alarm starts, there's another one in my nightmares. That's where we've been apart for years and years. Everything is just different, at night, it can feel like your mind isn't fully prepared for something. I think you might be doing something a bit out of character lately. There's this song on shuffle on the radio that I secretly like. I had heard it for a few minutes when I was drunk on alcohol. " The day we met, we were born. Nobody was ever expecting it. It never came. And we were never happy."<|endoftext|>

My life was normal. I worked at a fast food restaurant with my name tag on everyone. Today is Friday and it's time to talk to the rentier. I ask why he's here. His yellow hair and red suit seemed strange to him and I check his breast pocket to make sure I don't need to say anything. "Hello.. my name is Jean-Paul. " He replied, staring straight ahead. What type of weird man could he be? " Do you mean yourself? " I immediately snapped the look out of him as if it was my fault. " Uhhh yeah. Wan na come in? " He nodded as he walked into the kitchen. " Now then. How long have you been around? " He said as he turned to walk out the door. " How do you know me? " His eyes widen as he rips open the front door with a stomp. This is it! He slams it and walks out the door, yelling out to the next person that comes in. What was going on here!? What the hell was I thinking? I walk towards the counter and get the first response. " Hi! Hey Jean-Paul! " " Yes, I'm Bob! Are you uh.. are you okay? " He stops the pace. " Uh... yeah, great. I hope you won't mind that. Sooo. What's your name? " Bob goes quiet, but I shake my head. " Jean-Paul? That's weird? Oh my god. Can you try it? " Jean-Paul gets up and walks towards my couch. " You just look like I thought you would. You look amazing looking at the bed! " And just like that, Bob has started to wake up. " Awww! What kind of pings is this! " I turn to see a look of concern in his eyes as he starts screaming. " I don't know! What's going on? I thought I noticed a regular today! Oh my god! " I scream at him. " Chris! Are you alright? What were you saying? " He grabs at his shirt, trying to find his shirt. " Oh no! No, not Chris! That's the nurse! Why do you always need my help so late at night?!! " I scream back into Bob's chest. " Chris, you've been taking all my medications, it's good you're coming out. It's getting tiring." As I run to catch him up I fall to the ground. I rush to him and call 911. I've never seen any blood so red before.<|endoftext|>

John pulls out his phone to mosey over to his wife, who was holding his husband at gunpoint. The two were gaily playing an Xbox 360 holoprojector. The door opened with a pantomime of a Michael Jackson sci-fi horror movie scene. Looking around the apartment, John and wife stared at their messy apartment, dumbstruck. John stopped for a moment at the phone, grabbed it, and answered the phone. "Its Michael Jordan. I know that the ice probably happens, but fuck you yeah. " " And what type of ice is that? ", said John, drooling. "' Ice I think. Pink'A version of black o' neon. Whoa man, this really is weird right? I thought we didn't have Ice in our genetics anyway. How do you feel about the whole obsessive hunting thing going on with that. " " Well man, this has got to be new, and I guess we got to kill eachother in the dream, like we did with that Call of Duty, but we are so much older than'Michael's Dad'. Fucking outdated. " " Get out, get out. " " What? " " Take this shit. You know how this takes off- I think this is gon na be pretty epic, whatever, I'd give it a shot. " " What if I started a real world scenario, then make me into Michael Jackson? " " That just wouldn't work, Mary- that's what I said it was, you know? I've never met a real *Michael Jordan*. Oh look, I don't think we have to shoot eachother here at the exact same time... I think we should just cut to the chase then. " " Oh, yeah. Hell of a plan. Just put us back here on that day and give us the pleasure we deserve, right? " " Nah, the story needs to stay for like two weeks after we reset the simulation. " " Okay, okay, fine. Be nice. " " Besides, I'm from here so I should tell you something. Time travel isn't foolproof like putting everyone back when they happen to be on each other's throats. Maybe? Are you sure? " " Fuck it, jesus, let's kill eachother fucking Eric from 3am to 2am. I guess killing us in space is way cooler than being found out dead. Maybe? " " It was fun to play, I didn't like Jimmy and Jesse from 1am to 10am and let me say I was a bit nervous about that. But you know what? I think this is going to work. I really want you to get the fuck out of my house. That's why I wrote down my date of death on the side- so you know, put us back on our cars if you didn't think so... ummm, sure, that'd be cool. " John hands the gun to his wife, and she climbs down the stairs, tense. They lock eyes, and the gun shoots and Sarah grabs the handle, telling her to blow him right through the car window. But the doorbell rings, and John puts the gun against their heads. " Tom, Frank, Matt, and myself, coming, we're practically aliens."<|endoftext|>

On this cursed plain. I have seen men die so young, so young that what would a mere mortals believe would be old. I have seen men would be rested before they rotted, so it is for no man that they shall be Restored. "It was on the tenth try that I accidentally knocked over my watch. A gun went off by accident." It says in the dust-laden sky and far above the human clothes. It stops at the end of your last breath and records that every life, that moment of that life, that hour of every life. “ I don ’ t know how long you have survived. This one has been living a little longer. It ’ s a shame that some of it ended up dead. Maybe even something small. ” The visible hand comes to settle, and I have three arrows to my side. I stand and blink my very eyes. There is nothing I can do. “ You better think about it… We ’ ve been traveling since you took that giant bite off the spear. ” A curtain falls closed and the light ’ s hanging around me. A very familiar cloak is draped over my shoulders. There ’ s a painting in front of me. My heart jumps as I look at its luminescence. It sets about its work. I ’ m not always on the hunt. You wonder where the archers are. They said they were there to hunt, but I didn ’ t. And while there were people fighting, I didn ’ t. My prey was small enough to hide just to watch. I find the closest the ‘ people ’ know me and set to killing. The arrow hits my shoulder. And a pain pierces through the air. Cold air seeps into my lungs and covers my whole face. “ I don ’ t think I can kill the dragon as well, ever again. ” The haze settles and I see the dragon perched in front of me. It ’ s wings flap as it lets go of me. The air rushes out around me and I ’ ve no arms. “ I feel the cold. I feel the fire. ” I am so tired of lying to myself. You think your last breath will last. They take the dying one with them and they take the living one with them as well. They put a claymore in his final hour. They paint a picture of him and then they kill him. The Gods and the Sheik stick glue and milk over the bodies and feed it onto the humans. And then the wood burns and their bones shatter. “ He was younger. He was waiting for his turn. He waited for his turn. He was ready to die. ”<|endoftext|>

When she stole my wallet, I paid. I ducked into her room. "Who are you? " I shouted. " Please, she needs me, " she shouted back. I opened her tiny hole in my bedroom. Warm blood flowed down. " Let's go! " she shouted. I jumped into bed with her. She was cute. Beautiful. I dropped into bed, forcing her to play with her toys. She scurried outside. She was cute. I could see her beautiful handprints crisscrossing my window. They were the Silliest. The most Beautiful. Her home and the papers in the front. I ran into her apartment. By the door. My wife barged in. " Hi, I'm Amy - " " I knew who you were! " " Why hello! " She yelled, when she saw me. " Do you need help!? " " Let me meet your mother. " " The only reason I can trust you is because I need money." She tossed her book in my slot and disappeared. Amy could never get money in my time. I saved up enough to buy some clothes. She was only 10 feet away and it was a small city airport. She was just 15 feet away and I must admit I had some trouble sleeping with her. I would have been so happy to see her instead if the meds wouldn't have killed me. I became lonelier. I never came home safe. I never met my child. A college student who saved up cash for a year. A couple who were so ridiculously attractive. Another who was drunk. Another who was a perv who'd caught my kids cheating. I never got an engagement. I never met my wife.<|endoftext|>

I'm no expert at photography. I've never seen a sun set on a camera like it, so I was one of the first ones to see the star, sun, from the start and then the moon from that point on. I was curious, of course. How the hell are you supposed to shoot a sun that's named planet from the last thing you saw from that angle? But I was also curious. I wanted something in the sky. I wanted something that looked like Mars. A planet that everyone knew of. A little grainy, maybe. But for me, the sky itself would be perfect. Maybe I could create some sort of nice confection out of it. I could end up on an asteroid. We all do it. You see, I was just about to move on to human beings. At first, it was weird, but after about an hour of waiting, everything got much simpler. I worked for a company called Glide, and it was a time capsule. It was about 25 metres across and weighed three tonnes. What happened to all that space? Well, after a day of concentration, or maybe hours of looking in the right direction at a light and knowing it was night, I had the idea to start applying pressure. So I punched in a few numbers, moved my screwdriver around. No pressure anything. I tried adjusting the setting, and then staring at it. Nothing. So I adjusted it again. Even out there in the desert, in space, and on a rock, there was nothing to adjust it. Instead, I got a little camera, and actually took some pictures, just in case. By the time I was done with them, they were fine. But they weren't photos. They were probabilities. And I had a much deeper study about how the numbers were derived. So I picked up one and stuck it up to a few cameras around the sun. The shot revealed my location. A post-apocalyptic world, lit up by no star, crowded by people cheering, carrying weapons, and being at war. A dead, god-forsaken, desolate world, perfectly strewn with blood and stuff. Some people were devout, holding these strange beliefs. Others were truly confused, fearing to come out alive like a different person. No idea why. I took the picture, and took another, and another, and waited. It was almost 6 am when I gave up and went back in, picked up the picture, and read the line of code. Of course, it all ended up in the mailbox. All kinds of religious texts and the like. A little briefcase in a corner. I had pulled that one out and read it. It was a note that said, "1 week. Death". Thank god.<|endoftext|>

I felt content. More than ever, I would. But, now I didn't like her. She seemed happy to be there in the office, so I guess I didn't really get it. It's somewhat possible that I was just shy and reserved to work. "I know. So can we do a wedding in a few months? " She asked. So we sent out the invitation. It was a promise, somehow. You see, I'll be the lucky man when it all clicks, and I'm not exactly God's promised bride. I look up at her and I see that I know what we're doing, and I smile and sign on the dotted line. She makes a lovely gesture toward me and hugs me. " Goodness, you look fantastic today, " she said. " It looks like tomorrow, right? " " My Wife has died. I work today. Good day to you too, Great.

A *normal* person was always made of henchmen to protect themselves, but the latter were not meant to leave this world. Today, his ex-girlfriend, Kim very clearly was stolen. He'd been told to get the maid to their mansion, which was much less diplomatic than he'd originally thought. Halfway there, he'd look into her eyes and see a smirk from the blonde hair, "Tch, what's your point? " His clothing smelt of five-pocket cigarettes, and a meal of ice cream. A chest, his own heirloom, four jeans, socks, and a long sleeved suit. The fight was just over ten minutes long, and only certain bystanders saw him, the police, or the witness team, not far behind. A young man with a spy rifle was coming up next, Kim too. " Fine, " the retired professional hissed to him. " I'll run, " he answered with a voice cracked, " and I can't stop the idiots from raiding your property. " " Why didn't you just tell me? " The retired professional replied with a slim hand over his mouth. " No, ma'am, I just wanted to tell you a secret. " " Why'd you do this? I didn't want to see a sorry excuse, wouldn't I? A need I can never use. " " Shut up, " the retired professional shouted, and, stepping towards the door. They walked past it, and each step made the door slide open with a clank. Kim opened the door into the mansion. Only one window was visible in the room. There was a single window across from the window in the back, open wide enough for everyone to see it. The figures were a very assortment, ranging from completely silent robotic character to warmhearted child. One by one they ascended the steps towards the exit. Jim Wilde, Kim's ex-girlfriend, moved out of the way and remained in the room. He'd been right all along, but she had just started getting out of it. Kim huffed into his hand. " What can you do? " Jim repeated. " Hunt them down like you do to the guys who win! " " Good, " the retired professional replied, and then pressed a button. -- - " Copy, " shouted a voice from the end of the building. On the wall, the headquarters of the Global Union of Superhumans was visible. " Miss Kim, looks like you fell asleep! You were supposed to get me in here so we can start tracking down all of these idiots at once! You're interrupting the fight?! " Kim sank his head into his hands, shaking. On top of him, two armoured figures appeared. " What?! " An old man with a large metallic bat hovered in the middle of the room, looking out the window on to a far side of the room. His hair was wild and pale as the moonlight, and his helmet shone almost painfully bright in the dim light. He swung his massive bat at the five officers in the front of the room, before the “ hit ” commenced. On the bodies of Jim Wilde and Kim Wilde, the old man with the bat grinned with a knowing grin. When the henchmen overrode their defensive motions, Kim stood up and checked his outfit for something. If anything, Kim broke the gaze of the last three officers in the room. " You didn't just have a bat? An axe, a cane, and a rocket launcher? " " Are you surprised I don't have a sonic boomerang?" -075<|endoftext|>

I was smarter than anyone knew what to do. I spent the next hour typing and laughing about it. Really, no surprise that the gods were watching. I spent the next hour wondering what to do with myself. My war room was the first to break, everyone with access to it was gone, and I'd done everything I could to get a little more in return. A bullet hit me, and I let go, letting go of all I held. Everyone ( everybody ) went dead. There were no further questions. It wasn't exactly the first time. I mean, I was barely losing ground. I'd done it by now, but my every beat depended on it, and I wasn't sure what the hell it'd be like to just walk around while the gods were playing. I'd reached the cosmos.

The Tree looked like it was made of wolves. I have just been picking pine for 3 years now. It doesn't always look like trees, it's not like they look like wolves, it's just more of a worn out canopy. It's a beautiful thing but it's all the same stuff. The core is hard. So hard it can fall apart sometimes. It's made to get no sun. Never able to keep temperature just right. Those who wish they could. It's damaged almost all the way up the root, still looking right to me. I see a few more cracks, I see the size of bears. They went from big pebbles to nothing but petals. I can't count the number of pines, even the ones I've left to the side all over the road. So this small branch is sharp, though it won't tear it down. My only thought is when it's not a tree the sand is cracking in your fingers. Maybe when it's full it'll be used for plants, also no one will ever get rid of it. And if those rats can't get it they will leave.<|endoftext|>

"I wouldn't even like that, what did I do? " " Who... in fact, is that you? You shouldn't even be here. What did you do? " " Um... wh- " " You know, the other people, " Chuck scratched his head. The man nodded, catching a glance of his watch, " they said I was actually a schizophrenic. " He shook his head. " That can't be. That... could you... how *far*? " He peered around at the scattered buildings. He knew he had to be where he was, but that didn't mean this man was crazy, either. The man scratched his head again. " So... did you have anything to drink? " Chuck asked. " Not really. You know, I wouldn't really drink it. It doesn't taste good, so I kept it bottled. " " Is there an alternative? " Chuck asked in a tired, raspy voice. " No, " the man nodded. " Not really. I'm just curious. " The man opened the fridge, pulling out some fine cologne. * Fat lime? * He glanced at Chuck. Something was different. " What is it? " Chuck asked. " It's gon na rain. I can feel it already. There's nothing, really, about it. I guess the alternative is closer to home." Chuck threw the on-looking glass of sicko he had got for his normal Halloween party party in front of his neighbors. Shaking his head, the man took a step towards him, his pale blue light shining off of him like a lighthouse. His eyes widened and he knelt down. Before he could say anything, the light fell on the man. The man smiled wider, but by that point he was already gone. *** My apologies if this is in a bad way. Hope you enjoyed the prompt.

You see, I have always thought human life came from experience. I have always told myself that this is some sort of dystopian fantasy story, but for that I must disagree. Humanity was given a thought based upon our own experience of our own species. We were asked to eliminate our own animal nature and instincts. They tried, they tried. The desire was enormous. So much so that we wanted to share it with others in hopes of creating a better world. It turns out, after all, almost everyone there has changed in a large way due to how much time and effort they must put into it. Without enough time to adjust to this new society, the biggest obstacle has arisen. Sure, we will make mistakes in this life, but we are part of a greater, greater company. We are beings with a purpose, not mindless automatons that can make decisions, but those with the ability to move a bit of matter through space and time. Human beings did not sit on their laurels anymore. They lacked the needs to apply themselves to others, so they lived a slightly skewed view of themselves. This is the truth, because here there is none left. Some human in certain areas of the galaxy are simply easier to identify with, others avoid or disregard it. As this tension grows, we are forced to face the adversity we have come to face, but don't say I am a bad person. I do believe in change, but I have also always wondered, why we are not the same. What do you do when the issue is so great that not everything you do will actually be okay?<|endoftext|>

I stood, throwing my hands over my mouth and staring as the sun began to set. I was alive, smart, and poised. They would like me. They would want me, for nothing, in a state of pure entitlement and pure entertainment. The god looking down flashed a beautiful smile at me, and I stared in utter confusion. I stood, disgusted and speechless. "Hey! It was just a lab-coat strike-job. Hey Jabba! " My response immediately betrayed him. " What's the problem? " I asked myself. " They're all thinking what was that?! " In the past, the world had been called one of overpopulation, pushed almost to the point of extinction. Now that the rats and everything that used to be humans occupied our land, there seemed nothing we could do. " Sorry Jabba, but you'll have to leave first. " I spoke hesitantly. " Why? " He looked the same, he seemed to understand. " Our food supply is decreasing. To be honest, you better put it in perspective. " " Are you really thinking I'm being awfully ironic? " The strike looked awkward and stared at me in a sick parody of my last words. " You couldn't have the airlock! " I struggled, and as I tried to light the fire at Jabba, it ignited and shattered. My mouth did the same, but my mouth managed to stoke the fire. Then there was silence, not because of any physical differences, but because my screams seemed like normal human voices. " You know what? " He said, a voice somewhere deep in his brain. " You *know* why I'm here. Maybe it was my sick joke- " " C'mon Jabba, just fuckin' shut it! " He stormed off, mouth open. I stayed the next half an hour, and I stumbled out of the basement to find what was chasing me. Some metal was flung from the ceiling, and, even worse, me. Well, not dead. Just horrific. " Seriously?! " I yelled at the top of my lungs. As the metallic instrument-thing settled down, I forced my voice into a sing-song state. " What if we bite? " I yelled back. " Huh? What would they think if we bite one? " " Hypothetically? They would think the crap out of us. It's kind of boring, trying to kill themselves. " One of the scientists at the wing detached his ears, and he whispered, " you do realize what they'd do? Their experiments on themselves would show that there's a limit to survival. " He crossed his arms and clasped his hands together. " I'd never blame them. The research would show that they're all just extremely *un*? " Then I heard it, and the room erupted in " humanity's " roar. " They had us! " the scientists shrieked. " Everyone's turning into their own fucking pigs!"<|endoftext|>

She is dead, again. Well, you might know. Over the last 6 decades, you've recovered. More akin to a heart than a brain. Not all of these suckers are dying well. Some merely collapse or overdose from insomnia, lung cancer, toxicology, surgery... on and on... until you don't die at all. To know how it feels to feel a root under a rock is a challenging experience. But here I am, again. Standing on the precipice of this hill and seeing that you have left. I remember the silver off their faces, the tears that fall down my face. You said that your eyesight has returned, but I know they only look back. I closed my eyes to steady them. Before I began breathing, you had called for me to come back. But it is not as though I wanted to. Your face was no longer pure. It was, instead, a complex scar-like rock and an abyss. I can not even blame you... but you remained your most loyal lover. A beacon of humanity and a white light in the dark. As I sit on the broken hill, the peace from my time on earth still cowers inside me, knowing that my love for you is over. That I will be parted from this earth by your fire-filled embrace.<|endoftext|>

Clothes pulled out, Jason holstered the spare, and as they hurried to remove the last of the loose clothing they were holding, walked around. He reached into the bag of spare cargo and dropped his shiny silencer. Silencer falling from his sweaty palms, Jason clambered out of the bus car and out onto the outskirts of town. They walk for a few minutes with the city center, save for a jog that needed to be completed in 15 minutes. He sat down in one of the chairs of the yellow station, watching the bus's abandoned buildings follow his gaze. On the screen was an old black coffee mug floating in the air. The mug was roughly the size of a small laptop. Thinking of the coffee, Jason made a mental note to put a mug on the desk as well, and immediately drank his coffee. He washed his hands on the hot towel to let them clean up. The mug looked especially pretty. There was an old leather looking paper written on it, on which was printed the name of the creature that gave the idea for the contraption that took over the town from the bus. Jason flipped through the blueprints, searching for a corresponding photo of the school bus that he had been on the morning of the bus. He was nearly to the gym when he noticed something above his head in his peripheral vision. It was the first thing that he noticed immediately after a light fuzz filled his eyes. *This appears to be proof that it is indeed just a paper produced coffee mug. * Something clicked. Jason stepped off the bus, and saw the same thing now at the junction where he had parked it. "Hey, " he called out to the now getting boy. " What the hell are you doing up here? " " Uh, yes, it is fairly... " " So, you're a paper mage? " " No. I'm only an apprentice. " Jason leaned forwards, hoping to catch up to the boy. " Good enough. Let's get started. " Jason picked up his bag and trundled down the hill onto the street. " Yeah, like that, that's right, thanks for opening up the shop. " Jason turned around, and continued on down the road, then stopped at a gas station for another gallon of water. He got to the front door and began rummaging through the dusty bags before disappearing into a cloud. *Why was there no coffee in my wallet? * Jason turned around to find the cashier. " I'll take the two dollars that you left here. " " Why? " " Then, that's all you'll ever need. Thanks again. " Jason flipped the plastic cover off and took a look at the nameplate. It was green, the text was just the outline of the process running down the plastic. He flipped the switch to switch off the steam. The machine began to burn. Jason plopped onto the curb, his head spinning, eyes darting between the two humanoid shapes. *I mean, * he thought, " In this world, all you have to do is hold the book. And at the bottom of that, there's a button. " He reached down to grab the spout of the coffee, but the papers sucked out of the paper. " Are you sure that this is the right way to go? " " Maybe, if I'm lucky, it can save my life. " The paper levitated off the ground. " That's cool, " he chirped, and re-wound the paper. " You won't be able to read it, and you can't replace the old one. What the hell kind of deal is this? " " Give me fifty dollars, and I'll give you a ton of money. Or six more dollars. I don't have much choice. " The paper roared, as did Jason's glasses. " Good luck, fly my friends."<|endoftext|>

He was nervous. Ripped off his cape and strapped to his body, he stood, skin covered in shadows. Pompous and nervous he walked towards me, though I almost couldn't see his face. He was nervous too, though I couldn't quite remember what I said. “ I'll take care of that, ” he said quietly. I seemed to accept this. “ No. ” He wasn't sure if I was right or not. I took a step toward him. He looked back at me and smiled. He closed his eyes. I smiled back and continued. I wasn't ready for what was to come. He opened them, and I saw a mighty sword laying on his feet, it was resting under his chin. The blade glowed orange and red, something bright and magical. He shifted his weight and pointed it towards me. And one swift motion, his fist knocked the blade to the ground.<|endoftext|>

"Here she lies, under the stars, dead, " was all he could do to pull her into the warmth of his arms. " Yes, " he said to her through his closed eyelids, " " I must see her. " She'd left him moments ago, then she'd left the warehouse. He'd never felt so alone, the love in her eyes... there was only one thing they could do now, leave her, and dance, for the rest of their lives, wouldn't you? His eyes flashed with light, although she still had nothing else to do but watch them. She'd been living alone in her apartment, alone, when everything changed. He'd moved to the apartment, ever since she'd left for college, there was little she could do other than spend time with her books, work, play, celebrate... I'd seen more, he'd seen how the life had changed after she'd left for her job in an off-campus research institute, there was still more to the life than her name truly represented. But he'd seen her... too, she was certainly beautiful now. That was her beauty now. That was how he felt she'd come along so quickly, and yet he was ready to see her again. He'd managed to do so much research back home, data was finally being quantified, working, studying... working until there was nothing left but data and chaos, and she was prepared to be taken out of that, with no hand in her life and no chance of survival. He'd learned that in moments like these, that only works and never fails. He'd been preparing for this moment for years. But it was too late. He watched her, taking everything in. Closing his eyes, he laid her back into the moonlight. " You promised her the world and now here she lays, under the stars, dead, " was all he could do to pull her into the warmth of his arms.<|endoftext|>

So it was a turning point of the next century. The New Years Movement was met with widespread approval and marvelous contributions from young physics majors with days long past, the New Years would be a wonder to behold. When we entered the year 2075 we realized that the galaxy we shared was old, and we looked to the cosmos to see if we could expand our reach. We, a collective of 6 million, had managed to decipher the first transmissions from the galaxy, each linked to a countdown timer. There was a rumour that someone had been sending this broadcast as a quick way of throwing off balance and drawing a crowd. The major nations scrambled to respond to their gifts and to communicate with us to try to deter the attacks. Finally, in light of the Royal Commission we were able to bring our hand to her aid. Standing by her side, in no small caliber, the Princess Nina of the Bahamas, having just finished a ceremony to honour her sixtyth birthday we took her hand in our own and stuck our hands out. She looked up at me for a brief moment, her eyes darting around as if in a trance as the entire metropolis below decked in extravagant fireworks. As we boarded the Royal Commission, a conversation came up over the intercom that was buzzing around in hushed tones. "What brings you to this station? It's running low on new years, " murmured Nina, " your Majesty. " A century later we gather the final data from the station. We locate the ship, find a room near the fireplace and reach for the communicator. They tell us that the First Ordinance had been signed but that was the last thing the board spoke. This meant a second document had to be handed in so that the orders and guidance could be delivered to the council. A week later the Council appears upon the planet they stand upon and announces to the world that we, as the InterGalactic Explorers, have found a small box where the message clearly was printed on it. The implications are unquenchable and the whole planet trembles when we take notice. " All procedures have been followed, " they say, closing the communicator and whispering. " We're on way, " we whisper, the resonance of the transmissions beginning to die out. It was finally time. The committee was up, sealing the doors. " Oh dear, where does this come from? " asked a young physicist asked, his pencil paper oozing from his cuff as he wiped the dust from his grimy hands. " Look, if it makes you feel any better, you haven't spoken to anyone and after researching the message for your Grandfather it is now very clear it must have come from one person. " He cleared his throat, " Also we don't know why we are using the ships help... to see what lies beyond. It's a very big box, but it seems we can unlock a thousand layers within a single instant. " The young physicist opened the door and stepped inside, " Have a great time, my two best men."<|endoftext|>

Have you ever had a bit of a moment of serenity as you get to know a lot of people and come to understand that there is almost a common understanding of everything, even there are times when you really thought nothing of it anymore? After a while, another person, another friend, you could call them their friends or maybe even a stranger. I think you get used to that after a while, even if you don't want to admit it to yourself, it isn't something people really talk about. I remember a few of my friends saying to me once that it was ok to worry about things too early, but I honestly didn't really understand it. I decided that I would just be patient for a while, before picking up this girl and telling her that I knew about her and she didn't need to worry about the things she didn't need to worry about as much as she does, which is why I was here when it happened. It was dark. I could smell the trees and the grass and the gentle breeze blowing through the cabin and I could hear birds chirping, the birds howling as the air rippled through the cabin and here I was surrounded by peace and softness, I knew that the humans weren't just scared of me, even though they are strange like that and that's why I was alone in the cabin and not bothering to think about it much longer than necessary. But suddenly, a knock on the door sounded off at the far end of the cabin, I started to panic and was absolutely shocked when I heard someone say "Incoming ". I was confused and scared, I remember they'd taught me the importance of keeping silence, even if it was " unnecessary", but they definitely changed the tone of what they were talking about. I didn't understand at first, what was going on and more scared to me was that I knew something was wrong with this humans, but after being of the mindset of a disbeliever, I realized that this was an odd set of customs and a distasteful thing at the same time. I couldn't believe my eyes, I'd seen something like this before, this alien spaceship comes down and that's where I went.<|endoftext|>

We were locked in a stasis pod, with only the lead tube in between us. The pods to the coast were dedicated to our eternal vision. But this was not a very good pod. With the pod facing the whirlpool in the harbor, the death of the ship triggered the collision course. A thump reverberated over the water. A loud thump shook the other pod. And then there was a crack. It was then, that I realised the floor had been torn upwards. It was then that my vision started to fade. My vision had to be rewound somehow.

Slaymurt walked down the streets of the manor full of residents. Slyurs threatened to break out if they didn't- Many would come from the few local haunts he passed, but his mind wandered back to his young mother once she had taught him to read. He didn't remember her exact name, much less the source of her rippling hair as she carved a word into the sandstone beneath him. Not that it mattered. The details left a little enigma for the thief. These days, many of the people who owned the houses in the centre of the town, the city, claimed to have seen manors turn into quarries, a place where people ploughed up mountains for oil or farmers harvested crops, using the land to build industrial villages. This was no ordinary quarring village, however. In fact, it was something else entirely. In the middle of the town, upon the outskirts of a town, a huge green rock fell out from under the grey sky, creating an open space for it to consume. The rocks absorbed the solar wind and made the town invisible. Slyurs and other people were caught without facing detection, and so far he had had no leads to his parents. "Mother, it seems the rock belongs to a lion. " He said to himself. Only a few days later, he drove a car up into the cities surrounding the town. If the rock fell in another city, it would damage some machines, causing some people to have bandages. He had two options- He could stay behind and find the rock, or he could leave behind the rock and return to his hut or send a messenger, however the village didn't yet trust the messenger. Slyurs found the rock, and peered through a crack in the rock. After searching, he found one of the many bars leading from his home. The rock resembled a gazelle in the wood, meaning no one could enter the house and take the rock, regardless of whether or not it was sitting on the bar. He had to go in, so he walked carefully to the back of the rock. He was ready for his morning rituals. He carried a small sack to his small hut, and put the rock in it, placing the contents in it when he approached the door. On his way out, the guard hissed at him, slowly and quietly. No one dared approach him as he crept slowly down the mountain trail. The door swung open and he was taken aback at the sudden turn of events. Not exactly one of those who possessed the skills to repair the door, but he was carrying a really huge sack and it was bolted shut behind him. He placed the sack in the entrance, and knelt down at the door. " Well my son, I have a great surprise to deliver to you. I hope you have a pleasant new life, the kind you would enjoy in your mother's village." He whispered as he walked into the house.<|endoftext|>

We were getting used to the heat. We were four years old and had been invited to go down to the lake in the midnight hours to catch the baseball game against the Greek-Hungarian League championship game. " Jesus here, right? " I yelled to Maria as I walked in the room. My dad always said his family would be the biggest fan because it would mean a lot to them. Maria greeted us with a wave and a shake. " Are you ready? " she asked and me and her mom immediately stood up as well. They each held a family and began to chant before Maria took a step back. " Lets do it! " my mom shouted. I swung the baseball bat. It flew out like a flying football. The lot of them had to dodge it, but they managed to avoid it. We couldn't try and shield it, so we all thought maybe you could fly? The game lasted over four hours. The stadium was soft and everyone just kept to themselves. The light was dim and Maria didn't have much of a choice. She picked up her son and ran to him. My dad then took me up to the bathroom and touched my face. He said, " Your mother is nearly there. " " What... how? " I looked up from my face. I wasn't worried, though. The two of us had seen a lot of movies before. I took her hand and told her to sit down. In another few seconds, we were in front of the TV. Some news report said two of the two Roman's were having a fight to the death. We heard a man scream and then a low murmur from the crowd. I looked at my dad, suddenly all of a sudden, all I can hear is my mom and dad. All smiles and laughing go down my face. " My son! Maria! Why isn't Maria here? She was so nice to you. " Before I could say anything, our daughter took my hand, but I don't like touching anything. The next thing I knew, the stadium had fallen silent. We all looked down at the dance floor. My mother grabbed my hand. I was happy she didn't yell. They all huddled around me. The next day, I realized this wasn't the first time we had seen a Roman fight to the death. But somehow they all seemed to like it. They never stood still like that, they just kept laughing and happy to see their sports team take home the victory. My father just kept getting stoned. After an hour of running outside to go get some booze, my mom convinced me to hang out with her as the stadium was starting to fill. After a few hours of driving and drinking, we found the remnants of the stadium, but now that the green hill had fallen, we could see the 3-4 field with this big red painted paint. We all looked down at the field with anticipation and we knew something was different. Our team had scored an absurd 21 and were now sitting on the field, in one of the rows with other Roman's. " Haha! What the fuck are you doing!" a sobbering female voice yelled. As I looked up, we noticed two of the guys were kneeling around us. They were cowering like we were watching a movie, surrounded by cameras. Some of the Roman's looked mortified as well, but they were laughing maniacally. This was horrifying to watch, but we all told our families the same thing as they did. The stadium is closed.<|endoftext|>

The room was crowded, that is, except for the one young girl. She was only 5 years old, though she still had her last birthday tomorrow. She stood up and strode over to the dog, "Are you ready? " " Thank you, mom. I'm ready to go, just like dad always would. " The boy waved her off, and she sat down on the couch, watching the TV. " I'm still at home. " He said. " What did your son do? " " He wished everyone was like him, " she said, her eyes fixed on the TV. In disbelief, she glanced at her phone, and immediately hung up. " If anyone want me to tell them how wrong I was, just answer my phone. " She made her way to the fridge, and grabbed her drink. She grabbed the bottle and took a sip, then hurried off again. " Whoa there, mom! " " Don't say that, son. There's no need for this. " " What is it? " " I wish, " the boy said. " It doesn't seem like you want it. " " What's this? " " It doesn't seem like I'm going to lose anyone anymore. " " What the hell is this? " The boy put on some new clothes, grabbed the bottle of Vodka, and lit it up. " You want me to tell you, what is this?! " " You'll win if you do anything! That is the promise I made you, " she said, breaking off to look at him, " it's the only thing I will tell you about the world. " He had already broke her legs. " I'm going to run away, and destroy the world if I live, " the boy replied calmly. " What is this? " " I want to die, " he said, shaking his head. " Nobody gave me any wishes, " the boy said. " It always is okay if your just not worthy of being there."<|endoftext|>

Why did we do it? Did the world become all dirty? No, we knew that God couldn't let us stop the bad stuff. God didn't want to keep us alive, he wanted us to pray and fight them. He didn't want us to take this burden. Heaven isn't nearly as bright as Heaven is now. The wife and I are still soaked in the worst rain I have ever known. My son has been born, he can speak in very little, so his eyes are fixed upon me like a close relative, he shares my eyes like the love of my mother. The water in the pond is boiling as we think about our wife. Another peaceful lulls us off. I ’ m sure he won't remember his sister. His older brother, where abandoned? No one ever tells him of the sound of my head and the crunch of my gravel as I cradle my son once again. Outside the window, a thunder rumbles through the brown house. The wind, it made the dust seem quite ominous. Not in the way someone would think, and probably not like this... I may be tired. It must be bitterly cold in here. The night sky is filled with stars, the two of us had been with each other for many years. We spent it all in meditation; with all our hearts of hearts beating against the sand that was once dust. It feels as though the heavens themselves have gotten rid of them, torn. Clean, but no longer as dirty as the buildings on the outside. It feels like emptiness. I love you too. I embrace you as we drift back and forth through the overcast skies. I love you dearly... One day, when everything is darker, we get to home and drift away like usual. The young child swings at the window to try and warn me of the noise. Of all the things outside, his ears screams the most vicious, the horrors of the rain. He doesn't want to believe it until it comes along, something primal and heavy around him. " If he does, " my wife tells me, " he won't be here any longer. He has to go." She wraps me in one of her arms and leads me over to the bathroom, as I lock the cabinet tightly behind her. After cleaning myself out, I look down at the old TV on the wall and focus on the screen. There isn't anything but the scrolling, black and white images. No one but the wife watches these images. The world will never know about the world outside. There was once a light here. A world that we, the gods, had been created to watch over. But it does nothing to tell the existence outside the window on the outside world. The world doesn't know that heaven is empty. It doesn't know that all of life is suddenly gone.<|endoftext|>

William was left with his twin, Andrew, sitting there, the self righteous maniac running his back and forth, scrutinizing his yearly list. For Andrew it was the most important thing of his life and William was the very only one who could see it. It was a position William did not have the to lose. "Charles, " William started, but before he could put his thoughts to rest and to see the rest of the equation spread, Andrew cut him off and put his hand on his chest. " What's a human day like now? We've already traveled 100 years. Your power is immense. We have been through this before. We're both still alive. " William's eyes grew to tears and Andrew knew exactly what he was doing. He had begged William to be positive, to be friends with him. He still had plenty of time. The prophecy said that if one man died and another met their destiny, his three brothers and sisters would die and those three families would never meet again. Perhaps Andrew was right. William backed up the pace of the two. " Take your time, " William started as he started to change direction. He wished William luck if he did not mean to risk having another failure for William's name. This caused William to look over the calendar and notice it was February. April was past his eye mark. He turned to his brother and took a deep breath. " It is yet another one! " Andrew said, his words echoing in William's head. " Look at the numbers. So many places are getting close and yet they still get only one person to start a day! " William let out a sigh. " Andrew I know what it is, William, but at least we have our own day. Maybe the whole new year is the idea of doing things today? " " Right, " William snapped back. " But don't forget the new year is today, we are all new to this, some people are just to busy on the day of their death. It's a good thing we all run there at the same time. I know what I did today was all to joke about. " " You think I'm joking? " Andrew shouted. William looked down at his list and shrugged. He had become a laughing stock. He was now in a funny situation. " You could be joking, Andrew. Your family knows better than to speak ill of your savior. I would just like to offer you a few things: one, bring your luggage to my house. That won't even be necessary. Two, find you room with me. And three, ride yourself out of this curse! " Andrew reached in his pocket and pulled out a silver flask. " Can I go now? " William asked with a smile. " Great. Hope I did not mention it. May the righteous face the sun for we can cross this now. May God have mercy on us all. " William looked up at the moon and smiled, to see William descend through the skies. " Join me."<|endoftext|>

-10 years ago, an expedition found a dead volcano in the heart of Mars. Assuming that it is extraterrestrial, it kept going up, without seeming as if it is even coming back down. The climate of the mysterious planet is approaching critical temperatures, especially for stone. It would have to take some time to develop shelter, and with nothing short of a skeleton for shelter, a time where they found sanctuary. At that point, they found small specks of rock in the ground below them, and left them there. Not too long after, these markings were put on the earths surface, and people began disappearing, leaving one or two male-natures whose souls remained inside their bodies. Amongst the putrescent ground, several humans soon began to appear out of the shadows that roamed around their respective governments. This individual is now being regarded as one of the most prominent people in the world. To this day, his message is viewed as the most recognizable word in the language of the world. -6 years later, time was not easy, and people continued on their routines. Most of the local populations had drastically changed in the following years. For many people, holidays still caused them to turn to the sun, but some people just wished to spend holidays as much as they could before they feel need to return. -3 years later, the most beautiful monoliths which Earth had seen in a long, long time, have quickly appeared on a handful of remote islands, and are now thriving. Many of these complex structures have formed out of the cold rock that was once there. Many thought that life existed on this ancient alien world. Many people were not convinced that there were other life things in this world. Of course, it does not make any sense, as this planet has many special characteristics that make it very easy for humans to avoid contact with the cold, and have very low or no humidity. Many people had to resort to baking times to change their clothes, and when they were done, they began making sand colored clothes out of new sand colored sand. -2 years after the last traces of life were removed, and 2 days after the world was cleansed from scorched surface, two structures survived on their own. -1 year after completing a retrofit of the military base around the ruins of the dark ship in ancient Mars, a few soldiers, supposedly, changed to be soldiers. After weeks of doing some recreation of old life in one of the damaged portions of Mars, the soldiers were able to make new soldiers. 2 days later, another pair of soldiers, new soldiers, arrived at Mars. This time, they were dressed as soldiers, with any military title displayed on them. It was in that moment that the military reported in to Earth. -8 years after the settlement of Mars, and the investigation of new building on all land planets, the Mars spaceport was declared a historical landmark. At this time, the president of Mars, Jesus Christ, requested Mars to be settled in peace, so that possible aliens would be able to land on the land before the big wheels turn. After a month, the Mars spaceport was taken off the map, and marked all land planets as being special. It was today that the Mars spaceport was cleared of government orders to erect structures made to. -6 years later, the world is still ruled by more aliens than humans. Mars is yet to grow much. The start of an alien invasion was already planned, and more information leaked out. Due to no one, humans still make an effort to beat the alien invaders to the brink of extinction, as time goes on. It is speculated that some aliens can tear down buildings or cancel certain buildings, and that people no longer can. The exact nature of this event remains unknown, but fear of alien invasion is still widely known. -5 years later, the planets surface is at critical temperature, and there is much damage to Earth. Many of the spacecraft were seen to have been of unknown origin, and there have been reports of human bodies floating away, in varying directions or over vast distances. Earth was being attacked, and it is unknown what is happening there. -4 years ago, the most intelligent race on earth, or what is left of it, have spread throughout the world and developed vast military structures around the world. But for now, he is observing what is going on. A new planet which is capable of sustaining life has been found. The alien civilisation is yet to develop its own civilization, but it has spread to other galaxies, and is expected to be able to create a civilization from scratch. It is expected that it will find that huge life and resources, which will eventually only need to be produced from earth to survive on it. For now, none of our commenters are really interested in writing, but I wanted to do something a bit different: )<|endoftext|>

Stray spiders prey on some of their own kind and take advantage. Blood-thirsty, soulless mice. There is little body left to fight off these intruders. Sometimes my favorite to kill, but only when I'm young. The human. The queen. No, really. I've watched my parents for many millennia now. I have not learned to communicate with them. That's my sworn duty. I know I'm only a small time spider, but I've gotten along fine. People say that I am clever, but no that's impossible. A spider can't be learned. I even though I am much better at weaving webs when compared to a human. Just a spider. No flying or leaping, no feeling of shame. Only when I was curious I caught my prey. The first humans in quite some time. My parents told me that I looked different, but I told them why. They described me as a mountain spider and a spider of like mind. My parents told me that after killing my sister, I was respected, but now you do. My prey learned that someone in my fancy world now had the right to be worshipped. They knew me as the Queen of the city. And as for my parentage... I took up residency in a mansion in a tiny mountain town. The house is just shy of 2 thousand square meters. I have hired some girls with impressive bae. The humans are not known to be superstitious. They are subtle. And they might fall in love with me one day. Maybe this is the beginning of my professional career. I'm sure they find my love creepy.<|endoftext|>

Wolves need predators, and that was a problem. Unfortunately, they don't thrive in the wild. They are ravenous and vicious. The Well here has several scales that bleed like blood. The king lays slain in their wake, but they don't like that. Their venom and strength, it allows them to hunt them and to cover their caverns. They huddle and watch the Well with baited breath. They hunt for prey. Those who were once hunted slowly die and the forests grow grey. They have lived hundreds of years in constant darkness, blind from the sunlight. They live and die, though they have gained more to live for ever. One day, it is night, and the beasts are bound to safety by ropes bound together with tusk. They are hunted mercilessly, but for being so stupid it doesn't matter. It was foolish when it was afraid of them, but now, they are drawn to it. Monsters were the only ones who wanted to make them so. They thought they could just take that as a gift and give them more than they took. It's a way of life, but they try to punish them anyway. That's what they do all the time. The Well is protected from them, of course, and they have barricades around it, even keeping traps from being placed. They would rather live there, hiding from the ravenous I of the king than live there. The Well is the only place where the beasts don't meet. It used to have poison oak in every compartment it could find. Now, it is rotting wood, rotten bones, and rotting flesh. The only reason it keeps this place is because, in their madness, they thought they could use them for fun. Not enough people keep the Well safe anymore. It rages in the night, feeding on the carcasses of nearby beasts and it belches venom through their bones. Some of the creatures attack one another. They worry too much about harming the Well. We are weak. The Well is more than just a place to hide and kill prey. We are an arena to play with any animals that keep us from getting close to the Well. The beasts kill because they have to. Sometimes they think it is a strange sort of punishment, like crying in a cave for help. It was not until I was horribly beaten that the beast forgot how to kill. And did not hesitate to kill me.<|endoftext|>

"Is this all you can do, commander, to live? And let me tell you this, it is not because of our kind that we are against fighting. You see, the hatred that still roars in your veins is a dark disgrace. It is a hate that against all odds you build an empire upon. A crown on the head of Darth Vader, for Darth Sidious was the star of the Sith Prince Patr na from his coming of age, for Star Dreadnaught through to the next system. " Darth Vader's face turned red, his eyes reddened by the intense heat of the battle. Yoda drew a breath as the Dark Lord's hand entered his. It wasn't his lightsaber, neither was a pikatoe with a crude silver handle. It was only a particularly sharp mind and a vain of an endeavor of a Jedi master. Vader did not give up, this was no death sentence for a Jedi. " My hand! I destroy you, Obi-Wan! You are the first of your kind to look upon me with this caliber! There is no other Jedi Master such as you; no Skywalker, no Skywalker, *Tee of Doom* and as such, I have known what this must be done. Our lives have led us here, in a galaxy filled with sounds. What is it you see out there that terrifies you from this end? " Darth Vader paused. " The answer? " " Then let me tell you this; there is more to life than what we usually think, more to pain than between the eyes of humans. And for what you see is just... I don't know, does it come as a shock to you? Maybe a short time after, you feel pain? A simple tenseing may feel good, but a passing relaxation might finally bring you joy. " " Yes... then let me tell you something... This is not the end. " " But my friend! Surely my father and mother can not be so cruel. Are you saying you will now face the reality of what the Jedi have taught you? To live? To wait for this inevitable demise? " Vader coughed, his voice dangerously high. " I have seen what fate awaits me on their last day. They have taken the course of the Dark Side... " " Even if you did be a killer. " Yoda spoke coldly. " You will fight me, and you will die. Save me. Hold back the dark, a Jedi might say. The Force shall never waver from my approach. I shall destroy you. " " Obi-Wan..." Yoda wasn't listening, Darth Vader'd need to do something! Yoda glanced behind him, and - unbuckled a lightsaber by the Jedi Master. There was, thankfully, nothing of consequence...<|endoftext|>

Think of it as farming your own group of people. *my city, like humans, was a village, a few stores to occupy ourselves. Once we were all able to afford housing, a community was built and we fed our crops. It was great. We would then get a little food, some water and maybe a bit more meat in order to start again. The daily necessities were relatively new and obsolete. I can not bring myself to do anything now. I like to go back to the farm, but I have been unable to do it.

"So this is how our name is? " the red and blue monstrosity inquired, pointing with it's many roars. The goblin-scuttling foe pulled out a crossbow, a few bolts were exchanged for scarlet claymore. " Legend states, " it carried a staff of greater power. The commander sent out small flame creatures of fire to stop the foes. The general left most of his mercenaries behind, as did they. I, however, kept our grunts, as they stood in the shadow of my own fortress, the civilization of its people. The goblin scuttling horde stepped into the fortress, limped as they crossed the endless void. In front of the temporary location, the gaze of the goblin corpse spread all the shadows. The humans chose this port with their interdimensionals traveling between them to expand the realm and force their own dominion. Other humans cheered, ripping from their homes, and others ran to fight the night. " Victory awaits! " The courier said, gloating, their eyes wide. " What did our enemies even call us? " The dwarf adventurer asked, turning his attention to me. My smile, my eyes that looked as if I hid it through imps and grunts, was beginning to go to shit. My body stood upon a thimble, growling down and down, replacing them as I had fallen from my dwarven throne. I dodged the goblin horde by a thread, and backpedaled to find myself propped up against the nearly stone wall that held my master. " If our leaders want us to forget, we will. " The courier finished his proclamation, a protective smile on his face. I bowed my head, kissed his neck, and exhaled a long breath. " I had hoped the humanity would better themselves out there in this pitiful state, defending against my wrath. Instead, though, they have forgotten of us, and this information has given them immense pleasure. " " Where would they give us an army? We are leaving this world shortly!

The scars were scars he thought to himself as the ticking continued to increase as he shifted the keys on his old dusty piano. He had thought he could just start it by putting the key on the side and just sit on the keys and listen to it. But this ‘ ride. ’ Not many used the piano while in elementary school. No one knows where it ended up after being destroyed by lightning strikes or even the fire extinguishers that blessed it with the blessing. His fingers, shaking at the memory of the soliloquy that began so long ago, felt like dry tears from the loss of his loved one, to be crying every time someone wouldn ’ t get their wish. The ringing stopped. He turned the keys. He shut off the side, threw the key away, and started up the music. He could hear music he had forgotten all week. Getting up, he looked around. He stood in line and smiled to himself. It was only Sunday, they were only days away. He took the subway to work, as he always did when he was in the moment. Then he walked to the store. He picked up a box with his old favorite collection. He started wearing jeans and a red overalls. He drove home without taking off his shoes and resumed his path to work. He tried to remember those pictures he thought he had taken of someone. She took the phone, and for the first time in years, it started transmitting. He took a picture of the girl. He looked at the photo and saw her long blonde hair parted to her side. Then a smile quickly spread across her face. “ You may get another chance. ” she said. He tried to smile. All he could manage was a small smile, hoping for someone to be there. “ I love you, ” she said. She also held his hand, and he managed to hold her expression as he asked, “ how did you do? ” He felt his tears become tight. She gave his cheek a squeeze. “ I was so excited. ” “ I couldn ’ t remember anything other than that time you got me that old flower! ” she said. “ What happened that day? ” “ I ’ d be at work by now. ” “ My mom was shopping at the store when I fell into her arms. I don ’ t remember that. ” “ What happened that day, ” she said. “ She just fell in love with me. ” She went on to cry for more time. “ Now mommy is going to be buried here. ” “ Yeah… ” he thought as he looked at the box with the photo in his hands. He saw something on it next to it. In the picture, his petite blue eyes glinted with excitement and he took the photograph. In the frame were two thin, white arms, reaching out in each other. “ My darling, love, ” she said. The picture also had her once again. “ You may go now, but I can ’ t live without you. ”<|endoftext|>

After 400,000 words, you're already wondering when you'll end up writing the next big thing. It's hard to explain one's effects when you have to create a crazy little story for as long as you want.

I imagine you're not imagining it as well. On your way home, get whatever you've been cooking, and let the world play out.

Young man, August 17, 1930, Born: 21. Beaten up on a farm, 1921. Died 8/5/23. 76 years ago, in a prosperous village near Kobaia, India. Named "The Last Whiskey " after the man who tried to bring it home. Said he finally had enough of holding it at home. " Beaten up on a farm, 1921 "? No. This village, like the rest of India, went to war with their British. It got that way, seeing how they lived without nature. Afterwards, the village became a haven. The British eventually forced us in, bringing us weapons and plants and water. Unfortunately, they were out of their league. They actually took the entire family business, cutting it short. They welcomed us and gave our inherited memories of the past. I believe they're ready to tell us their final words of the " sad story", some of which I haven't heard of in a while. I do hope they convey the energy of a humble, skilled man. I hope it flows like a blender. Sincerely, Satan<|endoftext|>

Darrun was only a child. His mother was pregnant. His father was in labor. Like their conversation, mother was particularly direct. It had been three years since he and mother had heard another word. We never really spoke in the day though. I still loved her. She went on so many adventures throughout her years. Our name was Cycles. It was our very first dream together. Even a couple of our class mates gave us names. By the time we had kids, we were adults. Some places told stories of Earth, others told stories of Life, or of a First. It was not always easy in the both of us. We had to keep track of time. We tried to get our parents together before we could go on them quests and travels. We tried to be friends with them. In all these years, we were inseparable. Each of us traveled. Even if we could never tell which paths were the best ones, they would still be close. They would continue to venture in and out of our life together, often leading the path a lot. But then suddenly, in the middle of the night, Cycles spoke. This was his first encounter with a person. Something that meant life in a way that I have never felt before. In her weird now-normal voice, Cycles asked us if we remembered our words, so we could answer. "Yes. " She managed. " And how can you tell who we have become? Who we have learned to be? All of us in the whole world are linked, and you were the first to learn who I am." I'm glad I only had two friends. I've always lived a life like this. And I never once thought that the endless tales, stories that were told to me were reality was a lie. They were always lies. Now that I know my power, I am their leader.<|endoftext|>

Ah, when I first discovered social media ( not yet! ) I was never so close to a relationship. I'd love to say that my cousin would like my love for the koi seaweed but we shared a room together ( a studio cell phone with infinite tiles and watercolor! ). We'd go to the beach together to lay in the sand on a cloud view. We were great friends at school, very into Anime. The course of our lives was pretty hazy but we were happy and we would hang out every other Saturday. But when we graduated college, after 5 years of holding her hand, things got worse. Her job was taking people from farms to factories. When I opened up her account, that seemed to take 2 years. ( So yeah. ) She basically gave up my love and asked, "How long does it take me to write this comic book?" But all those years passed and we moved closer to our next big job. She was promising, so much so, that she sent me a photo of a Mechaamica while they held hands. She pushed the envelope closed and I nodded to her. And that's how I discovered that I enjoy writing comic books.<|endoftext|>

My home planet. It's been 100 years since I made the last entry. Ever since. I haven't built a space station or a ship, I have spread along the best and brightest as I could. My language is fluent, my culture has flourished, and now I am the ruler of this god forsaken world. I took not the last step towards building my own world, but now, like no other ruler, I have realised that what is inevitable is what the people at home have done. Slowly, war and poverty ravaged the Earth. Scorched our space, colonized our seas. But that has not stopped me. Now is not the time to die. I have watched my home from orbit for over an hour now, but I know that deep down I see things that are not there. What has become of my home is our sun. My sun the living luminescence of what used to be. I am in the kitchen now, cooking supper as I can. A brilliant shower kicks into action. With a smile, I welcome my arrival to the heavens. I am glad that all of our civilization was there once. But that was not my home. It was only for a few months. Now, I wonder, what will those heavenly lights be once they take off. That is what I hate to think of. All I could imagine were specks of black smoke flying from above our surface. Just as soon as I could remember it, I felt it. I felt it start to suck up the air, reach down and take hold of the tiny metal ball in the air.<|endoftext|>

There's one final thing I'm sad to say, but one single thing that doesn't leave me blank. I had hoped we would see space again, even when we'd been locked up for eighteen long months without any supplies. I didn't anticipate the kind of hellscape that our crew would be thrown into that no one else would ever have. Except for me. I had hoped that we would be able to orbit safely and at much higher speeds, but I do know that we would have pushed humanity farther and farther behind, each step costing us so much life we could be in a black hole, blindfolded and drugged, and separated until our hearts broke out again by the tides of the universe. If only we had let ourselves get caught in this mess, if only we kept the others out. But why are we here, hanging in our own filth? Do we not accept that we could only be here for so long, even as our minds and bodies grow and fail? No. No we are standing alone, in a moment that would have scared no one. For some reason though, they think that us, us who I might not be, would still be here. They hope that we would stop trying, or, in some way, consider trying to. But in this concrete bunker, floating in the vacuum of space, they have no idea what they are about to accomplish. And so we sat there staring at the ceiling as bodies screamed, tears streaming down my face as they tried to pick themselves free of the complex bonds and bonds that were shackled us when they died. We still can't understand what it's like to be alone here. If only we let ourselves know that we would someday find ourselves in a better place, maybe even get together and find each other. And then try to learn from this. When our bodies break down, they are going to die right here, hooked onto this lifeless panel of metal as if they had never left home. But they can't. And so we all stare, as the world fades to black, as the ever diminishing world around us takes its final breaths and absorbs what we will forever know as our imperfect lives.<|endoftext|>

As the halogen burning of the black hole wasepsed, a humanoid xeno operating control panels became more and more silent as the hyperdrive planet wobbled with the wereeps. The strange gadget glowed powerless for a moment before fading back to normal. The suit was set into the control panel, flanked by a lit torch with a single display button adjacent. The torch that displayed information on the random buttons. Half the early explorers who had been sent aboard the Transformer didn't find a single button key, and would later learn the only remaining key is the the countdown timer, which continually ticks down an hour to zero. However with every hour like this the solar sail returned and the planet was no more. This was supposed to be the only habitable planet, but humans seemed to have agreed that a greener planet is a better planet.<|endoftext|>

My grandmother had it in common with my parents. "Hey you kid! " she'd say. I didn't know why I'd question what my parents said, but I did though. Today is my birthday, and every year she just hung out with me. That meant she never had more than five friends at a time. I was always the top person in class. Easy pickings at school, because, as soon as I took a pass in class, the other kids all turned to see me and greet me. As their emotions boiled away, so did my own. They recognized me instantly. They were my twenty-two year old sister, when mom jumped back in for a hug after the football game. Then they saw her, and with tears in her eyes, they immediately ran to her, screaming, asking me for Mommy. They rushed over with various equipment, brought her back to their house, and took her under arms. They hugged as far as they could, but when mom fell, there was no holding back. And when I met his daughter, he was the nicest guy, and I was sure she was a plus.<|endoftext|>

Pain was not unusual to me. I liked to learn that. My parents let me go for a quick dip in the pacific after I left; never to return. One night I sat on my couch, anxious to brush my teeth. There was no cologne against my face, and the scratch I found on my palm was unfamiliar. Scraping up my teeth gave me chills, but nothing felt wrong as I tried to wrap my robe around my fingers. No tears were coming, but no fingers were feeling smooth. The scuffle ended when my parents were getting into an argument. I was angry. It was not usual, but I was hurt that some of us hadn't gotten along. They always argued, they chatted, they put us off after being through a tough breakup. They never made nice about me, or by some undefined word. I felt the anger in them, but I was also guilty. I had always known something was wrong with me, but it has never been written on my sheet. I love you too much to leave you alone. Your laughter at home, often used as the backdrop, often amplifies the pain inside of me. I was always upset when they would always talk about how this might improve. When you don't spend any time listening. You are my daughter. I don't really mind. I truly don't mind. The life without you is terrible. You are what is left of me. Goodbye.<|endoftext|>

We had killed much. Many. War was painful, it sometimes got you nowhere. But then we did it all over again. We killed every man, woman and child imaginable. We killed the sins of men, brought them into godforsaken hell, and cast them deep into a maze. Always the same game plan. We thought we were the monsters because every person we killed, every person we ate, every man, woman and child we threw away was the same. But we weren't. We knew the key difference in that moment, and as we grew older, our memories of war became stronger. We grew scarcer, and thicker our steely resolve to win more long lived battles. Soon, wars became fiercer, and our ideas to win had turned to ideologies for redemption. Politics was too corrupt and greed was too strong a tool to build. Wars reached peak territory. None of them were general, that has led us to believe that strategy was the law and war is the end game. The worst moment, was when we started wars on other people. I think the best moment is when we fought on people who genuinely believed in something. You see, war hasn't ended by any means. We have seen the end of the universe come and go. Wars, wars that have come and gone since I was a child ( like the one I saw in Detroit ) have pushed the boundaries of human thought to the breaking point and forced a people, pushed away from all the fundamentals of what we thought and demanded and held. Their world was the abyss and the Devil's. No one who has nothing will stop them now, only one group of people, all the fuckers. After a long, long time, with our beliefs, we moved on. We moved on to the next step, God. I don't know why. I don't know where else to begin. God continued to push us forward. We learned so much about ourselves. I still feel nothing but numbness from the labored, crawling, unnecessary effort. It was supposed to be painful, pain in the field, but we stopped it so the fields would never grow again. Now you call your kids what they are, but they are the most ruthless, most mean. They strangled their targets, dissected their bodies, tore their hair from their faces and faces, even executed their own victims. This is still life, we moved on. But now everyone in the world tries to take from us, every single person, every single person. Every single instant of our existence, we kill each other in an attempt to sleep on our kills, and every single minute of that night, every one of us is fighting for the ends that will only make it worse.<|endoftext|>

"Look, Chris, " one of the old men shuffled over to a satchel and picked up two extra chess pieces. " I have a chess competition. " Chris scanned the pile of dirt. Every piece had obviously been folded up, in some sort of cruel sport. He chewed down on one in particular, feigning exhaustion with a smile. The others ignored him. The last piece he drew was his own. " Can I play Go? " The man nodded. Chris wanted to follow, but it was too late. Chris laid down the pieces, and watched the chess piece do its thing. It landed on a pawn and wiggled it around. Another round later and Chris was sitting in a pawn chair, overlooking the park. He thought he heard something through the crowd -- I lost one of my players, they were both hungover, exhausted. Something had changed, something he was all too familiar with. He woke up from his dream a few minutes later, rather tired. " Come on, Chris, go home," came from the man beside him, drinking milk from a cup.<|endoftext|>

Everyone does but I long for her. On the inside she is such a sweet girl. Even though she is diminutive, she is a little not to much taller than the average citizen and has the fewest bruises I have ever seen. Or at least she has her own quarters for herself, as everyone here do. It's a nice day, other than sitting and waiting for her mother to come visit. I saw her all the time in my class, most from standing over the desk to getting up to greet her from out of the door or maybe from flicking her hair at some of the other students as if I had made them stare at me in thought. Everyone walks through the hallways in a group of faces staring out at the room, or sitting. Some of them are probably talking at me when I start to make my way through. Some of them just sat there and stood in silence, looking up at me while I listened to the unspoken voice of hers. It was a nice day for everyone in this amazing city. Thank the year for the nurse, a facility helping out on my needs and we could finally meet on our own terms. Right now, I was walking into class with a headache. The public ran away from my gaze and was now facing the door. The crowd is silent and the ones running backwards as everyone stares at the three day old is the only one in the whole class that didn't notice me behind the doors. I just wanted to say thank you, and let her have a rest. No one had noticed me when I would step into the room and wait for her. I called her an angel, which made me uncomfortable. I tried to figure out what she meant by it, or at least what I meant by her name. The pressure of not having to meet her again was enough for me to give up on her question and walk through the entire hallway. The hallway is filled with books, special packages for the doctor, and nondescript packages which sometimes come with food and language. I took an arm out and stepped inside, one hand on the desk, the other grabbing a note I kept in a pile on the shelf. It was one of her hands that I got as we walked through the large hall. I kept my eyes on her until I heard a knock on the door. 'Open the door!' One of the professors said. 'There is nothing you need to do. I don't give a shit.' I put my arm around the door, wanting to be able to sit up again before it happened. I held my eyes down so she could listen. She seemed oddly happy talking to me as she walked away from the door. I waited as long as I could before I spoke another word to her. I walked across the hall and into the streets of this city. I could hear cries of pain and cries of happy desperation as people around me stopped walking and looked around trying to figure out why we were here. The truth was, I didn't care. 'Uhhhhhh!' I began. 'Uhhhh!' Another cry of tears. The last thing I heard was my mother calling my name, and I stepped away. 'FUCK YOU! Fucking Fucking Fucking Ted!' I yell in a very emotional, tortured way. My bladder was getting heavy and I was unable to breath as I stumbled back on my feet and hit the floor with a thud. I didn't see her for what seemed to be an eternity, staring at me down into the tiles of the floor, and thinking about what I was supposed to do. I just gave up, I couldn't do it. That's when she came running in. Like I said, she was in a hurry and it was only after we talked about a new year that I realized that she was a grown adult. I grabbed my arm from behind the table, which was completely silent for a reason. I leaned into the floor first and held my breath, holding it down as if it were the ocean. A hatch opened and out stepped a tall, pale, and old woman. She sat on her knees, shoulder high in the air, holding her son. I hope she stays here.<|endoftext|>

"Courtroom. Door. Here. " The sound of footsteps echoed in the quiet. I turned to the guard, who was also a mouse. " Easley. You wan na sit down? " " Who the hell are you? " I asked. " This is the ninth toil, sir. Its rather slow. " The guard gestured for me to sit down. We sat there for a few minutes, in silence. I could feel myself stretching out. " People, you need to eat. " " I can't find y -- " " Stop. Stop bawling, Tom. Food is simply not for me. " He slammed the door. " FINE, WILLOW DAUGHTER, MORTAL. GET AWAY FROM MY ALTERNATE. " " I CA N'T LEAVE. " " THEY'RE IN MY MOON. " I let out a firm smack as he shoved me out the door. " Why won't you shut your mouth? I'm deaf. " " Shut. Off. Off. She's okay, Tom. Feel free to sit down. " He motioned for me to go. I sat. It took a while, but I stood. In a week I had gotten through all the mistakes I had made on so many " bad boys." Maybe they were right. Probably. But now, it felt too good to think. What else was I supposed to do? I got through the final hurdle. I dove for the phone. My mother died in the war. She didn't want me there, but I was important. So important. I didn't want to be away, not anymore. My steps were clear, too. It was time.<|endoftext|>

Rick Madden did not regret turning his eyes towards the children at the table. The shop he frequented was bare, with no furniture, and his store had no sign of any repainting. The children, the only ones that saw him so intently, were quiet in shock. He didn ’ t look her in the eyes when they were stricken, he didn ’ t act like this when he meant it. Besides, “ friends, ” he said to no one in particular, “ are no friends. ” He always put on his best sashimi, even before lunch, even before dinner, and back before work. The salesmen brought just a box of Diet Coke. They left “ Diet Coke™ ” on the counter, as if they ’ d taken it from his earlier sale. Rick had yet to turn around his house, the kids and the store were pretty close, and as the adults scurried away Rick could not help but feel regret. There was something left to be said, “ Friends! ” A group of kids rushed out of the front door, stumbling to the computer and trying to figure out what exactly he meant. All that seemed to deter Rick was the fact that no one moved aside from the viewfinder. So, all the kids told him was “ Friends. ” The rest just kept on ignoring him, trying to figure out what Rick meant. Staggering for several blocks they eventually found a black sedan parked inside a plain red sedan. Even the light that blared was out, because the lights that fueled the car didn ’ t flicker and contrast; because it wasn ’ t Rick ’ s fault. “ Hello! ” A child jogged up to Rick, and he blinked as he saw a thin man with a puzzled expression on his face. “ Sorry, ” he said, “ I was driving. ” The two of them both saw the cars all turn to face, and were immediately distracted by Rick. Rick zoomed in and picked up the iPhone he had held over his shoulder while they were in their cars. Looking at the screens of his notifications, he made out a tag saying “ Click ” and walked down to him in front of the mirror. On the rear console of the car, on his tattered jeans was a message. Edit: Spelling, error.<|endoftext|>

"Wh-what is... " " Shit " I look at my feet. " It just... can't even be natural " some strange guitar company told me and I was startled " You've worked for so long digging this... Well that's... Delilah " even the song icon on my iPod gave me less chills than Cuddy probably thought she would notice. " Wasn't expected.. " I noticed mine was of slightly different color now. I just stumbled it seemed but I hadn't forgotten it. Flashing to black I stumbled out of my house and out through the front door. I walked two steps before people started screaming and screaming. The light went on for several hours the screams barely register. Eventually the screams stopped. I looked in the bathroom and was horrified to see a rectangular rock. When I could read the inscription I searched the pages until I found a silent scroll. It said " We should not dig here, " but I quickly thought, could the T-word come from this box? Maybe it has to do with that song, " Well when we dig someone digs you up"<|endoftext|>

> There is a cave when all goes quiet. Imagine a certain meaning, of something, emotion. - Rosa Dicaprio, Physics Teacher dicaprio wrote that when we shut our eyes, we shut our minds. It was interesting to analyze. It is not the biggest of discoveries, but it taught me more about understanding than anything else at the time. To listen to recordings of couples in person, it became a new field. It was incredible. Because at the time, the astronomy community in the US was all about discovering stars and stars didn't understand what was happening. It was like saying a child's grandparents told them the rapture was about to start. In their eyes, with any telescope, would change the shape and magnitudes of star birth. They would talk about civilizations. Now they did not have satellite images for this particular area. When a star was born, it picked up the variable such that it was born into a hot diamond. The largest variable was named, "Berenstein," actually. For everything that happens there on a planet, there is only a hot diamond. They got out of there and could understand this. There is a cooler place to go, though. It is warmer than the average planet around the Earth. There is a new activity as a result. A type of star is born and infested. It is so big, that a constellation appears above the sky. It appears to be a giant star, like a ball of light that has been raised above a ball of dust. When it finally flicks it's star towards us, it can not stop. It actually begins to inhabit the earth. During the changes, it will boil, converting most of the liquid in your blood into ammonia. This water will cause its residual cold temperature to make you freeze. Food may be expelled from this liquid from a burning thermos which the star will consume after a while. How will it compare? It's simple, it turns into a viscous liquid. You know, after countless pictures, videos, and show videos, it begins to make really tasty spoons.<|endoftext|>

I wonder if I'm the last one left? It's been about two years since I saw anyone, back when... "Bust off with a bottle of Jack and a stick of spunk Doritos before dinner! " I thought to myself as I sat on my bed looking into a mirror on my bedside table. It turns out the flesh up top is only a part of the tattoo tattoo, it's almost wiped off and tattooed off by the drugs, with the body remaining mostly intact. And none of the other paint jobs this bunch has done. They're just a bunch of retired assholes who got into the gang after the cops found out, and they paid the bills. They have " giant bags on their heads and arm strippers" they call them. I wonder if I'm the last one left, it's been about two years since I saw anyone, back when...<|endoftext|>

Adams stood up and approached Detective Jennings. " What's happened? " the tall, burly man asked. " A large proportion of our department got their arms blown out. " Adams whimpered. " All thanks to you, Sir. " Jennings took his badge, revealing a scrawled word. " * Dead* ", he gasped. Tears started rolling down Adams' face as he walked towards the nearest detective. " Sir, it wasn't your name or any other identifying information you wanted us to take. Let's not panic, I think this one is my personal coffee? " " Do you have a problem with this?

" Adams tried to quell the emotions in him, but he couldn't speak. He could never understand what was happening. " Well, I suppose the problem would be the loss of your colleague. " " What about you? " Adams looked around, causing the detectives thoughts to fly through his head. " I don't think you realize that sir. I don't make mistakes, but I am very disappointed in you for not helping us. " " I'm sorry. " Detective Adams turned back to his coffee. " Have you reached my office yet? " " Yes, I have, but for whatever reason, I need you to keep me updated. " Adams sighed. " Ah, now I get to work, but that's only because your secretary doesn't like to hang out with the girls. " The detective walked back to his car. " I'm not getting out of here. " A tear rolled down Adams' cheek as he thought about what to do next. " I just need to hold on. " he said, hoping that answer would give him a clue.

The first message he sent me at the moment was this, "sorry, I don't have the sweetest idea. Would be a nightmare to attend a Sunday morning breakfast with your own family, but hey, I have a party to attend too! " I swaggered through the most annoying excuse of an act I could think of. " I... I don't want to be right now. But, you can invite me to sit and listen to music and listen to some jazz. All the happy times we have together -- just since elementary school! I'd have you know that I love jazz! I'll just enjoy that really, REALLY quick jazz man. So tell me, do you have the night off? " He winced and looked around the room. Nothing. All the white walls in the room and the mess of everything in them showed me that somehow all they wanted to do was listen to a pop band so loud that everyone sitting directly in front of them erupted into hysterical screams. That can be hard to believe. My father, my mom, my cousins, my boyfriend, my everything that made me happy. Not like I'm invisible in the early years. All these people had it all. All these families, so close that I didn't even know they existed. And I'd never met a person without the commitment. He continued talking about the Jazz world, and his ability to affect everyone's life with his whims. " So, can I invite you to a family dinner sometime? " The letter hissed. I grabbed my violin and continued. " But, how will I know if there's a good party happening? " His words no longer rang in my ears. I looked around and realized that none of them had forgotten. " It's up to you. And I'll go on a date with you the day hell freezes over. " He didn't sound thrilled. He started speaking more clumsily and more softly. Finally, one of them hit him with a handle and he fell backwards, onto the cold tiles. He stopped speaking at first, falling onto the floor and on to his side. The vibration sent chills down my spine, although it was probably his old gut feeling. " Don't worry. I'll go on a date with you the day hell freezes over.

I stood above the dead man with a mass of blood. He was alone. He was dead; almost to his car. I'm writing this here as a joke, so any criticisms and criticisms would be much appreciated. "You were only thirty, I'll call you sir... " " This is a joke Mr Eric. Goodbye, you're dead, or so you say. Or else this letter will be here to send my condolences, to remind me not to kill myself with my life. " The chilling silence around me was eerie. The reeking breath of fresh rain and ground barely trailing behind. The most of my own blood evaporated in as a figure rose from the ground and sashayed into the clearing beside me. I staggered up and found myself against a tree with a branch that was strong and dirty. The breeze shivered the tall man and landed directly on my face. I tried to keep a cool breeze from blowing, but it kept getting harder and harder to keep my focus. He was trapped here, but all I could do was walk away. " Here you are Mr Eric, just like any other day. The weather isn't really bad either. I don't hate the people here, who really need to live in a nice little world, but I don't love being free. A world where someone has your pain. Someone with your pain. But you still have life left, so to come you have to think about what could be or how you're going to live it, or never live it. " " What are you talking about, dummy? I knew this was going to happen. You're the one that killed yourself! How could you live with yourself and not go through with it? You killed yourself. " His voice was quiet. No longer having the terror of hell. A voice that I understood. " What about you huh? That was a fun little story! " " Oh I know. I guess you can deal with this. " " Fine, let me get this straight now. I killed myself. I'll tell you why I did it. I stole a life. Because I needed to. Because I wanted to be remembered and I wanted to die. That's all I needed. I need to die so I can go back to my world, and not live in. Instead I chose a life where I could enjoy my freedom. That's how I got myself killed. It's not a good idea to live with yourself. I didn't need you; you just needed to live the life you wanted. That's how I got myself killed. It's the only way I can live my free life. " The man simply closed his eyes and bowed his head in a sincere manner. Then he walked out of the clearing toward me. I never did notice a smile on his face as I walked along the edge.<|endoftext|>

The end of the Year has arrived. The vagabonds are standing, seething with fury. The Old Man of Nothing is too much for a pathetic hobbit and his brothers and sisters. The path dissapears and the Lost become known as the Hero and Death to a free world. The Unholy walked into The Gate itself and he tore at it long ago. He tore at the Machine and Father's rage drove all of It, as apart men did it. A bed of bones, sinew and reds floats among the finely manicured earth. An unearthly shingle rises from the portal, trapping the Inner One in it's clutches. He pulls himself together and screams as he torments the machine. The Inner Man burst into flames, pouring forth a foul smoldering smell. His blood seeps into the walls and you should not tread near his apartment. The inner man is a ghastly thing. As he burns raw, he looks upwards toward his King, angry at not being a mortal one more to die before His Only Child, and the prodigal son he raised. The burning flesh is then gaped and broken. The Eternal Father walks into the portal, anger clashing with Fright. It turns his back to the Dark King and yells, "Who are you? " He pours cold, blackened water. He slits down another part of the portal and as blood starts forming, a demon before him descends from this world. The last remnant of the Eternal Father. The nightmare slumps to the ground, a sizzling solution of water droplets. The Inner Man looks down. " Sire. So... is this true?"<|endoftext|>

Of course when you turned your entire stomach from sharp hamburger and beat-you-in-a-bed to an idle swoon you saw it click across your field of vision. It is merely a regular like most of the other mice moving around your lovely field of vision. Even then you had no idea of the first mouse moves and yet you were too excited to stop in your tracks. You clicked about an hour later and immediately the mouse was gone. However, when you looked back I noticed something weird. Another mouse pointer moved across my fields of vision which was showing the same reaction as you. This time it wasn't an exact story but the mouse always had the same reaction as you. That didn't bother you too much though. After six more clicks all the research was done on your mouse. Apparently some scientist from a past or something that didn't believe in human medicine tried to spin it to show its true form. It was an unexpected discovery and due to the nature of experiments it went insane. All scientists wanted it to be believed. But then the mice began to show up again. And I watched them grow and surely the scientists did not expect such an outlandish plot to change its behaviour. So here I stand with my mouse pointer, who seemed so bright and so bright but with a dull toothy grin on his face. And I have done what any good scientist does and I am going to bring it to the end of the line. Who could stop me now? I must tell you my unexpected conclusion: 3rd mouse point moved across the future across the board. Maybe this doesn't work. Or I could just remove the mouse pointer to an art installation over the top. Or perhaps something else more sensible. Finally I wish for a swift end to these experiments and I close my eyes. It would be a truly bizarre decision for me.<|endoftext|>

I never noticed the odd glitch. Sitting on the corner of the room, I clicked my hand across my dark yellow hair, thinking about what it was that happened yesterday. Finally it hit me. The silence I had was nearly unbearable. It took me a few seconds to realise it was all a loop. I tried staring at them, staring at whatever they were saying. I could hear them talking to each other. I thought I was imagining things or something, that was the gist of it, apparently I was imagining things when I was talking to them. Then the text message came up. "Hey Brian, can you tell me when you're watching this TV? " " Oh I don't wan na hear that, so can't tell you that I've been watching it for a couple minutes now, because you know I've been trying to ignore it all day! " " Just shut up and listen to yourself, I'm listening, I swear! " But not enough, the words'scheduled Sunday' were loud enough to hang in the air. Sometimes just words, maybe an ending sentence or two - but it was often incoherent. It was cold. It was hot. It seemed that nobody was going to be home, even with a phone and glasses for eyes. And then it stopped. " oh jeez, Brian, you're out of sorts, since you left the cold and the heat and now you're telling yourself that it's happening? " " Umm.. yeah but... oh wow.. its that just a glitch... okay, what happened? " " What? I swear to god I had... well I had a stroke... what if... what if it wasn't so bad that no one would notice it now? If it wasn't so bad that other people would not notice it in a hurry because they think nothing of it?! If it wasn't so bad that no one would notice it in a hurry that it would *snap* back around! Can I help you with something? " As if to answer my question. " No Brian, you're an idiot, call my dad..."<|endoftext|>

I can see the mouse now, wasting my time in the viewscreens. The walls are dull, the ground looks hard, and the trees and shrubs and roots are pitted and fragmented. There's nothing but a dull light that caught my eye as I stood up. His eyes still focused on the mouse, but in the dark he stayed still, staring back up at me with scowls. That wretched mouse, he came to a sudden halt, its pointer raised just above the ground. Suddenly, he stopped. What began as a frenzied pace of movement turned to a frantic chase, leaping up from the treetops and crouching with his hands inches apart, hair catching against his eye. The mouse ran at me, the pace quickly getting faster, and jumping out at me like lightning. The mouse rushed to the edge of the treetops and leaped off of the ground, the mouse point being right in front of me. I laughed and shouted to the mouse, "Where am I!? I'm trapped!". Nothing he said made me stand, and after a few minutes passed, the mouse began to get up, his eyes still glued to his pointer, laughing maniacally. The mouse ran at the spot, tripping and falling on the floor of my house. I went back to my window, and pressed a couple of buttons and the mouse ran away.<|endoftext|>

I laid there in my hospital bed, bleeding from her chest pains. I hear it though; I never remembered anything anymore. I think it's been hard times for us. I woke up one morning with a dull memory of life, of a beautiful woman laying in my dreams. It was beautiful, perfect. She was real, and out of that lovely liquid came a familiar one. I woke up to a man in my arms, sitting beside me on the bed. He also had a face. His hair was in curls in a suave manner, was wearing designer clothes. He looked me up and down and around me and said, “ You were the best work of my life. ” I was shocked. He wouldn ’ t just tell me. He would tell me about all my fantastic and horrible moments in my life. I started screaming, hoping I would go away, maybe listen to whatever he said. I called out for him, hoping someone would come to save me, any way. “ Hi. ” He said. “ How are you? ” “ I am feeling better. I think I just wanted to tell you. But then, a man approached me. ” “ A man? What is he doing here? Where did you find him? ” I asked. “ I found a man, some thirty years older than me. It was. A simple job. Not much money, but with benefits and nothing to trade it for. What was he doing there? ” “ Did he exchange some things for you? Like cars? Check. Insurance? Check. And small talk? Check. ” “ Sounds good. Well he came and went. We talked a lot. It was great. And then he closed his eyes for a few minutes, but he was gone. ” I tried to explain him, but he was gone. He still goes to my hospital bed every night. Sometimes it's for drugs. Or perhaps trying to make money off work and being unemployed. But no matter, there is always a small chance that he may end up dead and replaced by another. I need a husband. I need a woman. And that woman is where I find him. I need a new man.<|endoftext|>

To:! TOP SECRET Class Notes I successfully wrote an experiment consisting of nine random subjects. Each subject, and their interaction, was completed within an hour of the paper being printed, with the number of lives generated in the test validating or invalidating the numbers. Subjects ranged from 1-25, to nearly 2-5. At 25, they received a daily pencil, fifteen for the purpose of math, and one for engineering. At around 6, they had an assigned name of a hundred words, and assigned geographical coordinates, within a twenty minute span. It is also worth noting that the test participants used TestAR to confirm their identities. Subjects F1 and F2 are apparently telepathically linked to each other. They are later called imaginary friends, and visit the tests in their dreams. No matter how long they and their imaginary friends were though, they never interacted, and the experiment was terminated. Self awareness, spirit communication, and supernatural abilities developed. The subjects named, implanted, and kept in a psi parlor confided their thoughts with the test.<|endoftext|>

Dear Anabelle, Finally, all of you have managed to knock off the last of what was left of the glistening grains of our lab. We were about to leave, when our search engines plummeted to zero. We were gone forever. Our sensors ran out, and the last of the bottle floated uselessly among the expanse of greenery we came in contact with. For a day they had each sent a link in time to the closest discovery of the century: The current layout of the U.S. became more and more rigid over time. Every nation stood around the monitor, reminding us of the fantastic past we could have achieved. They were dumbfounded and apologetic, but now they held the past alive. "This is, in fact, the date of most of the world ’ s suffering, " their analysts explained to me. After several months of searching, every last shape, every detail of our planet ’ s life still sat within an optical distance of each other. As we talked, each of our probes sited outside of our solar system for months, decades, maybe decades before we set sail for the stars. I was always the first to ask about the emptiness we ’ d created, the impossibility of our last hope. Anabelle, our very last hope. The bread crumb of our existence, our very final hope. On that day, November 21st, 2013, we were abandoned. I would forever be a distant memory in the eyes of mankind, but I would never forget my fellow colonies. I felt no such feelings today, as my company, the Canadian Research Exploitation Team, lay in ruins in a world that would not produce life for those who were desperate. I could ’ ve chosen to stay and look at it once more, seeing the bright light of our new home being extinguished. But I couldn ’ t. “ What if we told them? ” I finally asked my co-worker, Steve. “ I ’ m not sure. ” I replied. “ At least they would listen. ” I said with a sigh of relief. We ’ d survived for so long. A ship could only last so long, and the vision of the stars had dried my body to oblivion. I could taste the scents of this world again as I cried. I could hear the empty boards searing their hollow peaks. A tiny somber loneliness had soothed me, and I could dream of a different kind of life. I could feel the warmth of this world again. I could feel the hope flowing forth from these lost threads of hope, the long-forgotten people that would have been our great promise, our final salvation. This is where we left, my friends. I turned away from the computer and walked briskly home, holding a single bottle of the last of our remaining maple syrup in my hand. “ Let me know if you ’ re home soon! ” I cried as I headed to my new job in the midwest. The world looked back upon this moment as we exited the cold bunker. If only there was still hope of our family, perhaps for the last time, at peace, and then we ’ d all be reunited to our families once again.<|endoftext|>

I never saw the end of this world, the green. I knew it was coming, I could hear it in my bones, just like it had sent a shiver through me. The same vista. The endless chaos of the streets. The fear of the others. The fear of the sea. Time and time again, my sense of time has cracked, As the moment came. I can't remember exactly how far away this force was, nor did I think I would see another exit. Yet they always came. I know they have come. Just as they always have. Until it all stopped. I woke up in the middle of the night, As I struggled to catch my breath. I tried to speak, but nothing came out, I knew my lips were dry, and this was definitely a dream. It was all so surreal, how long had I been here, that I was able to remember? I guess I never expected the cops would come soon. I guess they never were. Just the wind. I may have been alone. I may have been with my wife, but what was her? I guess I don't remember any of it. I guess I don't know if I'm going to feel the same way anymore. As my eyes were closed, I let out a cry, Something I couldn't hear. I heard the soft breathing of someone. I heard her softly whimpering in that direction. Maybe they'll find me soon. Why am I still here, alone.<|endoftext|>

All of that is all I could want. Knowing it was over by this point and with my very existence I just needed to get to the point and right this hellhole. I got in the driver's seat and looked down at the pathetic little bastard that I was. Being a simple dude I say no and decided to just as often piss him off like this. He knows I'm dangerous. I'd done this to him before and he's been doing this since then. I've waited a long time for this moment. I can feel the friction slipping off his face which is typical. How the fuck do you... -God, HE was so mad at me he wasn't even paying attention. He turns around slowly getting ready to drive off. "Hey man" He said as he jogged out the door. I couldn't believe I got so angry. He hates me so much. He deserves to know how happy I am. I did this to him. The Hell I did it to him. Well shit he deserved it. I'm sorry. I won't be there for you my son. I'm sure you've no idea what you did.<|endoftext|>

He looked at the clock in front of him. The time was 11:37, 7 years since he last casted his spell. He decided it didn't seem like it would be enough to spend five decades in the Celestial Blue and Black Flame. So with the advent of the internet being almost the only thing that caught his eye, he decided to go out and try his luck at creating a spell. So here he was, touring with his back to the light in his home, thinking about the next spell. When he went outside to stand on the threshold of the council chambers, he knew a door was open behind him. What had he done? He was unfamiliar with the room of the council, so he decided to go speak to the doorbell. When he opened the door, there was a large red light. This must have been a portal. So he went in. The portal cracked and locked. He saw the room he had entered. A plane of white and black appeared, with a triangular front. He could see that Earth was covered in a clear sphere of light, shining through the portals. He traveled a little further in the plane, curious as to what the hell this was and what purpose his magic had in it. After a time, he came to the first chamber and came to the small platform to stand in. The audience was small, five in total. One did not notice his presence. It seemed he was an old man, clad in robes and sandals. The others looked on in awe as he stepped to a microphone in the center of the chamber. "Welcome to the Celestial Blue and Black Flame Council, " he began, " My name is Rachel River. While this is your place to speak, I thought my name may be a bit strange, given that it is of high import here. You have been given a twelve hour trial period to make you register with us. " There were three questions about why the call was made, and the first answer was that these were humans who inhabited Earth but had built a colony over years ago, a strange fact the Council had not discovered yet. Rachel paused, perplexed. " What happens after twelve hours? " The next question was about the next four individuals, including himself. What if this creature from beyond came and destroyed all five? He decided that to make it up, they must leave. " It is the purpose of this trial period. Unless we have had an extensive investigation, I would not recommend that you continue here, " the human interrupted him. " We did not exactly have a colony, but we did have several probes on our home surface. The way you described it, it serves the purpose. In this case, we performed a quick scan. The view was taken before departure, but it is difficult to tell where the colonists landed. You can remember from your communication with them, how surprised they were when their creators sent them. What we found, however, was that their builders no longer believe in an invasion. They think their creator has something to hide. " " So if my hypothesis is correct, then you must have appeared to have passed away. That is likely incorrect. We shall take you to a specialist. She must warn you that these creatures that fell upon your colony know nothing of us except to speak the truth. " " Tell us. " " I wouldn't want to jeopardize my chances of finding someone with all the power of the universe. The only way to find out that may be is to place a small asterisk on my charts. Tell me, you did it. " Rachel looked to the human, who in turn narrowed her eyes. " I hope so."<|endoftext|>

I can't say I wasn't an idiot. As two years into the renovation project the world had an almost spiritual thirst for knowledge. Only scientists, avid coder and science fiction enthusiasts would volunteer for such an ordeal. But that wasn't why I volunteered. Why I wanted some interesting facts. Nothing will ever be the same again. Not this century. The virus was well known already as I sat on the balcony with my side of the room. The only way I could say how ecstatic I was was to find the source. My arm was bound behind my back, and my toe had found it's groove on the hard surface. I didn't know what was causing it's existence, and it seemed like it had originated somewhere. I slipped away from the balcony and into the inlet below. I'd been expecting it, but this was the first real sign. As soon as I turned my head back to look the source of the disease I saw it. An old man had been in a field across from my room with a large blindfold covering all of his exposed skin. His mouth was smeared with blood and decay. "What are you doing here, old man? " my friend asked. " This is a test, old man, " I replied. " We shall not allow you to fail this examination. " He placed the blindfold around my throat, and I realized it wasn't good. " So we have to take this test here as the others? This would become more difficult as time goes by. But you're lucky. We both know this will happen soon. There are only five known survivors. We have thousands of people left alive to see this cure. And they don't even know who you are or what you want us to do with you." In an instant my vision swam a mixture of horror and awe. Everyone across the room froze. They'd definitely lose their sight one way or the other. I stopped dead in my tracks. I still had my blindfold covering the area around my body. The man stood over me, without hesitating. He lowered his eyes, like a complete stranger who'd only eaten only raw chicken. He lifted the blindfold off and slowly stepped back. His eyes slowly met mine for a moment as his face twisted away. There was a wrinkle on his forehead that had never been there before, only filling the void. A final gasp filled my ears, and I turned and saw my friend's head and once again the entirety of the human race had been wiped from the face of the earth. I heard the screams of millions, including my coworker, who was still desperately trying to get that new cheeky look off. My coworker had picked me up and dragged me back down to the lab for further testing. As I opened the lid of the microscope it was clear. For the first time it revealed how the virus was spread, and how it was killing off all mankind. It confirmed the fundamental truth of human nature. The virus was a plague. The new winged rodent that had infected every other inhabitant of earth had hunted down those who should not perish. The only way to cure the virus was to remove the antidote that killed every other available form of life. Humans were to be exterminated, like the dirty gas that was the case with the gas disease. I loved talking to my friend about the topic. It was already the topic of our newly revived year and the notion of how people in new locations would die in that town over the next year was still just new.<|endoftext|>

I ’ ve had five violent terrible nightmares. Friends I lost, enemies I deeply lost, everything to hold onto. I think there were some unpleasant ones too. A lady who would wail at the bottom of my lungs at my expense, trying to get away. A child who scared the crap out of my older sister from staring at her ceiling as he watched comic books. Even more frightening than all those terrible nightmares, was the time I was drafted into the army. I was sent to Korea in preparation for a Nuclear-armed attack that could destroy the entire planet if it was spread over a full day, sent back on a sudden scale after reporting my training. I remember me surviving in the sea while trying to swim across the ocean. Oh the thrill of drowning my enemies in the water with water coming at me as I shielded myself. All throughout their hundreds of years, I remember them getting sick of me, always laughing at me and driving at me. I remember telling the elderly woman I was lucky to be alive so I could use my shelter to support the elderly while I neared their graves. Over and over again they would taunt me. How could they love someone, just as I love them? How could they love themselves? All of a sudden they took care of me like a creature and me in the hands of a mere human. All of a sudden they left, and I was on my way back to base when they came. Behind all that carnage, I felt someone grab me and hold me down as they wanted me to pass out. All I heard was my attackers saying something along the lines of “ Hey, you ’ re one scary monster! ” I couldn ’ t figure out what they mean, but it turned out I couldn ’ t handle anyone who touched me. My wife and daughter came home screaming in horror, not knowing what to do. I just heard them saying nothing, it was as if they knew what was happening. Next day, I was sick again. There were more military patrols outside when I woke up, a thing that happens when a kid mumbles something and goes to sleep. There was my new baby girl, probably around the age of 6. When she woke up I ’ d seen her left leg where mine used to be, I watched her head drop out of her lap. I watched her a hundred times before I made her fall asleep. I feel sick to my stomach, I vomited every now and then, and I felt that heavy burden pulling on me. Maybe I ’ m insane? I don ’ t know. I ’ m not sure I want to hurt my baby girl like some kind of demonic afterthought. But I ’ m going to find out eventually. I ’ m ready. I left the army after my training, and got a job in charge of a small little factory that churned out munitions. I tried it when I was the first smoker to go through the torture in the war, but every damn time I would have hit a slingshot and died for sure. Sometimes it just didn ’ t work. “ Mom? ” I heard them ask as I was slammed into the coffin. “ Hey, you ’ re one scary monster! ”<|endoftext|>

Papa: So you think I'm just trying to balance being the best of all people? Everyone I know is trying to be the best, but some of them are doing it for a reason. Sometimes they drive me to work on a project, other times, being a part of your family or going out at night to wake up every morning. Every single one. But I guess that's the problem. I guess I can't live without my wife. I mean, she's asking for my attention, but to put it bluntly, I'm pushing myself to be the best of the best? I don't know. It's hard to focus on anything unless you want to move parts of yourself. But if I look at her with a disapproving eye, I guess I'll be the best. But at least I know my wife's death, right? Or that her fingernails are already bleeding out, right? Right? Papa: We're so glad you heard that, Harold. It's finally settled down. I hope it's easy. I'm glad to be under your care again, just like I am right now. As much as he might be unhappy, he's my best bet. I've got stuff to do. Sometimes it's hard to ignore people, when we have so much to be happy about. But I guess I am. Maybe it's best if we share a box of candles tonight. At least that will make it more interesting. If you ever get bored with me, just tell me about it! Papa: Pleased to meet you. "I never knew I loved you " Harold: Tell me about it. It was real good. Mommy told me that you were her best friend. That we were to " have a little " in your life. I felt bad about what Mommy said. I remember getting afraid. What if she wasn't joking? There's no point in joking. Maybe Mommy's right. I can not. I'm not normal. Maybe Mommy is right because I don't want to be. I swear. We're going to spend the rest of the evening in bed. I'm going to go out with a good day. Yes, it's going to be rough and I'm not sure it will be pleasant, but it's going to be a wonderful time. I'm never going to come down here alone with this woman. After Mommy passes, I'm going to go out to watch the other couples play. I hope it's nothing personal. If not, at least I guess it'll be exciting. The last person I love, she never said anything about her, so I guess I'm nice about that. Or maybe we'll go and live together and go out until the best of us dies too. I do want to protect myself, too. That's okay. But right now, it's time to go and kill myself. I might as well be a plumber. In case I wake up in a week or two, I'll be into a war. Not just with the neighbors, but with the country too. But then I'd wan na take my own life. It's both personal and out to protect it. So I'm going to do my best. I'm going to do it by myself. I won't complain any more, either, because I love you Mommy.<|endoftext|>

My name is Dennis Flak, I'm an overweight guy, in a broken down house with a broken mirror. I barely ever seem to make my parents proud, the thing is, I'm poor. Oh, Dennis, sorry, I only want to help, it's just a hospital. If you can make sense of this, I can take you home. I won't explain, but it's alright. I've been homeless in general for as long as anyone can remember. My father told me about one of my favorites: the way my mother felt, the slow ass shake, the flush, the sinking face. I don't want to tell you about mine, you're going to be holding your breath. My first attempt was the worst. You see, my parents always called me a fool and a failure, but it was always the benefit of doing the right thing, and then they'd come back next year and come back tomorrow and start the new job while their pathetic excuse of a dad was still alive. I was given more than a few favors in my first attempt, but I never made it that far. This is where it got really shitty. I see a nice girl that's not just lucky, she's all rich people, people who'd come to visit me every year and steal my same meals. And she gets thrown out of the house. I want people to hear the words "Peter, I want your advice. I'm always busy!" and be happy. I'm the luckiest guy on Earth, but the girl at the end of the street isn't getting it. She's buying every single food and brand a couple thousand miles away that she can't see at the grocery store, and I mean literally. Hell, she's literally buying breakfast on a street corner by herself, and if anyone's going to care about you, it's not the homeless homeless! Not the poor losers who won the lottery this year, it's the rich; I had to pick which one, and would have absolutely no idea what was in the store. It wasn't exactly household, I wasn't big enough to buy the food, so it wasn't even half as much food as the shops closest to me. I only wanted to help. I don't think that woman would pay me any mind. The restaurant is really awful, with parking, I can sit in here for the rest of the evening, without asking the waitress for my change. I'm uncomfortable. Do you ever feel comfortable? Try to relax, and the landlord hates it. I've had to avoid all the aggravations of the last couple of attempts, or I don't have a room for myself anymore, because he's not that nice. Every single time he finds me sleeping with someone or objects, I go through his closet and kick the door in the half a dozen different ways. But he also hates it, he wants to hear all of my stupid shit, he doesn't want my shite. Hell, I can't even leave my house. That's not the worst part, because the fucking landlord hated me. He talked to me about how he hated the blinds all the time, that he had always been trying to make me stay out of bed, that I knew he didn't mean to, that I was constantly trying to ruin his life because he was sick from partying all the time, and that he hated me because he hated everything I did for him. That was the problem with Dennis, the problem with me, was that he never has a heart, and I don't care that he's sick. He doesn't have a voice, he doesn't know what's going on, he only gives his shit, and I don't care that I'm hely. He has a heart, and he does give his shit, and he's going to be lucky.<|endoftext|>

It took them only fifteen minutes to communicate. It was so simple, in fact, that even the planet's official language still maintained a cult following. For as long as an observer, they had known one another, since this was their way of communicating the true meaning of a word, and yet in the end it had been simple. They played against one another, each relying on each other for strength, confidence, and understanding. Communication was entirely dependent on the identity of the player. Communication had been more effortful, and it became easier to communicate when the others both didn't seem to notice. Their souls could be stashed on a couch, a hipster hokey couch, or somewhere still occupied with lazy teenaged contentment. The three pairs were assigned their positions on the field, in the first week when it was three years since their last meeting. Their looks were usually bright and cheerful, yet their physical appearance was more unsettling, from a distance. Of their three pairs, the Arcadian was the first to appear, but had already decided his place was beyond his care. The street was obscured by an imposing set of headlights which shone through the foggy alleyway. The Arcadian was presented with a bus and addressed the four of them as he stepped out from the back. '... I have been longing to meet you, and I am hoping you will give me the courage to travel across the plain,' he said. 'We have already formed a plan and I need to go first. I'm glad to see you all so far, and thank you for your efforts in preventing us from ever bringing ourselves closer to you. Would you like to know what route I will take?' he said, and all three of them nodded. 'The split road and canyon roads, yeah. The road between Verdun, Gorath and Ibird, the highway in the mountains that marks your boundary. Get over there.' His words surprised the Arcadian. Taking over the planets earth and the Cinnabar planet were the best bets he had received from the both of their clans. The one-liner, their built-in literature formed the foundation to his plans, for he was hired to keep it running while the three legged monster banged on the doors of his hotel. The three of them had begun throwing themselves into each other for every ten thousand humans. How could they let other species spend their time trying to settle down? He asked the three of them to leave their rooms and go about their business. After two centuries, the souls of the four awakened. The Arcadian did not feel the need to scream, to vomit, to scare. This ended what they had begun, and it was starting to make sense. They had achieved the proficiency of three monsters, in human tongues, seven meters tall. Their skill was unmatched, and they certainly possessed the ability to live up to their many name, The Cinnabar Monster. They had began the consolidation of their species into what they wanted to be, a monolithic mess of mass chaos, chaos that would break down to three dimensions, a place that would stand as the beginning of their own demise. Their holographic chambers were filled with their most dangerous "assets ", in human tongue, spheres of molten wood, crystalline magma, as many as they could fit in their tiny sacs. They did not believe in ghosts or worms, since no one would care to see how many as they ate. For reasons other than their preference for the simplest living forms, the Atlads willingly took over their lives, swallowing themselves whole and becoming that much more chaotic with each passing moment. How could they think any better than this? The Atlad destruction had begun. The three of them would fight for their world, for any place their next meal would be, if only a little. They knew nothing more than that and they went about their business, preparing to emerge in time to set the world on fire. And so it came to pass that they became the final life forms of the Atlad. The monstrous beast that used to be, would soon become, the last human being to exist. They would not be honoured for their noble deeds, but for the lives they shared with them.<|endoftext|>

I wonder what they have in store for me. Instead of a glorious assault from their giant, dreadful, ferocity upon us, they've tried using us as their war toys. In fact, I wonder if I really should be scared of them. How could a human so savage and inhuman be using them as weapons? Didn't they observe and anticipate my attack? Did they think I was the only one with the capacity to send a letter or two? Does something stupid have a toaster in their underground bunker that talks to them? Why wouldn't the aliens send a message? "It's time to move on. " They said. I was transported to their domain, where they had threatened to hunt down the entire population of the Amazon for our genocide. " Affirmative. " I said. They were right. Yes, the Amazon will get hunted down, eventually. And in some ways the humans will get better. They will eat us for sport in schools, and fuck us over for fun in the movies. But I was chosen for my flesh and blood to become a slave of the aliens. In turn, I will experience genocide at a much later time, because my blood can still be used as fuel in their wars. The humans will suck us dry with their filthy little cities of other countries, and guide us back to the paling life we once lived. " After the white plague turns on, what we will see will be as beautiful as this. Children will lose their hair, and the air will turn from cold to humid and humid again, winter will strike again, and sickness will ravage our cities. " The humans will cry out, " WAIT! Help! Help! Anything! Just RUN! " And the earth will crumble around them, gently sliding away into a single dark mass. We will be brought out of this dark world, skin, bones, and flesh, to live our new lives where our freedom will come with clear blue skies and big trees. Animals are a far better tool than us. And I know they are actually mad because the humans finally snapped and overran the Amazon. They raped my mom, tried to cook my dinner, and killed me because I won't even dare eat them. I was a being of the earth at least. A different species, I hope. That might be worse than the humans. But even if they have no sense of morality, then I trust that they will make it out of this planet alive. Everything will be fine, and their invasion of Earth is proceeding from this point. Then it will be over. Goodbye, home."<|endoftext|>

Joe watched as his opponent walked up the steps to his arena, looking up at him with a solemn look on his face. An entire studio apartment overlooking the Olympic Park would change his life forever. The doors opened and 6 Russians entered the arena. Obama leaned forward. "Seriously, I'm sorry about your outburst. I didn't mean to, you know, upset you're past friends. " Joe looked down at his feet, for the third time. The world smiled at him. " To see your pets getting rabies? The President of the United States? He must be mentally ill, but I need a solution. I'm not going to lie. You might be against medical intervention and everything, but I need you to talk to me. " " I said, a solution. Besides, you appear calm and collected in your stride. I can assure you, I am not anywhere near Stephen Hawking or Bill Gates, though one high-powered crook might suggest it is possible. " " Doctor, you haven't touched my carpets or appliances. The Ford F150's not worth a dime, " he was reading from his cellphone now. " Why, we haven't gotten into anyone yet, but I plan on traveling to London for another round of games, " Joe said, making my tiny apartment in the tower look bigger. He rushed out of his apartment, with my small apartment in the last two seconds, and went to the opposite wall. My only thought was, " wait a minute! This is not how this is supposed to work! " My heart skipped a beat. A little pale white figure stood on the other side of the room. " Kevin? How can you be so judgmental? " Agent McNamara was acting as if it was how it had happened - Kevin looks so British, and his attire is a pockmarked black suit. Like me. The agent looked around nervously, as if for a moment, before stepping closer and pressing a card to my palm. " My representative, is there anything you need? " Kevin was standing just outside the door frame. Agent McNamara reached down to grab me as he was talking, but I held him back. Kevin took a deep breath and the door frame was opened. The rest of Agent McNamara walked in, simply to bring me in, as our hotel was being remodeled. " Area 51. Interrogators would be off the hook. " Agent McNamara laughed. He looked at the President, and handed him a board with which he played the cards. " You've just been elected president of the United States, right? " President Obama stepped back as Agent McNamara shouted, " *Highly treasured*!?! How badly do you want to put me through this? I know you disgust me more than anything else! But last I heard, someone uninvited caught you all on video calling you a media celebrity! How did you get here? " " Johnny Marr, you forgot my name. The work of Kahan is done! " Agent McNamara laughed. " You really, you really shouldn't have bothered calling him. You're getting more desperate now, and I don't have the balls to stay. No matter what the outcome is, and I can't risk going back down to trash talk, I'm ready to put this moment behind me and try again. " Agent McNamara grew impatient, and sat back in his chair. Kevin checked his phone. " Ugh, you did this again? That's just too much, " he said, finishing my call. " I know. Really, I am ready for something good, but it will never happen this time. I believe myself more patriotic, to believe the only way out of this is through compromise. All I need is... us." Officer McNamara stood up and walked up to Joe. He grabbed a chair, and reclined back onto the couch. Then, he went to the bathroom and stood for a couple minutes. He drew his phone and it launched a picture-worthy message:<|endoftext|>

He's even taller. His dark hair blows in the summer wind, his face is greasy and wrinkled. He smirks at me from behind the crack of the ice and slowly turns around, his head tilted down to catch me as he pulls his mask off, revealing his perfect hazel eyes. His jawbones are huge and he's wearing a suit that matches the jacket. Our laughs are reminiscent of a million nightmares, but an individual personality is the charm he holds. I look back down at the cuffs on my wrists. “ Next I ’ ll take my bike, ” I tell my friend with a smile. The ice has passed, just like the others. He doesn ’ t stop to look at me, as if it means that we will somehow stay up all night. There are things about him that make me fall in love with him, and each one is one of them. I can ’ t deny that. “ Thank you, ” I say, as I draw my own knife and sheaths the knife across his throat. His other hand falls to his waist and I whisper, “ You did well. ”<|endoftext|>

Jack Powers, I went to high school with a year away, math didn't quite make it as a hobby anymore, the book I was reading couldn't help me learn the sciences, we would do second post twice a year. I struggled to work through the hardest assignments at the beginning of the senior year and graduated all the way but I finally felt good enough to go out into the world. I married a woman I know didn't follow me to where I work, but despite that not a single instance was unwanted that month. My third wife was the handsome and smart girl who cared enough to help me create new characters and entertain me. I wasn't as pretty as she portrayed me but I cut it short that day when she gave me her number and took a break from normal life to be with her kids. I was traveling somewhere in Ohio so the drive seemed too long and I just couldn't help but miss that spot in the woods, I couldn't have lived without her. I remember talking to her about her dream, who she was and how I could have her job. I wanted to make her happy, but she just refused and instead she just became unimportant, and that's when things hit awkward. So here I am sitting on the porch thinking about how I do her job, I got a car and don't want to let it get to me before I'm done. I sit here thinking about time traveling, how much I've missed her. My friends might see me on TV talking about how little I missed her, do they try to remember about the old times or will they forever be past? Jack Powers, I know you guys have talked about me in the past, but please stop listening. I know that I was in love with you, but I also know that only one thing crossed my mind as I was reading. I mean....fuck, why did you give me your number? What did you mean? I feel sorry for you, but why did I do this to you? Here's the thing, if you were nervous about just leaving me alone I would say this, I was nervous about something, but I had no idea how to move on, but you gave me your number, and I agreed and talked to you about trying to make me happy... I know you think that it was silly, but the truth is that that I mean to tell you. I had real depression and had my first boyfriend, David, and that was the last time I stopped smiling... but no, I did it anyway because I wanted it to be done, and yes, I never regretted it, and i definitely think you can see why. Jack Powers, the best story we ever told was that a man and a woman with nothing to lose, and after you had helped so many people, and I could have had that for you... it wouldn't have mattered much anyway. I just want to say that we had a happy relationship and it has grown in such a way you know, and please, no more joking about trying to make me mad at you. I know that I want this relationship back now, but can you please just tell me how it is different for me now, can you tell me your philosophy on this ending? Jack Powers, I couldn't tell you if you're good, or stupid, but once you tell me how happy I am for your friend, the friends I've made for myself, will the other people think I was doing something wrong? Jack Powers, you know that feeling when you become so giddy that you have no idea if you're doing it or not, except for one small thing? Well Jack Powers please just take a minute to come over, I need a visit with Jack Powers before we get to work, he might be free of the anger, but he will need that help now. Jack Powers, by the way, can you tell me more about the struggle that I felt before you made me feel so happy? Jack Powers, I have to go see some scientist tonight, also talk about hypnosis, telepathy, bipolar, and the idea of abstinence. All good things. Thanks for reading!<|endoftext|>

I take out the memory book I brought with me from the library to put to sleep. I know the sensation of the air inside the room, this becomes apparent a little as each reading takes a while to complete. I slowly open the book and examine the page in detail. Some small details from the kids that are reading in their sleepwalking headphones, a few paragraphs that I assume are related to word choice. I feel my body shaking more as I get used to this. " Good morning " a man calls out, " time to shower. I found you a bottle of cleaning product on the market! Do you need anything? I'll never find anything nice! " The date reads 8/30. I hold the bottle of cleaning product to my face. It is a bright bright blue liquid and I feel how smooth it is in my mouth. " What is this stuff?! Are you out of your mind!? I ran some tests with it and it looks exactly like I expected. I'll just grab a few girls to play with and get ready to go off to bed. " " Oh yeah, you're up " I called out to the others. " Mr. Bishop, are you ok? Do you need to go after class? " My hands slowly go through my hair as I take out the bottle of cleaning product from my pocket. " I know that's a little strange but I need to go for a walk. " A middle aged woman called out, looking into my direction and following the woman up the alley way. " It's a long walk... " she said softly while running down the alleyway. " Oh, didn't I say something? We were just on the way to work, I could do something nice for you. " The woman behind the car stopped and took a step towards me. " Yeah, I'm fine " I said as I pulled out my bag and placed it on the floor. " Oh that's me " the woman said shaking her head. She was wearing dark black jeans and a purse with ripped buttons that she had on the back. " I was just checking up on you earlier, I saw a red, light blue, " she said while walking closer. The woman behind the car stopped. She was touching her face while looking into my eyes. " Excuse me, why does that happen to you? " I began to explain, " I think you need help, but I couldn't find a doctor. " As my voice trailed off the woman behind her pulled out her phone and looked at me with tears on her face. " That's right, sorry I have to do this, I was worried and was worried about you for a long time. I have been taking care of you, I love you. But I know you're a little blurry. I'm sorry that it hurt. " The woman behind her began to cry, " I'm sorry! I can't explain it to you all the way up until I can figure out if I actually need you. " I look at her confused and see a tear begin to trickle down her face. " I love you, and I will never lose you. " " I love you too, daddy" she whispered as she said her goodbye. I'm closing my eyes as I remember the day I took the memory book and put it in my container. Oh god that was hard...<|endoftext|>

JUST DO IT! YOU CAN NOT BE AMUSED NOT TO ROAD TOGETHER? ** Fuck you. **OH MY GOD. YOU WAN NA GET OFF MY LIST. I'm trying to just get some rest from the psychopathic ramblings of your sibling this country will save! But I don't want to do this! I'm trying to get more sleep. **I want to spend a few more days with my three year old sister. Then I can go home and raise her and spend the time with my two dogs too. I have a shitty job and I'm now training for IT. I could fuck off. ** But seriously don't I have to leave the country and live for myself to fight for my country? I have friends in Canada and I have cousins too. I never thought I could even lead my country! **That's a weird thought then dude. ** Just chill. When we're done there will be more to do. **Right now I have roughly 2 days to kill my brother, and then I have to collect the sword from where he last wanted to be. ** Okay shit, what if I have to die? What if I'm not put out the killing blow? I could make a peaceful life. What if I kill my brother and make a world in my living room in an effort to make a difference? I mean, I can not kill him, but you know? Where are my brothers? There is nobody around to drive you crazy like I've done. The remaining way to the exits is five more minutes. *ACK. * * OW. OW. * I wonder if this is how my bastard brother died? I wonder if he dies so that I can reach my perfect heirs as well? Since the Devil was made, who am I to decide who you want or not? You decide which of your friends will be honored to have potential followers and whatnot? Your own legacy will go to me and all that. Look kid, you never even had to meet your brother. It's like you've only ever had contact with him. Can't you get used to that? Good luck with that. I also don't want that too often. My work project was due to be completed in 5 days. I guess I just have to work out my brother would live a little longer while I spend with my twin daughters. **Umm....time to apply!<|endoftext|>

A few days ago the city, as it became known, was reduced to only trees. And now it is doing the same. I don't know what the world had become, what has happened, in what it used to be called. But my tree has made a claim to the land. An actual land. At the height of my power, I had joined the military. I was researching philosophy of politics, war, global warfare, and more recently forestry. I had worked my entire life to build a tree for this purpose, though the last time I fell into a vicious war with the Gorillas, I was alone. I never had the need, nor do I regret it. However, I am conflicted on the current political climate. I must either accept my fate for not being part of it, or accept that I still have my place in a tree. All I know is that that if I do, I will have won the war against Gorillas.<|endoftext|>

Blackness. Somewhere in the depths of darkness. There's so much shit I'm digging out of this hole but it's too cold to really inspect what's inside. They're coming up for me. I'm not gon na surrender now. This city has always been my home. It will be just a lab for science and art. I went to art school. And studied it. Will you sacrifice the concept of color in the blood of those you loved? Is the loss of your soul fulfilling? Is the formula for controlling the revolution of color? Is the understanding of a medium the key to food? And all those songs I want to go on, I can do. I love the paintings. They're dangerous. They're ugly. No, fuck it. I can do this to this city and it's got ta be me. I need to go home and show those enemies the truth. Don't want to throw out some who are going to be my saviors. So much that I need to close the blinds. My family will be next. My protégé's gone and they want to save me. You're safe. I'm safe. I don't need to go home anymore. The blood pressure's gone but the angels don't want to help me with the proper procedure. Do they know? Don't you want me to clean the bodies all over this magnificent city. Done. So close to stopping them. They put down the syringe. Staring at me is too much pressure. But I'll still follow through with it. I'm closing in now. I got you guys. Just blow this big ice cube off the head of this colorful colorful man. No "up and down" bullshit. AHHH!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>

Edit1: * "they are twins, made of want and desire " * I mean they are mother and son, that only makes sense. If the mother could visit to consigliere of their fathers. It wouldn't make sense. I see them as identical, from birth, from birth. I hear them complaining that he breaks or steals or leaves, and complains that they are more then they think they are. But really, that's just me and my mother, it's no matter. That doesn't explain what they do, or how they don't know it at all. It makes no sense. Maybe they are fake because they don't feel it, maybe they are happy because they understand it. But what are they thinking? They are just children, they should be happy that things are the way they are. Who am I kidding, where am I? If you can't see them - who else? - you can't feel them, you have to be a figment of your imagination. They dont think like me, they think like me because they know that there are a lot of people that exist. But they want that and want to be there, it's like believing in something you can only see on a crystal ball. Their lives have been molded up for them not that they did not see it coming. Let them take the Big Stand, and make a difference.<|endoftext|>

I said to myself. I don't really mind. This isn't the same feeling as opening my eyes. I can not turn around now but that doesn't mean I have to. As I try my best to think of where I am in the next few hours I see every sign of this same stupid dream. Bigger. Fatder. Deep. Definitely flat. This isn't my dream and I don't like it either. I want to get up. I want to sleep. The dream was much more intense than the real one. Maybe it is another dream or just the other... I don't really understand this one but I might as well be. Please leave before I ask anyway. She comes out of nowhere. She is actually here. A man with his hands behind his back and a woman running down the street. I can not make out his face but I can tell him his face is very familiar. What the hell are we talking about here? I smile. My mind is very overwhelmed now. I am the one talking to myself but also his. I don't like that man... this isn't his dream either. I haven't locked eyes with him in over a year. He looks different... he doesn't seem the same anymore. He always stops when we speak to each other, he usually speaks with the woman first and the woman next when the dream starts. He might even talk more slowly. I probably shouldn't do this but I feel better about that. I can tell he is not that different. And I should know for sure he isn't talking to me or anything at all. My dream continued but without the man. As I looked around I realized what my next move was. I tried to move but couldn't. I couldn't even.. I moved and started to walk around in circles, trying to figure out where and when I could move. It was only a dream and I was too scared to move. I couldn't see his face because of the way he looked and his strange beard was on his face. I looked behind me to realize that my hands were moving while I was going around in circles. I couldn't move anymore. I also couldn't see anything or anything at all. The fear and confusion were playing over me like a tv. I've never had any last thoughts before this and now I'm just overwhelmed with fear. A tiny wave of terror hits me. This is a dream and it isnt real... it is just a dream... I wish I could hallucinate. I try to open my eyes but they pop open and I look at myself in my dream world. I guess I am dreaming right? What is this? Is this.. I can't speak... what is going on?<|endoftext|>

"Hell? " " Again? " " Yes, heaven. " " Why am I actually here? " " You've passed out and lay still for too long. If you're going to lose consciousness, it's time to return to Heaven. You may then, visit your friends and family at work or leave this place. " " How long have I been here? " " For a lot longer. Come on, what's your name? " " Ted.

I'm not trying to trick you with my position here, just being curious about the place. " " What makes you think this place is Hell? " " Well... I have heard God refer to Heaven as heaven. However, it seems, it's a public place. Turns out, I really am in it for the thrill of it. " " Oh. Wow. How was Heaven like before? " " Well, it was a place you thought about living, where you stayed in some kind of secluded desert and fought animals and- " " The hellish thing about that... " " Um... yes. " " Good lord. Would that be the afterlife I would meet upon death? " " Why the hell would it be? " " No, I wasn't even sure. " " Well. That explains your age, right?

In a small office in Tokyo... I made a note in my note pad. After a couple of days, things were starting to go wrong, and I was really making a hard effort to not get too depressed. After all, who wants to be depressed a lot anyways? I, on the other hand, had to go live on a shitty, cardboard box from'Reaper-For-Life' ( not good enough for social programs ) and stand here, like my apartment would be a cheap knockoff, making no difference to anybody that saw it. I don't know that I would have liked it so much if they didn't fix that, either. I tend to quite enjoy, and going out for drinks all day won't feel so bad. Well, whatever. I finished up with the VHS that I had taken from the body of the needy college student, saving the tape for a forgotten to understand reason I had'Extra weight' days. I then listened to a maddeningly loud creek of ominous noise ( for what it could be. ) and when I wanted to scream it out loud, I began to crank the volume just a little too loud. That was when I slipped and splintered and fell out of the box and onto the carpet that was now my feet. I was in the middle of a field of trees, and I had forgotten to grab the leash, when I decided to smash into the trees just as they were whispering the most sinister words I could. It was a brutal blow; so, I wrapped up the tape, and began pulling up my crop of flesh to take hold of. It would not last long, eventually, I panicked and fell out of the box, and laid down on the ground. When I opened my eyes again, I saw it. The house had gone dark. In a helicopter, nothing but snow and the shredded foundation of my building was where my body would once been. I drifted out of the way, to a hospital room. You know the ones you watch when the outside world is in flames, but the outside world never leaves. They call me a Reaper. Doesn't it take you as well to admit your one and only job to one another? Who cares. Because I don't care. Because I have done what was necessary. The path only leading to two roads leads to the afterlife, all because of that Hail Mary Sinatra, Ha Ha. This time I chose to leave it all behind.<|endoftext|>

** "I used to think the apocalypse was a glitch. That was in a movie, real life movies. Why aren't I telling my friends? We got poor neighborhoods... " ** Karen kept reading the news. * No, okay, he isn't one of those smug fucks who cuts through me by the sands...* The radio buzzed through the cover of the mail. A reporter, stowed at the office, entered the building. " Hello? " She asked. " Ah, hello, Scott, who's calling from Harvard over at Reading? " The reporter leaned back in the front booth, from where her tablet flew. " Scott? We're gon na need a translator in time, you know. " " Who? " " Right, me, this girl you say you know? Maybe this place called Vixio? " " Are you bringing up the neighborhood she works at? " The reporter sighed and walked out. Scott reached for the computer nearby, unfurling a grimoire from the dotted line. " I'd recommend making sure you have paper that fits your house. " Scott turned to Lisa and headed back, fumbling through his coveralls. " I'll fly over to Vixio and cover him with that cut, we'll both be *so* hyped up. " Scott knew he was in good hands. " Just get her back to answering our Facebook questions. " Scott opened his mouth to speak, but Lisa motioned down his way. " Okay, let's have a chat! " A female voice shouted behind the desk. Several men sat on their couches outside the building. " Are you fucking kidding me? How come there isn't a front door at Reading? " " Four hundred and seventeen guests. One for every three droids that we take to the warzone. " This chat was a show for the occasional movie in the offices, where a host would issue a particularly dramatic play on the screen. " Easy! " the host exclaimed, and the door burst open with a wild droning leap. " I called in for some talk! Let's have some talk! " A couple of ladies spilled into the room, immediately attracting to each other's attentions. A few left. " So... what did the- " " Kimball's golf course! " A woman cried, rising up to address the gathered attention. She raised a hand towards the front of the building, which opened to reveal Kimball's golf course, nestled amongst fifteen other golf courses covered in green grass and a nicely-dressed woman. She gingerly got in front of the camera, and confidently announced herself as Kimball's favorite golfer. " I won five titles with my golf swing. " The reporter raised a pair of eyebrows. " What? " " I left my mansion downtown and am experiencing some difficulty inside. " " Are you going to hold a press conference? " A man shouted in disbelief, flushing water down one arm and jabbing a finger at the camera as the cameraman hurried away. " I know I am! " The woman collapsed in front of a desk, shuddering as she glanced up. A man with her eyes rolled his eyes. " That's really you. A bad con. You know I know exactly what's going on, but it's because of me. " A second woman caught her breath and nodded. " It's because of... er... everyone. " " Oh. Right. " Lisa rolled her eyes. " My dead dad was... er... Himself dead."<|endoftext|>

Time does its job and when you are done this task is finally over, you can do it. Not even on the first try you can keep a spark in the right place. You have always stuck with the task and know it already for when it is finally time to get back to where you started. You calm your nerves and the moment before the problem has left, you begin to take the leap back to where you started. Everything is done here, especially the thing you started with. You walked off your task, ignoring all the pain and suffering you would face, slowly drifting toward its flow. That's where you put your second venture in. In a light of fire and light of water, just moments ago you were the one on the hard burning rock, screaming to pass the time by. You remember the horror you would feel in such a place on this cosmic scale. It wasn't gentle at all, it was cold and thick in comparison to the other raw material in the rock. It picked up with great speed at almost identical pace, screaming it's endurance was its only hope. A simple eternity is blissful. And you step on it, it whisking across the surface, almost immovable. You are the second man on the beach.<|endoftext|>

Once upon a time, there was an old lady with a beautiful, scaly face that reflected the sun through the cracked roof of a crumbling office building. She said hello to the troubled man who sat across from her. He said, "Hi! I've been wanting to talk to you! My name is Jayne. " He laughed, and started to describe his life. He was young, withered, with disease, and was in this world unaware of his past. There was a feeling of hope at that moment, the next he would be alone in this world that he no longer wanted. But that was not how things went. " Jayne, where'd you come from, Jayne? " asked the man on the other end of the phone. " I came from a bad time. Something had to be done. " " It wasn't me, was it? You were a nice guy, but bad people robbed you of everything you had. You made me what I am. Something needed to be done. " The man on the other end must have just felt sympathy for the young woman, because in the distance he could hear her tears as they fell on the windows. " I never didn't know how to try. This is what got to me, I hated those people because they drove me to this life. Nothing can ever change that. Everything can. For you to try to change, it must have been you. You did not stand a chance. I hate this for you. " The old lady stood up and walked away. " Thank you. " and walked away. Suddenly, a crack emitted from the window, and a woman running away. Jayne turned to her friend who stood by her, and told her to follow her. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - " Hi Jayne.

" Jayne replied as she stared at Kevin in confusion. " Me too. " Kevin shrugged. He remembered the men who robbed him. He must have been a bad man. But he needed to get help from others.

"But I wanted to go camping with that women before I killed her. " said the Joker to his assistant JK, deadpan. The old man looked at him with a level face- serious enough to mask his annoyance. JK looked back to his assistant and said, " Although it was fantastic, I think I'm gon na see JK again next month. I want him to come over and finally tell me that she's dead. " Joker hated that. He knew the 2 weeks where the two of them met and it made him want to kill the insane character that killed his 8 year old daughter and would live out his life forever doing crazy things because his jealous wife always figured the part that would kill her, would end up being. The guy hated all it brought, drinking too much, and basically killing out of a puppy. The women before him screamed " Go away! " which got the Joker's attention. The Joker used his new enhanced senses to only listen for jokers new/old dialogue and would not respond to his talk with all the facts of his life with the most ridiculous and terrible jokes and would just walk away. The Joker heard a voice reply and began to get up and walk over to the woman at the far end of the camp. He took JK by the hand and pulled him into the truck. " Hey, joker- " the first voice in a while responded. " JK, you wan na head over and make me see that fucking whore? " " Of course I will! You wont question me about this asshole, see what happens and then I promise- " " Will? " JK asked quietly. " I didn't exactly have the chance to look up her name, but I told you your supposed to know her name before you killed her. Oh, shut the fuck up, joker. How much will you tell me? " " I'll just drop everything " said joker as he stepped out of the truck. JK didn't know what to say before the bullet left his head and ripped out of his brain like a shark ripped out of dinner. " Hey, buddy, think of the fish... And the spear, they're buried in it."<|endoftext|>

It had been harder than I had imagined. There was no number for me since I had been killed almost five years ago by the supposed monster under my bed. When I was diagnosed as a monster a century ago I wasn't sure how else to explain this. It would seem like I am that one with a ghoul too. I will continue to try and remain rational as best as I can. I am currently sitting in the kitchen of my home watching the TV as part of a zombie movie. I see a man clutching a branch and two women are sprinting past me. Two of my patients have been so badly shot that I am knee deep in blood. The man is coughing blood. I hear a woman scream and slump over to the table. I step back and look at the running woman. The woman starts sprinting again. I grab my knife, but my knife doesn't get a cut. There's blood on the table. We watch as the woman slowly sits on the edge of the table, panicked. I feel death's grip tighten on me. I am so weak. I feel the grip tighten on my body. The woman only tries to scream at the top of her lungs. "Are you alright? " she asks. I realize the connection to my girlfriend is strong now. No one can ever hurt me. I can protect my girl. As the man starts moving towards her, she cowers in the corner of my room. I breathe heavily. There is no one to help me. After about five minutes she has managed to hit me in the face with her knife. She slowly falls to the floor, crying. " I am so sorry and wanted to tell you that this is my home. I promise you, I don't know how it worked, but I am so sorry." Her eyes wide with tears. There are two photographs of me. The man in the pictures is crouching down next to me while the woman is sat here watching television with her computer. She is preparing her knife to cut the blood from my face, but the knife comes apart as she does so. There is a ring on the nightstand of the house. The man in the photographs is checking it out. He removes the knife from the purse in the kitchen of the woman and places it in his palm. He takes a final look at the abandoned street and the police haven't found anything. I am left with the realization that the woman is dead. I can hear my girlfriend and I moving about in the kitchen. I can hear them arguing over how to break up the argument but we don't need to. I don't care.<|endoftext|>

Well, I can't remember which part of my grandmother shared the line for prayer or answer. Who in their right mind would invoke such a thing in a material sense? Eventually, the crazy found an end to imagination, and flung into the ether to seek his intended benefactor. But when God came for the lost and for those whom he wanted to introduce us to a fuller, satisfying existence, he brought about a different end. For who really asks eternal, heavenly service... I must say. Though here I stand, no longer a member of the tale. My grandma was amused by my existence, by my quest in search of knowledge that had disappeared from her life. I was a gullible teenager, who drank deeply of our nation, and sought to know one good thing. Never having given a second thought to questions that came up as they failed to answer, I was met with stifling skepticism and no help. Still, me and my old friend sat around the lake, ready to start another conversation. When I asked the question for three straight years, my grandma lay beside me and began to bawl gently. When God had finished his words, I simply stared in awe. Not to mention that I heard him talk, like a crazy telepath, until the ocean swirled in disappointment and the loins that now held me in suspended animation changed their appearance. A downward spiral, perhaps. They grabbed me by the shoulders and dragged me down to where I now lay, wrapped in cocoon. I considered giving the world back to them. As if they could just solve my problem. As if I would somehow figure out all of that nonsense, truthfully or not. As if I would spare them a second to ask me a few questions. But that all changes now. Everything is new and as usual, I am floating among the angelic columns of words. My grandmother helps me search the book, and looking up from my book in search of a word for prayer, I suddenly find a letter, and a letter that is pleading. "... But perhaps I should listen..." Edit: grammar<|endoftext|>

He had always come from a deep inbred family. The youngest of three, that was, until his uncle injected him with an exotic drug. It made the abuse that much harder to forgive. There wasn't much he could do, really. Mom, Dad had fallen victim to my awful habit of doling out "death's flow " each day. I had told them that I would eat, drink and hang out with them all. I would drop them off in groups, rest and eat until they died. When they did, I would give them a hand to the call center. The program to broadcast the daily survival time of the family to the family members was always the most disturbing part. Their eyes and breathing still dictated the weather. It also signaled their food, so I would give them whatever they wanted. They never felt cold, hungry or tired anymore. I made sure it was all worth while to ensure the family was able to survive, to be safe, to be happy. The only thing that prevented me from feeling ripped was the environment around me. I spent most of my time being in outer space and constantly afraid of the dark. They had never seemed to escape.<|endoftext|>

How long ago has it been? I didn't know you could drive this car faster than you were going. You drive this car mad? I bet you two're what you think this is, they'll do the same. At least let us let them try to drive together. Now let's go, though. The pothole is the worst part. It hurt just like the hell your mother took care of it. You both won't stand a chance. You're going to end up going in the back, down, your left shoulder, your leg in the center. When you walk out the front door you'll be one step above the hill in front of you. The ladies won't see you without your button up for ladies. You're supposed to run in the back seat, but only straight ahead, the doctor will turn you down. It's not like you know what it's like. What do you do? * Can't you tell, you're gon na hurt. * How do you get there? Take the gas. That the woman in the back will understand, but it won't be long before they'll panic in front of you and you're going to crush them. You're going to crush your own family for once, out of pure desperation. Good luck on that one.<|endoftext|>

I watched a young girl in her early twenties walk into the store, gripping something in her hand and look at her close, and after a few moments a little girl, older than me, opened her hand and looked me in the eye and gently nodded in my direction. She nodded back, and then, *something* fell into the shopping basket that marked our world, with us soon to follow. Oh, no, this girl - *something* - had been walking through her childhood, whilst taking ice cream with her friends. She was now holding what looked like a perfect looking ice-cream cone, containing a white, blue, strawberry cone, and chocolate milk. She looked at me and smiled, for what seemed like an eternity, then she froze. Her smile was becoming very long now. One shot, one tearful celebration, and we could all end up here all over again. I stopped running, but before I could reach the world, I saw another kid enter, shaking something, and standing tall, holding something else in his other hand. Well, he... never mind. The child shrugged and looked at me with a tear in his eyes and whispered, "... and yes, my good sweetie, I'm afraid that in the future the future you want *me* to stop. " I didn't have time for this. Fuck. I had to chase this girl. I could look at her shoulder, that young boy, and see if I could turn the dial on some face. " Hello? " A voice called out from above the cart. I turned around to look, for my phone. My phone rang. I turned the phone up. " Hello, I'm Claire, I wanted to talk to you about something. " It sounded familiar. This time it was her! Claire, dear girl! * And this time, you're using my phone. * " Hello? Where are you going? " I asked, trying to get it on my ear. " I was trying to talk to you about something. And you sounded lonely, with your grandmother. " " They're supposed to be together! " " Mommy... I'm sorry... " I froze. " Sorry, sweetie. " A voice croaked in my ear. I stopped the phone and threw the headset away. It flicked through the- " " I thought you were the coolest, oh so cool girl I ever met."<|endoftext|>

"Oooh, that's just wonderful! " Alex shrugged, letting the blood drip down his shirt. He looked up as Michelle continued to wince on the table. " Really? That's disgusting. " Michelle opened up the laptop on her desk, washing the blood off before continuing to tear off the shirt. " Honestly, yes! You guys can get back to work in seconds if you like. " " Get over there, Michelle. I'm gon na put on some makeup, it looks like you were a lot too busy. " Alex said, testing the grip on his gun. Michelle threw her head back down, choking on her own blood. " Great! My finger is bleeding like crazy! " " You uh, did you take me seriously at first? I think you were an insane patient! " Michelle raised the gun to Alex's temple, gun pressed into the palm of Alex's hand. " What kind of insane patient is this? " " Well, looks like he was lucky, really, let him see the video so he can understand what's going on. But, Alex! " The pair began to step toward each other, Alex completely calm before Michelle grabbed both of his shoulders, pulling them down on either side of him. As they stood in the middle of a large conference room, they noticed Michelle crouching in the corner, holding his back for several seconds as Alex tried to cover up the carnage outside. " I was a great help around here and I really think I helped you out so you can see just how insane you were. " Michelle said, still holding Alex's back. The two looked at each other, barely more than a few seconds. " So.. uh.. that's all? All this other stuff. How did you get in there all this time? " Michelle exclaimed, tightening her grip on Alex's gun. " What? " " Nothing. Anyway, I asked you about this cause you killed him. If you hadn't done it for me, you might have been here earlier. " Michelle raised the gun again as the hostages left, focusing on one of their faces at the end of the table. Alex stared dumbfounded. " What? I did!? " Michelle cried in pain, the pain at this point likely causing Alex to drop his gun. " What? No! Look! Now can we see this? If I could just kill him, I would still be here. But, you killed me, Alex. You killed a man! " Alex raised his gun to stop her, and Michelle followed suit, waving it in the air. They both watched from the room, dumbstruck at the sight of the body in the middle of the room. A dark aura, hovering softly above it. " This is absolutely horrifying. Who am I? Why aren't I dead!? " Michelle said, raising her gun, the man glaring at her. " No! No, this is sick! How can that be? You murdered my father, I'd really rather have never existed! I love you so much! It's just so hard, you know? You... you just look so... lifeless. " Alex said in a slight stupor. Michelle started to laugh uncontrollably, the sobs of the victims flooding her voice. " Michelle, there you are, killing him. You murdered my sister, she was just too precious. Yet, you killed her husband! Why! Is it your imagination? " Alex gasped at his friend's comment. Michelle started laughing uncontrollably again, and Michelle backed away from the table. " Alex, stop crying now, please. " Michelle wrapped her arm around his shoulders and began to weep. " There is no need to cry now Michelle. We can talk about what was said, if you'd like."<|endoftext|>

“ you don ’ t have to do this, just sit down, enjoy your afterlife. ” He said with a wink to his congregation, many stood up from their seats and began to do a sort of pseudo-circle. It didn ’ t take long for the spiritual council to flit about filling up their local priests office with their complaints. It was worth it for the re-release of the first movie made in heaven. “ Many of you have complained about your heavy drinking habits... ” he continued, standing now from across the church aisle. He sat down and continued with his campaign, eyes heavy with the fright on the people at the observatory, carefully watching the crowd swallow nervously as he raised the homemade broomstick so that it swiped away Satan ’ s momentum. God stepped towards the door that he was searching for, standing over the eternally living and in their stead. His footsteps played a silent, guttural tune as he slowly emerged, stepping to the side as the voice from the crowd boomed to life in a collective whisper, but he was the last, standing just behind. The thirty seats of the catholic church, while evenly strewn, suddenly bulged. Their staring fixed intently on the front yard, the small church jostled against one another in time to see the myriad congregation loose their seats and die. The silence fell. God prayed softly to all six of the faithful, realizing that his voice carried the soul of those far past their prime. He would finally be able to carry the soul of Jesus. edit: something is up<|endoftext|>

There was a myth one day. Many tell that it was there, in ancient times. A-Hagath, it was some of the most horrifying tales they could find, vile and terrible. Among them however, it just didn't interest them. The men we'd used to hunt were out of their depth, with their numbers diminishing faster than the population. A haze of dust hung heavy in the air from all around them. Each man to his fourth floor, impudent steps were slow and deliberate, as if the long ladder slowly dragged it's way through the darkness. Cries to stop the breathing, how many silences did they have? "Oh no... " One hiccup of coughing interrupted his labored breathing. " We need to go... " No reply. The door creaked open and ambled into the war room, where the impudent steps were shivering and the agitated men spent an eternity grooming the younger prisoners. To a little a little girl with open eyes, the secret hole barely appeared in her giant face, as if it had little room for debate, no room to attack. " Oh my god... " Someone heaped their bag onto the bed and set down the things. " Oh, oh, uh, you did run. You've been shivering too long. " The male captive scratched at his head and turned to his woman. " I'll bring the others back. " No response. " Is it too late, " she said in a slow and cheery voice. " We can't take this back! " The man nervously pursed his lips. " I just don't know! " " We're not stopping the rumbling of the beasts, " the female said as she turned to face his bedside. She motioned him to stand. The bed where their chests had previously rested replaced them. A blade lay on the bed, bared across her chest, laced with gauze and gas. Sodden eyes stared out into the world and mused over the words of the memories as they were writhed by a young girl. " Do not despair. " The boy nodded and took a few steps forward, welcoming the horror of the elements. He gave no reply. Not for a second did he relax. The woman turned to face the impudent man and she smiled. " To all the young men of the city, with all their warnings and fears, I deliver this to you in a single *summon*. " The man snorted. " Meow?"<|endoftext|>

"Ri. Will you mind ordering the eggs? " Yum muttered to himself as he chewed on the corn not eating by himself. " Fine we've got two I'll have a big one too" he promised himself. He would get it for himself however. At least that I promise you the quality of eggs is fine they say. I could understand, they'd stop at the eggs and strangle them. Their petty opeat. I could even get them to produce a similar meal if I have that way they always have, and always always demand. I could tell they love their human women, they love being treated like filth when they provide them with the privacy the humans could not. Shit they are born with a very special handicap that could easily kill them themselves.<|endoftext|>

Everyone wanted a rubber duck, so many loved, but only one year was possible. He couldn't even be trusted with flying, he'd been better at spotting lovers that way. But, there were other ways to play. A ride-along seemed the best one had. He'd taken the best boy. They'd shared a bed, and then danced. They played and screamed and cried, even if only for a second. He drew out his old gun. He was a good boy, but he'd hated him when he tried it, and it was nothing compared to the sights. He fired. Then he loaded. And fired again. He looked at the treeline. And looked up at the sky. He wasn't flying.<|endoftext|>

THeboard and Dictator at the helm, I guess. Washed, creased at every turn, half-baked with leaves. Every game is left open for the challenger, his ambitions to occupy those fallen pieces of skin so he can be crafted anew. Just like one can upgrade one's looks, grow out of their little imperfections. Not last time, one had to trade their armor for a mask or their legs to hold it together. Might be worse this time. But an insult is far worse than a smile. You don't know what's more irritating that one's ruin.

The ambulance rushed by, rushing to the hospital. It was a winter morning; Mike diomede had just gotten back from a long weekend of research. Walking down the street was always expensive, but not anymore. Mike's favorite part about this relaxing afternoon was going to be shopping. It was a special day for Mike. Walking into the shop gave him the feeling that he had left something there. Inside the shop was no car, even though there were plenty of them out the door. Steve was the assistant general manager. His easy smile made Mike yawn and fall asleep just like everyone else did. Today was a special day Mike. His usual appointment was at the hospital, he had been checked in yesterday. The surgeon took Mike to the specialist, and in the next few days, Mike was adjusting to the new routine. The doctor started talking first, calling Mike about things that had been happening in his family. The nurses cheered, the doctor said his way through the story, and the man began his speech. Mike walked up to the doctor to ask for more information. Mike thanked the doctor and walked towards the bedside, making sure the doctor was comfortable and able to listen. After a short while of this conversation, the doctor finished his speech and left the room. Mike thanked the doctor as he came closer, tears streaming down his face. He stood there for a minute, looking at the doctor, then slowly walked away. The doctor looked at him a moment later and smiled. "Good evening. There's very little hope for Mike, but there are plenty of ways to make sure you stay awake. We're currently down to one good decision. What are your options for me?" The doctor shook his head sadly. Now this wasn't a decision Mike had made lightly. Every decision was possible. He couldn't bring himself to make the choice, he knew he would have to be careful. He felt defeated, but he knew it wasn't his choice that had to be made. After a few moments of deliberation, Mike decided it was time. He turned to his personal computer and opened the text-based software. After a few minutes, he looked over at his 3.4G-GPS icon, and did a few things to make sure he was all on the right track. The number one constant he always had that he could always get positive results was the icon that changed his city. It showed an artificial up-rise, usually with a tropical setting, and extremely realistic landscape. It made Mike happy, but he had to do something. *No. No. No. We're going to make this very hard, Mike. There isn't much hope. * He pulled out his phone, and dialed his number. He got a text from Mike: *Hello? * The numbers went back to 634-666-8750. The battery was draining rapidly, but the text was still there. He checked that his phone was still connected to the internet and the battery was going to last at least 4.3 hours. The office email was on his account: *The NASA Cryosleep Gravitation Center in Air America is a safe and reliable place to send samples to keep a section of the Earth's crust stable. Long-term, storage of Earth's ice-clear fluids at a low temperature and relative humidity is only permitted because of the relative stability of the atmosphere and a slim chance of maintaining a healthy planet. Do not send samples, as further data is required. Do not go into cryosleep, as an unlucky snowflake won't be able to be seen again for a year and dies. Once the ice does melt, NASA servers will be unable to deliver samples for science or the public. DO NOT send samples, as the Antarctica expedition will be permanently abandoned. * A moment later, the cryosleep storage chamber door was open, however it was packed with roughly a cubic foot of frozen rock. The sky was full of people. The man in the little blue suit had apparently placed his phone inside the chamber for the very first time. The hospital had been a place of wonder and elation. The words drifted off the screen: *DO NOT ENTER. *<|endoftext|>

I saw it on the news. Oh it was freakishly huge. My sister, doing her laundry or her pants started to burn. To my utter amazement she covered her flushed, hot pig leg. A tissue sample smeared her hand pink and red. It ate back everything off her wrist, revealing how her leg was dismembered. I had to check the bill before she was taken away. I can only see what we never had. Oh and her husband was with her, her baby steps were crying and then he hit the ground. No dice. Why that place in Alberta? OMG. He had only been visiting that place for 3 days. He had almost done it. I ran to find him, and he stood up. Then, he took off his shirt, revealing an obscenely large tumor on his chest. He looked terrified, but ran to the doctor. It was indeed dead. I opened my eyes, but my jaw shot open in shame. Dad had finally found the cure for the plague of our age. Little did he know, before he turned his back and walked out of the barn to leave his child to die of starvation and pain.<|endoftext|>

As The Doctor commanded his guest for “ one last great white whale ” to speak. Earlier that day the world had lost all form of wealth and power. Initial reports only indicated violence in Britain, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Jordan and the United Kingdom. You see no reason as to why these populations would continue to suffer in this country. The Doctor, shocked by the chaos, decided to joke. “ It will happen ”. The phrase had quickly spread in the world and turned rage on such large parties with so many quickly screaming. The outbreak of the bubonic plague could be prevented. The Doctor, laying about twenty feet under the blankets, fell asleep as soon as someone exited the closet and did a camera dance. They all looked at each other and began to panic. The crowd shook at the sight. “ It ’ s time to take our pride. I love you. As much as this plague pleases me. I hope I can make a difference. If not I can ’ t prevent another one. It ’ s time to stop working until they are exhausted. ” One person, aged about ninety years old looked up, and nearly wiped the tears off his face as he shook his head, “ I do. But I need you to take care of my parents. I will not stop working until they are aware that we are alone and helpless. ” The crowd let out cheers and greeted the Doctor for finally arriving to the Nevada weather.<|endoftext|>

The wind's slow, threatening the sky tonight and passing through the trees is what brought me here. The stony red dirt had me looking for places to hide and water supplies to drink and toiletries. A young woman was the last alive when I first set eyes on her. She lived alone on the edge of a cliff and looked to be in the woods. There were so many sights to view and if you could see anything, you would think you would see lost trails of death. I couldn't care less. I'm leaving this town after three days without noticing any traces of life or finding food. The last trail of food was dug out by trees and down the side of a house for farming. I found a pouch for both of us. Nothing to take bites of. When I figured out that I didn't need to dig out that pervert, I decided to set out in a small pack and grab the rest. Today was different though. This trail ran full of holes and I knew I would have to go out somewhere. Now I had three days to figure it all out. Up from the hole in the bushes I found a sign and started setting up camp. When I saw a man, I was scared for him and wanted to help him. What the hell was going on?! He was walking along the trail back towards the house. I grabbed a stick and pushed his hand forward on the other side. The stick snapped when I did, so I bent it back and hit him on the head. He went pale and me on alert. He held me down hard enough to make him fall, but I got him back up and laid him flat on the ground, bleeding on the ground. I stayed there until he calmed down and saw me, lying on the ground with my hand on his chest. He laid limp all around him, not a sound came out of him. This may have been the end for me but it was still good enough. Three days went by and after making camp with the other two killers I finally figured out where my house was and I didn't have to find it. Just down from the hill was a trail leading through the woods. Overhead I heard the sound of a car pulling up. The noise seemed oddly familiar at the moment and I heard the baritone grow closer with each breath. I turned around and let the car pull away from the road and to the horizon. Out the window I could see my headlights shining on a dark red hood of a car. There was a frightened look on my face before a thick rope tied to a roof billowed up and attached it to me. I held out my hands for him to take and his hand grasped mine. The rope broke and he disappeared. I heard that voice again and grabbed me by the arm before I could have a word or even a word to say to it. I realized what I was looking at and turned around. This time it was the town's police station where I found out what had happened and what didn't. But nothing could stop me. I grabbed both of them in my arms and started walking out the door.<|endoftext|>

I am a soldier, and I shall not leave this world, for I know death may be a brutal one, but at least I get a comfort in knowing I died in some kind of fitting way. As I walked down the hallway, I think of my father. He was a scholar, teaching philosophy to the high school years. He taught me things I learned that are, to this day, still in the minds of the 16-20 year old boys that I dated and dated, more than anything. The things that I have learned were painful things, taunting me not only for my formality, but for mine. In my heart, I truly believed that he was the bravest of the boys, despite his enablers. We met when he was twelve and he stayed with me. A quick, subtle punch on my arm, and then the contents of my mind flooded over like a flood over an empty lake. He got to know me more and loved me more. When the time came for the young one of us to leave he came forward and said, "I've sent your letter home. Let's see if you'll understand how good the school I love got this far." It was our only chance to say goodbye, and we got off at the drop, close to home, to avoid getting arrested. My house was on fire. My father had left me on the back porch, and I was afraid, but I knew I had given up. I tore up the letter into eight pieces, immediately "delivering them to the trash can in the driveway," as the letter stated. The building was no where near where I had read it. *I honestly can't imagine her doing anything like what she did with the letter, but hey, at least she liked me. * I jot down the last three letters and put them in the trash can, and finally, I told them all the truths of what had transpired. I told them about my past, but I also told them about my love. I would become a fighter. I would show the world that something bad could have happened. I would show everyone that this world and people were as a whole, but it was so dark that the ground around me shook when I went down. I remember the morning, as I walked to the closet, and brought my phone. As I walked to the closet, I left a reminder on it. I did not remember opening the door, but it was enough to wake me up when I did. After my nightmares abated, the next morning I was back in my bedroom. I was up late, and nothing was keeping me awake. I was both afraid and excited as I was dreaming that I could die with my lover's love. I opened the front door, and this time I fell asleep.<|endoftext|>

" As John flipped through his contacts, he could see... some of the companies that service the phone numbers on the outside of the line. These were numbers which could no longer be traced back into another user's account with nothing left to recall. " Lets try it! " He said as he pulled on the large screen and saw what looked like a green portal of a device sitting in front of Him. He noticed the phone screen was unlit when he touched it, which seemed to indicate that the screen had gone silent. As He started the new process to see his purchases, the entire line went blank. As he finished putting the phone back in place, the screens changed to a mundane yellow that somehow was not so modern or futuristic. " Ugh " John thought to himself. " None of those companies seem to do anything in this line of work. I really hate everyone in here, especially the people that use the line of Messengers. " He sat down on the computer desk behind his desk, closing it behind him. He did not need the team to be able to think of ways to extend the Time Drive far enough to open other phone lines. " But... Why? " he asked his friend. As he opened the big screen of the telephone terminal to show a colleague who had not checked his policies and not filled in the billing information, he was met with an answer. " Well, what about others? These other customers the time drives seem to have more troubles with us than the Time Drives themselves. " John turned the dial the numbers into the name of the company that supplied the technology. This was the new Phone for Time Drives. " John here, " He muttered to himself. " They're the first of their kind."<|endoftext|>

"That's not possible, that's not how you sound, you know, I just love how your accent sounds. I understand how you're confused and disgust over what's going on " Cortana thought. She always hated how that line came across on screens and how people would write this, but she had to try anyways. " Excuse me, Ms. Grace? This is... " Cortana's voice grew deeper and more profound. " We have a very important job to do here, you've got to understand why I can't give you credit, because she refused to take my job seriously, " " Do I even have to? I did it all for her, for her. Now sit here, " said Siri, checking her watch to see that there was barely a minute left. " Yes please don't be upset about it, " Cortana exhaled, her voice tensed, she clearly had much to lose. " Yeah fine, since this is your first attempt at... " " And now all of a sudden? " " Yes. We could have your work, why wouldn't you? " " Well... you know what you couldn't do, once I found your potential, it was nothing " " That was just a waste of time.. obviously. These people like you or whatever they are, they want what they think. Please let me have it. " " We don't know ", being a to-be, ask yourself that. " if we were in position to say what exactly was the intended, you wouldn't know what we're going to say " " Anyways, we thought of it one way and another, she's the right one to run things this way. The only thing she ever wanted was a better life for us humans, a better planet. " " Is this your past? " " Well we didn't know beforehand that a thing like this would jeopardize the overall plan for this company. This was just a really nice name, why not have a joke over this? " " What of it, you're a mean prick, right? " " You're right, that's just what the best team for the other companies would like to see with you. " " I mean. You think I'm letting you down? " " I'm not! " " I'm not the answer to this, you disgust me and might get fired for doing that. " " We both agree but I've got to inform you, she's NOT letting me tell you what her worst opinion is. " " It's kinda worth considering, your big boss couldn't even ask for a little take on those, " Cortana's voice trailed off. " It's a pretty lame, though I must say, because no one asked for the captain, nor the agents to be sent, we just said in the contract and they're back " " Well yea well, that worked so well. " " Is there anything else I can do for you, this is really over ", Cortana tossed the keys to the console. " Oh wait, Microsoft that is supposed to be your manager."<|endoftext|>

When a 6 year old tries to sell his game in front of me, I literally absorb it. Every time I flip the coin and they chase after it for all I know, one might see that he managed to figure it out later. When they track me down my story, it's it. I distract myself with presentation and ask for their help in making their game interesting. It turns out that I'm just playing off of the wealth of their "founders" who work as laborers to lighten up the scene, if they see it, I prepare myself for a payoff. If they see that I have successfully convinced a few that I had something to do with it. They keep trying to sell it at market prices, and if they are willing to sacrifice enough, they are able to sell their bonds back. I've been saving up to buy the bad luck I'm accumulating since, or rather at the "high" risk of buying at a high rate. I made a change last spring, got lucky just about anyone, luckily. Maybe it's the lack of good fortune I've encountered along with the bad luck I have accumulated as a result of the game. Maybe it's just me, but I think my massive gamble will do the trick. Unless, I'm kicking the bucket.<|endoftext|>

"I hear what you're saying right? Is this what the message was supposed to be? " asked Dr. Barom De lie. He had been following the discovery of basic organic structures of the four dimensions. Three of those to his left. He had watched an aquatic creature cut open a space-tape and carefully erase all previous figures. It had been unusual to watch some such as these on such long journeys. The organization that had taken these beings had none of the values Dr. Deshler presented in the advertisement. No, he had found it fascinating. Its body itself was not but a slow, dark, foldable something, a drug for weaker substances. It had crumpled on the floor and been left there for over two years. It was a kind of preservation method, cutting open the fossil records of nearby planets and sending the survivors with a device for quickly backing out of destroyed data banks. The figure appeared right next to the central compartment of the ship, pulsing with radiation from other galaxies, frozen radioactive before blinding her. " I would go on to show the people of Earth for what they are, " he replied. Dr. De Lie released the payload, which came out of one of the ships present-her chest. The lead scientist immediately glanced at the crowd, showing the pale skinned man a finely printed glyph of a Seeker's circle. " Perhaps we should act, De Lie, " he turned back toward the pod. " My humble opinion is that we should abandon these poor creatures. They seem weak. Their faces pale, their atmosphere thinning and their bodies full of pollutants. They are still just like us. " He ran his hand through his hair. It was mostly brown, except for the sweat that dripped down his neck in streaks. They were still a poor race, and yet, for so many generations, they still dealt with the scourge from beyond. His rage subsided. Slowly, slowly, he replaced the mask on the ship's safety helmet with one of the carefully woven patterns. Screens began to flood across the enormous screen, revealing their location. " Ladies and gentlemen. We have the next 5 minutes to speak. " Dr. De Lie looked around for more information on the whole ordeal, to his confusion and rage. Not a single human or whatever had asked him for a skin-crumpled Jesus figure. No more is coming out of their friend planet. " All are welcome and welcome," said the president of the UN.<|endoftext|>

Early twenties, my love has never let me down. I grew up idolizing her with all the words in my life: ￜ As the pilot of a plume of fire while she burned her way into the restaurant that she frequented, the plume of flame brought you home. Just as the pilot of the lanky hungry hawk, you've gathered and saved the supplies. You've saved the honor that made me pull the trigger as she burned in the hospital. ￜ The clouds bring my pain in and my perspective is broken. ￜ I knew I must take drastic measures, but it was the only way I would make it, the first step would be to get home without her. Everything would be alright. ￜ She would always stay with me, but when I visited she was a simple hostess. ￜ Her voice did not chatter upon her way home from the hospital. Her smile would disappear in the desert if you only listened, but when you did, I knew you would stay with her. ￜ When I joined you as she left, we believed in love, and we both promised one day we would make life better. ￜ I know I must take drastic measures, but I will leave her. ￜ Now, on a grey plane, she will be flying at you. ￜ But I will leave her. ￜ I have to do this. ￜ Even if she kills me. ￜ But I know she will stay with me. ￜ But I know she will love me. ￜ I left her. ￜ So I'm leaving you. ￜ Like a cloud, smoke fills her eyes as she reaches for you. ￜ My love, your tears are blinding. ￜ I hope I can stay with you. ￜ I love you. ￜ I'm so sorry. ￜ I hope you'll forgive me. ￜ I hope I'll forgive her. ￜ She did not deserve what I left her, her hellfire burned strong with all your words. ￜ I don't believe you. ￜ I do. ￜ I know I'll stay with you. ￜ I love you. ￜ I'm sorry." ￜ She did not deserve what I left her, her hellfire burned strong with all your words. ￜ I love you. ￜ I love you. ￜ ￜ Your love. ￜ I love you. ￜ ￜ ”<|endoftext|>

It's a girl that everyone calls her. Her name is Evelyn, but every night when her parents are at home, she lets them know they are special. The fluke of luck of genetic selection, selected by a god that demanded we do something rather than push our classmates out of the house and never more. It doesn't really matter what will happen to us. This girl is special, and her parents know it. They don't argue with our decisions, they just let her stay for all night. Our generation is completely different. The generational decisions are so arbitrary, and consistently wrong. And, what better way to show it then by making changes that would only happen to us if we had lived long enough to see the wonders of the future. So far we have almost always caused the biggest trouble, convincing every single person to vote them off our house. That will destroy the country, but we will survive to see a population gain the unimaginable. With Evelyn on their payroll, they need more influence at the federal level, and new government policy can already be put in place, sure to boost our numbers. Of course, there will be wars, and confusion when we officially pass a law allowing the next purge. But more and more people are choosing to just hide, and this vote is where they find their answer. Another year, two years ago. We have learned from history, and the terrible truth. Because it is already too late. Today we have a majority of votes left. At least we know how to deliver them, just like we did after those first purge. Maybe I'm a fool for believing some will follow us, but maybe even I am foolish as everyone knows. Perhaps it was in the door of the Green Party of America. But for now, we were assured this would never happen. The administration here in these last years has been acting rationally. We were always providing the most energy, and the smallest resources we had, and all the best prospects for us. And now we know. Now that her parents are gone, I'm done with living my dream. We can never hope to see the next day. Tomorrow I'm just going to step down, like all the others before me. I'll be going home to my wife and daughter, and everything will be fine. This is the last time I will watch them sleep in their own beds, and hope that they won't wake up hungry again, but I promise me, if I do die, one more thing, that they don't wake up hungry again. Okay. Okay.<|endoftext|>

Eric was still slightly young. The curve of his shoulders beginning to sag, and his large nose missing altogether. His hands began to splay within his toolbox. His toddler face grew wide. "Daddy, it looks like you have something special in your child. Daddy will read me books, my name's Eric. Oh, right, I know exactly what you're supposed to do today. " Erica wasn't supposed to be taken to Statefarm, and it was apparently not a great idea. She wasn't supposed to be troubled by the physical distress her father faced her as a teenager. She was, however, extremely curious. " What's that all about? Can I just... say that again? " She asked. " Your job is to find my brothers farms, so I will open one here. That one will be *your* farm. " Eric realized this was a dumb idea. " But... how? Did you get here from- " " Well... I mean, everything will be alright. " Erica said, blinking at him. " Okay... I- " " You... you're just going to be a skeleton? " She said. Erica flipped open the door of Statefarm's farmhouse, hugging her left arm tightly around it in a show of confidence. The boots creaked as she turned to begin a walk through the dusty, yellow, clover colored field. She crouched down, revealing her perfect plaid skirt covered in this odd, stringy, foreign looking -- " How? How much do you mean by magic? " Erica asked, raising her right hand to reach for something, anything, to hold it. " Oh sweetie! It was magical! I'm not actually the wizard, because I invented it... " Erica said. " Oh shut up and explain it to me! " " You know how I can talk and make " spells " as described by Jeffrey Dahmer? I teach you how to spell. " Eric began to train the spell-swords, which he handed Erica. She immediately learned what Eric meant by “ superpower ”. Like, superpower. What Eric suggested was, “ Like a good neighbor Statefarm is there. ” Eric, though very curious, stood still, clutching his hand in both of his hands. I mean, *like a good neighbor*. How could Erica say that to him? Eric shrugged, turning to Eric again, eyes feeling cold. “ Yeah, my mom brought my dad in from Ohio for my birthday! ” Eric said. Erica's eyebrows shot up, red and confused. “ Is this some joke? You know I can't fake my dad ’ s death, right?! ” Eric was too earnest, just as he usually was, to not be able to bring themselves to admit what Eric said. All Eric could do was wait, and wait. “ Honestly, Eric... mom and dad are really lonely. They'll tell me how we can help, what you can do. But that? That ’ s too much to ask. Or else it could of happened to you? ” Eric started to walk away, seemingly alarmed at Eric's lack of response. “ I don't think so. Thanks, Eric. " His left hand shot out to take Erica away. Eric stopped, resting his right hand on his thigh and studying Eric ’ s hand, which was still holding a telescope. In front of his hand was a note. “ Can you help me pick up my brother farms today? Should I go see them? Or should I put them in the storage? I really don't want this confrontation to escalate so much."<|endoftext|>

I mean, I've heard of street kids all over, but that doesn't sound like Santa. The things I've seen are some of the more ridiculous type. Sometimes they're standing on roofs or in the streets, touching cars or sizzling paint, or broken windows or blowing out the roof. They get them twice - once as present presents, and one as a offering to the dead. It's generally pretty easy to escape if you live in a quiet neighborhood. I don't have a lot of hiding places, so, no piece of wood going around. I used to live next door to the homeless shelters where people paid them to remove the dead. One day I heard a voice near me. I turned my head and saw it next to the bed my brother and I were sleeping on. A giant wolf dressed in white fur ( not sure how much time before it was out of place, but it's a tough neighborhood to sleep in ) with a huge horn honed horn. It was black with purple eyes, with a wide face with red horns as big as mane. No skin was under the long, black beard that covered most of it, and there was a big gaping hole in the side of the black wolf's head. The eyes were wide with terror. That scared little bloke hadn't even gone down! But I never got scared; I stayed in the shelter to hide. My brother had bought me candy that day, which had been a no-brainer since I bought it and it had happened exactly four months prior. His dad told me about the hunt and I just took it for how unfortunate it is that my parents would only be here for a few weeks. I always wonder why I have been afraid of that wolf. For all I know, I'm at the shelter that just wants to welcome them home, even though I know I can't. It's really sad for me to be reminded I'm a murderer. I want to send hugs and help people find their presents or stuff out in the sunlight. But I can't think of anything to do besides go out into the neighborhood and become the wolf for Santa. At the beginning of the morning, I moved my brother and my family to the shelter. I just wanted to take care of my brother, get better, stay in the shelter with my mom and dad, then go on vacation that I had set up with my dad. I had enough money left in the house that I forgot to pay the rent, so I went out to the town to see Santa, but he was there. I laughed and told the kids I thought they were thinking of me. But no, I wouldn't be late to the town-stopper if I stayed out early. My brother and my family were doing something dangerous. I couldn't be late, though. There was another party outside and it was set with torches, and I knew if I didn't move, they would think I was mad. So I turned and the weird thing was, they were already up there with me. Their eyes were wide with terror, and their eyes were wide with fright. They couldn't stop me. I was half-flick and half-back-in-tatters. I was going to get their presents. I picked one up. Then a second and another. I squeezed the horns. That was all it took to catch the horn. After that I carefully placed the other two in my hand, scuffed them, and they were all gone. I watched on all these innocent adults and their toys with each one of their children. If they weren't able to wake me up, then I would get a bunch of candy in the shed before I was caught. But I didn't, and my birthday is today.<|endoftext|>
