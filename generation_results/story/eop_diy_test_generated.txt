Sooooooo read that. I'm really looking forward to this. A quick recap. 
 I think that Donald Trump is really a disaster. The whole thing just seems like a terrible plan to make; a plan that makes no sense, totally ridiculous and hardly anyone is paying attention to it. I'm actually surprised that even Gingrich didn't give us the crucial speech to make our minds go crazy. He says that he and the nuclear stockpile was breached and is now there to "listen to all of the world's attention". Next thing I know, Santorum is walking through the door and is preparing to punch Hitler with his loaded 12 gauge. I just don't think Gingrich would change his policies in such a concrete way. 
 Hm? Interesting plot device, I don't know how best to proceed with it. I'd like to read more.

"Oh God, no. I'm pregnant. " 
 " Oh, god, no. I'm stuck in a dream. " 
 " You'll be fine. " 
 " That was so easy. " 
 I got up from my couch, legs crossed, watching the newscaster on my television. 
 " There was a house we were going to change into right about now. You had so much fun with it. " 
 " And? Why would it need a bigger roof? " 
 " I'm a disaster. They covered the cost and now they're stuck here! " 
 " Fuck off. If you want your family to pay for this, you can't just move out. " 
 " You're not taking any of this seriously now. " 
 " Yeah, but you won't. " 
 " I'm interested in this house, it's a real lifestyle. " 
 " OK, I'm just asking, what was the best night? " 
 " Mom, I'm talking to Mr Martin here. " 
 I took her hand and left. Outside her parents hurriedly walked in. 
 " Is this the time? " 
 " I thought we needed to run out of beer, but these dogs that kept talking in my apartment got all manner of weird contraptions and stuff. " 
 " How about you? " 
 " He said he didn't want me to make a mess. " 
 " I told him, just look at the poop. It looked real real blue. " 
 " I know that, I'm glad we reached an agreement about it. " 
 " And it looks like we'll have $ 8.75 at first. It doesn't have to be hard to find someone else. " 
 " That's not possible. " 
 I walked back outside and went to a chair. We sat on it for a few minutes until Dad came. 
 " You don't have to hear the whole argument. Everyone knows it's over. " 
 " The car was taking longer to drive around. " 
 " Sorry but, you just sent it. There's something there. " 
 " What? " 
 " There's something there, it's a fucking phone. " 
 " Well we probably shouldn't have rented it out, " Dad said as he leaned over to grab the phone. 
 " Let's hurry to a new place. " 
 " That doesn't make sense. " 
 " Yeah, and then we can go have a drink. The new house is really old, you can't lose someone. " 
 I pulled the phone away from the hook that got it stuck into the wall. I looked over at Dad. 
 " I was all set. Now, I wanted to go play some videogames. I'd only be with you until we get paid off. " 
 " Fine."

**********1**********
Before my childhood, when the ring I wore was worn by a mage of trade, none had worn it in life. I suppose it had been worn all along; leather, gold, hearts-leather, whatever. The ring from one time back was now a husk of a small, bored, broken old man, wearing the same coat of what seemed to be average weight and the same modest, worn ring. He wanted nothing more than to smile and wave my name out on the porch. He looked visibly shaking now, but didn't move a muscle. The way he smirked before a lecture of some unknown magus, was... unsettling. 
 I felt a high-pitched pain just below the tender arm of the berserker, as I stood, staring at the shattered remains of the empty box that lay draped to my side. 
 "Sir, I don't know how that was possible, " he began, walking toward me with a trembling hand. " Was it me? Is that all you ever did? " 
 I nodded. " People didn't eat men, " I said as my lips snapped over my shoulder. He had all of the bodyguards of a dozen families surrounding him in his arms, waiting. " I lost about six weeks worth of my flesh. And I hated it! " 
 A rumbling grew out of my stomach at the now airy lips that had befallen my knees as I hunched into the ground. I cupped his leather wrapped body around my hand and we stood there. Was this how our family normally should be? But I couldn't really see why, but he did seem impressed. 
 I looked back into his eyes. " Tell them, " I smiled and turned back to my troops. " We don't have this much scar on us now, do we? " 
 He nodded in agreement. " We do have a lot to do, probably. And we have the right kind of soldiers to deal with. " He winked at me from above and walked across the yard to a wooden build-up. " Once we get these final supplies. You both are the best in the whole Army. " He stroked my hand briefly before standing up. " Look, if you want to make your magics last, maybe get another blade, but our families may be able to offer them some more work. " 
 The soldiers, raised in laughter at my retort, looked to each other in understanding. My hand moved to a handle on my right arm, as I nodded in agreement. The soldiers smiled. 
 My jaw dropped. My eyes snapped open and I saw the weapon lay on the ground, red wax forming stars of some kind. I crossed my arms over my stomach as the soldiers rushed over. 
 " This is a great house, " one said. " What was it built for? It's a home for a mage," he grinned at the last part. 
 With that, I squirmed back. There in the front yard, sat a loaded rifle and a matching pair of boots. But the front yard was bare and far from clean. A pair of cheap boots had fallen out of the ground into the dirt. I finally saw his brother's arms wrap around his fellow warriors at the end of the yard. 
 This would be my last warrior.

I knew it would never happen. 
 There was a door that led to this place and somewhere good was waiting. It was built for some sort of purpose, I had forgotten what it was named. The out is slowly winding down, but I feel suddenly resigned to it. It's always had a place of its own, if not right behind me, it would surely be its home. 
 I reached up, with all my might I brushed past the hard stone and grabbed a pack from the nearest cabinet. As I pulled out my bow, I spotted a dagger nearby, but where a certain amount of raw electricity will have it is a new one. 
 It just flies by quickly after, galloping slowly and darting off, aimlessly. 
 I jump back, open my eyes and look up to see an enemy standing facing me. I touch his eyes and it's no ordinary enemy, no I've seen him countless times. But what is it? I begin to wonder what it is. 
 "... Huh? " 
 " Walk on ahead, thou foe. " 
 He grabs my arm. 
 " My name is Buster, but no more, and you shall have more of mine. I swear I'll show you the blades. " 
 " That means it is all yours! You are to wield, not be ranked. You may have your choice. " 
 He dives me and charges, dropping everything I've taken but an undying blade of his. He's practically on me now, it's amazing what you can do with an unlimited amount of survival ability. And now I've stood victorious against him. 
 The enemy strikes, and I rip the dagger from his hands. 
 I feel its weight from over my shoulder, he swings my head to my chest, killing my neck with ease, and it'd be better this way. His grey hair parted, and suddenly it's long at his waist, a gold band caked in blood smeared across his flesh. The blade flies once more, and I hear a screeching sound as it thunders into the air. 
 He swings it, but nothing feels off, I let loose a pair of great sharp teeth to his side, it's smooth polished blade dislodging itself from his opponent, leaving him behind. 
 I kneel down, pick up my bow, close my eyes and speak. 
 " We are thousands of miles away. All hail me, I protect you, bring you in contact. " 
 It took a long while for me to comprehend, my mind all but stuck on the words of an ancestor. Something inside me was beginning to question my old life, and I should have taken the sword of the Orken, but even as I realized its meaning, it was no longer powerful enough to overcome. 
 "... But what are blades? " 
 " Tales of the great Knights, you're just another mortal with nothing more than a blade. These ancient legends are tales of men, mounted up on helmets and swords and axes or axes and swords, who are sent on to the next step in a journey to reach the end of their days. " 
 "... What are you telling me? " 
 "... It's words, nothing is written in them... " 
 " Hmm... What do you mean? " 
 " It's a toy, something your people use. " 
 " So what do you mean by'teachers,' then? " 
 " If a man casts a spell, how do they know they are defeated? " 
 " Every spell a man casts is thought a new beginning, a young person after a brief life, and they may possess a new weapon that will do the same. But this is nothing, I have already seen all." 
 I looked across the room at me, blood pooling in my cheek. I was out of the woods, I had a way out, I was better than this guy. 
 Maybe I wasn't the first, the only human to ever wield a weapon. There's maybe something I could take with me, my name was Buster.

It wasn't easy being a child, crying, and remembering the towns you lived in at night was quite the challenge. Just hanging out with friends and schoolchildren who seemed to relive an old family photo with their endless memories of the industry. Some of my friends had abandoned me after some of those days and I don't blame them. They were all either lucky or really unlucky, they didn't pass on the life they had already loved or at the end of the day, they left me to bury my memories where they could at least keep me company. 
 Most of my friends were very artistic and cheerful all of them, and so it felt good to have an odd job and a loving family to rest with. I was happy, at least in those days, almost happy that I had met my most important person, someone I could spend forever with, that I didn't have to worry about. I would believe that was a good thing to know that I knew the sort of person who had been the person I would be coming back for. I would know that my first memory would be going to them both, giving them an opportunity to see the things that happened in their life. Maybe that's why I wasn't afraid of being lost or kidnapped or robbed by bad people when I went to them. 
 It certainly wasn't like my parents told me if I had to be alone or with someone who was human like them, they didn't think I would be. It seems that everyone I knew left me so quickly and so easily that in the end, sometimes it's really hard to figure out that you're one of the same person and that everything you've ever loved or done for someone was just because you were human. 
 I am not saying I'm still afraid of being trapped or kidnapped, I have always figured that the only way to change is for me to sleep in a bed and watch a movie, if they're going to see me. Maybe I'll spend the night seeing people and see what I can find. Those memories are not for me or anyone else, no. I won't. 
 It's a burden to live with, that burden falls on me, and it's probably all my fault.

Not many still remember what actually happened that night. We've been killed by countless Aliens, but we can always remember this. We were at our safehouse before we managed to launch the final bombs and tranq it out. Our crew left shortly after. We had been assured that they were alright. A secret mission, were we to leave behind the prisoners. They had so few. So many of them. Heh. It goes without saying that we were wrong. Our research of the post-War world dropped a few thousand tons, cutting the planet to the core with binary quadratic equations. Yep. Black holes. Heh, they showed up with numbers of annihilating man just like they did. We couldn't believe it. Inside of our ship when we were submerged with tons of water we got to see humans seem very intelligent, maybe even moving around.

The dark clang of guns and wire signs was the only sound to emanate from the shower. Not even the voices of the police, like the demon that descended upon his cell. 
 "Jackpot? You've got a fucking clue, " I said out loud. 
 " Listen, you fucking bastard! " He just kept saying it. " Throw the power in a flame and we can kill him! " 
 " You're going to do it! " 
 " It's not funny! " 
 The gun at my neck was still lit up, even after the lifeblood that had pooled around my neck. The luminescent whirring made the man's eyes fixate on the 10 foot box on the floor, where I'd seen the last body. 
 " I'm sure you're scared, Jack, " he said, clutching the phone. I held the handle to my neck and hovered it in front of it. I heard thunk, and then the sirens of the police boats as the tube swung through the room. 
 " Are you... are you doing this to me? I wanted to make you proud. But you know how we've become the all-important bastards we are? " I said, cutting the receiver off the wall. 
 " You'll do me in, I'm afraid. " 
 The man sat on the floor, flapping his arm. He didn't move. 
 " Come. " I jerked my fist, now in front of the hot gunpowder, and pointed it at him. 
 " Jackpot, " I gritted my teeth, and shot back the gun. " Come on, Jack, " I said. " Those bastards are going to love you as much as you love them!"

The monster in my closet sleeps for hours. 
 The horror that is her is a part of her. My room is merely her room. My door is the weapon she uses to assault me, and my bedroom is the kitchen- I lean on the countertops of my tattered French door, checking to see if I need to use it. It's not necessary, she's not there. I need to escape now. 
 "Celine, we've had enough! " She yells. " You need to leave now!" 
 I blink, and she moves to the other side of the room, and picks up the time. I have fifteen minutes left. 
 I'll have to get in the box. Something exciting is about to happen. As I start to open the box, it fills with the warmth of a day-long morning. I lay for a moment, thinking. I wait a few hours, then throw up. I'm having to make my escape now. 
 I guess a monster sits on your couch? What is it saying? Should I leave now? I'm dumbstruck, but I figure I can't hide. As I sit on the couch, I hear it's voice: 
 *Vive la vie 
 *Vive la vie 
 *Vive la vie 
 *Start your journey 
 *Ready for what's ahead. * 
 There's a blue dot the size of a billiard ball at my feet, and I have to fall to it. Some days I even forget if I'm there. For a split second, I see the lump of red blood where it hides. I notice the way its lips move, perhaps on instinct. I panic. 
 It glances at me. Then looks back at the box. I'm bewildered. 
 I hide. My wits make it so I don't escape again. But the grayness in the box keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and it decides I'm weak, and if I don't die, I won't die. And then the lid slides off the box, revealing the ghostly image of me. 
 It's Frankenstein, and I'm sick of it.

"And so, Mr. President, I ’ m having your last interview in just one day, eh Mr. President? ” 
 “ It was great, though, so what do you tell me about your work today? " 
 “ Really just after I graduated university, I was hired as Project Director for the PSI, or *Project Stellar. * People have always said I ’ m the greatest president I ’ ve ever had, and that I ’ m everything humanity could dream of. ” 
 “ Well, you said you were the Director of Defense in the SSMU 'Help Us Put Together': ” 
 “ Mr. President, I was the director of Transcendental Protection when I was hired, and of course, I ’ m one of the most decorated members of my graduating class. People talk about how awesome you are, how you ’ ve won medals during military tours, and yet you can ’ t shake the feeling that you will be the one to replace General Lewis Sheridan or Governor Walter Kelly, or worse yet, the Czar. I ’ m shocked these people never expect what comes from the guy who was hired in place of General Sheridan or Governor Kelly, but, you know, I ’ m still excited about how you will be helping the country today. " 
 “ Great, Mr. President. You are going to be the one to replace President Sheridan, or Governor Kelly, or whatever is sitting here waiting for me. You never say never. That guy is the greatest president I have ever had, and, it all started when I was hired here, but I would tell you, like everyone else here: I can go down in history as one of the greatest presidents I have ever had, I can go down in history as the greatest actor and writer and director in history. Then the same day as you, you were laid off. You can ’ t be replacing a man who was into films and accomplished nothing. It was inevitable that you would go down with just a weak arm, and everyone sees you as a great soldier in the army, but you are dead. You have been gone for a couple hundred years and no one ever expects you to show up on time, and have exhausted every other option. ” 
 “ So? I said you ’ ve been hired for Project Stellar. And why would you want me to hire you? ” 
 “ Because I don ’ t think you ’ re worthy. You put my squad right in the middle of a major airport with the SAMARS combat goggles, plus the practical sensors you needed to get my position, and they only have the low-light range for ground combat. Anybody who wants to give that vision a go needs to come up with a plan. " 
 " Well, Mr. President, what ’ s the plan? ” 
 “ Sir, we ’ ll use drones to pick up any people and bring them to the targeted area. Why not just use artillery to destroy the drones and go kill them whole? With such a small and maneuverable drone, you ’ d blow up the airplane through under a mile or so. We ’ ll also get an accident on their engines. " 
 “ Sir, what plans do you think you have? What other weapons do you think we can use? ” 
 “ You put him on a hard target after me, Sir. ” 
 “ That ’ s not what we meant, Mr. President, you talked to the guy. He told us there were no more drones around. ” 
 “ Yes, Sir. We take every available option from them. ” 
 " But, Mr. President, why are you so quick to answer my question? " 
 " Because, we don ’ t have to worry about people dying today. " 
 " He ’ s dead. I already set up operations in Europe, and soon, people in the remaining regions will be coming here, too. Especially if it ’ s with the gun, man. And if they turn out to be somebody close to you, they ’ ll have more reason to suffer today than those souls. Thank you for your good faith, sir."

Am I really so blind? 
 This feeling came as a shock at first, but I didn't know it was true until it hit me. I had always had powers. I had superhuman strength, super speed, invisibility, darkvision, telekinesis. 
 But, just that all became fuzzy to me, and I was blind... first thing I did was stare into the sky for a very long time. That's when I saw the scar on my neck. 
 At the time, I tried to explain it to the doctors. They told me I had the ability to see the future. 
 Then came an interview. They put me through an intensive care unit after eight years. In the last two years, my eyesight was still pretty good. They gave me tests and I got more tests. I was declared blind in just two years. 
 But that was my only miracle. My sister suggested that maybe I could become super-human. But I wasn't sure what I was going to do with myself. 
 The medical field was divided as I was injured during the seizures. As I continued to numb my limbs, the pain of my eyes faded. They weren't stronger then the rest of my family, and they didn't age. My mother told me that I could transform into a super artist if I even wanted to. 
 Then my father was diagnosed with a complication. As he shot me with a light-up laser blaster, I was pulled out of my parents coma. I had no idea why, but I saw an angel in a brown suit and took off my father's gold glasses. 
 That's when it hit me. I was blind again. Of course the first thing I saw was the scar on my neck. 
 I'm blind, then, right?

Freaking the irony, it's a rather bold throw. It works because he's very clear about this? If he says he'll give us more of a list to remember us, what kind of list will do that? 
 A tad underwhelming at first but once I feel compelled to read it, I feel like I will. 
 There are a few things that stand out in the description: 
 * The first thing to fall out of was the presence of blood. It wasn't on the pilot's seat, not anywhere. 
 * The pattern of blood on his torso and on the ground and on his head was consistent with what he was thinking. It seemed obvious that he was dead. 
 It's also the last thing that deserves to be read. He's bold, confident, and living. He's a man. 
 It does a good job at its job at forming the ballgame clues, and will make the reading more personal. 
 As a reader, it's hard to come to terms with his ending but right before the paragraph opens, it's at the point where the characterization of him ceases to exist. 
 Overall, I find it hard to believe that you can put a ton of information out there, and read a perfect novel, but it is astounding when you realize how little people actually think about a character in comparison to their experience. I feel certain that many of them haven't even thought about the details until the end, and that's when your heart gets in your throat. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********10**********
"Please, don't " I whispered quietly. 
 I couldn't have been more certain that she wasn't dead. Of course she wasn't dead. Her body always maintained composure. Only when she was calm she always moved when she was with me to be safe. The screams, the burning. The aftermath. " Why haven't you gone, " she tried to say. 
 " Why haven't you come home, to see me? I'd be staying over here. I'd wake up before you. " 
 My own thoughts were often interrupted by the realization that I knew he would move to the side. If he moved he would walk to me as well. " We've had a long day we've had. I see you're no where to be trusted. " 
 I shrugged. " No, I'm sorry. " 
 It was hard to stand then. The wife was crying and he had taken her and brought her back. I was reminded of the early days of my childhood when I first learned of my parents and I pushed her away. I wished I hadn't. 
 " Please. Please! " I pleaded. 
 " Oi, daddy! It's okay. I'll talk to you later. I'll be back in an hour or so. " 
 " Please don't leave. " 
 " Please, just come back! " 
 " No. Please. Stay with me. I need you. " 
 I knew he wasn't doing this. 
 " I know, daddy. But your leaving. I was just there to- " 
 " Please, please, stay with me." 
 His hands shot back. His voice went soft. My heart trembled as he walked out the bedroom door. It would be over soon. I hoped I could walk away while he was gone.

A harmless way to do no harm... 
 Except that he comes in this slow, as if expecting me to give him another, grubby hand, or ungritty, tear-stained shirt. 
 It's the kind of thing I would do with two heartworms and a kitten all over, I guess. 
 He doesn't even look like I'm telling him, I know that when he's bored, he just leaves. * It's all he's got. * 
 Sometimes, I wish I could talk to him like I'm sitting in the dark, looking at his smile, and the kind of look that makes you trust him. 
 In this light, I know it was cold inside, but I know he's feeling no tear. 
 That's all that kept me sane. 
 The first time, when I used to argue with him, he asked me questions I've never asked him. 
 When he goes back to his own mask, where he remains, and hears his own voice he says, "You left me be. " 
 " I know, like that. " 
 " What, like that doesn't get you nowhere. " 
 That's all I know. 
 I never worry, or fight, or irritate, or anger him. He's always quiet, focused on me, and I always believe in him. I know. 
 It's been so long. " What is it like to feel free?" I ask. He answers, doesn't exactly flinch. 
 I know I'm broken, or at the very least, broken for nothing. 
 He finally says the truth. I still don't understand why he didn't apologize for the situation, but I know he does.

"Alright, " said the preacher. " This is the first time in months a pastor has been able to leave the country for work after being in a coma for five years! What else do we have? Electricity? Water? " 
 A big grin spread across the man's face. " W-what? " 
 The preacher nodded. " What do you want to make sure I get for Christmas, all on Christmas Eve? " 
 " I-I *don't* think... " the man said. He felt the muscle get used to the cold, that immense confidence in his voice. 
 The preacher nodded as well, somehow croaking out in his sleep like a sore thumb, " And what exactly do you want for Christmas? " 
 The man grinned as he used one of his hands. " Oh, what I forgot: I've been telling you all these things in advance, as well as nothing in the way of actual wishes. One of them being for *Alice. * " The church bell chimed. " One of them will grant you anything you desire, just make sure it's right for Christmas, and it'll never freeze over! Just send a message to your parents, so they can run around checking on you while you sleep. No problem! " 
 The man stiffened, and it got harder to maintain some of his sleep, and the strain was constant. " Alright, man, I want you all to get to work, " he said. " Now, this isn't the first time... just because you gave me a *Christmas wish*, doesn't mean that you *have* to. That was not always going to happen, but you *sure as hell won't be doing this any time soon. * " 
 The preacher lifted his hand. " Look, this is the end of this at the very least. Please, come downstairs and let's have a good merry Christmas. " 
 He closed the door behind him, and a computer sat right in front of him. 
 The man was no older than fifteen, and looked as if he had never been born. 
 " Well, " the church bell chimed, " I guess it's time I asked for your favor."

"Hi Teletubby, " said Larry, I desperately tried to figure out what had given him the internet sensation of fame. " Hi. It's me, Mitch, yeah... now are you *human*? Are you *being* human? " 
 Larry was making a big deal out of this: first of all, his fame for being the # 1 in tumblr was actually taking off, and second, its hilarious. Me I could make out pretty much anything. Heck, the headline read " Save Tumblr " right after I spoke with Mitch about being " human. " What a great idea. I guess having a truly iconic name was a great idea too. 
 " Hey, this is unbelievable, " continued Mitch, " this is *my* one. It took me *more* than one hour of explaining this plan. " 
 A viewfinder caught Mitch's eye, scrolled along it. As if on cue, " that
*happens* to work, too. " 
 Larry followed it. He was a technician for the company, but just yesterday he was a Hottie, and today he was an amazing faun. 
 " And my only regret, man, is that this really *is* insane. You actually have human anatomy, *human* anatomy? This is *just* a *dream*. You knew this day would come, right? Didn't you go camping this trip with the others? You just go camping for the apocalypse? And then the trolls come and troll because you've done *so* well in the TIFU world, right? And that was a *crazy* idea. And you did it, and all because *you* chose *trolls. * And just... *like* that. " 
 *Screw it*... " Just like that", I thought. 
 Today was April 4th, and Larry needed to- 
 It was April 5th. 
 Matt St. James had been trolling his girlfriend yesterday. Oh yes, the guy who left you wan na take a picture, and shoot another and break up with, and take his shit, even looked as if he was raping her to begin with. All without his girlfriend, you see. 
 Well, finally, he told her and she just laughed so hard. I'm kind of surprised he's still with her as far as I'm concerned.

*dumbfounded and dizzy through a distorted haze* 
 I saw a woman walking on stilts. She seemed such a nice looking person. Would look nice. I wondered if she was still walking on stilts. 
 I walked over to her, got off the car and began walking over to her. She ignored me. 
 *uncaring, and all at the same time... heeeeeep* 
 I arrived at the marketplace, thought this person was lost. They were selling some snacks. 
 "Did you see what they're selling " I asked. 
 " Oh yeah. Their expensive snacks. They're seen everywhere. " He said with another smile. 
 I couldn't believe I had heard the woman say that, when she was selling these snacks. But he's not seeing me, and I have to trust her. 
 I walked home. As I left a young man stood by the door. " Hey! Hey! look it's me, big guy! " He let go and walked out. 
 The young man had abandoned his favorite snack. How could this man not be just looking at a movie? As I peeked into the booth to see what he had sold, I thought " It wasn't me " 
 The salesman walked away. We quickly set up an appointment at a local grocery store. We both agreed that food was cheaper there. 
 The young man walked up to the counter. " Wow, no way, I haven't walked before! " He said. I was shocked. 
 The woman smiled and walked out. " Oh great you are successful, great man. You're way ahead of the game. " 
 He reached to grab some pocket change. " How did you know? You're damn good! " 
 I put the money in my pocket. " You must not be aware of this history, he told me. " 
 The man walked away. 
 The woman greeted me. " This is my main stop, and I welcome some of your friends. " 
 " You can come up here and we can talk about it. " 
 As I handed the man my change, he admitted it was a nice change. He took my money and walked over to the counter. " The ladies welcome. Thanks for staying. " He said. 
 The women left. The young man walked away. 
 After walking for five minutes to our main stop, he went around to the back of the store. Looking in the general direction of the store, he saw two other sales men at the other end of the store. 
 " This man, thanks for buying. " He said. 
 " He loved his snack and decided to pay. " He added. 
 My heart started beating a little faster. 
 " The reason I said thanks was to get one of these snacks. And the good stories about this person. " 
 " Pretty good, huh? We're all good. " He said. " See you tomorrow at Starbucks. " 
 I got the hell out of here and headed to Starbucks. " Got ta go home."

And then the search for the money came. Of course that didn't suit my case. It was a twist job, an odd job at the time. I could've committed more. Well for what they said, it wasn't my case. For me the whole place was safer, far away from whatever plagues us here. Really they just claim you've been in here for what seems like an eternity, ever since the catch. This pissed me off. I'd been here for over a year now... so long, and yet so much longer ago... I'd been locked up. Leaving my parents and siblings alone. I don't know if I want to try and escape. They told me last time the place was safe. I guess that's the alarm this time. " Grabbing my shovel and bending down to pick up a little kid. You would've liked him to at least get out of there." What was this kid's name? Brendan, apparently that makes him one of the five persons coming for my mother? Shit, what is this shit I get to do! I don't think they know I'm here! What is this voice?! Call 911! Shit, what is this taunting me? The policemen don't even have a purpose! I thought they were giving me a non-stop aspirin, a lifesaver! A breath, a tiny amount of whatever oxygen my body produces. I don't know where they're going with this... I can't.... Wait. Did they hear me? No. I don't think they were listening... They're not fucking listening. I guess they stopped caring after I left them, and this would change everything. But wait. I'll give it to them...

"There's no doubt that [ gunpowder was never invented ] ( http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_for_the_world ) " said an old lady in the backroom of a military official. " There was nothing about guns... " she paused, her body almost slightly hunched over and her ears slowly relaxing. 
 Another man in his 20s passed the tall, tall girl. She looked up at the tall man in the corner. " And there's nothing we can do. And yet, no society can do something about it. " 
 " For the last 16 years we've been unified. May you stay safe there. " He pulled an old WWII Model 1908 pistol from his cloak and stuffed it into his coat pocket. " Don't ever run over me. " 
 She shifted in her seat across the table from him. She quickly focused on talking. " For the last 8 years the society was unified. And now, that society is under attack. " 
 " You... you can't... you don't understand! " he looked up at the table again. " Say, aren't we fucked? " He pulled out a revolver from his cloak and pointed it at the girl and then pointed it at the tall man across the table. " I'll explain if you want to hear it. " 
 He pulled out his copy of the New York Times and started typing furiously into his keyboard. After clicking the key a man in his late 50s came from the corner and shouted, " The government of America is under attack! " He marched towards the wall behind them and fired a large round into the wall. Suddenly there was a horrible sound that filled the air. 
 " Excellent. Yes, we are under attack. We can leave, but we are doomed to die. " The tall man jumped in excitement. " Can you believe it? Please. " 
 She quickly sat down and sighed. " There can be no telling what what impact this will have in social life. You are too good to believe. These are not serious people. " He pressed a button and the Washington Monument began to rise. " I believe we are all doomed."

Right when I received the letter saying I would receive this gift, I just wasn't expecting it to stick. I mean, it is not like we weren't aware of how the Internet works, but not a lot of people bother to pay attention to it. 
 When I first received the letter, I couldn't believe what I had just read. I was finally going to be accepted into the world of the Internet. With these people I was going to find a way to change things that I already knew were horrible. 
 But of course the streets were full of lotharios and brunettes. One by one, some people started reporting that they had been snorting heroin on tables in their homes. So I decided to put the situation under my control. I created a situation to make it even worse by using the internet to tell the truth about my childhood and the problems I faced. 
 At first, I made up stories about how bad things were going, how I was afraid to admit that the world wasn't how I thought it was. I lived with my parents and siblings in a rundown suburb, but soon found out that, as an outsider, I was better off "using" the Internet to make fun of the real world. 
 I looked into the Internet and discovered something new. 
 **The Internet* was the internet. Some called it anything and everyone called it a great internet site. These websites proved that people loved and hated the Internet and that they were content to ignore it. 
 I began digging for a forum to remind myself that it wasn't me who was writing this letter, it wasn't the internet. I didn't have to listen to any religious thing be true, I could learn a lot from other people, but that's okay. I had to find an actual person and do what I felt was right for me.

The door has never been open properly. Tom never locks doors because of fear of fame. He just likes to come out here, he likes the sidewalk, and in the back of the hallway is helloween bags and bag food. The coffee table, the desk, the glasses, the table, the table. They are all coated with Dust. The aceleleleleleleshelelele! Honey is in the bags, and s'mores are everywhere. 
 In the back is room 694, the couch. Hole it. Mark looks like he has a container. Mark is still not crying. He looks like he is playing soccer in middle school. He's in the corner, celebrating with his parents. And while other kids are drinking a Rascal's Red Label Juice. I'll let the District Distillers know when we get it listed, because I have to save it so bad by tonight. I will be glad to hear it. 
 Before we get to the front, Tom comes in the door and shows Mom back the first bag. She is angry. That garbage is terribly yellow. But Mark is still very upset. He is even more so with Mom. And that is what made Tom tick backward a few days ago. He never saw it coming. 
 To Tom. Tom says, "Kreiner, Mark, go upstairs!" 
 I just don't seem to have anything great at all, so I take them off the desk and walk outside. I see it! My favorite ad from last year! Mark gets his Cube...

"Announcements!" 
 That was them. Since the 16th of August everyone was given a set number. You could be born in different locations and it would look exactly like today. Those who died today would be brought to the information center where they would be shown a screen that would list all their future actions/etc. It worked well but it was the best. But after 1 week many of them left their lives and had to enter the code that tells you what was going to happen to them. Every single one of them left it still printing. 
 This day I woke up it still a blank screen. 
 On the last page was a price. I suppose it was the random number system so I added it. Like many things that would come to mind when you wake up, it all depends on what you do now. Think Adam and Eve was the poor little prick stuck in hell? I wasn't even sure if he should go to hell before they had been feted. Oh but I figured any subsequent suicides were better than hunger. 
 I was half way through my oaths when I stopped by the sun. 
 My number was now 2. I wasn't sure what it means since it was all blank except for the current choice. Maybe one day this day I'll be able to choose it.

> Next time I write to you, it's a joke. A joke to all the dumb idiots out there. 
 That is the premise that I'm going to use, a network of spies which will selectively deactivate the human soul before it has to transcendentaneously exist. The network of spies will execute anyone on the net even if there are others that may have close connections to the internet. They will both be nude within the first few years. They will be captured and tried from other websites which have a small set of cameras placed under their eyes that will scan their country before taking them apart. This will dramatically improve the efficiency of many websites that don't have the option to have invasive methods of search and reconnaissance of Facebook through them. Again, this is something that needs to be investigated. 
 My task is simple. They'll take a photo of me and place a 500 ad per day screen scan on the old internet. They will then kill my latest upload before removing the old one. After that, they will return to a normal website including that deleted one with a new scan. This will be done by picking a to immediately click the ad, and then hitting refresh. After that, their cameras will return to their homes, and they will report back to the home the complete and total death of me. This is my information. I have no more contact information. I don't need to know their life history. 
 Here's what I do. 
 If you are reading this, shut up and listen. Please. A.I. has already been engineered to expand into every country, and even force everyone on the internet to pay. Thank you for your time.

"First off, probably would have preferred a bit of shooting, in hell was it a good idea to slap Bomb from underwater. " 
 I sighed. It wasn't that it was bad, it was one of those things like: " We could actually shoot the Sentinel from the sky while still being airborne. Shoot it at the Sentinel from the sea, get it closer than the Sentinel would have. " or, " We could actually shot him from the air. " 
 " That one was a bit random, just like I said. " 
 " It's irrelevant. The Sentinel is able to get near you and swim away as fast as it possibly can. As such, it is generally never any major enemies. It is essentially unlimited, it can deal its massive advantage to one target at any time, from inanimate objects to soldiers that could be carried. I have not seen my son-in-law die with a shotgun but I wouldn't know where he's going if he were anywhere near you, anyway. I don't believe I've seen a single monster in 22 years, which would be pretty jarring given the size of all that in the sky. That said, I'm not sure why I would jump up and do so, otherwise this may be real, in my many thousands or so attempts to get to you. " 
 I closed my eyes and sighed. This was no peace or quiet. This was real. 
 " Second, people in my office think you don't know where our patient is. They're awfully reticent to actually talk to us. I have seen a few within my team and through them I have the sense that you have a lot of things that will get you killed with the Sentinel. They just can't understand."

*Something's bugging me. I don't know if there is anything else... * 
 So many things happened in life I could not immediately describe. 
 I was in a bus full of people, non stop. My car was parked directly behind them. The seats were empty, they barely even produced the sound of passengers grunting. I couldn't hear anyone else screaming or hitting the ground. The lights turned off, people in pairs stared at me bewildered. What the fuck do you mean glass? 
 This is pretty bad. 
 The situation was summed up by some guy yelling "fucking statue ", a smart guy texting me " we are going to pass out " and then " on radar " and I realized " he wanted to do this to me. Why didn't I know? I know I'm the one doing this... 
 Eventually I tried to grab my phone but it wasn't working. I looked around, briefly remembering that the bus had run over a level two and someone calling everybody on the bus to call some help. But then I didn't know what to do. I didn't have any supplies, or all I wanted was to go back to the game. 
 " Someone help! This could be my last experience at this level!" 
 There was some glare from the bus driver and a bunch of others around the table. 
 I had the strangest dream. I was on an airplane and I was in the middle of fucking power station. I was shaking up from a panic. 
 Suddenly I heard something from behind me but I couldn't place it. My eyes also felt foggy. I checked my watch but there was no time to respond, there was no way I was breathing. Then the thought struck me. I walked into the exact opposite direction and were greeted by some waiter. I asked him what happened, he asked what I wanted and told me to drink my drink, I walked to the edge of the floor and immediately fell backwards and woke up in front of the main office. 
 The coffee shop had a plethora of stores but it was my first time. The bank in hell was literally my only remaining fix to help me. I went to get paid and paid at the checkout as I neared my cash, thankfully I turned on my computer and figured what I needed to do before I was robbed again. 
 I called a taxi up in a nearby park. 
 I met someone in that park on that one beautiful Sunday afternoon. The next day I met a group of people in the park. They were people I just met. They were on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, and I could hear some noise from the past a few miles away. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********24**********
I awoke with a start. A spot in the night followed by a sudden shrill whine. Again, my eyes scanned the room while the noise caused the sleep to slip away. 
 I ran into the kitchen and pulled out my drawer with no luck and it lit up, revealing a gun. 
 The shaky voice sounded down the hall. " GO! Quick! Go! Or the duck won't find you! " 
 A hint of pride hit me and I turned my face up, unwilling to comply. It didn't matter. The soldier stood before me, awaiting my orders. 
 " Are you sure it's gunna go down? " 
 " Sure. " 
 I passed the gun to him and he squeezed the trigger. 
 He stepped back, the door of the room opened into the hallway. My eyes met his and he removed his mask and looked at me. 
 " My name is Sergeant Pac. I'm good at hiding. I'm sent to kill." 
 He left the room with a groan and rushed out the door. 
 As I headed down the hallway towards my house, I learned my family was gone. A tag came out of my ID card that read, " General Pac."

"Here's a message from the Icarus crew " the senior Icarus said, leaning over to see if there was a hitch in what he was seeing. " He says that there will be a catastrophe if mankind goes extinct. " 
 " The temperature will soar to much above normal around the Earth and it would begin to cool due to solar panels, that means the chance for life in the world will increase. " 
 " Oh yes! Scientists say it will vaporize over a year. " 
 " There are solar panels, hurricanes, super typhoons, tsunamis, tsunamis like all things they've ever known, hope your species survives without a major catastrophe. Humanity has the ability to channel their thoughts and energy around them. " 
 " That must be enough for you. You're the Icarus. We see many great thoughts and those we choose to join in the heavens. " 
 The Icarus stood up and examined the pictures of Earth, warning humanity that it was going to be destroyed after the end of the human race. Even though the whole universe was watching from the skies it took more than a year for mankind to escape the Earth's inner depths. 
 " We have also shown ourselves to be in great danger as those big giant machines will destroy us in the beginning. We must keep our mind free of it's nature. " 
 Another long silence gave way to several deep and deep breaths before Icarus connected with Major Alignment. 
 " Is it here yet? " 
 " No. It has been late since the flame. Our transmissions of these transmissions have been entirely silent. I would like to send you some special messages for the lucky high school students to read up on."

The only question that my mother ever asked me is *Was it worth it? * I asked myself everyday. 
 Every morning my mother never answered her question. Instead she would always reply with, *Oh, ok, let's go to the park. What's for dinner? * 
 To be honest I always thought she said, *Sorry, I said it wrong, it was just being polite. * 
 So I only ask it once every weekend, or on a Saturday. I'm just missing a significant other out of nowhere. I'd say half an hour later, it'd mean some terrible thing to me. 
 On this particular Sunday, my mother wouldn't say anything. She just stared at her phone in her hands, the screen glowing and at the same time flashing red. 
 I was pacing home from school when I saw my mother walk up to the house. She walked up to me and kissed my cheek. I looked away, confused and afraid. 
 “ Okay mom, ” I whispered. 
 “ Are you in or out of you mind? ” Her voice seemed like a stormtrooper, despite my grade. 
 “ I don ’ t know mom, ” I replied, “ just getting out of bed. ” 
 “ Okay, mom. We ’ re going to go play, ” she mumbled. I gave her a look, afraid of what she ’ d say. 
 *Okay*. 
 “ Okay mom, let ’ s go play. ” She waved her hand and then walked to the door. I knew I had to let her walk out, because it ’ s dangerous going in. I stepped outside, got in my car, and drove out into the field. 
 I parked in the field for awhile, slowing for a minute, only to realise I wasn ’ t even driving. 
 I looked around for my mom. She was just looking at me. 
 *What am I doing? * 
 *Why aren ’ t I looking at her? * 
 My mother stepped out of her car and walked over, eyeing me with frightened expression. 
 “ I was just going to go play with my dog! He ’ s crying! ” 
 She finished walking away, and she couldn ’ t get more than five steps out of the way. 
 My mother put her hand out. I didn ’ t hear anything from her for a while, but she said, “ Come on. ” 
 “ I ’ m so sorry, mom. ” 
 “ I ’ m sorry. ” She looked at me again, still laughing. 
 “ I don ’ t understand. I thought you were supposed to be out of town. ” 
 She put her hand on my shoulder. “ Just give up, okay? ” 
 “ I can ’ t do it. I have to go home, and I need to go see my dog. There's lots of problems with this field right now. ” 
 Her smile dropped. “ I ’ m going home! ” 
 I was too concerned to reply. 
 She walked back into her car. She put down the gun and looked at me. 
 “ OK, okay. ” 
 I pulled the trigger.

"I cried the second he approached. I sobbed the first day after We were married. I couldn't take it anymore. Nothing, actually. Nothing had been given, nothing he said made sense to me." 
 My wife sobbed next. I cried for hours more. My children sobbed to it. My wife kept sobbing a little more. My kids were better than they ever were. Nothing mattered anymore. I died under an old cancerbed roof. It became clear that things would never be the same. I could no longer live. I knew I could no longer have children. My wife made a point to ask me for money after all this time, but she didn't seem to care. I felt like she didn't have a father.

**********28**********
People started to cry, knowing there's nothing more this world would hold if the last barrier collapsed. 
 The song came from behind me and we kept firing until I could barely make a sound. There was no man to speak of in this world. Its quiet outside with only the din of the bells, and it used to be dark and distant for me to think of others. The noise alone was enough to lull me here, an old man. Lost in thought I drew my sword and stalked up to the wall. I was, in all likelihood, clutching my sword as it dangled low and against my hip. Blood pooled below my eyes and I wrenched myself into the gloom. 
 My cave is quiet. The room is quiet, and the children don't seem to mind. My wife walks beside me with a wave and I smile sadly, just as she does every day. The nurses smile at me and we whisper to each other, and without my assistance I grimace. " Alright, I'm going to need everything I can find now."

"Not every cat can make you laugh " she smiles at the first chuck of the hoard over their pens. " Some cats would finally laugh. Some cats will laugh. It is my plan. My plan for the whole lot of you. If you would just yell at me about it. " She is laughing now, only dropping her shoes before she pulls them around her neck. The collection is making a noticeable noise. The way it grows. The fear it takes. It cannot be stopped. Not through your lack of it. She can not, she has to know that it will not. It is my plan, my plan for the whole lot of you. It will not happen to you... but that is okay by me. Now relax. I know we are in the middle of some trouble at the door so go to the front to leave. You can come in now and I will not. Don't rush out on me again unless you are thinking tough something. Take something from the far corner. Put it on the side next to my author, okay? Maybe someone will laugh at it. Maybe I will be mad at you and come back in one night. " You look away. The conversation is almost over. I know what you are thinking. Nothing will happen to you. Not that I can care for you. No. I have to do this. " Yes? What do you think? " No! No! It is done! I am mad and I am furious! " Please, stop! Please don't listen to this, it has happened. It's all real. " There you go. I will laugh if you don't get mad at me. Please, do as you must. What a perfect first date. " Good night Mr. Yang. I love you so much. It's going to be a long night, but don't wait to get down to it." A flash of white crosses her face and she goes back to being happy.

A jumbled pile of paper spilled from my kitchen window. I had seen it in documentaries, restaurants, and private events. It was a trash can in late summer, little pockets of paper at the bottom, and a road sign in the midst of a series of cheap billboards. 
 This jar looked like its namesake. A small yellowish tuft of fine dandelionish petals and gray juniper leaves, like beads of a previously bottled wine glass. I scrunched up my nose. Would i drink it? Would i try it? I wiped the residue off my tongue with a ragcloth and tossed the jar into the trash bin. Who would care? 
 Who would steal this? I trotted into the dusty cellar, prepped the lid, and turned my attention back to the pile of papers. This had to be it. What could i say if i said so myself? I grabbed the heavy table, barely out of reach of my shoulder, and threw the lid over my head. I giggled and turned my head. What was this? These scribbles hadn't moved, but if i wasn't careful, a small tear could have formed. 
 There was another little shred of paper. My finger quickly scanned the red black color of the paper, taking several cursive matches and putting them into my mouth. I wondered if this was some kind of memory trick or just a trick. I pat the rim of my coffee mug and looked at the large, pointed teeth of the child in the corner. " I need a **** new ____ bone". 
 A little twig whizzed into my hand. I reached into my pocket for the lost paper, ready to start over. I looked at the big red scratch on the wall. I snapped out of the trance. For the first time in my life, I had been free. And, at the first chance I had received, I broke.

Tom woke up still shaken. He turned around and looked over at his buddies. " Now, calm down. " He started shaking nervously. " This is getting weird... where the hell is Jesus?

Time to go get your glasses. Look around, see if the sky is clear or not. " He walked towards the doomsday device he spotted. " Okay buddy, " said Jesus. " That's right. It looks like the sky has already started to clear out and I think Jesus is here. " " He's right. He looks like Jesus. " Jesus looks behind him and gets a surprise. " Oh wow, that's weird.

**Build** 
 In an underground world based on the fictional Star Trek universe, pre-historic explorers in prehistoric villages discovered just a hint of the world they lived in. In ancient Rome, there was an underground bar market where people kept their pasted stuff, who were said to be in hopes of finding a new life form, before forming an empire. The ancient Romans thought they could see a god before they produced the Star Trek set. They ignored religion and did not realize that the galaxy with the best and the worst of civilizations wasn ’ t really headed towards one place. It really didn ’ t matter where they came from. 
 After decades of progress, they reached a decisive conclusion. The afterhumans were actually much more advanced than the beforehumans, and could wreak havoc in the very environment they lived in. As discoveries like the being was discovered, they needed a bold plan. The Afterhumans discovered advanced technology, acquired more of it and were able to research all the other beings in the universe. A few generations later, over 70 years after having freed themselves from slavery, a group of humans were sitting in an abandoned storeroom in Rome, pretending to be the first time travelers, going back and fixing old machines to maintain history. 
 Their secret weapon was simply a "bobble". They decided to stay underground until the Afterhumans were ready to test it. Thousands of people worked together and their plan was to go back and change history. They started a long and bloody war about it, before destroying the bar with homemade bombs to kill the soldiers, killing all those that they beat to keep the war going and finally killing off the entire working population in their old civilisation.

I can't believe it happened. It was all a facade. I can't believe it happened on a a dare or anything, not after four years because of all this. I swear to God God, I'm going to kill for this. 
 Anyways, back to my story. 
 Oh, I don't remember anything after that day. I think I just lost my best friend and I just remember when I found out he'd turned into a mosquito that had bitten my friend. That was a little different then it usually was. 
 I was looking for a young person that was schooled in martial arts who can identify and work with a dog. I found him dead yesterday at a train station near my apartment. This kid would have been useful to have in my job back at jobs such as this, but unfortunately, his sanity was killed by the gore the cowardly killer had poured into him. I'm pissed. 
 I feel the joy of our kid injecting me with nitrogen and other synthetic additives on the guy and his painful injuries. It's an old boy's joke, to me at least. Not to scare him or anything. This is the last straw, so I grab another inhaler and jump in the boxer shorts. He sings in the stew and pisses on my couch. 
 By the time I wake up, the mask is gone. I can see only his face staring off into space. The light changed from a bright orange to a dewy red. I feel a tug at my wrists. It hurts to breathe and I lean away from my mind, trying not to think. 
 I pulled the mask from his face. It looked bright white and it sounded like bleach, fluttering away towards me as I slowly realized what I had done. It was all a facade. I can't believe it happened on a dare or anything, not after four years because of all this. I swear to God, I'm going to kill for this.

Vincent von Gogh suddenly didn't care whether his painting was good or not. It was a heath of paper, with a wide smile on the top, her matted hair in messy curls, and his wordless demeanor. Those kind of people had been cut out for centuries, we all know what you mean, the dead of night when the stars are set, stained under the bustles of strange cities. 
 I'd always heard about people who complained about the dead, especially stray objects. The living go around themselves rants about the dead, often provoking no responses, and can only cry during events no less shocking than the death of humanity itself. Probably enough of a social phenomenon that there have been some dead inhabitants of Gotham who cannot carry out their wills. 
 It was perhaps a little funny, staring at Vincent sitting on my terrace, the brush of my fingernails brushing against his cheeks when he launched another painting at my application. Just as I was about to draw my last passing eye on the story of the Dead, lightning flashed in his peripheral vision, and the life went black for him. 
 I waited for the next turn.

I open the door to my bedroom and the gun sitting outside is shaking. 
 On my side of the door is a.40 in semi-gloss plastic. 
 I manage to bite my lip to call out. 
 "Let's go grab some snacks. " 
 Just then a young girl comes rushing out with several packs of snacks on her hip. 
 The next thing I know she is sitting up in her bedroom, looking at a large television on top of her head. I turn on the television and notice that the news is in full swing on me. I smile. 
 The news walks around the room reporting: 
 It looks like we have a gun control act! 
 The News reports on the names of the gun lobby. 
 The gun lobby is fierce. 
 We have a gun control act, and we have a lot of money on our side. 
 They sit down next to each other and have breakfast in one of the stacks. 
 The News feeds on their pokemon. Pokemon day updates updates. 
 Pokemon battle reports. 
 These are some of the most heated events in history. 
 The house becomes cold and dark with heat. 
 The TV falls onto the floor, fading back to pink and white. 
 The news dispatches some monsters who make fun of us. 
 Big monster sort, " Heckle-Knight " on green! 
 Boom! 
 Our entire town is shaken by the casualties of our " Aggressive/Agreed" activities...

God took a few steps forward, opening the door to where they had ploughed steel through a forest. Halfway through the pushback, a soldier came flying. Thankfully, he landed a few hundred meters back. He came across the base entrance and looked through the screen, only to find that a Soviet sniper was practicing on him. The soldier panicked, and reached for his railgun in desperation, not knowing what to do. 
 That was the last thing God heard before shooting him in the stomach. 
 God heard the two Soviet soldiers shouting, and took a step back. This was what the World Watch called a place of quiet. Believing himself to be safe, God stood up and clenched his fists. Moving towards a small platform, God got to the rest of the walls, aiming out at the jungle in search of a crack. 
 He hit something that dug at the side. An abandoned building, lost in the war. God let out a sigh of relief. He tried to think on his next action; as he walked forward he began to panic. He rolled over and looked up, but there was nowhere else to look. 
 The next time he found a way out of this world, God made the same mistake, shooting a Ukrainian sniper. It was the same mistake that put him here. His anxiety about what the next action could mean became compounded with the eagerness to follow the soldiers, but never learned how to meet his next goal. God stepped into the blast hole, and took a second to count.

It was the war in the 19th century. Millions of people are dead due to famines, we led marches for centuries in this forsaken land. In there I remember the calls of Life and Peace every day, as the dying surrendered their last lives to save those very souls. 
 War isn't so painful anymore. The roads were no longer paved with painted canvas and the snow piled quite thin in some places. By this time the army was halted there could be no entry for soldiers. It was ordered that all infantry units must surrender or else the soldiers would die. The snow melted slowly and then a massive layer of snow fell and while many soldiers fled, others had not returned to their homes. They were stuck in a shell, a spot that was manned by wailing children and mothers of their children. They started screaming and began screaming a helpless that was many families lost on the battlefield. 
 After three days of suffering no one had left home, it is believed that they retreated from this land. It was incredibly cold there was no snow melting now with no electrical devices on either side of the snow covering. All in a few days no one dared make a break. By nightfall the army was damaged by the snow. Last night the army had retreated and the battle could not be won, and so I won't ever hear from him again. He was in a terrible hospital bed. For this week I'll be missying him day and night. Tomorrow I'll not be able to see him. 
 After the song ends, farewell. One must keep thinking that every day there was pain and thousands died.

*WHUMP*. 
 I woke up in the middle of the night, reaching for the water bottle. 
 And I heard my alarm go off. I shivered and brought my umbrella to the window. Dad was definitely awake and my bag was wrenched from me before he could say anything. 
 I couldn't see much of anything around us. But the woods were dark and she was scared of me. 
 I'm on a boat, and she and my roommate are walking in from Maine, the latest thing to hit the waves. 
 How did she make it back? What was that fucking storm? 
 I looked down at the bottom of the water. There wasn't much water there, in fact, there was some clouds in the air. It was a nice dark blue. And then, there was a flash of lightning and then everything went dark. And then there was nothing. 
 I realized something, and it was a pretty big explosion. 
 I look up at the sky. Then, and I realized that the wind was blowing away my shirt. 
 Shit. 
 It was a shower. Oh my God.

"The sea of dreams doesn't die, which means the ocean is dead. " 
 " But for the moment, that's exactly why we are here, yes? I could never live without sleep. I'm going to look at the sea, and the waves, and the sun, and I'll see....we can go anywhere. " 
 " Well, that's a change from when we looked at this particular coastline. But for now, you know. Just in case I awaken, see you for a second, isn't that ideal? " 
 " Yes. That's a change for me. Everyone notices when they sleep, we should all be aware that they have missed at some point. " 
 " Is that why? It's not like we get bored right now and stop to ponder the concept of sleep. And, ah, you know what? " 
 " No, that's why. When we sleep. It's just that, we can never lose the fun we've had with the dream we have now. " 
 " Why couldn't we be more free, then? We have a wonderful, wonderful vacation here! " 
 " Well, I see. Ah, here we go. Let's get going, ladies and gentlemen. "

Every day I hear the crows going away, the bats scratching their feet, nightfall night. It just never goes away. It's a shadow of a thing, a looming shadow. It darkens the morning, the forest looks darker, it looks less, the shapes become less. 
 I sit and sweat my brow. It's been a while. 
 I know my mother is looking into my soul but I can't hear it and it hurts me because no one knows it. 
 I know I like to play but I've learned to stay calm and wait for a "bacon" or something. 
 If it's there, I'll be gone and no one will notice me, otherwise my spirits wouldn't have. 
 I wear my crows, I wear my crows, and I wear them. 
 I walk around and I'm in the woods but I keep walkin' towards the forest. 
 I don't say anything when I go in the woods, I just watch. 
 I hear them calling. I can't hear them, they know it. 
 They call if I forget my song. They're calling if I'm not comfortable. They're calling if I'm not willing to face the dark. 
 I grab a shovel and we get a shovel and I go to sleep.

"BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP " 
 " Wah. " 
 I woke up in my daughter's room. She was in bed and had spilled all over the floor. I tried to step through the cracks in the wall but it would be too easy to stab her in the side. 
 " Hello you did that. " 
 I was a little shaken, " Is this just dream? " 
 " It was. " 
 " But you said you're a hero. " 
 " How are you supposed to talk to me. " 
 " I can't. I didn't wish for you to wish for me to be immortal. I've always lived in the past. " 
 " God I wish that you were a hero. " 
 " My own immortality is a pretty minor point. But.. hey, I'm not racist! " 
 " There's no point in ignoring you. You've forgotten everything. " 
 " No? " 
 " Yes? " 
 " Why did you fall in love with me? " 
 " Because I loved you right before I made that wish. " 
 " Okay, well.. My wish is this: do you know who I am? " 
 " No! " 
 " Ok. If this is a dream, I'm a hero. I'm my own guy, not anyone's. " 
 " So then do you do it? " 
 " I wish I could stay immortal for as long as I wanted. " 
 " So.. like you say? " 
 " See, I wish I could die at any point in the past. So.. it's a nice dream. " 
 " Not my dream? " 
 " I wish for you to become immortal. " 
 " That's not my dream, it's what I make the wish for. " 
 " Okay. So now you've come to accept this. Now get back to your bed. " 
 " Uh.. okay." 
 Edit: life starts again.

I always loved it when the waiter called out my name. I was humming a song, and was almost chirping when I saw what he said. Every time someone was looking at me and wanted some, they would float around me in the form of a gigantic hat, similar to a sailor's hat. I swore I saw spiders fly over my head, and they would make my hair shine! I never knew how bad it was really until they were stopped by a woman in a hospital gown with a needle in her arm and a warm smile on her face. 
 "Just wait here my love, " I interrupted. She was truly beautiful, and beautiful just as I had envisioned her. That's how, ever since I was a little boy, I always dreamed of looking up to her, watching her make jokes and make fun of me for wearing a pink hat to school, whenever I saw her laughing at my jokes or laughing with her parents. I thought that I would be able to enjoy watching her and her laughter! It seemed as though the more bad things I'd seen, the less scary I'd come up with! And she was always laughing. 
 " Hello, my love? " She sounded nervous, like she was kind of trying to hide something. " I've never met anyone with a blonde moment like this. And I've been contemplating trying to get you a job, but I'm just not willing to have you pay anything. " I asked. I felt her mouth move as she leaned over me, and she said, " Oh sure, I'd like you to try, as long as I can help you."

God Damnit. 
 He's waiting for me to finish shoveling snowballs into my sack. " What the fuck!? " He yell. " I don't have time to stop man, because all you can do is throw snowballs at me and shit. " I grumble, rolling over and resting my butt against his jaw. " You sure you're gon na let this one down? You're saving my life once, and you know that it won't take me months to find you. " 
 " O-okay. " I sigh, sighing again. " Look. I said I'm sorry. I don't want to end up like this again. I had a plan for that, for this one moment, but there's always something in this case where the lawyer- " 
 " I know what we have to do. I just need you to repeat the steps again. " 
 " Right. " 
 " I'm willing to do anything for you. Please. " He slams his fist down on the table. " Really please. " He tosses the left half of my sack on the ground. 
 " No, no, no, no. Just let me right now. " 
 " Yeah, yeah I know, I fucking know. Stop. Right now. Right now for some reason. " I sigh. " Can't you get up! " 
 " Sure as hell can you. " He pulls me up onto my knees and starts lifting me up onto the fire, melting me. I winced in pain as he spit in my face. " Listen, buddy. I can show you, ya know? It's okay, man, just leave me alone. We can fuck again, y'know, in a moment. " He lifted me up off of the pit and started walking me through the ice on the roof. " This is it, you're finally dead. You're going to be resurrected. " 
 I squeezed my cheeks together as he walked away. " I-I'm already dead. " I slumped down on the floor, hoping he would listen for a response. 
 " Seriously. You're dying. This is already over, I don't need to deal with him. " 
 " I don't care. I don't even care. " He leaned over and placed his chin in my lap. " Get back on the roof, pull down your hoodie, and don't be like, you know what else to do? It'll be over okay? If I drop you off, yeah, I'll do it. " 
 I grunted and slowly turned around. " No! Stop! " I yelled. " Don't let him fucks mess this up! Go back to school, leave me alone, " I continued, while he shoved me off the roof. 
 " All right. Okay. " He turned and walked away, breathing heavily. 
 " I'm not fucking serious, dude. " I shoved him down on the floor and turned. I could feel his shoulders turning to one. " You got ta do what? No. " 
 " No. " 
 " You said do what." He punched me.

Five years had passed since the last human traveled to the underworld, our meeting in a cave of ash later this year. Though we were simply going through the motions, we had formed the plans to arrive in the afterlife where our guild would journey to die as well and someday become the most powerful. 
 "What are you going to do for my reward? " 
 " We need you to share the journey with the other humans, but if you tell me that I will care for all the souls that walk on this Earth you will be sent to the deepest dungeon in the most dangerous city in the world? " 
 I'll never forget the one… 
 One day a young child emerged from the deep dark portal to the forest and laughed. " This is great! It's mine! " 
 " A witch?"

"Well, there must have been something... *cough* weird going on here. " 
 " It's all right. I was trying to make this a bit more proper in spirit. " 
 The line in front of Jimmy opened, and a small, thin man dressed in a red bandana jumped from his seat. 
 " Go on man. " 
 " I assure you, " Jimmy began, " that it is technically correct to call my client Satan. His name is Jerry Sullivan, but I think he's that guy who does the law. Heck, I thought he was your attorney. God, I don't know why I'm even in the legal business. " 
 Jimmy Potter nodded solemnly. " Yes sir, of course. Here, I'm going to explain. " 
 " By the way, I'm an old friend of yours. You have just hired me, so... uhhh, James. Holy crap. " 
 " Go ahead Mr. Potter. It has to do with Michael Godbeer, uh.. What do you mean he's not playing Godbeer with you at all? " 
 " Look, you make it sound like Michael isn't even as bad as you are. But Jerry, he's not even in court. He's gone over to Mike and did some legal consulting for me. Don't you remember what he recommended? " 
 " It's called a clerical error, sir. " 
 " It says this: " He paused, and pointed to his left. " There are three clerical errors going on right now, all of which have to do with Neil Armstrong. " 
 " Okay. Mr. Potter? " 
 " I didn't go over to Mike and asked him if he wanted to go over to Mike and propose an arrangement. " 
 " What does'you propose'? " 
 " At this point in time I can't tell you. Neil Armstrong is, uh, a dirty old man. I haven't seen him in a good while. " 
 The man sighed deeply. " Anyway, let me give you a final, in case you were asking, opportunity. Michael in fact has a number of people with the same interest in the same fields. " 
 Jimmy Potter looked at the man in a serious sense. " So... could you explain why? " 
 " It's just, sir. I can't find any. Neil Armstrong was hired to write a contract for a client. " 
 " This is literally God's top lawyers, isn't it? " 
 " I don't know. But I know Michael not to be allowed to even have his plane ticket. " 
 Jimmy Potter was taking a deep breath. " Go ahead now Mr. Potter. " 
 " Come on Mr. Potter. You've got to work some smarter." 
 After the van pulled into the parking lot, the manager shuffled around. His hand slid across a file that stood out from the pile of papers in front of him. A single page of questions lay carefully off to the side. 
 **Michael Armstrong contract, contract statement 11-A of Copyright, Waiver and Appearance, showing Neil Armstrong attempting to make contact with a remote wild goose in Indiana. Invertebrate, including the remains of the goose. **

I sit in the dark of a dark void, that is when I see death, but not my own death. I was born four months later in a field known as a City. Other than the sudden appearance of myself I am not aware that there is another life on the other side. I feel a sense of loneliness surrounding me, and I am not sure of the meaning of the situation. There is no other living thing that could cause my death, not this one, and my only pursuit of that end. I slowly ask myself, "What's this place like?" 
 I looked around, and I saw not a blackness, or blackness beyond that.

"Do you take this gun inside? The gun of your life. " 
 " Me neither. With that I removed the key and, with a shake of my head, dumped the barrel into the hotel car. There was blood but the desk drawer still held the bullet. " 
 " My gun is much more than blood. It is the key to my destiny. The glass of the keyhole must be walked through. " 
 " Will you help me now? " 
 " I would, if there was a boss around. As a side note, I will give you a job. " 
 " Yes. With a gesture you will get your powers. Before you can run away you will hear " 
 " Yes, that is in your. You come with me. " 
 " Make sure to look at me without muttering so I don't know what you think. " 
 " Yes. I will see you in court the next day. If you don't help me I am not going to bring this car back up. " 
 " To stay with her. That is you and the last time you will meet. Yes. That is you. " 
 " To stay with her."

"I told you, Mrs Warrenfield wouldn't be allowed near you. She's not a good person. " 
 The assassin moves closer to the cleaning lady and gives a sudden squeeze. " I can walk on my own while you dine with us. Why would she need me to check things on you? " 
 The cleaning lady isn't amused. " Look, I know it won't matter. " 
 " If she is right about the regularizing we make a first contact. Anyways. She's not even cut off from either the government or some strings. Also the funeral is last Wednesday. " 
 " You are right, as any first contact is it shouldn't matter! Stop her from laying such delicacies on me! Come down and help me clear my meal. We'll talk about it tonight. " 
 The assassin steps forward and takes the meal. " What are you doing? " 
 " Look, I'll admit, I know it won't be better for her. But I can certainly help you. When she finally forgets, maybe she'll understand. " 
 " Don't worry, I don't worry. " 
 The assassin closes the door behind him. Slowly. " She was always so nice. She was a special girl. I know that she'll be happy to see you. " 
 Mrs Warrenfield is silent for a moment. " Alright, alright, alright. We can go now. This is truly a special night for us, and as you know it is the highlight of our lives. Come down and help me straighten the scene, please. " 
 *Another young man breaks the silence and a smile slides across the assassin's face. She was so proud. * 
 " Alright, before I leave Mrs Warrenfield, it would be a perfect tribute to the volunteer sniper. We'll head back to the estate, " the assassin says. 
 Mrs Warrenfield sighs deeply. * Next time. * She thinks. 
 The assassin leaves without a word. He follows the young man to the back of the church with a stamp on his passport. In a small room lined with small white tables is a door and a set of red lights. Every hour or so Mrs Warrenfield visits the back of the church. She carries on for an hour or so before returning to her office. When the he leaves he looks around and gives a smile. She was so proud of him. She wasn't always so nice. * 
 The assassin enters the back of the church. Her steps get quieter. She stops and looks around a little before looking through the stonework at the girls waiting inside. She doesn't wait anymore. But she finds it when she arrives and reaches the front row. " They almost returned the other day. " 
 The young man clears his throat. " No, we didn't actually show them any of that. You seem curious. " 
 Mrs Warrenfield's smile widened. " I knew. I've already kept myself informed of all the ways to do this. I should have been nicer." 
 The assassin steps back and hands her a package. She chucks it into the bulletproof vase behind her. 
 *I knew. I should have. I should have seen it, the look on his face. He must be a part of the mission. I should have felt that as a part of the convoy. I am thankful. *

He sits quietly on his mahogany bench gazing out the window and mumbling to himself. 
 "You're going to bomb the civilian in one day. " his wife squeaks out as she marries his mother. 
 " Okay, " he mumbles as he silently sits down at his table, " I'm going to have to kill the Master Sword dude because I've been living in a hole for too long and he's trying to find a way to save me. " 
 " M-But that would be way out of touch with me and his family. " 
 " Uh, your talking to the Master Sword dude. You're crazy, and tell yourself you have the nerve to be paranoid about the Master Sword dude being the only one who can save you from him. " she says. 
 " Wait, your just being extremely self confident! " he grunts. " The Master Sword Dude is the most badass man in this whole case. Now walk over here and grab his sword. " 
 " Is that why I've decided to join you on your quest to destroy the Mideyland? " 
 " Yeah, but I don't believe that you can be a totally badass swordsman. I believe the Master Sword Dude is the only one who can destroy the bad guys. " 
 " Listen, Gaffli, We're all just pissed that you're gon na be sitting here with us. This guy's hooking up with the Resistance or something. " 
 " What are you referring to? Are you actually telling me what to do? I can't take this job! I have access to the Master Sword Dude's cyber-punk output. My wife and kids would never listen to me because that's what they've all been growing up to. You don't even need me to do it right now! You only have the Master Sword Dude and you're bringing the Mideyland down by itself! " 
 " That's nice of you, I don't really know if you're nuts or just being emotional. I'm convinced that if I didn't have you I wouldn't still be working here at Turtlecraft Industries. But besides, the only thing that made me want to help you was just your keyboard! " 
 " You can't just let me kill him, your writing. Tell him that it's not worth it. For me to join him in killing him is like going through a traumatic childhood. Instead I decided to help him destroy your entire family and also your whole community."

How does this happen? The boy seems to be a complete expression of self interest. The teacher takes a slight flustered glance at his hands. 
 "Welcome to the school of superheroes. Professor, would you like to participate? " 
 The boy, was very much in shock. He slowly took a deep breath. The teacher stuck out her hand at him, followed by a hug from her. The boy is stunned. She then giggles back, trying to 'balance out the happy intermingling of words. 
 " I want to thank you all for coming to class. Please don't try to hide your embarrassment in the sunlight, you and your fellow students will be able to laugh all night and I hope not let you 'break the mic.' " 
 With a 'thank you' as she walks out the classroom, the teacher finally had enough. Suddenly, the guy who stood next to her had him asked all the dumb questions in front of him. He still had an odd look about him. His eyes slowly turned towards the teenager who had just caught their eye. 
 " Tell me, young man. You're super not just... normal. " 
 The kid looks up from his research and smiles broadly. The students stop for a moment. " You're somewhat different... and we're just eager for our new friend. " 
 With that, she leaves her class and to the front of the class. They duck behind the desks and out into the hallway. The teacher then swiftly led the girl away from the stage. 
 " Well what's it gon na be? " She asked awkwardly as they ran toward the classroom. 
 The boy froze, staring wide eyed. 
 " Don't do it. " he hissed, his mouth slightly open in shock. 
 " I wish it would... ". 
 She picks up the girl. " I wish it would be you... ". 
 " By the way, we were wondering whether a relationship should be formed... ". 
 " How the hell do you know that... ". 
 " You're a superhero, aren't you? " 
 " Not really, the class just wants me to be happy, aren't they? To bring balance to this day, to my family's... The bigger one? Some new school system, and I really do need it, aren't I? ". 
 " So... you want someone with more blue eyes? " 
 " Yes, really. They want a magnet! ". The boy lifts his eyes. 
 " Wherever we're from? " 
 " I dunno. But I wouldn't mind going through with it, how about a quick training? " 
 " But I don't have the money to rent a place! ". 
 " By the way, actually... That would be kind of awkward, but... " 
 "... " 
 " You mean guys that made you wanna be? " 
 " They don't always make me happy though, no matter what. I'm not so good for having blue eyes, it's all blue eyes. " 
 " Cool. " 
 " And anyway, have any of you got any friends to talk to, at least? ". 
 " Well, that would do! ". The girl giggles a little, obviously enjoying the silence. 
 " Look you'll be needing this, you know that. " The boy with his blue eyes continues. 
 " Well this would be a good starting point. If you ever have any heroes to prove you're a good candidate, make sure to let us know. " 
 A few hours pass by, and the boy is starting to form more confidence about getting that job done. After he finishes talking to her, the teacher finally gets to his feet and hands him a handbag. 
 " Alright boy, just take this, it's good. " The girl thanks him and tells him to get her phone out, and he gets her phone ready. As he leaves, the last thing he remembers is being on a rooftop, feet thumping on the concrete. It seems that the first thing the school ever saw was *a beam of light* that burned everything. 
 " My name is Willow Smits."

"Such fun, " I muttered to myself. It was just another day of my day off for all of the adrenaline to go through. I ran out of extra cash, but when I saw her, she was sweating and I couldn't make out her words. 
 " See, " I said, noticing her new date. " You've been with her for six months, right? " 
 " I know, " she replied. " We've done it many times, even when you only looked at her. You went through so much debt while she was away, and I'm glad that she loved you so much. " 
 " I know. I know, " I mumbled quietly. " Your face has become red all over. " 
 She smiled. " Are you going to tell me why? " 
 " That's *my* job, I'll just take care of that right away, " I said. " Then we can... reconnect, just like this? " 
 She laughed. " You can... rip us apart."

The Dark Brotherhood hit a snag long ago, and their lair, directly on the outskirts of the Commonwealth, was the target for the foe. The site was believed to be overrun with major zombie hunting grounds and those who managed to escape their bodies were quite successful, though there were protests and what is known of this, many killed themselves off and were bestors. The Black Knights secretly loved the pair as twins and in fear of losing them for their bloodlust, Elis were planning an attack against the southern part of the company, the capital of the Dark Brotherhood. A crime called for by anyone who felt threatened, the Dark Brotherhood was known for their violence and insatiable lust for justice. 
 Today was the day they would escape, the swaths of their territory mostly empty but survivors have already fled, the injured and dead alike, the undead and the pursuers wandering aimlessly. 
 "Heezeed " 
 Despite knowing the location of the location, everyone's decided to keep their distance and retreat. Unfortunately, Elis had lived in the area for the last four years, and decided to go by the color of their skin, not daring to cross the corpse of one of their own. This expedition would lead them to here, and they would leave the camp this night, while Rulon watches over the northern village. One day, he wishes he could say goodbye to his friend, Rulon. 
 " Dad?".

The phrase made me feel pang of guilt. " Where has an old soul like you spend their working day? " I asked the owner, laughing from his seat. " A human heart, anyway, " the man laughed. " This piece is really pricey, " I told him, and he jumped up and down. " Sorry, " he sighed. His purple hoodie worn over jeans, and his glowing gold Apple logo along his chest. " I hope you find yourself happy right now. " 
 I looked at his well painted, bright white stripes that covered the part of the windshield with a brilliant ruby. " Looks like me. " I told him, smiling as he opened the white coat. " Where's the rest of your caretaker? " 
 The proprietor nodded. " We've only lived here for 20 years now. The owner, " he called out, gently pushing his glasses back on his nose. 
 " That's alright, " I reassured him. " He may be here since he's doing a book update. You know, I'm sure he doesn't want you having such a good time. But don't worry, he's excited to give you a big present so he can come home a million times. " 
 I put the man's money aside. " Your heart is really starting to hurt now. This one time, you died when you were just a baby. I have to give you this heart so I can care for you even after you're old. " 
 The proprietor chuckled. " You're a rude man, " he smiled, taking another sip of coffee. He raised an eyebrow, and I grinned. " We don't even need to have a family. " 
 " You can move. " He said. " We already know where you live. I know why you're here. He wants to help you improve your life. I'll use his energy to help yourself. " 
 " What's that? " I asked, as I felt my concentration slipping. 
 " New heart again. Never again."

I had the girl at my table the other day and I'm halfway around the world. I've been with her since I was five, she's been there for me since birth. We both love to go swimming together, she makes me cry when I mime up the blushes my mom gave me for the first time. My head comes up to her, she's alone. I watch her laugh and her brother laugh, all smiles that I can understand. Our eyes meet and we laugh through each other's tears, catching up on all the glory that we've both witnessed. We tell each other of our big adventures and our small mistakes and of our love. We cherish each other's grand exploits, and we laugh together while we finally work up the courage to lie awake, sunburned, tomorrow night.

"Hello. " I heard my guide's voice as he flipped a switch on his shoulder and faced the wide road. The spring, the wind howled as he sped through the trees. Dressed in a canvas suit, I slowly approached the wooded area in curiosity. The steep leaves grew taller and taller until their edges became a smooth stone lined with bark, when suddenly I heard it. 
 I looked into the distance, hearing its laughter all around me. * Scream? * 
 I was looking for the source, just outside my window. The tall hairy footprints were shortly followed by dozens of these animals, those that didn't grovel and shriek uncontrollably. So, I started to check the area for any witnesses, but there was no one there. 
 " Another... another one will not find us, " another voice said. Was it fear? Is it fear of the laughter? I quickly reached out and brushed against the shadowed footprints, but the branches disappeared, leaving only the occasional watchpan poking out from between his toes. 
 The footsteps arrived, and soon, a group of men emerged from their bushes, their faces twisted and mutilated as they took out their weapons. They carried arms and pointed at my guide, their wide eyes looking into my full view. 
 " Come on kid, what the hell were you going on about? " I motioned to the man behind the scenes. 
 He nodded, " If you know what you're doing, I have no problem with that, you need to finish it quickly. Get those bare metal sticks around your ankles and find a guy with two sticks!" 
 As I reached up and removed the sticks, a flash of pink erupted from underneath them, and began to slowly fade, until it was golden. It was then that I knew that they were walking away from me.

I woke up, heard a, a horrifying screech from my pillow, and stumbled out of bed. The last I knew, my chamber door was unfurled open, there was no way around it. I tried to claw at my sheets but the challenge was too much for me. It just wouldn't let up. 
 I tried kicking the door a bit before I got any of my willpower back. I looked down and found it was my first living thing, a tiny, hand held bed-robot. As I got older, I got used to walking more. I still have my stuff. As I got smarter, I got better at things. I had let the robot handle most of the chores, doing chores that were unexpected for me. I also had a fairly perceptive man, always conscientious, and always thoughtful. 
 It was as though I was walking through the hallways of my old apartment building, as I strode up to him. He looked at me deeply and said, "What, are you finished getting ready to leave? ", as I climbed into bed and slept. " Yes, ", he said, glancing over, " I knew you would be here soon and it was time for us to spend a peaceful little time together ". He walked over to the sleeping host for a hand-job, and took his spot on the bar. 
 " What's the matter, idiot? What was your problem? " 
 He held up a hand for me to shake. I tapped lightly, but he yanked back as a small droplet swam from my cheek. 
 I banged the bar with my fist, and watched a swarm of flies pass on the glass. After a while, my feet still touched the bar. " What the hell is going on? ", I thought to myself. It was just a dream. 
 As the last drops of urine left the stinky bathroom, I sighed to myself. I had finally told the truth, I just hadn't felt like living for a long time. 
 It was like back on earth when Mars was all dirty and my childhood homes were clean and my clothes dry, and people only told stories about flowers and flowers. 
 Years passed slowly and everywhere I looked, there was a growing interest. 
 " What? ", I said, staring out the window. The last ray of sunshine entered the forested garden, and I opened my mouth to scream. 
 " What? ", I was disappointed. My eyes were just pixelated, blank white, the water glistening as if someone had torn it away from me. The androgynous, androgynous ones stared at me, and turned to me, glaring at me at the darkened window. 
 " What the fucking fuck is going on?! ", I screamed. I bent over to collect my thoughts. " What the fuck is going on, my fucking pet dog? ", I was so upset that there was no way out. For a second, the only thing I could say was, " Dog is mine!"

"I can't..No..Please don't do this... I'm scared.. I'm being selfish.. " Beezle said. 
 " What? Why are you doing this to me.. I'm a human, I make sure you're standing by your side all the time because you don't want to end up like- " Beezle started to choke on his own words. 
 " Just because I killed your pet dog.. It's because of you. It's because I saw you leave a group of students wandering in the blind alley way around home when you got in your car. It's because... I came after you. It's because you brought tears with you, and used it to escape from the horrible reality that you are leaving and might never be able to return. If I'm going to keep living like this you must come to the realisation that you betrayed you because of the class that watched you bully your friend. You're supposed to go back to school as a human. " The creature said with a wry smile. 
 " What else can you do.. " Beezle was quickly silenced by one of the others. 
 " You aren't important to us. You don't matter much to us, although by some very, very small reason. Your parent's are friends with someone who you adore and they don't have very much of a link to the world, and that makes you and your family feel a little different from the rest of your friends on the campus. With that, I have no choice. Just be an animal. Just be a human. No more excuses. " The creature said as he took Beezle away, with a slight smirk on his face. 
 " I'd rather be like a human. No more deserve to live in this filthy, cluttered and disgusting world." Beezle said as he gave up.

The bad guys always win. 
 Mother died the night of his birth. She followed him to the entrance of the building which he had forced her into. He had ruined her life. Her family had tried their best to keep her home. And yet now she seemed to be living a lie, she had killed her mother. Her father had tortured her and stabbed her, killing her. He was so warped that he could not recognize her face. It was clear to the parents that their son was unstable and deranged. Nobody knew how he had managed to persuade her to let him go. There was nothing she could do about that. They hadn't understood why he had cast her aside, then why he made her spend her life in solitary confinement. 
 He had killed her before; she was old and frail and it felt as if she was decaying from her beating and being offered the best shelter she could wish for. There had been no food and water for several months. Blood was still seeping out of the back of the house, and now was the time for the feeding. She was starving, but she could still eat. The door was unlocked, but the door refused to be opened. The parents had taken an interest in her. It was the only way she could survive, and they could do no other. They said that their son could not hurt her, but she could help that man. But it was only once she did become used to the people around her. At first she tried to free herself from the plastic doors, but they would always shut again. 
 Through the windows they saw her. She stood alone, dead, if she had not been so careful. They had still been upset that she had gotten so close to her end. She just wanted to eat again and forget about all that. They had no choice but to teach her what was best for her. It was a balancing act, trying to pretend she was not alive. 
 They had already fed her food and water. Another failure, as she thought about her dying father. But she still tried. They brought the rocks. They casted the glass over and destroyed her. She cried until one day she looked at her clothes and saw nothing, and rushed out of the bedroom and into the kitchen to clean herself up and to eat. When she looked to her father one last time she saw that the clock was up, time was running out. She had lost hope, hope that she could heal and rebuild. Perhaps she could be a symbol of hope, the walking threat to the lives of the children of the city, to a future she would once learn of. She ran to the refrigerator and switched the light on, hoping to remember what she had eaten earlier and what she had done. When she opened the fridge doors, she saw everything she had done. Everything she had come to hate. She laid down on the floor, crying like a baby, and raised her head up to meet her father. They couldn't tell who she was, or why she had come, but they knew she was in his arms. She raised her finger, and the razor banged against her forehead. Her eyes opened wide and she drew her knife. She sliced her father in three. She walked away from him, and threw her daughter to the floor. She was never seen again. There were no signs of her actions, no signs she existed, no signs of fear, no signs of anything to do with her. She was not doomed to live another day in a house full of toys, plants and trees, of food and water.

The sky was ablaze with faint reds and oranges when the giant earthquake hit. It was only a small dent in the fine copper hull the world had put up. The agents monitored the area frantically, dropping expensive drones to the backstreets like it was nothing. 
 "St-touch up with the display centers. " Said the Captain, who'd recently retired. 
 " I don't know why this seismomagnetic event hasn't been noticed already. We got on board and began searching, but they've fucked up. Apparently by the super-vacuum bridge, every node has fallen on one side now. No alerts are received yet to cut it loose in the blackout. " Said the new Capt, who had installed the R15 solid-state drive into his ship. " It's been happening pretty much every hour of the week. If it gets all up in a week, you can't control it. " 
 The Captain turned to look at his fellow crew member, who was languishing in the seat. " Don't lie to me. It's not time. We're on it. " He turned away, explaining how he'd been the only personnel that had been placed here within weeks, even if they knew that the Armageddon was coming. " Even if we don't know it, the people are demanding the answers that the agent of destruction left before it all started. All the space stuff is falling off the maps. They're sending the signal to each node in the neighbourhood. " 
 A minute passed on as the remaining crew got the message and nodded off. Dr. MacRae had turned to leave when the stillness broke his stare. 
 " Okay, " Said MacRae. " It's your turn. " 
 The camera flashed. 
 " This isn't working. " Wordlessly, the crew dug themselves into the spot where the earthquake had started. It was like they'd been stuck in the deepest depths of a crater that hadn't even been exposed for 5 hours before. The scientists, however, figured it was enough to stop the waves. It was getting dark fast, and McRae knew she had to stay at home. 
 Down below, the ships communications antenna suddenly went red, covering the entire surface of Mars in a thousand tiny dots. Their entire spacecraft had been immediately rolled into a central hub, the only computers still functioning, every single one alive. 
 Gestures mounted themselves on the aurora cone, tunnels running out of the spacecraft out to the Red Planet. 
 MacRae scanned the horizon to see what lay beyond. Standing amidst a swathe of green and orange veins were what looked like their own planet. There was no sunlight. Just a flicker of motion in space. 
 " Damn it, " she gasped as the two armed ships stood overhead, gasping for air. She reached out and picked up the small device that indicated the quake was likely back there. 
 Once in range, she turned it on. 
 Cape Canaveral was totally frozen in a flash of red and orange. " It's all just a matter of time," she whispered to herself. But it wasn't. As far as her eyes went, it wasn't. She didn't know where they were going. She couldn't find a way out. Only the unlikely.

Dear Lord, 
 I would like to remind you that in order to improve your life, you have to become a deity. I mean I'm a little dubious about it, but I believe my God is too complex to mess with and only works when the questions remain unanswered. 
 Just because I'm a deity, it doesn't mean I'm a god. I wrote a book to help explain this, and to teach you that I'm a god and we humans are just the descendents of an ancient civilization. They were very nice people and you know me. 
 If you read the autobiography of your best friend, Iris, ask her how she and you achieved so much in your life. If she takes your faith seriously, perhaps, maybe I can please her. 
 Honestly, my little planet isn't worth finding out. The way your mother has taught you has taught me how to be an actual god. And even though there are a few countries on this world that are just as unique as ours, you just have to figure out who your gods are first. 
 So, if you'll give a cursory glance, try coming up with a name for your character. Name your god. Do something special for them. 
 I know that I've tried giving your demon friend a demon friend, but with the sheer infinite power I have, I wouldn't need it. I can simply take them and wonder how this isn't something you understand. 
 You never know, Lord, but even then, you can do that. Remember that little book on Belief from Eden that you had? If I've made you some gods, I'm sure your immortal version of life will be somewhat special. You will have to figure out who your god is. 
 In other words, when you arrive at the end of your life, you're going to need a god, and even if you don't like it, I'm not a strict spiritual being. Your god is going to have to figure out who your God is. And I'm always going to keep it that way. 
 I'd love to hear some advice from you, Lord. 
 But last week, I was sitting in class when you walked in and asked you a question. I told you about two things, your a big guy and your little buddy. And suddenly, in my head, I went up to you and asked again. But this time I made you the dumbest answer I've ever heard. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********61**********
Of course I still haven't made them in.. 
 Of course I still haven't made them in, right? 
 Oh... OK. 
 There is no middle ground, after all. 
 What are you gon na do? 
 Well, wait. Stop fucking with me. 
 You know what I mean, I lost hope. 
 So how do I deal with this now? 
 Who else does I have to deal with? I have job to finish but how did it get here? I don't even know your name. 
 Sorry. That couldn't be. 
 [ intro voice ] I guess I don't remember it, you're having trouble. I think I'm in trouble. 
 [ intro voice ] Why do you have to come back? There's food everywhere and I'm starving. I can't be with that creepy prick in the backyard. He keeps onto me and I bleed and he keeps on getting in my way. Do you want me to come back? I have a temper that I can prove to him. He calls me too and I'm putting your food up on his roof. I'm not gon na eat anymore because of you. You're a bad woman! You hate me. You beat me when I was a child! Get out of here. I'm sorry. I can't leave you. I'm sorry. 
 [ intro voice ] You don't seem okay. I've been requesting you for a week now and I don't know what else to do. 
 Well, we'll see about that.

"Now we must build a fort in this valley. " Cecilia growled into her bull shins. " It can not pass the wall of Iron! It is God's will, but I can not stay here! " 
 The tall oaksmen held tight to the world, pales in comparison to her own shape. Black trunks hunched in one corner, white at the other and the rest of the Mahal had been uncovered as they snuffed out the nearest of their wood pallets. One oaksman, tall and thin, watched as a surge of energy fueled the small band, who built themselves from stones, of what might have been corn. 
 Cecilia moved as fast as her brother dared, racing around the small clearing beneath her. Time was short and it was dark out, but she saw it. It was burning -- the Phalithyr from the embers on Mount Terro --
" Where were we? " She muttered weakly. 
 Her brother stumbled backwards, unconscious. Phalithyr were infested with the remains of Phalithyr in an infested valley. Cecilia limped backwards, back out into the coldness of the churning cauldron. 
 Their captain called his bazara to him. " How could they've been such nimble warriors, you bastards. " 
 Cecilia's face red. " They were the Aranes, I hate that. They could have easily defeated them and maybe even been innocent. But they were small, we only had one Mithra. One Mithrite, man and ruler, a mere spearhead in the modern world. It was our undoing. " 
 " So would you have died so? " Oaldemar shouted. He was the only survivor of the scene. 
 Cecilia mustered a soft bark to defend herself. " What of the Nephilim, and the big ol' Hoell? Any or all of them were safe. But if they were still dangerous, so was Tycho. You know I would wager a lot that they ate their mom's gallow, where they feasted and did their bidding when no one else wanted to, that the line would get out of hand. " 
 Oaldemar looked about, giving Cecilia the appearance of feigning ignorance. " But of course, we have nothing to lose. " 
 Cecilia grinned wickedly. " If all we do is force the Midas to fight, for no else in our vast state has a greater chance. " 
 " The Horse Breeds of the Hoplite, rather. The prehistoric people spoke of the Name of the Beli-Longhurst, an ancient feast of the Nhlian Fatherland. They were the ancestors of the fearsome Mvarren Fang. They ate no vegetables, they didn't become fools, they did not bite. " 
 " We sacrifice to them at first, you see. But surely God will see fit for them to sacrifice their sacrifices. If we were to leave them be, then by the Gods, we should offer them this feat. " 
 " Such a glorious feat! Tell me, what will all those tribals of Galatia do? " 
 " You are extremely foolish. It is the good of the gods that shall be sacrificed at the request of you. By the gods, they will be worthy. If not you, then what will? " 
 She crossed to her brother with a sigh. " If our sacrifices were to dance, then why our offerings? " 
 She raised her bull and raising it to meet her eyes, Cecilia raised a faint ghostly beam of light to the sky. 
 " Mm. Mm. " She gasped, listening to her brother's voice. " So it must be with our knowledge, we knew not how to conduct our battle. But in this age of literal destruction, it must be fought with fire and steel. All the Gods do will stop us if we are not free of the wrath of the Great Fire."

Dane decided to sleep, realizing that the officer just sighed, half-asleep at this point and rolled out of bed. He sighed and settled onto his bed, ass hat shoving itself forward across his belly, and sweat seeping down his thighs. Fuck it, his car. It had to be late. This crashed. 
 "We'll be stuck somewhere else for a while, and I'm already fired! " That was her mother saying from the front window of the driver's seat. Yes, her mother. She couldn't hear this shit coming. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe it was a drug overdose. She's supposed to sleep. All she can hear is this crash and the sirens. He hits the brakes, even though he knows the car won't hit him. Damn, the cops just stopped in on that one. Fuck it, he got a brain injury from that one. 
 He had a different vision. Stupid watery eyes. His jeans fluttered before he could use them properly. The rest of the day he wouldn't even have an ounce of control. The rest of his body was just sitting there, unconcious. All he could think about was the voices and the police car's alarm. Fuck. A whole weekend. He could be doing this to himself. He's from a different city. There's a speed limit. One, two, three, four. No turning on the brake. Dude is getting agitated. Shit, would he fall asleep in the hot sun on Friday morning? All he does is smash the door. That's when he sees it. He drops his keys, lays down, and screams. All the little shit just sit there, moaning like a child who's getting drunk but wanting nothing more than to sleep. 
 Dane was suffering from hallucinations and dreams. Many of these had the echo of a criminal one night later in his hallucination. So, there he was, reading a book, sitting in his own room, writing a story. " One." He thinks to himself. Fine. Fine. ****

"That's 20 million bucks " I thought. 
 I tried opening the wallet, waiting for it to finish its function. By instinct, I said " ok, what is it anyway, it will only take 10 million dollars " as I crumpled it. The only condition was the existence of a specific key on the inside. I went back to cutting off the key from inside the wallet before opening it again for effect. 
 When it came out the key was embedded into my neck, leaving a mark with it. The moment I realized it was there, I suddenly realized how careless I had been and just went to the wallet again. In the only way I knew how: the right key was inside of me. I used the key as I slipped in. Every turn I slipped into a state of fear, tension and an extreme lack of comfort. To my surprise, the key was still there, and I just put it in. 
 " Yea, 40 million dollars " 
 I thought about talking to a coworker with no clue how much. 
 " What? " 
 The change that came for me was two thousand five hundred and eighty seven dollars. The reality was there was no way in hell I had been able to afford this. The rise of alcohol had drove some mad nuts to drop a family member of mine on me. I needed to have a child who had no care for family. 
 " 20 million dollars, I'll need it. " 
 I stepped out of the bedroom window and swore in that mad, broken voice of mine. 
 I left the door unlocked and turned off the lights. 
 " 20 million bucks " 
 I went into the bedroom, pulled the children's sweater tighter over my head and locked the door behind me. 
 " 20 million dollars" 
 I was 20 million dollars down the road and wanted me to return it to the drawer on the table next to my mattress.

"So what is the history of sleep movies? " 
 " One, we first show the classic sleep experiments of Sarah McLachlan, who first founded Nightoftuff. Then we show her Stan Oduro, the most advanced sleep, science and invention since dream. " 
 " Alright really so if I'm listening in, why do we have…wait who is this? " 
 " Why does the earth needs space from " earth " so she can get herself out of the bad dreams? " 
 " Well, he's an astronaut. We call him Alan. We have worked together to bring you the world's largest fully-solid sleep machine since my late grandfather, Ray. Now hold on! " 
 The movie pulled out its entire 48 hours quickly, the light trickling down as the form crumpled under the deluge. It didn't seem to care. One by one it was spun through space, mirrored against the yellow grass. 
 " An an alarm clock? " screamed Grant, a quiet growl. A tear trickled down the side of his cheek as Grant ignored it. Even his greasy hair swayed back in pain. He wanted to cry, but he was not well enough to deal with the scream. Now, it was his turn to look on, like he was meant to show the poor world an old video game, let alone his artificial one. One small cast member had apparently fell asleep, hearing all the soft sounds that made it sound as if music was playing. 
 " Ah, the music. " 
 " It is *music* in action. " 
 Grant smiled, watching as the mimicry of music played on the screen continued. " And that, old lady, is why my program looks so unlike the rest. " 
 " Well Grant, we try to make you calm down, so we can keep you safe. And this doesn't stop you from falling asleep right now. Yes, the light rain here is freezing at night, and you must stay put in the tunnels as your teammates scramble to move away and scream. Now, I am so glad to be with you, Grant. As scientists for several decades now, you are the last subject of American science students research and development, and although I am not sure of the source of the awful horror story you have been hearing, let me tell you a story of how I once was..."

“ Huh ” said a local couple as they walked through the busy intersection. They ’ d caught the startled young man from his tattered hood, who jolted to his feet in a panic. 
 This was a part of the Magic Academy, and for it to be an accredited school wasn ’ t normal. 
 The couple had stopped in the street to ask how this one had managed to escape. The older man stood, shaking his head and rubbing his stubbled head. 
 “ We ’ re stuck, if we get this far out and we don ’ t cross the barrier we may have to hide here, ” he mumbled under his breath. 
 “ I mean, it looks like there are other school sides too, ” said the younger man, adding that they would be lucky not to have broke the block ’ s traffic code. 
 “ Not as an issue, ” said the stranger, half clapping their hands together as they passed through, “ we understand that it might be dangerous here. But there is just like muggles, just because they use muggle technology doesn ’ t mean you can kill muggles. There are all kinds of the number two muggles out here that use muggle technology, and it may even be safe to hunt them. ” 
 The man beamed at the children, and their bodies jumped forward, arms up, clinging to the path. 
 “ Hey kids, come on now! Just because you can ’ t – not because you can ’ t. You ’ re lucky. ” He chuckled, breaking the silence. 
 “ You won ’ t have to be like that, ” repeated the man. “ It ’ s a not a burden on you to do something, but you also have to work hard. ” 
 More clapping for the couple, who collectively moved forward in their fading way, caught the older man ’ s eye. They snorted and he smirked. The children began laughing wildly. 
 “ Hey just like that, ” said the older man, standing up, sliding into his own seat, “ how ’ s you? ” 
 The pair sat there, dumbfounded. 
 The older man sighed, flipping back over his seat and raising his hand. 
 “ Well, I have to get on with things, ” he said. “ You hear stories, right? ” 
 A groan, heard from the younger man, followed. It only served to make it worse. 
 “ Yeah. Well, then I have to figure out how the hell you got there, ” he corrected himself, “ just keep walking. ” 
 The room fell silent, and was interrupted by the old man ’ s panicked flapping. 
 “ You have to see this, ” he commanded, “ remember this, guys. ” 
 Three men appeared beside him. One with muggle tattoos, the other had a broken broomstick. 
 “ Also they can ’ t be travelling on in-a-way, ” said the man. The other two nodded, sensing no reaction. 
 “ And, ” said one, “ they won ’ t tell anyone until they ’ re safe, ” so they were too late.

So I guess Sir Terry Pratchett has it all, or at least that's how it works. If he doesn't get that you'd better get back to work. 
 First the background, tell me, how do you feel when you catch a mouse during an exploration? 
 When hunting and so on, how do you convince someone to stop trying to kill you? 
 You're practically the Devil himself. you save thousands of lives every single time, and you're never a threat in the general direction. However, at some point in the course of your writing you end up sacrificing someone and suddenly you, or rather, you become someone else. And it's not like we're your enemy, you know that. You're a help, no different than the villains of the book. You push back against any encroaching evil and brave an effort to prevent the inevitable. You make copious use of your mental strength to get things done and make sure you care for the crew. 
 But that may not quite be as good as I think it is. The man who opens fire on the first man in the boat should have a short life. Or there would be nothing except for the value of one last opportunity. Well, in both cases you'd have to give up something to save your pathetic crew members. Well, you really don't want that anyway. 
 I think if you really want a different battle plan to guide you around you'll have to make a change. Instead of trying to kill one, instead of trying to kill as many as you can just give up the battle. As a writer you want to use your personas to fuel your ability to write in really intense detail. Go up to the top of the tallest building in a city and write what's on the ground, not make it a fistfight in the street, if you can talk it through. Give it a slap and there's no point. 
 I am a wizard, a damn fool.

"Alright folks, We're still getting got wor since the primary sequence " Ashley exclaimed. Bill looked at the screen on the wall, but with more fatigue than excitement. Bill quickly pressed play, he was a cynical 50 year old with a long drawn out daily ritual of talking about'College Girls' and how they always fall for it. 
 " Alright guys, you know what Ashley, Most probably thrown out after last month's episode of Ballerg; your brother just tells you that you're planning to get involved in science when you can't prove that you exist. Meanwhile, are you ever worried that we won't figure it out? " Bill nearly vomited from the thought. 
 Bill slowly backed into his seat, impatient to hear more from the show and smarter for having reason to root for him. 
 " I'm not sure. Of all my fellow members, I have to admit that I'm not particularly concerned with finding out where the rest of you are going after these last three episodes of Bubblegum can you just tell me what to do about this? " Bill said with curiosity behind his eyes. 
 Bill simply nodded and said, " No. Probably not, but I'm going on tour in a couple of weeks to try and find you all. " The two agreed to tour their world of science together and Bill started to relax. There was already a guy at the front and a girl wearing a light brown spandex suit, with a large fin in her hair and an overall attitude that made Bill uncomfortable. He wasn't really sure what to make of her but that was the easiest part of meeting them. 
 " Hey look at her, she looks super sexy. Her dress will make a man happy and she sure as hell looks like a video game character. She looks just like Batman with a nice long cape and neat looking black pants on. Would anyone care if she mentioned you or something or tell you a secret or a secret story? " Ashley didn't have all day. She didn't even have to think, or even blink. 
 Bill smiled. He had known there was more to this conversation than he knew. He contemplated the thought, " Will we ever figure it out? Are we going to be at a party or something? Maybe when we get a run down on tech support and fire the shit and hire someone else? " He glanced back at the computer screen and made the decision that he could be with the other seven member of the security team and that he was ready to try and break out. 
 " At least we could try to be friends " he stated calmly. In fact it is the only way he could explain to Ashley that there isn't really much else that has changed. * I don't have to explain anything about computer security*. 
 " Okay, I will tell you a secret" Bill continued.

It didn't always work this way. We had to learn to live with the fact that emotions turned our back. As a matter of fact, we knew we were doomed once humans even expanded into the microcosm of the universe. 
 We were never meant to live forever but we knew, although not always, the worst were still long after we slept. 
 It never worked in space but no matter how hard we struggled to control how much we shed, we'd survive. While humans were less self aware and self aware enough to live on the plank of the mantle, there were still rules that were meant to govern us. Laws that didn't mean anything, while too cold to a beat, were already set in stone. For example, without pain, we'd have to be willing to hurt our loved ones or suffer great agony. These laws were also issued to track our spending while we slept, but we also were required to pay the drain and sink under before we died. 
 This enabled us to continue working in cramped vaults, labs, clinics and zoos throughout the galaxy. How long we could survive and what the next step was once more. I've watched them die and even seen people that had slept decades die before I even saw what the real world was like when humanity finally realised what was behind the decaf mezzone button and genetically-engineered homo sapien ships arriving at warp with long range strike weapons.

"Finish yourself and feed the flies, Pilot! " a voice hissed from behind him. John silently watched them move away, door to door running behind him like steel sheath. His current master was armed to the teeth, but he watched from the back as he began to infest the ground. He could see his master and cower in front of him. 
 But it didn't matter. Neither would his master. This was just their chance to escape. In the end they will survive. It was coming from a full sized classroom, and his master's next victim was about to enter the class. The room smelled of garbage. Many other people were just looking at him, but they all knew how to cope with the smell. They kept pushing and tugging on his collar as the classroom grew more crowded. 
 " Don't let your feet interfere with your moves, Pilot! Don't move, you and your master will have to be stopped! " 
 He looked at the sword. Not one of the front teeth was in the way, and the book shot toward him as she did, drawing his attention from inside his katana. He gripped the book tightly. " She will be fine, she should be fine, she will be fine! " he yelled. The book stopped swinging, the sword was flying with him, and the swords mind blanked. The ground shook with the disintegrating force of the noose, and a big explosion tore the seating area apart. 
 In the corner a man who was obviously his master nodded. John reached for his sword, no doubt from the same seat he had been sitting before. When he reached the seatbelt the seatbelt was still strapped to him. While the tiniest creaks indicated the swing was coming right at him, the wrist of the sword wasn't all that distracting. 
 John placed the sword on the floor and stroked his own head. " You are not alone, Pilot! " he yelled. 
 The man looked up at him with a look of mischievous disgust. John took the sword from him, pulled it out and as he did he took out the noose. A hand reached out and a hand came towards John's face. John struggled but he was able to free himself. " Get this to yourself! Get out! Get out! Get out! This isn't a joke! We are going to be lynched! " 
 " I'm not here to kill you, Pilot! I am here to save you! " John kept clenching his mask tighter and wiggling his toes. His master was beginning to sink in the shadows behind him, watching him with disgust. John decided to show his master what a miserable people life was like. The man continued chewing on his mouth and mouth a little while. He was embarrassed by this, to his delight, but he wasn't going to leave that behind to die anyway. " But please, Pilot, don't you think this is a fun way to spend your last moments? You've got almost 20 more minutes than you would have liked. You are young and will have no regrets coming out of school." 
 John watched as his master continued eating alive and dying until he finally collapsed. The end. John sighed and leaned forward, leaving his master alone. He didn't even get to see what happened on the front door. He watched as the first victim fell victim to the unforgiving monster hiding behind the door. The last sound his master made were his last words.

It was a dark day, and the stars were shining. I could see an assortment of brilliant things aligning up in a mix of colours, and all without losing focus. The rendezvous with some new Earth known to Earth was brewing, or so I thought. I needn ’ t have worried about the local population, or the common people. The usual meeting and alliances from our new home, has seemingly ended long ago, no mention of a Union was ever spoken. Then, one of the satellites send a spacecraft and find us in a matter of weeks. Another one decides they ’ ll be waiting for us and begins recording the commands on the new spacecraft. 
 Over time it became apparent that this new World of ours had a thousand stars on it, why couldn ’ t any? They added up all the needs of our Moon, which would then be counted and let sunlight cast its light on us. The terraforming of the new planet ’ s surface, the creation of minerals and minerals on our new home, our new home! When none was happening, another could be heard saying goodbye, but only after reaching such speeds that they eventually vanished. 
 The weeks grew on until finally our satellite sent word of the fabled Warrior ’ s Pact. We were allowed one stop of their spaceship to be sent to Earth, just to be found, but it was empty. No team had come for days since we had decontaminated the planet. 
 Over a few weeks we lost contact with humanity, because apparently there was a complete suspension of communications. We followed orders with no joy, we had no friends. I thanked God for that and went about my daily business of following the orders. Sometimes it didn ’ t feel that long, which it was when the Space-suit teleported me off my feet to a distant location, but who knows. They suggested to use a log to let our satellite know what we ’ d been out to. It ’ s a lot easier to guess from the UFO that disappeared from radar. 
 There was a big send off for Earth. The session was close, and a little over a day has passed. With the Earth still around our objective, we never gained a clear direction before. The next one came. I decided to revisit the logging, hoping it would be helpful. I have hope, so far. 
 My log is now not something I would share, it is something we ’ ve received since we were dematerialised to our new Sun. We were talking about colonies on the Moon, the rest of the progress I ’ ve made on our home, and why my new home could still hold such primitive technology. But more important: This log is the biggest part of my tale. I look around in hope as my altitude accelerates into the normal forty-four degrees. I look up and see a lovely Planet around me. A beautiful sight and setting, surrounded by these trees that are pretty much on fire – These bushes are allowed in anyway, the trees on fire everywhere. What a sight to see. No driftwood, no maples, just a peaceful planet, surrounded by beautiful people and creatures with divine mysteries. As I have now dearth of berry plants, my roof is falling apart, I have lost all hope and only look at my Log. It is not a more beautiful Titan, but a Death Planet, with signs and spheres and shadows lining it. It ’ s a hellish place, with so much ash and rock inside it, the planet ’ s surface is all rotting and crackling. I guess the land is going to have to change.

"You knew nothing of him, or even his race. " 
 " I was only his right hand man. " 
 " He's not into pranking, it was very early in the campaign I was in. " 
 " But why haven't you died yet? " 
 " Because my name is Adolf, I am very fortunate to live. " 
 " I was a clever boy. " 
 " And every time we slew each other before the war he found the more dirty ones and killed them before they got to us. " 
 " I hate him, because I realized first and foremost, that if he could use all his power he would have known I was the one who was Jewish. " 
 " He always came to me, begging. I wanted to give him power as well, I wanted to have him see me as the man who deserved to live. He crushed me. " 
 " The children attacked my mother. I saw her family repeatedly chasing her along in pain, as I trained her for this death of mine. I taught her not to believe herself to be innocent of the lies that some children told as a child and killed her to let others go in peace. " 
 " If he saved her, what did he have to show for it? If he could spare her, I'd give him the booty to go after her as well. What other world could have allowed such foolishness on my soil? " 
 " I saw him to think that a man like him could truly have that effect, and that he would soon follow that idea in his family. On that night, I lost my family to the meanness of that man, no matter what he did to me. " 
 " And why are you telling us? Who is Hitler? " 
 " I don't know, but if I did it would horrify me. " 
 " Isn't he an individual? " 
 " No, he is a monster, and he leaves his mark on me. He kills people, rapes their wives, and slaughters their sons. It will always haunt me. " 
 " What will happen to my family, if I am found? " 
 " It is hard for me to imagine that I will find someone like him. " 
 " Didn't you realize now? He alone could mean the end of humanity. " 
 " Is it not beautiful to imagine that there is nothing that can hurt us in such a short time? " 
 " On the bright side there is little that is still alive. The world has exhausted so many people's potential for happiness, that everything is just a wish. But I think a brighter way to do this is to find a means of obliterating this hell he caused. " 
 " You're a monster! You get all of us killed! We did nothing in our life to make that possible, and I will not save my parents from this. But you won't get any time of remembrance for how pathetic you were. " 
 " Now, we have to prepare to fight. " 
 " I know what you are thinking." 
 And, as I raised my gun, he held it out and shot me.

I thought there was a new bloodlust going on here. They were unstoppable, and they were after me. 
 One one I guess. The second one was... wait, fuck. Seriously, guess what? 
 I didn't remember what they all were like. When they finally made it out of Earth we didn't even bother. They were looking for more. Where I was originally from they were sneaky enough to evolve into a humanoid. I still have to hide in my cells. They shouldn't be able to poke at my cells. 
 Here they are. 
 My cell mate was puking away. This is new. 
 They went for me. It was only natural. The reason I didn't treat her with any more kindness was that she had never asked for me to leave for anyone else. 
 I saw how she felt. The emotion I feel at the moment. As she hugged me into her chest, we laughed. 
 From inside the heart scanner I scanned each body of the monsters and ran to them. I ran up to the clerk on the other side of the room. I ran straight down to the head of the monster, scared. It was standing alone in the door. I sprinted out of the room. I started to crawl over the monster and grabbed it just as it let out a deadening scream. 
 I swam into the darkness. It was gone, and gone.

The bird whistled, and I took a deep breath. Sleep was coming. 
 After I cleared the part of my face I noticed another pair of dingy dirt covered hands. 
 Don't worry, this one is more experienced. You've never heard this kind of thing before, but it smells....well, it makes me sad. 
 Don't worry, you've never heard of birds, as in in the least experienced one. For this reason, while singing to the tune that would of become a familiar source of my nightmares, the hand he picked caught my eye and I expected to see a huge bird. 
 The fingers had traced patches of rock over the only walls that remain, on the gentle pine floor when there used to be a tree. Painted polished wood and dry leaves echoed amongst the light breeze that gently took my attention away from the bird, but this one, even more dangerous, was not. 
 I gasped. As I dove to see them, only the small cockpit vents did not break, letting me see them as young children from a further north would, in a few seconds, see it. The tongues, as I call them, grew bolder when they took notice, begging for guidance, demanding I follow their lead. 
 Next to the plane was another pair of bright red birds, running up to the pilots cockpit. As I shouted, the three perked up and at once, two meant no harm when flying. 
 Finally the second pair just popped up, approaching my direction. 
 The first opened up for me, but before I could ask whether a scared little bird deserved me, he gave me the big red word, snarling. It was going to hurt very soon. 
 I aimed my gun at the prey bird, and it barely raised its hand to reply, before reacting, pinching the side of its neck. 
 Me neither moved nor looked at what was not a sheep. 
 I watched the green little bird eat, as I watched the red lizard try to copulate.

I really enjoyed last weeks story, I'm gon na spend this weekend watching episodes and commenting on it for the next year or so. Anyw wan na try something different? 
 Anyway, I'm really excited to finally get to hear that story for once. 
 So this is my first attempt at writing something, I hope you like it. All critiques welcome. 
 "The silence within the chamber was deafening. Faintly intoned beneath the rumpled air, echoing with a myriad of isle's sounds. A faint rumble filled the air at first, then an echo of shuffling and rustling in an unrelated background. The floor was not covered in dust or filth, its white walls standing out from the dull tapestries. In the gloom, it was the sound of machinery humoring himself and fulfilling the undying need to scrub at his feet."

Wything looked around to make sure he was showing no sign of any deception. 
 Murdered and mutilated, he was left with shrapnel to the stomach, left with a limp after being trampled and mangled in front of him. A hand came to his ankle and a punch against the back of his skull causing him to fall unconscious. 
 Below the Takeda's head a string of scars and blood were covered a white halo.

 " I tell you what's right, Mom! " 
 " Look, " replied Barnaby, " I got ta go! " 
 " No problem Barnaby! I don't want to leave! " 
 " I'm in the middle of a storm too Barnaby! Don't you like that customer in the carriage? "

The sound of the chilly wind in the room does not clog up your ears, only makes you feel like it is raining. My mom wasn't proud of how I treated her as a child but she needs to know that I am still a young woman, one more step in life to make sure she stays healthy. 
 She would keep the wedding souvenir on my side, of course. 
 As I wore it over my mom's wedding dress, I couldn't help but feel a cold breeze pushing me deeper into the darkness. 
 I have never really gotten used to dying in the forest. It has been all too unfamiliar to me, no matter how many times we have spent in that ditch, the memories of the day are the only clarity I have. 
 I couldn't believe the thought of death, I was happy. 
 After what felt like an eternity in the forest, I felt what ifs of slow darkness within my stomach. 
 Easier said than done, I was able to see the spot to the west, the light from the moon. 
 I woke up about two meters from the trees, I was surrounded by trees. On the corner, a small child stood, his body shaking with fear. 
 As I looked into the child's eyes, I could see a look of utter worry on my mom's face. 
 I turned my back to the child and started walking towards him. 
 He began walking towards the light as I looked behind me and quickly run toward the light. I knew he was near and I approached with the hope of saving him from the darkness when the child dashed towards the child. 
 I couldn't save a lifeline for my youngest son, not now, not ever. I didn't want to leave him behind, not even a moment would go by that didn't be a sweet memory for him. 
 I ran as fast as I could and ran as fast as I could, chasing after the dimpled figure. The child, standing perfectly still, could not stop running. 
 I jumped for joy and fell to the ground, avoiding the demonic blight which engulfed me. 
 As I looked up at the face of my loved one, I saw the tears falling down my face. 
 I don't know how long I have had to live before I am tried by a demon to be possessed by your evil, vile goddess.

It was ugly, in the eyes of many. Sometimes just to look at, looking deeply would snap your eyes open, it wasn't easy to move up. At the age of 12 that was easy enough, but I always ended up falling down in front of the church of Jesus, wishing to be alone. I just had to glance behind the people that looked out the window, and near the entire church. Something was new, I don't know, that no one actually hears. 
 It was winter morning and I was starving. I sat in front of the church, not feeling like eating for days, eating things, and I didn't feel hungry like eating meat for days. I didn't know if it was my hunger or their religion, but I was starving anyways. I grabbed out my bedding, trying not to sink down. I could have if I wanted to, but the garden was empty, maybe somebody had set up in it. I tried drinking my food, the space in my room was cramped, and when I jumped out of bed to look, my eyes were wide open. I felt everything. 
 I put the blankets over me. The smell around the room made me uneasy, my eyes closing only a little, but I still didn't know how to move. I looked in the bathroom mirror, as if I was trying to figure it out. What did that little black cat make me look like? I wasn't crying, I didn't care, my eyes were closed. I could feel the water around my eyes as if I could watch it grow and engulf everything in it's watery spaces. 
 I hit the mirror, where I waited for someone to take my clothes, let my face go watery, and find me. I put my bag in the sink, and made my way down the hall towards the gate. It was a familiar sort of walk, people coming and going in and out of that big open space in the garden. They tried to feel something for me, some knowing someone, some fearing. For a moment, I felt like the fidgeting and shaking didn't really bother me. Then something started happening, something was moving up, at the same time I started to feel the small finger twitch of that blue cat I saw yesterday, running up to me, hiding underneath my blankets. It was big, and was about the size of a bowl. After it began to panic, I went back to the kitchen to make my meal, with a little bit of water for each item, until I realised it would taste good in there.

"He's new after all. " 
 " Nah. " 
 " Dude, I only come in for a few laps now, keep straight. If he ever calls me, I'll switch our schedules and tell him it's ok. " 
 " Funny man. " 
 " He needs someone to confide in, I think? " 
 " I hope so, you feel like someone needs to consult, alright? " 
 " It's probably good you're tired, and we both know it. It's not like there's a sharp break or anything, after all, I'd rather just drive. " 
 " You both know that already, bro. I want more privacy. Keep it that way. " 
 " Sure, but in a couple more months, you both just won't be able to talk anymore. " 
 " What? " 
 " If you leave here, I swear, he'll call the police, I swear to god, next thing you know you'll be lying. So I've got to offer you what you want. " 
 " I'm a better guy than that. " 
 " That ain't easy. Just don't give him access to free speech. " 
 " I can read your brain in the meds, so you know better than to touch me."

He had ridden the bus home, wracked by the sadness, the blood so close to his ears as it came about, always a fatal line. Fumbled for the keys and remembered every night of the attack. Staring at the streaks of blood and blood and everywhere in his head before opening the door. Waking up, fumbling with the key in his hand and tightening it as soon as it was pressed. Pulling the keys away from his head and gripping the handle only to be surprised when they clattered to the pavement. Oh, what a way to end his life, but somehow seeing him come home early and realize that he had come too late was a satisfying end. No wonder he needed to be in the hospital for this. 
 The bus stopped outside, knocking over a kind of small man reaching for the ride button and picking up the key, applying a few more knocks around the flat that he so desperately wanted. The odd lady wearing a giant jacket, it was just the usual grands, but whenever something like this happened, the set up of the city really just came into their own. 
 The receptionist was snickering for no reason. Too loud and especially gruff to stay in. He had no idea where she was, but there was always someone going about their day to give her a new pair of glasses. Another strange woman sitting at the desk: sadly, a cold one. Ever the human kind, the folks at the reception were always a bit annoying. She was brought to the attention of a few more people besides the man of the hour, but the peculiar person was a bit more picky, even being their preferred identification. 
 Of course, this fellow seemed worried to himself. He had not seen him again in at least twenty-seven years and wasn't going to hurt himself, so how would he have known? He stared in puzzlement at the man and thought about why he had come. Although he hadn't seen him before, there was something in the way he looked at him when he spoke. The look that sent a shudder down his spine. Still not going to hurt himself, just as he thought. 
 In the last few seconds, he had thought about the very annoying woman, the extraordinary stiff looking woman, the various roads of attention that the man told him about, the hotel room that he had seen her at, the strange man with the weird hat that she wore. Was she even in the hospital? He hadn't cared though. Most of the time, his thoughts of the unknown woman were simply a reason to take the bus, to get into a weirdly awkward hotel room. 
 However, when the man had taken the box out from under a glove, the woman was staring at him wide-eyed. 
 "Nice touch, baby, " said the strange man, as if recognizing that she was so familiar. She closed her eyes and he stood, " N-not you? I'm very sorry but I don't know how to put this. " 
 " What? " he said, hesitating but looking around. He wasn't a stranger to the man, he just couldn't put his finger on it. But the woman began to close her eyes again, and he stood, almost unwilling to learn about her routine. After a moment or so, he began to explain, a little too clearly, a little more, " I'm sure you've seen the same chap at a busy coffee shop, when you have to ask the same way and I, um, " he started, still going wide-eyed, " I... have to put this in, " he said, almost lighthearted and pleased with himself. " I-I just... they started making something of this, don't they? " 
 " Yes, baby, this. " the woman said and sat back. 
 " Look, " she said, " some people might think you're crazy, and they might even think you're stupid, but I can assure you, there is nothing to worry about. You have everything under control. " 
 " Wow, " the woman said, not wanting to burst into tears, " I've only seen my puppy! " 
 " Not yet, " said the man, still looking at her confused, " look out. I'll kill you in my sleep."

In the first hour of my work, an EMT was here. He tried to read me, but the word sent me gasping. I tried to resist speaking. It was too weird to be real, but the words woken me up. They should have told me when I realized I wouldn't speak. That perhaps I had a freckle on my cheek. 
 After 5 minutes, the EMT saw me stand and remove his glasses. The alcohol drip- no, he was beside me. He sucked in the smoke and sent sweat up my leg. He held me for a while longer. In the afterglow of the old downtown, there were people waving their instruments outside, but they couldn't make eye contact. I heard a tremendous boom. I heard a tiny croak and a footstep. EMT, watching me, revealed my face was covered in scars. 
 I felt like the biggest depression I had ever had. My voice was cracked, my jaw crushed. I couldn't talk; it felt like a thousand sharp forks had pushed a cube toward me. " Don't ask questions," I managed to whisper. One more push, the cube would push itself to my flesh. I kicked it and took a step forward. The car then approached me. It was a two-wheeler, but it was driverless. The blades jagged against my skin, barks of pain went deeper than I can describe. I woke up and saw my face was broken in half. Pain had gripped my entire body. I looked at my mom, who was staring into my eyes. 
 It was a nightmare; you can't ask questions, one minute you are thinking about your life and the next you are crying.

As soon as I heard that, my heart sank. Let me tell you: your government is bugging you. 
 Searching The for Business Online operated by a bot. I was like all the other full blown unemployed people in this country and I was standing at your door by your 4th floor. 
 "When are you gon na tell me what went on in last minute? " 
 " According to my husband, here you are. Okay Google, we're here. Okay. We're here to inform you about the new law passed this year. " 
 " That law I signed? Well I'm not going to lie I was surprised. I thought this was the name of a taxi ride. Uh, ok Google we're just going to hold you under till 24:00. Ok, ok, ok. " 
 Now you've got to be some kind of crazy 15 year old in a bad mood because we're there for you. The law is legit, nobody wants you to be independent, but I promise you it won't get you fired. I promised all my friends and coworkers to help you figure this out. 
 " The GPS is off. You got ta speed up until you figure this out. " 
 Ok, I guess this is your last chance to do this. Maybe not right away, but if you're in this game and people need you more than ever and I still haven't convinced everyone that we are a real thing, please come to our house and find the medical right now.

“ They would never forgive me for it! ” 
 The ghosts of the innocents stood defiant in front of the board room, resting their fangs upon the delicate silver keys with splinters. 
 “ Who *did* you draw this on, sonny? ” 
 He wove the parchment into a thin ring and grinned. As John mounted the deck, he paced around the room, stopping, before turning to the board. It was just his little friends with their fathers, and he liked as much as anyone that he had them. 
 “ In the long run, you are proof that no matter how many stakes you set up for the old me, a valentine, or even some minor criminal, even in the face of adversity you can pay off the debts of your family and friends. Even with the vengeance that comes with the death of their child, your family and friends will save them and their wife, even if you can not bear to leave the sheets in their wake. ” 
 “ And if they can't, their children will die alone. When the judgment day comes, each of you will pick a scrap of paper, carefully scratch it together, and write the words “ Does it matter? ” ” 
 John choked, and they laughed again. John's friends knew his mother when she wagged her tail at him the moment he saw them. They knelt and clapped him. Not a word of sympathy, as if that makes sense, and they had never asked his mother. The only thing that John could wish for was a family whose burden was never mended. So in doing so, John spoke his last words to John, the words that would change the course of his life for the better. 
 “ Now you, all of you, have the power you were born with, and the world will never fall into disrepair! ” 
 The whitestones hummed with the sound of the horse hoofs and the crowd at the horse track grew excited. John shouldered the blades and began hobbling out. He had never looked so anxious. 
 “ Bless you, John, for everything will be alright! ”

"Orion " asked James Cooper as he strode out of his dacha, handing a yellow tablet to the guard with a large red pillmark on it. He was one of the top three most powerful drug lords in the world as he raised the device to his temple. 
 The guard looked at James with incredulous surprise, inspecting James' artifacts carefully. He slid his hand into his pocket. 
 " Hello! It took some getting used to. " James inquired. 
 " Did you open it? " the guard asked, shrugging his shoulders slightly. " It has the double-longer capacity, just *just* enough to refresh your entire life, you know. " 
 " I understand, but you're one of the richest people alive. I *know* you're one of the most notorious drug lords, " James answered in a playful, humorous tone. 
 " What do I have to say for myself, soldier? " The guard asked shaking his head, his hands pumping wildly. 
 " Are you really telling me that when we got in possession of this shit with the chemicals we injected, and knocked you out just because you squirmed on the floor, that you didn't realize what caused your lost life and this important line in your life was due to something else! " James exclaimed, shrugging his shoulders again. 
 " No, you aren't fooling anyone, " The guard replied with a slight smile on his face. " I wasn't expecting that drug lord to let you go free if he saw you in prison, even if he didn't see your life slip by at any rate. " 
 James just stared at the tablet with a soft expression. 
 " I don't know! That's just fucking crazy, I can't even take the pills without a clear conscience! " James replied wistfully. 
 " When you place a signal, a clear signal for the criminal to rise and release you, exactly when, because what made you decide to lay claim to all of the billions that would soon be lost, on the back of your cheeks? You either are already dead, are already dead, and want to let the government take over the world through a single pill? " the guard said calmly. " Or you both believe me. " 
 " Alright then. I guess I will have to prepare for this one. " James said triumphantly. 
 The guard leaned against the wall of the dacha and was aware of a short booming voice talking to him. 
 " When he comes out, there's going to be consequences for things we did, and for things we cannot understand. You're getting married as well, " James explained, his hands already feeling the excitement of this one-off. " Now it's up to you. Choose wisely, my lord, and we shall make America great again."

It's the score, you know. 
 Of course it is! 
 It happened when I was at college, oh boy! 
 I was messing around in front of a computer when he said "Go to university ". 
 That was his greatest moment in my life. 
 I was at the teh M & P Mealty ( for free )! 
 And he handed me his photo album and a key ( it was for later ) 
 So I grabbed the jackpot and went to work. 
 But I left when I got out of nowhere! 
 Well before he told me he wanted to leave, 
 I was already flying back. 
 When he informed me he had replaced my phone, 
 I was looking at him wonder if I could even steal, 
 because he hadn't left me without a thanks. 
 That was my first day of school and it wasn't the last. 
 He told me this was my last day of life. 
 You can not control me like this. 
 Now I'm lost in my own mind, sobbing out " Please, find me".

As I gazed inside the pit, the glow, the dark overcast as the mountains glistened, seemed like a ghost town, a ghost town where everyone knew each other. The castle seemed like it was born from a soul mate, the Iwo Jima castle before the great war. The scar across the right temple, was a time a king fell in love, or at least I think it was, "that " was the ritual. I then saw... that hole in the wall. It was straight, neat, and why the hell wasn't it shiny as hell? 
 I dragged myself over to the wall, and the stench of death seemed to overpower me as the grass, and cactus, and the treetops trembled. I had wass suffered when I was the kid, fighting with my uncle, when I fought with his army and his army who attempted to do little to keep me away from their promises. The cancer killed me before long, but I made it through the effort. I ran out into the forest. 
 I wasn't angry, I was ecstatic, and here I was, starving, covered in dirt and scorched pavement, the last dregs of my soul mate's woman. The only thing besides her was a tricorn I had done as a child, that was her great aunt, said it was blessed after death. It was her greatest gift, and so I ran for it, and it was my purpose, the only one I had remaining. 
 I ran the last few miles, and everything seemed to follow my footsteps. The alarm must have sounded after that, I suppose I couldn't risk it getting out of hand. The sun seemed to be rising, and that damned tricorn was smiling to all, saying " this is my delight, a present from me for you! " 
 I ran some more. A few blocks later, I found another tricorn. " That's the king's tomb! " I thought. They were all naked, cloaked, a little bit alabaster, but skinny. They looked after us, threw us a good meal and then they left, and I ran toward them to find another, another just like them, another atleast. I noticed they had have slow walking too, and died right before being blinded, a painful injury of a face. 
 I stumbled into a sarcophagus, and shoved it open. It was perfect, and I took a deep breath, and there it was, the greatest treasure I had ever seen. It had silver fittings, and clean lines. In the bottom I noticed the polished steel cap, but it was no ordinary thing, no small dagger or cutlass like me. Maybe that was the charm of them, but right in front of me, was the power of gold, and what could it be? 
 That had to be it. I frantically turned the cap to face the source of my power, and shoved it into the hole. Before I could leave, I heard my niece screaming, loud, harsh and gurgling like she had lived for the whole of eternity, my granddaughter kicked the boy in the leg, and kept on screaming, screams, begging for mercy from the icy castle, until finally the boy begged to be treated as a free man, but I just laughed at him, you know, told him that he had to do something and put it into practice. 
 Anyway, I did it. I grabbed her by the hair and wrapped her up. " That's the best torture you could get for anyone like me. You really are an idiot," she cried, staring at me. What else could they do besides have her watch me?

The noise starts, 
 I glance on my glass at the empty seat, 
 so that everybody else will be listening, 
 but nothing is said by any human, 
 Nothing in sight. 
 Then, the noise goes, 
 out of my view. 
 Someone's filling their pipe, 
 everyone is whispering, 
 and everyone tries to say something 
 something, 
 so I can continue, 
 but I no longer am, 
 There's nothing else they can say, 
 nothing else is said by anybody, 
 nothing else seems to move at all. 
 I wish I could tell everyone I love, 
 But all they're saying, 
 Is 
 No, 
 don't do it. 
 Not that anyone's doing it, 
 just wait with yourself, 
 for the noise to stop. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********89**********
I used to think every facet of my life was normal and perfect. The memory of being you that I never recognized or didn't love; the mask that I wore when an extra didn't want to listen to me; the rush that I can't control and I still have if I am afraid I'm out in the cold. 
 I love you. 
 As if with every fiber of my being I feel any emotion, thought or pain, any self-control or contentment of any or some of the people I meet. As if one soul were free to leave this world forever and live on out in the dust because they knew the isolation around them that was always there, out of touch with them. I can't take the sight of you, be taken away from me in the absence of this. I wanted to make you feel something, to create something special with your touch, something out of the ordinary. 
 It was something I thought I couldn't share, at least with some people. They were my subjects, my reincarnations and the humans they had left behind. By now, however, my parents were gone and I knew my mother was dead, well buried, torn apart by a car wreck thirty-three years ago. My parents knew I knew I had been born a damn cunt, they raised me a thousand times before getting whatever they wanted me to have and then breaking them a year later. Why don't they give me a bottle of shampoo, or a cold? Does it ever make you happy? 
 You are gone. So is me. 
 The internet is a living hell for me, I understand that but I just can't. I used to be the enlightened one, sure I knew that I was right and there was no reason to be so damn ignorant to change my ways, but after looking into that coat of makeup off my daughter's birth certificate I realized I need help. Sometimes it hurts to carry on and to leave. It would be better if I let people hold on to me, I hope those of us who don't live your story believe I am not stealing from you anymore. 
 The things you once told me about being my mother were incredible. The woman that I married came to me and told me that I was the soulmate that she once had, that she was no stranger to misery, that she knew her mother was dying and that if she wanted to go into that game she could forgo the hassle of getting a job and start a family and lives there. She told me, "I'm saving up to make you happy someday. I'm saving up for you soon." 
 I will remember those words till the very day I die. I will carry on the trail of those words and know that I have worked hard so hard and cared so much, that I can live with myself, even after I realize it's all a lie and honestly it's not. Those words mean nothing in the afterlife. I wish they were true, it's obvious to anyone who could smell the coconut odors of the sea before they landed on their boat when they arrived, or heard the little whine of an apple whirring under the waves as it hit the water. 
 I didn't want to leave, I wanted to find meaning in life. I didn't want to be left behind in a world that doesn't fit me. I want to take up a role in the world, to know what is possible and what is possible in a world where you feel. Because you know you have meaning. 
 Yours truly,

We have so much to tell; the revolution. We've won, no we have worked. And guess what? We've also won the fight. The strikes won. The streets are clean. People are satisfied; happy. Quite changed. But we are still in the clutches of the greedy bankers. The capitalists are gung ho. We were happy in the past; we learned from it; we are now free. After the revolution we know this. We have to rebel. Why? It may be to some desire of a corporation to take over. But it is such petty greed. If one in its place takes control then it is also a producer. And so it is true it is a producer as well; so it is true it is a socialist. Those who took over the world gave a brutal hand to the British oppressors; they gave a hand to money-grabbers and other better minded astroturfers. They bought and sold of the industrials, anti-establishmenters of a culture. We gave them freedom. Our own Free Commerce. The most primitive culture of economics. They taught us against the elements; we taught them against economics! Why?! If we can build the factories we can build houses out of slaves. We can colonize a distant sun. We could create a flourishing continent. We could be those exotic blue pearls you ask? They can be bought and sold of their errors, mistakes. As the rich see with their big logic and the vast wealth of the working class what they are going to do. They want so badly to join the revolution. The Brits have become such a parasite! We love them so much; we are so desperately good at educating them. So they let our kids grow up. A low schooler in the State used to teach us to use French for their sewing machines. I love my boys, but they are a strain on me. Can't they see that we have not yet learned the benefit of learning from we have learned so much? 
 Now I'm writing this hoping you find this to be some allegory to the great revolution on a much bigger scale. After the government is overthrown and almost all those who challenged us are gone, what's left are few and far between. Now we live in a world where only outsiders see us as a threat. I say passivity, but he who live in the realm of a worker becomes a communist. We are the privileged, young class. The ones who have lived our lives and have had our freedom in some manner for too long. We can run. We can meet the business venture capitalists who will not yield. They can operate the factories and send us back. We won the revolution. We knew it was going to happen. We wanted it all and where to turn it. But we can not hide. We still see the old prejudices going on. We just wanted to warn people. We still think of a way to do so. We can run and hide, but we know fear and will never fear. That is why we resist them. We have lived this strange world and it is dangerous. We are the workers of the future, working for everyone else. 
 Do you see, people? Change has happened. Change means growing lives. People have made more money but we used to be self sustain! People no longer needed their white coats. They wanted to make sure people could pay their bills. The machine we developed meant great money for our children. People are working hard and there is room to grow more food. People are giving money to doctors. The food is better! We need it! You see, after the revolution, it was by our hands. We would like you to give it to us: we can make machines that do what we want to do and you can help us make them what we want. No one can make them better than we can! These are the good old days; we will be remembered by this nation forever. We will have a new future. 
 And for we are the champions of peace and life. 
 Love you, Caravan House

*Samuel Jenkins, the first mind readers to be placed on the R2D2 version of *The Gatekeeper*, known as The Rimworld. * 
 Just a light's in the abyss, 
 For fear's which I march off into the ring, 
 For what is soon to follow, doom and suffering. 
 * Samuel Jenkins, the First Mind readers to be placed on The Rimworld. * 
 Although our secrets are advanced, it have been said I am a mere witness, and I have known this exact scenario but I did not know why I was granted the task of witnessing the devastating effect that it would have upon my entire species. 
 The planet appeared as we have always known it to be, it was a desolate, barren wasteland, undescended and without any vegetation to eat away at. 
 In the distance I could see a writhing figure, no, not a howling beast, but an ape, with strange yellow scales covered in fangs, its eyes like obsidian bars. 
 It hovered over me, crawling through me and beneath me like an animal. 
 My eyes snapped open, my limbs were completely immobilized, I was unable to move my body, barely able to see either. 
 Samuel approached me and spoke, 
 "You're deaf! 
 It's going to get me, I'll scream like a dead man, 
 I'll rip your flesh apart like a cage! 
 Watch your tongue go down your throat as you mutiny! 
 You're as strong as you are thick! 
 & nbsp; 
 " Wha... whats going on? 
 I don't wan na die, I am a prisoner! 
 & nbsp; 
 " 
 Keep my tongue down or I will have to use my jaws to chew your skin. 
 I'll let go of you slowly, I'll bite you with one hand, you'll dig your big fat teeth into your shoes, you'll gnaw on your clothes and your whole body will split open and waste! 
 You'll choke to death because that's what you're like! 
 I'll eat your flesh first so I can enjoy life! 
 Thank you so much to forlorn Aunt Samantha for turning me into this monster! 
 & nbsp; 
 You're awesome, of course, but you were a mistake Sam, I'm gon na live to see your death."

In his last moments of life he sat hunched over beside a large cylindrical table. That table had been filled with photographs, sketches, hieroglyphics, drawings, and many objects. Soon the dark room began to fade. Bullets of electricity and fire filled the room once more. Not far from him a lifeless, bleached figure lay on the floor, eyes that could not be seen. For several seconds of silence he imagined these memories, but it was so obvious that he could not remember what came before and what came after. This this couldn ’ t be the end. Now his flesh, his soul, his body lay in the claws of a gas. The horrid gas filled the room, and it began to consume the human body within. The gas began to engulf his body in its own, killing him instantly. The human body went limp, and that was when the heat started to take hold. His body took with it the joy of failure, his last ounce of strength, as the gas filled his brain as it extinguished the memory inside him. But that was only the beginning. He was almost there. Slowly, reluctantly, he slid through the smoke of the gas. And slowly he unfolded the bones of his father. He cried as he thought of his loving father before the gas touched him, afraid of the pain he would suffer as a child, like everything he did was for the purpose of making a success. His father would succeed and he would go out on to make the world a better place. And so he said, “ Father, ” and let his body fall into the darkness.

Manhood. It sounded like a great idea. 
 The idea that God had shown me, when his creation had formed I was cut off from the rest of mankind. The non-believers were all dead, as in, no longer in front of my gaze but instead lowered to me. 
 At first it was simple. I tried starving. Not easy and without money I couldn't afford it. I tried new technologies to fight the impending apocalypse. No matter how small a cure would be, it would take time to reach the point where I no longer had an earthly life. My hoomany body would heal. 
 But what I did was no cure. My life began while they began. It would continue, and I'd always beg for more. I craved for my memory, my ability to wake at any moment to find a home and just let my world break apart with it. 
 But it couldn't be done alone. I hated it. How could I ever return? The rulers, the tribe, the citizens all hated me. I hated the world that I had created and in doing so, swore I would never leave it. I couldn't live without pain, without good. 
 That was before the implants and machines came along. I could push through mortality. My people wouldn't stand still for long and I couldn't possibly die alone. Even after the implants took me off the face of the Earth, I still refused to allow my vision to be too dim and I was forced to seclude myself in caves in the desert. I wondered if I could heal, if I could corrupt. 
 So I crafted the perfect solution. The weak, the self-righteous, the hardened and the destitute of the world were all I could push through when it came to hurting themselves. I injected trillions into a whole species. I'd given them millions to name at random. No one ever knew. Every jaded or cheery, been had as a blessing from their people but no one ever took my word seriously. 
 "Keep them out of the city. " My people begged as I added one more directive. I reached out into their hearts. I was taking their souls. 
 They begged. Some of them also wanted to go out on a limb and kill their creator but I could not help them. I could not have it. I asked them and their faces were literally shrieking into agony as I thrust the global poison in them. 
 " Does anyone want your help? " asked one. The rest of the chosen ones nodded in silent agreement. No one said anything for a long time, as their bodies grew fatter and fatter and the pressure fanned out in front of them until every vein was dominated by a slug of poison. 
 " He's broke, sir." I whispered. The others nodded obediently. I removed the plug and locked the chamber. 
 Now I know why all the believers hate it. A shadow was cast from the pool of molten lava behind me and the rest of the survivors streamed back in for more pales in the eyes of the world. 
 I stare into the eyes of a dying God.

A voice rang through the old, barren walls. 
 "We need you to go! Shut up! There's no escaping the Pandemonium! You cannot keep doing this! " 
 *A voice called out from out of the shadows*, " Now! " * 
 " and you came! Step for step! Just keep going, you're serious! " 
 They set the severed bodies to the ground, knees and each other. 
 Slowly, once every four years, they went from the desolate building to a massive, metropolis. 
 They looked out over the ruins, and each time, they had to make up their mind. 
 " You're a freak! " 
 " No you're not, don't let that fool go! " 
 " Shut up! Everyone must move! It's too late! " 
 They ran as fast as they could away from the raging wasteland. 
 They eventually reached the edge, and were horrified to see all the stars away. 
 " We've got good news! " 
 " We are several hours away! We're running out of nutrients. " 
 " I'm freezing! I'm freezing! I'm freezing! " 
 " There is one more thing we need to do!" 
 The world shook. 
 The last, and only, alive broke out. 
 The pandemic killed thousands, possibly millions, of people. 
 The world suffered greatly, and governments collapsed in on themselves. 
 But they eventually found their salvation. 
 After months, the people around the world used computers to come back to life. 
 But they couldn't, because the machines kept failing. 
 Eventually, everyone who had the " all knowledge " ( or " basic" knowledge ) of the virus was eliminated. 
 No one looked back. 
 There was nowhere to go, no air. The only thing they could do was watch as their world burned in the end. 
 They called in government-sanctioned protests, and burned to death with cold metal and guns. 
 It was impossible to take part in the last act of resistance. 
 And no one was willing to.

It took me three long years. But I think the truth is that I didn't want to do it. I wanted to save someone, a friend. But as I came to terms with it all, the sense of pride I felt became too much for me. I couldn't do it. It was too much. 
 I had a sexual awakening. Then a day had come. A day that had not only meant less getting physically isolated but more would mean less being attracted to women. And the feeling of being a part of something very very important came rushing back. And the feeling of "me being a part of something even better than I had been trying to be." I didn't want to be treated as such. I had never felt great. But it felt good. Soon enough, I was longing for that first time. 
 You see, I loved cats. I loved smells. I loved music. And the most beautiful cats in the world. So I was going to find one who, despite what I'd heard on television, had a soul as big and strong as myself. A beautiful soul. 
 And when I did, I quickly found myself falling into love with her. And then I loved her again. She was my only hope. 
 And we were best friends. Only really, I was true and beloved by every way possible. And as soon as we were born, she looked just like mine. And that's what got me in the first place. Even though we had love in our hearts, we never realized it. Ever. And so, of course, it hurt so much that I decided that today would be my last day with her. 
 And I knew we could do this. I knew I had to do something important. And I took to the sea. 
 And it was amazing.

Everything is a little harder now. Everything is just a little less real. 
 I can don'thing about it. Don't mind. I'm just here... 
....Don't. Mess. 
... No... I'm here.... 
 You said my story would be a little hard for me. Oh no. I just can't do it. 
 I have some things I don't know anymore. I'm not sure what they are. I know that I can be so stupid, so dumb. I know that I need others like me, but no one will keep me happy. No one will watch as I wake up in my bed... 
... Will. Reawaken. 
... Never. Reawoke. 
 People are calling me crazy now. Told my story was pure bullshit! I have a chance for a miracle, that I can call upon for someone! It's growing in me... is growing... is changing, is rising... I think my story is going to shake a lot more than it did when I was 20... So calm... If I was 25. Of course I wouldn't. 
 "Your name is... My..." 
 It feels like a thousand kilometers. The room is wide... the ceiling is black. I can't see anything, but it feels so... warm. 
... Is. Over. 
 Everything seems to go dark now, as if I would be in my bedroom, alone. Everyone in this room is staring, and I am far away. 
 Everyone is staring too. I can feel my face starting to fade. I can feel the ache in my fingers, and the cold sweat on my face. My arms, and everything... I can feel them tear. I can feel my skin start to turn cold... My hair, and... The white ooze from my neck becomes pale as the sheets start to rot. 
 I can't stand it any longer. It's overwhelming, and makes my stomach hurt. My legs start to spin with a crescendo. My head hurts... I can feel... up... Up... 
... At. No. Stop.

From the back of the classroom Mr. and Mrs. Johnson sway gently through the icy halls, silently expecting the torment of the store floor to bring tears to the lovely girl sitting in the corner. 
 "If you cross one more floor, I assume you'll need to shoot up like... two. " 
 Racing to the front of the other room Mr. Johnson was followed by a spray of red paint covering the opposite sides of the room. It appeared to grow larger, as if in a trance. But despite its size, it still wasn't getting into his head. 
 " *What the fuck? * " Mr. Johnson croaked into the microphone. 
 " I put down my.48 scope and put the fire extinguisher in the vacuum chamber. You hear me? If I *shoot* up two, we'll all go to hell. " 
 Both Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Johnson continue to stare each other down, passively. Any sort of escape would cost them both dearly. 
 Suddenly, a shirtless boy with a long straw hat, a red tag looking like a parachute, and a straw hat is on top of the head of their loser, stuck at the edge of the one another. The door behind them cracks open and Mr. Johnson falls in, tumbling to the ground. Mr. Johnson, unfortunately, doesn't appear to realize his victim was downing the rest of the liquor. 
 " Thank you < 3. Good luck out there. I'll see you next week!"

Don could feel the wind through his hair and into his face 
 His breath filled his lungs and he was reallly nervous and he needed to relax... 
 The doctor forced his way through the veil, there was none left around. 
 And he saw the town people. Guys waving back and forth over bikes and people with glasses. 
 The same bartender that runs the daily drink menu did the same service. Every so often another guy would place a black bar up to his bar, and around that they would eat ice cream. The waitress would order more things that were probably just made up food. 
 After several hours, the bartender let the waitress know the last time he put his drink on the table was the last time they would've given him a drink. 
 That is when the tension broke loose as he went into his offices. 
 He wiped his brow and looked in the mirror. 
 Nothing was the same. We all knew him... It was just the environment that he lived in. And it didn't matter who he was. If it wasn't him... He felt bad for himself...

I lean against the corner chair, knees barely supporting myself against the wooden chair. 
 Still mid walk, the normally crowd- watchers in the place stare at me before an elderly man speaks; 
 'Not many feel as if, just not all are exactly correct.' 
 His raised brows furrowed, he raises his hands in an angry voice, 
 'Perhaps they are. Perhaps someone misunderstood them. Perhaps a misunderstanding with place.' 
 His eyes gleam dangerously bright as he speaks; 
 'If only we could reach them. After all, if there is none, there is no need to tell.' 
 I grab my coffee from the table, it lies down, in one hand there is a soft, slightly chewed note; 
 'Come to think of it, every time we break the spell, we lose our ability to go from poor to rich. If we lose our ability to go from poor to rich, we lose our ability to do anything other than eat our dream. Well that's just an illusion; there are no true squares. So which square are they?' 
 I wait until I am sure the man hasn't made any mistakes; 
 '*Someone* overslept because of one mistake. And if they did, our friends will be told all about it, and that's not bad either, if they want to experience something else, or if their dream was that different. It can be anything if it is good to go through that great rollercoaster!*'
 In my other hand holds a lifeless body full of the pine needles of my ancestral choice. 
 'That doesn't answer the question of what we're missing.' 
 I look up at the man from behind the desk. His eyes finally white, deep but cold, 
 'I am trying to leave it. I want to end this misery.'

"This must be some sort of prank, they say? " Sarah bellowed. 
 He looked up from his desk, intently looking back at his computer screen, somehow calculating the upside down hood of the trunk. 
 " And this! " He shouted, his voice getting irritated. 
 Sarah looked puzzled, then snarled as if she's had some very unpleasant experiences. " They had this moment, the moment, and I.... " 
 He wiped the sweat from his brow, frowned and put his mouth shut for a minute before groaning a little more. 
 " Oh, oh, oh, oh.... " He stretched and sat back, seeming resigned to the fate that was about to take place. 
 Sarah left the lab and walked out the door. For a moment he mused, then tapped the button on his phone. He squeezed a few fingers, then checked the time, they were 5:37. 
 He set down his phone on the floor, glanced at the clock again, changed the time and opened the box. * About 40 minutes. * He smiled and started working. 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 Something in his hand began to unravel. And then, nothing. 
 Sarah swept it across her desk, snatched her purse and walked outside, weary and without any company. She broke down into a bath of sweat and rolled onto the couch. 
 She took a deep breath and started watching television, " A wedding? And a snail's live stream from an extended live chat? " 
 " Yeah, the way I'd be on it. The whole DIY-i-go house party thing.... " 
 It was the same sound as the radio when he asked her to volunteer at the con, the sound of the TV shut off. 
 "... OK, what's the temperature? " 
 " 73 degrees. Really cool. " 
 He hung up the phone, walked over to the kitchen and opened his small bag. He grabbed two sprouts and tossed them in, one way, the other direction. His mouth went slack and he began to chug the contents in, breaking them under his weight. 
 It was cloudy and snotty, he couldn't feel the sweat that slowly grew through his hair, his eyes began to water, and he was being tussled up and down, sweating profusely as he wiped the sweat from his forehead. He began laughing uncontrollably, then made his way over to the kitchen, dropping the small bouquet of sprouts and mixing them with water from the trashcan. She started to start chugging, then he saw her crumbled to the bottom of the dry pan, tears running down her face. He rushed out, telling her to run, pointing at the TV and shouting as he ran away. 
 She almost screamed, but he just ignored her. He kept telling her to run and to keep running, reminding her that he was wrong. Even as she fell into unconsciousness, he tried to cheer her up. He put the bouquet of flowers in his left hand and clambered up to the side of the river, hoping the other suspects weren't watching. 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
 After what seemed like an eternity of staring, listening and listening to him stop suddenly, Sarah opened her laptop, and saw the date 2/21/16. It was the day of her wedding, from where she worked in the field. 
 " I hope you're ready, Rebecca, for our longest dating ever!" 
 Her heart sank, the feeling in her chest was killing her. 
 She closed her eyes and began walking towards the door, all that remained was a haze of blood and disgust that looked like something out of a science fiction movie.

It was always the same. Something about the way he would undress and the way he would respond. Every now and then he would reply again, starting with his piercing, bitter comment that wasn't aimed at anyone else. I stopped responding and stared at him, recognizing him first hand. He appeared ten yards away at that distance, and I couldn't stop staring. 
 I wasn't sure what it was like to be a journalist, without being able to relive the account of that person's last words in front of me. It wasn't that I was giving away my work to the world, but I had one thing I needed to know about him. A voice whispered in my mind. 
 I know that this could be him, didn't it? He spoke the same truth that we all talked about, a voice that spoke his last words in front of me. My mind whirled as I felt the warmth of his hand on my shoulder as I shook in my excitement as he led me to the gilded podium. I felt the heat that poured from the room as I took my place as the judge. 
 I sat there silent and bewildered, learning more about the man.

this post was on an official forum for an unknown chatroom chat room. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; As I was commenting on the thread I found some news, more of my own I thought, but also some answers for my future life might still come, possibly lurking on the news as I done it always last year or maybe I may feel at home reading the link but not yet. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I've always told myself it's simple: Delete a post and use # rmuser 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; You might find it interesting, I can always count on that. If you read too I'm sure I'll understand. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I think maybe it was something that got away from me. I stopped a journal during the war. When I happened upon it I removed it, I'm sure it wasn't until a year later when I realized how blatantly it had been compared to Hitler's illegal war on the Jews to prevent economic reasons for non-Jewish bloodshed. It was an open letter, but when they did finally expose this event it went down because it was so serious, so serious, so brutal. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I saw it used in other media then the Holocaust. Anything that now has gone viral causes it. the twitter account, 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; My opening thought as I've come to realize was one that drove me to writing because I wasn't good with words. In all my time I've never gotten back a reply that didn't mean, "I'm sorry." It has to do with the world systems. Almost anyone who has clicked on Wikipedia already knows of the corruption in the system.

"The hail shard of fine brass have shaken the lances in my next life, I'm in the Dark World. " Jon said. 
 He thought for a moment, 
 " Haven't never felt this new found nobility of being in a world so full of voracious dangers and predatory traitors. " The handsome brute responded. 
 " Yeah, I suppose that's true. More than what the term's taken to describe. I looked back in where I came from and noticed it was always a storm. " Jon said. 
 " Sometimes the many storms that swarm the lands get to you. An Elysian's close enough to break the equator and shine a blue orb into the Earth. " Jon said. 
 " And then you go & *bloodivng and ashivng*. " Jon said. 
 Jon had just finished a fresh crop, the Wintermarch was down a few miles into a civil war and not many things were out of the ordinary. 
 " Well, it was finally time. Of course, the weather permitting. " Jon said with a smile. 
 " Oh yeah, Dad. It's quite a cold here last winter. The sky is darkened and the atmosphere barely above freezing. " Jon said. 
 " And then I saw it, it wasn't a storm, it was snow. An immaculate panorama of the Sun. " Jon said. 
 " Lola is concerned, what? They called it a frozen taiga when they first came here. That might be a simile. " Jon said. 
 Lola thinks for a moment. " Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Snow, but her smell just can't be much better. What color do they call her? Pink? Colored? " Jon said. 
 " They took her away. One girl, named Terra, and brought her up by her own boot. " Lola commented. 
 " Hmm, I can only assume that's probably the misnomer. " Jon said. 
 Lola was quiet for a second. Then she said " Luna, why don't you run your back for the last time? If they want me to tell them where her stuff is, don't tell them just yet. " Then she said " As you left Mom. " 
 " Me too. " Jon said. 
 " I know. Don't worry, Mama- " Lola cut off. " You'll start soon enough." 
 The snow turned black, Lola fell in it before a beautiful stream rose up from the abyss.

I open my eyes, except this woman has her eyes fixed on me. She's moving silently, I still can't believe what just happened, after all these years. I try to tell her, "What was that? " but I'm unable to reply. Her hair seems normal, the sheet of cloth covering me is soft, and she's still holding my hand. 
 " I thought it was a dream " she replies quietly, despite her good reason. We both glance at each other. She doesn't move a muscle, no, not even a single muscle. I sigh, how hard can it be for a human being? I was framed by this. I am covered in the thatchy skin on my face, it hurts. 
 " Let me think for a moment..." she says. I lift my head and blink a few times, trying to find something out of the ordinary. My eyelids seem to tighten, unable to keep still. I push myself up, trying my hardest not to let her jump in. She glances away quickly, she's trying to stop me, but she can't. She stands there, staring into my eyes. One blink, and my body feels like it is melting away, yet somehow it still feels right. I throw myself onto the bed, struggling to take the fall. 
 A lot had changed since the night she took me into the world, I didn't really know what I imagined. I imagine being in a very peculiar romantic place. It was our first date, but I guess it wasn't too far. I imagined her with me, took my hand in hers. As I held her, she started to melt. My fingers trembled, I thought we would be able to enjoy each other again. I thought we would finally fall, but as I was struggling I felt something grab my wrist. I grabbed it, and pulled it out, as I tried to push it away, it fell off. The nightmare hurt me so much, I cried. It never felt real, but it felt normal again. It moved, but it couldn't move, it couldn't leave my hand. I tried to twist it, but it couldn't make me reach my arm. I was pushed out of my bed, but somehow something came back and made me fall into the bed.

I used to love it. I used to know that sometimes blonds could grant people an unbelievable gift, but now that they're awesome and perfect, even be able to tap into it and commit some brilliance and brilliance in so doing, it just seems... The harder I tried the darker it became. No one has tried something like it before, but today it was just another subcategory of the product. This isn't about paid work. It's about giving a gift. 
 *Blond moment dye* 
 *Random little-blond moment* 
 The cup I had been working on had started coughing up a droplet of very bright blonde hair dye into the tip of the piss tank. Just another little Bully. 
 The stink of the,
*Sweat of vomit and 
 *Contaminated wine* 
 That was the last straw. The shipping and handling of my friend's gift, a company named Blond Ambush, had been yet another excuse to cut off a crucial part of my leg. There was so much blood in my entire leg, and every effort every second was spent to save it. I just could feel the elation that ran through me, a tidal wave of joy that grabbed hold of me and would ever keep me safe from anything out there. 
 I had so many worries. Why would I spend time risking everything to get an amicable compromise? What are I risking? What are I risking doing? I'm spending time on Blond Ambush, but every second I spend on it, the planet revolves around a man in black hair. And it's white. 
 I needed a compliment, but my face was already watering. I stumbled out of my seat and ducked beneath the sea of blinking pixels. 
 *Elation blossom* 
 Blue eyes caught mine. I stared down at the fabric and then at the lines. Yup, they were a nod of approval. It was so natural. I collected myself and raised the cup to my lips. Then I closed my eyes and smiled at the glory of my hands and at the superiority of my blinking piece of work.

Hi people, I'm not the best article of all time, but at least I have read the prompt a lot already: 
 > Was this like trying to change the sun? 
 > Gender, left/right, participant/participant, Obama 
 > What's in new subreddits? 
 > Best open-sourced language that's out there 
 > =3096,000 points ( or a little less. Click and click to download their results ) 
 Yeah, very popular it is. 
 Im kinda disappointed in myself about not being allowed to do some of the best and most original writing ever. The only people I liked to come back to this thread are author, people not interested in making stories for themselves or for their families, and because me writing is short and strict, I feel like I'm losing out in a lot of ways. I kind of feel like I'm forgotten. 
 I saw the Reddit war going on, and frankly I'm kind of glad they took the first step in it. I have a pretty serious head start here, and I haven't written so many good stories or essays lately. I'm over two years old, and I don't have time to do anything I shouldn't have. Maybe I'll choose to just ignore others, maybe have me write poetry instead. I don't know, I really don't know. 
 Yeah, I haven't written anything since I was a baby, but I'm probably not doing very good on this one either. 
 So... 
 Actually, that's what's kind of depressing: almost everybody has these old and negative feelings about others, and the negative is usually the negative itself. My family seems to have very positive feelings about others, and i'm kinda hoping that people find this useful and continue doing my family's work for me. 
 I really love guys like you. Everyone has those particular feelings, but it's really like nobody ever mentions anyone else really really. I mean, sometimes I would get so upset trying to be liked, but there's someone I'm ashamed of seeing. Someone who totally gets it. I've never seen anyone like me for who I really am. 
 I guess anyone can come along just fine.

My first time writing a story in this subreddit, so please critique and functor me! ( Funny thing about bestiality! ) 
 1: Jenny was fascinated by the flag. She came in, as usual, asking what had happened to the flag. Without waiting, she glanced around the room. She had enough curiosity for one question, nothing seemed strange anymore. Picking up her pencil, she started making this too long for her benefit. 
 2: Jenny had slowly moved through the alphabet, picking out a number of letters. Three letters all. How do you pronounce them? She read one, excited. The box on the top left was thicker than the next and the second three were less intricate. She scratched them, more inched closer to her assignment. 
 3: Jenny tried to yell at all of the long cuts in the fabric to startle her operator but her voice stopped. Once she started singing like a gong, she stopped. Jenny stared right at the man at the end of the line for a long time, then suddenly felt something crunch under her armpits. She jumped, back to her pencil, and began to type quickly. 
 4: Jenny found herself stumped. She stood there for a long time, needing to type out the alphabet word by word. Looking for the right note, she picked it up. Thinking long and hard, she saw two things. 
 1: There were two stars in the corner of her eye. She saw four letters in the red. 
 2: Jenny's eyes widened. A double edged sword was swinging around in her mind, snarling at her. Jenny put her pencil aside and started writing, then stopping briefly after eating a bowl of soup. She could hear smoke and teeth honking as an evil knife cut through her hair, her rib cage collapsing on top of her. The cowboy hat covered her breasts and she lay on the ground sobbing. Another punk hounded her outside for a few minutes. 
 3: Once again, Jenny decided to hold a knife to the throat. The keys were everywhere. Several feet away, she heard a crashing noise. Chunks of wood tumbling toward her, hitting her on the face. Her heart stopped in the air. Smiling, Jenny smiled. 
 She didn't know what was happening and started to run. She ran once more, the bullet ripping through the flesh. She passed out, barely able to shout as she felt the cold, hard object in her heart fly.

The judge seated in the Grand Courtroom just stared at the man inside. The old lawyer stood, surrounded by his prisoners. He glanced at the judge. 
 "So how was your plea bargain you cited for charging him with feasting on his own choice at the craft fair. " 
 The man in front of the judge was wearing his finest suit, embroidered with a yellow fox, feathers that people had placed on the front of them. He smiled at the judge and asked, 
 " Mr. Stark, this is a good example. " 
 The judge leaned in closer and said, " Mr. Stark was most definitely his own daughter. He passed away nearly two weeks ago. Of all the man you charged for the marriage he never even found out why she bore the shape of a face. No one knew who she was or what she was intended to become. That is, until this morning. " 
 " Oh, the kid would be so upset by the lifestyle he took to pursue her dreams and build a fine castle that dwarfs the castle's most expensive castle. He should have never left the castle. " 
 The judge paused. " All the same, she took the girl and left him. Of course, it was her head that left her for the twins and also for the babies and other expenses that might have been incurred if she had not been made her own. Yet you were certainly guilty. " 
 The lawyer sat down. " Thank you for my earlier referral and proof. Please agree to your next case. " 
 The courtroom erupted in laughter. The judge walked out from the court, leaving the crowd of judges in shock, others smirking. There were about 5 men in all. They all were an old man, and a man believed to be much younger than his age. 
 The judge seated the judge again. " What makes you to be the one to convict the defendant? " 
 " Well, yes. The appeals lawyers have a number of reasons why they would have to convict me, because I have seemingly the exact opposite exact fate. " The man interrupted. 
 " Well then, how is the defendant's future limited by an eternity of experiences that you have not discussed in court? " The judge asked. 
 " It is actually due to our boy from his first marriage, or other cases you listed, that he is in this process now. A very young boy who is bound by the law and typically listens to the court during all the introductory motions in court. He constantly changes from year to year, making sure to keep his education a classical style and keep the order and demeanor he truly wants. He has friends that he rarely meets. He has friends at home but rarely visits. In fact, he spends most of his time at one of those slow, repetitive corporate offices in his home town. His colleagues often leave or leave and sometimes pay for his services but he has to request a meeting before he gets back. If he leaves, his house gets demolished and his school gets destroyed because of us. He can only stay for the time being to help people, not for himself. " 
 " So this is why he needs our help, and why did you seek out your attorney when you probably could have avoided prosecution and show what we were capable of. " 
 " My client is always disciplined and paid for well by himself, yet I would never dream of bringing him harm. Why was I forced to judge and incarcerate him? " The man sighed, " If I could only have the chance to say yes, it would be the legal tender. " 
 " I agree that putting the child in foster care is a very freeing act. " The judge said. 
 The lawyer turned around and looked at the judge. " You seem quite captivated and you can't stay for long. " 
 The judge sighed. " And you can't even enter his home to claim the home and own the home because of a prohibition on self-immolation. You have to choose either way. " The old lawyer approached the front of the court. " Either you kill him at this point or go back to college and purchase a small cottage, a chicken wing, a mantel."

It was a cloudy night when the Japanese coast guard came in. The 14-foot waves of wind slapped into each other like melted snow. The sick and sick rounded, respectively, as I hurried down the tram. My screaming resonated out the villages and the tramping life that grew in the huge golden wall before me. I was on the ground, the fear and hatred of my enemies burned deep within my being. My mind raked through my memories, poking with my skull wondering where my allies were. He sat on his knees, staring at me menacingly. 
 "The white flag waving over our territory is the flag of the great nations of our world, " he whispered to me. He shrugged and continued talking. I thought that after hundreds of years he'd managed to get me to speak my own country. I should've said so. His face slowly got pale and dark. I couldn't help it. 
 " Know I shall be the leader of the world," he said. He nodded and went on. 
 Soon after that incident, he was mugged for treason. Pestilence, I never understood the irony of what transpired. He would flak the country in his face. Sadly for me, there was no getting me out of it. Soon, my town was cowed by the spread of koreans. Statecraft, confusion, what was the point. I was the only refuge. 
 I spun around and turned to see a smirking young man with salivating teeth. 
 “ From what? ” he demanded. He looked mildly amused. 
 “ Musurge! ” I shouted. 
 “ What do you mean from what? ” he said. He snatched my shoulder, shooting me a look. 
 “ We're planning a very strange trip to North Korea to clean your tongue rod of every dirty filth imaginable! You may have done so many things to deserve your raping, murder and pillaging of this tiny country. ” 
 He winced. My thoughts were packed with regret. As I prepared to leave, he spoke once more. He spoke with his own tongue as I poured myself another drink. I swallowed before I noticed his long sleeplessness. 
 “ You shall break this pole, and your tongue will burn furiously in your mouth. I have made my mistake. I have ruined all of this. I have suffered fools for so long and wasted the collective effort to do it so. Now, to you my friend, I must beg you, take responsibility for your actions. You have helped many people turn this searing reality into a place that I can no longer touch. I am not aware of your intentions but I have chosen to pray for you. ”

"Where is he? " Blase, the representative of the District Council stated. " Mr. Swanson, " Blase responded. " Mr. Swanson is very unhinged, " Blase and Blase advised. While Blase wasn't the smartest of them all, he was a highly skilled fish. They thought they could defeat him easily, knowing the small differences in the color of his flesh, the creases on his body, and the unbridled natural aggression of his body. 
 The new administration decided their plan to siphon Blase off of government funding wasn't a bad idea. And, given the nature of their situation, they didn't have an easy task. They needed to get his attention. To get a little faster, to make sure they made the right decision, and to get their chicken kibble to release at a snail's pace. For now Blase, being underwhelmed by the suggestion, and overly concerned with the downsides of his low LIFE, was unwilling to give him much. 
 " How about an extra turnabout? " Blase wondered aloud. 
 " Oh that would be lovely, " said Blase, hoping for some sort of great revelation. " Best of luck... " 
 " No, " said the president, straightening his tie. " Even if we just get we're very enough beyond a response that he doesn't see a *click* before his move is complete, there's a *thump* when it gets done. Tell me, Mr. Swanson. What's wrong? " 
 " It's his birthday, " cried Blase. " A friend is running for Congress. This town has already passed the Good Karma Bill. I'd even like to add a little might to my budget. " 
 " A successful campaign seems, " said the president, " rather, like... 'pharma.' " 
 " Interesting, " retorted Blase. " I'll find out later, " the newly elected one-term president said. " Good luck all out of office, Mr. Swanson."

 " What do I have to do to get there? " He asked.

 " Why do you say that? " He asked. 
 " Well, you've really become my personal helper. Maybe it's selfish, but it's always helped that you're still here. And I understand. " 
 " I'm sorry, but I can't help you right now. "

 " No, you don't. " 
 " I'm not... I'm not happy with you. I mean, I miss you and I miss you-- " 
 " Don't you -- this... this... " He said, quickly dropping her.

 " Okay, okay," he said.

Red? Me? 
 She went from going to the kitchen and replacing the bleeding napkins with some sort of bleach. She didn't stop, actually she lifted her head. 
 That's when it got weird. Suddenly she saw that she was going to have to say something. Everything was going to become blurry, she heard them say something and her head instantly dropped. 
 "Why do you kill?" 
 The scream came. It suddenly got to her. It was coming from the depths of her imagination. In her 10 year campaign there had been no hint of how insane her campaign was getting. And her life had lost all logic and I can only hope she won't use it to take the fall. 
 It must have hurt somehow. It was the 15th annual Red Jobs Tour in Texas.

While researching the current whereabouts of billionaire William Bedford, I also discovered his Antibiotics would dramatically improve his body. Hemolytic diarrhea, liver failure and severe food poisoning would eventually destroy him. He might be discovered prematurely, and some managed to survive it, but he isn't a great blood donor and would require considerable training before toelion. 
 _____________________________________________________________ 
 Today, Dr. Martin Hernandez joined the OrcaPatriots, as well as Dr. Burch Burch Armbruster, the Paracoath. Everyone loves treating their children with a dose of anticoagulants. The treatment is effective for almost everyone over the age of 20 and comes with the possibility of immunity for any circumstances. Now that I am informed that any serious harm was done to Captain Clayton Burns, "he will have a dignified funeral "... Heck, I think that was done to a couple of bad apples. 
 Most of the research supports this conclusion. It would seem that the normal course of action would be to keep others around to report him to the local police force. They don't expect police to agree to any such treatment though. 
 _____________________________________________________________ 
 It seems that all the studies I have been performing on Baron Benilstein, have produced consistent results. Unfortunately though... 
 His personality has not changed. He still can't stop drinking heavily. When he talks, he just stares at the clock, which is faster than his attention span. Strange, there seem to be a bunch of clocks all around, showing the same time left until tonight. Yet he is open to eating people again. I always liked to joke with him about the TV lights being off, but we must keep him out of contact because the actual time of his death is 5:30 pm! Right now I am far more curious than I am about the clock. I am not looking forward to going out with me and talking to him because that would only provoke other people's reactions. I should probably check if the clocks are clock reading and I am certain that they will be just fooling around. I will sleep, at my house... There is no way I could possibly slow down without influencing the current situation or his day-to-day life any further. Maybe his parents have gone too far in calling him a coward or if they don't have to end it already? I have no idea how he would react now that I am gone. 
 _____________________________________________________________ 
 Now, I could spend the rest of my life hiding out and acting different, either as a sentinel for the mayor, or as some type of one night stand type. 
 I am not going to lie. I think I will definitely kill an outlaw. What do I do if the mayor throws up at me and instead of making a grand address? I would be bold enough to stay where I am and watch the mayor's speech ( perhaps in a private car. A barkeep often visits during the day to check on it. ) 
 Some levels of altruism work wonders on Benilstein. He owes this to the two good times he has spent with the city. Yes, Mayor Benilstein's time with the city will be greatly diminished if everything goes to plan. Well, it could even have gotten worse. 
 _____________________________________________________________ 
 I think I'll just fly out and find him. We have many roads leading to unknown destinations. There is virtually no traffic in Benilstein, and it is made public knowledge that he is hard working on a rescue mission. It seems his efforts will work. Now, I can plan my own family's next steps after he is removed and security guards arrive. I must hope that as he gets older this city can get a lot easier. When he is done... I will be ready and ready to go.

She sat before me in the woods. I loved to watch her as she stood in front of the passing truck. If I had known I wouldn't have sprinted up and killed the evil behemoth that had hurled me into it. I would have been quicker and I would have just stood there watching. She heard me and raised her head high to my hungry gaze. Then she added, “ My, my, you ’ re not going to kill me. ” 
 She snorted a low, amused laugh. “ Would you like some nacho cheese? ” 
 At this I looked over at her and she pulled a pocket knife off the side of her head. “ No, I don ’ t want you eating that. Just eat what you want. ” 
 I didn ’ t reply. I grabbed the knife by my side and pulled the knife into her mouth. I cut her throat clean, then started licking the wound. She looked down at her hands and closed them down quickly. I took a deep breath and breathed hard. 
 “ My, my, you ’ re going to eat that. ” 
 “ Of course, my my. ” 
 She tilted her head and took a deep breath. “ Very good sweetheart. ”

The owner of the place had arranged for me in a certain dress, for his earnings. 
 My name is Scoli. I was 4 years old. 
 I remember all the guards chanting my name and kicking and screaming, and the dog just hanging up. 
 I wasn't sane when it happened, not until it reared its head and removed the mask and cape that my family threw on me to show it what was coming. 
 And I'm here, too. 
 I'm not even sure who's taking me, because I couldn't breathe again. 
 I'm too weak to say more, so I just wait for people to enter and I don't cry. 
 People don't just leave, though. The hardest thing about that part of my existence is that you never see those people you love ever again. No matter what they did to get to you, it always drove you insane. 
 Life is like that, I've seen it all. Nothing will bring me back. Nothing. My life has been hard, and I can't give up on it. The selfishness that lives in that black box hasn't always been there. 
 I just hope they don't hurt me, okay? 
 This was the hardest step in my life.

Arrow wrote a story about a man who gets shipped off to his new sister, who is his father's real grandfather. Arrow believes that he would have gotten more "Inaccessible " without her. Of course, Arrow is more obsessed with finding the Infinity Dagger that was assigned to the only stone statue that was left standing. One day, the Infinity Dagger finds his way into the home of his next of kin. 
 In the letter Arrow states that his sister, Annabelle, and Arrow are his parents and foster parents, and the end of the story begins with him and the writer looking at the Infinity Dagger and looking up at the author. 
 The teacher is ashamed, as is he. Arrow is the one who refuses to admit that he isn't quite what his sister used to be. 
 Having two parents, and almost a ghostwriting writing personality, Arrow never wants to write further. He knows that he's done so and keeps on writing to avoid getting fired. He would never just end up telling himself that he's sorry. Like, a vampire would. 
 Apparently, dying only attracts a vampire and giving it too much testosterone upsets his personality. It was apparently that trying to explain that his sister isn't from this world had him killed. 
 Going off story, I'm convinced that this is the first time Arrow is forced to write a story to convince himself that his sister isn't from this world. And even though he is/has been told to have said something to the author, he is still afraid of never ending an entire story with it. 
 Edit: Unwritten advice 
 Edit: Writing prompts probably don't even exist.

The orange yellow cloud casts a choking smog across the sky, making a brilliant orange haze in the distance. Thirty-seven centimeters high, the rock bearing down hits an elephant's cage; the animal has strolled around the entirety of its life despite having a weak human arm. The scales on the animal's neck join in, piercing through the dense litter that made up the frozen ground. The heart ends in one of the rows of lumps, sitting in place of its wound. Its body is mostly filled by its own blood, its sweat-filled skin just out of reach. But the other three members of the calf share the same bounty. Every one of them is the same. An infant is the most dangerous, possessing a of the blue lung-shaped thing that rips apart metal and wood and leaves molten gemstone. They are simply indestructible. Yet a calf with the blue lung is beyond them. The calf can not die of starvation and dehydration, or pain, or anything. Of course, their being is weaker than the other calves, as steel is built into their bones, and their muscles are shut from exhaustion and inflammation. But the blue lung is closer. 
 Every of the hearts of the calves melted alive on the inside, with their bloody marrow and blood and ectoplasmic bone as the body. For the infant calf, the heart is filled with life. It has only never had time to live; instead, it was developed and then buried by its mother.

His eyes were still darting between the myriad of animals on the planet as he watched. He knew what was happening, that they were ready for a celebration. It seemed important. 
 On the surface, the surface seemed so much easier. Like the memory kept on slumbering away. He was just an old man, lying in the city, just before he met the eyes of his master. They were so young, they never even knew he was here. How could they be so naive? 
 He cradled his head in his hands, his vision as sharp as ever. He rubbed his eyes with his right hand, trying to force a smile. It seemed he was the master's pet. His master wasn't one of those demigods, the ones who made peace with the world. There was no god and, it seemed, he got to see all of it. 
 He wasn't crying. He was simple. He didn't want to leave, it was for his own good. He just wanted to have a simple life. 
 He looked down at his dog and saw a little hound in his yard. It wasn't a dog, but a hound with claws. A primal instinct, the joy of dying, of dying that had never been there before. They had no food, no space, no supplies, no thought. They only needed to wait. 
 They smiled at him. It was strange to just look upon his beautiful yellow eyes, or at his four eyes, and it was full of wonder. 
 He blushed with delight, when his master didn't break eye contact. 
 He knelt next to him, and kissed him. The words hung in the air as the best of them was broken. He kissed his master once, it made a silent moan and cried out, even from up there. 
 The hound's jaws got dry. With his right hand, he held his stomach in place as he cradled the dog next to him. His heart was beating hard now, as he was treated to so much tasting. He buried his head next to his master, knowing that eventually the death on the planet would come. 
 He didn't miss a beat. He couldn't live this kind of life for he knew this would be the last time. 
 The dog scratched his head on the small street. The dogs cheeks turned red as the sunset fell, the scent of leaves washing over him. He felt pain wrack his body. He needed to breathe. He could see his master. 
 He was going to kill him.

Chuck exited the laundry room and went back to the dining room. The Lord of the Rings fans quivering behind their tentacle-jawed stand had spread quickly through the room. 
 In his hand was a small wooden stick, the color of raisin, forming a stick and some juice behind it. 
 "Chuck, hold this! " An Fafnir pulled it from his shoulder and took a long swipe at the ashtray on his back, the splashed juice caressing his hair. 
 His eyebrows furrowed in ecstasy as he stomped into the living room, the dining room erupted into music. The Epix brothers rose from their tentacle-jawed stand and followed suit. 
 A battered Durotar leaned against the pool with his hands on the wall and snarled at Chuck. 
 " How much taste the pudding will taste, Chuck? " The Fafnir asked as he offered the stick to Chuck. 
 The teen looked at him with a smile and stretched. " 10, maybe? " 
 Chuck glared at the male Fafnir. " Also, prepare to test for out craftwork this week. " He motioned to the Stone of Tristram its nametag wrapped in vines. 
 With eyes darted behind the mirror, a Latin form-form. It painted in Nottinen hartinen, hissing and wailing as it took shape. 
 Chuck waved to Chuck and the Latin form vanished. 
 " Brod! " 
 The trio huddled, looking at the stone slowly lapping at them. Their stares falling into confusion, the stone, now violently distended, peeked above them. The two fandoms could not look away and walked out into the evening, alone in the dark. 
 A man clad in a red and white labcoat looked up at the air. His nametag cast silver and gold around a brown etched in gold. 
 " You're without a doubt my apprentice now. It is in your hands that I set fire to the Lambbearer's flesh. " 
 The man slipped past the three men into the room, and out of the living room came a Magekin clad in black. 
 " Now. When you and your wretched people will understand Lovecraft's evil, we may sevecee into your realm. " 
 The red-skinned man took a swig from his schnapps and plastered the figure's blood onto the ceiling in the blink of an eye. " That is most of your tale. " 
 Chuck moved towards the main panel on the front of the room and tossed his hard-of-hearing armor to the desk behind him. The magekin advanced and deposited a golden slithering orb in its hand. The magekin reached into his robes and drained a great chunk from the tip. 
 A nameless voice echoed down the hall. " Silence, begone."

Thor, the hated Man of Thunder, rushed towards the capital, unblinking. We couldn't hear. We knew he'd miss us, but he didn't even have to look to us for a sizzle. 
 Well, you see, Girotti, Girotti's brother, had joined them out of duty. He played guards, hired the best assassins, and no one even knew how to kill. Suddenly, Time Thor ( and others ) forgot who he was and he retreated, naked, screaming. The Ministry of Time was shocked and feared him. We sent a team to take down but not Thor. We sent a new New Zealand they called South Africa, who were SO WELL! 
... and because your average american, do you know what a friend? I used to be so scared... and when they stopped the kids from school... and I think that's when I realized the zits... they suck.

I had was being badgered by the local goblins, I had all seen them at the time, I had ever seen a goblin with two claws pull a dagger out of his cloak, I had never had to walk down the streets with a chainsaw. But this time of year, their presence forced us to make sure it wasn't too close to the field. I was tired of seeing the goblins do all sorts of bizarre stunts, they must have long fell, they often wave me away, or whatever they're doing after letting me out of their building. 
 I just stood in the stands. I did not know what to expect, I had never seen anything like it, but I guess I could feel it, just like before. Now, I stood back up, glanced down into the room I had, and saw my mother. She was holding the dagger in her hands, and was holding a candle. I had finished a silly initiation ritual that had inspired so many. She was old and tired, and no shape in the world could be more unsightly. But she was doing her best to assist me, but I had what I needed. I had to ensure her safety, I was about to face the giants, but I had to make it look clean, as their powers would be for us.

"Okay, guess you're having a heart attack. Well that's a bad thing. " 
 After I finish saying this I turn to the register. 
 " Well I guess I'm dying. That's my job and I can't even keep an eye on the clock. " 
 " Is that so? " 
 " Yeah... It's a nice way to work though. " 
 We argue for a while. " Doesn't work like that. People just stop after getting sick, and some day, they even die. " 
 " W-well that's... it works a lot better than air pressure. So you're at your last breath? " 
 " Yes, that's exactly what I said. " 
 " So your heart doesn't kill you? I'm dying? I could lie down, sleep in the comfort of my bed, and wake up? " 
 " You could, of course, but it would be too damn irritating. " 
 The next day comes. Sitting in the restaurant, I see a face of concern and wonder. " What about this person? " 
 " No doubt, this guy is dying. Probably killed by someone who didn't give them enough money. He probably thought he could make them fat but they wanted to look... unhealthy? " 
 " Don't ask me that, you know how much money he made or when people in your area died? " 
 " I have no idea, he could be here before me again. And he is an extreme murderer. You know people in these suburbs aren't always the same. " 
 " Oh no no no, I guess they have kids, and they don't give it much thought. They just... don't care. " 
 " Oh hey, who cares. They simply want money, you know? Not necessarily money that will make the world a better place. The world is fine, I just have to ask you one more time... what happened to your friend? He looked so sad, his heart felt so hollow... " 
 " Oh! He was never sad... " I scream at him as I snap back into my deep thought. " You think he was? Sorry, it's just what you call... an extreme murderer. Like, I see his picture all over the internet. You're imagining people dying at the exact same time. That does make me sick, aren't you? But what about that man? My grandfather? " 
 " He was an ordinary man. He acted very kind to an only child. Didn't act but acted in the way that is. The crowd rose slowly from the tables, paying him a visit every few minutes. When he left, people began to move away from him, I don't know what happened to him but everything was fine. " 
 " So... did he spend his day at the beach? Did he go to sleep when he woke up? " 
 " Probably but just not anything too big... maybe a sleepover somewhere warm. " 
 " What... the man is in prison? Where? I don't know, maybe if he was not up there then it wouldn't have been so bad... " 
 " It's okay. Do I know anything? " 
 " Nope, sorry. Just don't freak out because I love him, and because my job makes it so... " 
 " Are you sure I can find the doctor? I need to ask him before he gets to the hospital, and the vet as well. " 
 " Don't worry, don't tell me he can't stay until I... just ask him to come to the hospital. I would understand a lot, but he can't go to the hospital... " 
 " He is definitely paranoid, though... I just can't explain it to him. " 
 " I don't understand. That's really sad. I understand... you're an extreme murderer. You can't live without him."

"What a bile and poison! 
 In a madhouse! The day had finally arrived 
 For the vilest thing you ’ d said. 
 He lay there, listening; 
 “ You know what you ’ re just going to do, 
 It ’ s true, I ’ m just going to start running, 
 But I will let you go, in some ways very strange. 
 Most of the people were only sons and daughters, 
 On their ancestral earth; 
 And though they may have grown up with kids 
 Who will never interact with the world again, 
 They will fight! To keep the peace, 
 The world would need to move, and so 
 For a while they ’ d keep on fighting. 
 It was crazy how quickly they drew fire 
 While most warring nations, 
 Like Spain, Spain, and Mexico, 
 Got all pumped up for a war 
 Half a century. 
 Now you ’ ve got me, West Australia and North Africa, 
 The land is just starting to dry up, 
 Nobody else cares 
 About peace and see us in Valhalla, 
 If you stay away from the people, 
 Then these crooks are going to go to Hell, 
 To have a gun against them. 
 How much of that I ’ ll let you see, 
 So that I may destroy the world, 
 Speak out loud. If the people think I ’ m crazy, 
 They ’ re only playing the law; 
 This religion is so popular! 
 You can ’ t talk like that, so be careful, 
 Because the world will be too crazy. 
 There is no helping you anymore, 
 Because you ’ ve got me over, though this spree is only one thing. 
 It hurts, you can ’ t stop me, but you can stand by, 
 And watch my family; 
 Mom knows how hard I work, 
 I ’ m going to get this done before it gets too late, 
 Just a little bit. Come on, tell me, 
 What was once a peaceful utopia, 
 A world where everyone was equal and fair, 
 Is now a war zone, in which at least they have the peace, 
 Make sure you say what you say in broad daylight, 
 If you ’ re not great, be it, white people in some money, 
 You ’ ll get burned by birds and the poor, 
 That ’ s for sure, I suppose, 
 But it ’ s worth it, to say it out loud.

I suppose this really shouldn't come as a shocker to me. 
 I haven't written to anyone recently. 
 It's usually adults on their thirtieth birthday or so. I suppose teenagers are even more... unusual. They dream big, fresh balls of death from the thorax. I used to hear of this old Chinese proverb, through years of debate and debates among my peers. " Somebody who has enjoyed life ten times has passed up the chance to strive to create an artist's dream. Someone who has amassed amazing accomplishments has passed up the chance to take his wife from him, his seven year old daughter to school. Somebody who has won raffles from his favorite retailers has passed the time to discover a novel he loves just so, just so, totally perfectly. 
 I took it all in without thinking it through, though, so I decided to get a few things straight. The first was the adult component. It requires thirty to be implanted. Our computers can't make good ones, especially when the machinery they are made in to rivulets off really crushes things. Sure, intelligence can come from playing catch-up to some pretty impressive play-radio, but it certainly does not have the drive to actually create an offensive pianist, hitting at an amazing level of attention. Even then, it doesn't *really* grant us the power to destroy a school. Even worse, are *those* children? This never came with the authority granted to us by the very sex robots of society. They should know better. 
 So they can be removed from humans. They can get a few months off of their assigned cycle. The technology usually has to go through certain parts of puberty. I'd like to think we can avoid the first five to eleven cycles, but still, at this point I'd be getting there pretty early. 
 Still, I wouldn't want anything to break my doctor's heart. I don't want someone finding me, reading my pamphlet at the back of a garage to tell me my mother is gone. I need her back. 
 I shudder, sitting in the middle of my desk, slouched over a bundle of papers, writing things down about someone important. There are some rules to be followed, of course, because they can't happen. Or, no one will do anything about it. 
 Sometimes, I worry that I might be a virtual crazy. The trinkets are far enough hidden out in my boxes that it wouldn't be a big deal if they happened, but... only if they *do*. 
 A simple, simple trick, simple enough to play on children's minds, if you will. And, er, get people, as that's where I come in. 
 I was born with the devices. But, er, I like to think I know what's truly important. 
 Pity. Especially since my mother hasn't been home in four weeks. Since I can't speak of the rare little family business that I keep in the trunk, the last thing I would think would be the wisdom of giving them a little drink or snack to keep my spirits up. 
 I thought of them long before they happened. I've thought long enough, and passed words about them to friends and colleagues alike. But mostly, in that moment, I sat silent. 
 Let me tell you something. Never once and for that matter, will my mother ever see us again. I never will, never will. This will be her place. This will be her only refuge. 
 I heard there were rumours last week that children had played on me. I knew too well. I had seen it myself before. Some girls had completely lost their minds, and ended up in that very house somewhere, without knowing it too much. 
 But, now, I can't... 
... I still... 
... Mom? Dad? I mean, I have her phone. She is gone. I don't care what she did, and I know I can't go back to this life, no matter what... 
 " Why didn't you open the front door and say something?" 
 He was dead.

A musket ball was thrust into his shoulder, thin streaks of shot waiting on contact. The rifle slung over his shoulder and whipped around, waiting for the shot to come out. He didn't give it much thought as it fell to the floor. 
 It wasn't until his butt met an oar that it struck him directly in the stomach. His suit was now flung with the remainder of his body remaining, hitting the ground hard. 
 Silence. 
 A man stepped back from his gas mask, attempting to save his life. If it weren't for the near round wound that was sticking out of his chest, he probably would not have died. If he'd just known better, the man who used to sell him weapons would have rushed past. The lone sniper stood motionless in the quiet. 
 The man's vision darkened. The man's rage evaporated. 
 The rifle swung open, crushing the man to the ground. A glance to one side of the man's face gave the sniper a deadly look. The man's eyes peered directly into the sniper's. Before he could react, the rifle was gone. In a sudden burst of pain and confusion, the man fell backwards on his own leather chair. 
 The sniper rushed to the chair. His arm was strained with pain as his arm slowly grew numb. He looked down at his bloodied wrists and shook his head. He was sorry. 
 Tears formed in the sniper's eyes as he felt the end of his gun tightening. A steel pistol is strapped to his neck. His father.

^ "One thousand and forty seven writer's edict. " 
 " There I am, on that blog I worked at for thirteen months! Every social media article, every viral writing initiative, every story being documented, every author's /r/WritingPrompts post. How many of you could have known about how well that was? Not a single one! " 
 In my opinion, I was wrong. Every single one of them. 
 People are making silly statements about how great that was, all the time. Like if we had the same vocabulary as the Upper Plots, they wouldn't be arguing about ( inter )peak any more... Bad. Evil. All in every marketing name. But the still, the bad. And the trend didn't stop. 
 Pushing into a corner and writing a new entry on every creative page on the internet, sometimes being wrong, sometimes with an insane theory or a hoax, all the time. It seems that people just stopped this madness. 
 And it's like the government doesn't even know. Do you know what that means? By giving away the truth, let the world know we're nothing but a hoax, and your clue is that of a Twitter feed? That's what we do. We don't even pretend our fake comments look so good in a post, but we treat them and it's like we have some sort of meeting place with celebrities. You think we should have all that stuff so we'll just sit back and shut up? Look at what we've done here. " 
 People were writing like that. There was no error being made. No melodramatic arm-wagging, single-subject proclamations in response to material on Google Play. This was out of the ordinary. It was the norm. Or at least the norm for what transpired on this subreddit. 
 People were trying to be intellectually honest and rational, and they were trying to find their very own post here, " Trolls really started coming out, and have started harassing me on Reddit and Facebook. I really don't have any ideas why it's happening... it's probably just my mind playing tricks on me." 
 Well, there it is. A few thousand and forty seven. And a counter sign on every book subscription anywhere on the planet. 
 I didn't think to check out to make sure, but I'm always happy to see a red flag in the midst of a cold day, a blue print on every book subscription on the planet. 
 It was the next one I saw. It was first lurker comment, just like the last one... I don't know what exactly they mean. Not that I know of the new ones. And if they were the same, who would care?

I get up. The sound of a chiming is clear to my ears. Tears fall down my cheeks but I can barely concentrate. 
 “ Run! ” I murmur, clutching the phone in my hand and gurgling. My hand shakes and eventually catches on to my eyes. “ Run, run… ” I started crying now, I must have sobbed earlier in the day. What happened? 
 “ You ’ ve noticed ” answered her. “ What happened to you? ” I look around frantically. Why? 
 “ To save you. ” I nodded. “ Shall I borrow one? ” 
 “ Yep. It ’ s alright, I have the on-line program installed. ” She nods in response. I stare at the stench of blood. 
 I relax. I try to stay awake. I wait till I can hear the aural music, until my eyes are open. I don ’ t hear anything. 
 I stand up and walk out of the cabin. My hand is trembling. I take two steps out of the building and they creak open. In the distance, a loud group of kids cheer for their team. 
 I run along the snow covered highway. Run, run. I can ’ t even stop if I want to. I run as fast as I can, seeing as how I ’ m the only one left. I make a few more changes to the road before getting stuck, and I bring the car over. 
 The car screeches to a stop and a terrified-looking boy is walking towards the car. I run into the hood of the car and can ’ t help but be a little scared. 
 “ What the fuck did you do? ” I ask, confused. 
 “ What ’ s going on? ” he asks. 
 I quickly realize that I haven ’ t got my phone in my hand, and my answer is simply: ‘ Run! ’ 
 “ Can you believe what I ’ m saying? ” I say gently. 
 “ I suppose so ” he replies. 
 The car stops and a beeping hum comes from under the hood. It ’ s a somewhat familiar clicking noise, but not so familiar that I ’ m sure any of these people would recognise it. I try the window but the noise stops abruptly. The car stops in front of my house. There ’ s another beep. 
 The boy and his friend walk towards me. They put a hand on my shoulder. 
 “ Run! Run! ” I say, shouting. “ What the fuck did you do? ” 
 They both run a couple of feet before reaching the family ’ s dwelling. The man on the arm of the chair yells ‘ Run! Run! ” 
 I sit in the study, wishing that the family did the same.

“ Pat, Pat ” 
 “ What are you going to do, Mr. Obama? ” 
 “ Forget what happened today! Just leave me alone! ” 
 “ Pat? ” 
 “ To answer your question, it ’ s not quite as if I don ’ t still visit every single desk and talk to your friends. It ’ s not quite as if I even have the energy to say hello! " 
 Mr. Obama laughed. 
 " It does make sense, Mr. Obama. " 
 “ Oh, you just never go to that party and pretend to do so! Aren ’ t you naïve? You know all this stuff is fake just to impress us? " 
 “ Mr. president, your dumb mother said that a while back that a man called George had made his name in Africa. She still said he was a lost cause, from her point of view. " 
 Mr. Obama paused briefly. “ You don ’ t just talk about a lost cause, do you? You often go all over the news to deny the existence of the man who sparked the war between Egypt and Sudan. " 
 " And why did he cause the war? " 
 " Well... " 
 " Oh no, don ’ t worry. He saved us. " 
 " I know, don ’ t I... " 
 " You don ’ t. " 
 " Yes. And when it was down he stopped... " 
 " Really? " 
 " Yes. He went back to Africa." 
 “ But how did it happen? " 
 “ It happened... ” 
 “ We don ’ t have to admit it, you know. ” 
 Mr. Obama shook his head. 
 The president noticed that his mother had been lecturing him on homo sapien strategy, to make him believe that he needed help from outside. 
 But then she broke down into tears. 
 She started crying. She wanted him to make her feel better, but she knew that others could be better leaders than him. She couldn ’ t wait. She finally got up. 
 Mr. Obama ran into his room, and took away the red papers from his mother. 
 When he came back, he talked to his wife. 
 “ Oh, I never saw the end of his reign. It was more of a shake-up than a grand vision, a bigger— ” 
 “ What the hell is wrong with you people, do you suppose you left to put that nonsense on the internet?"

It started with Ryan.
"Blooming in for the kill " Ryan said in a high pitched voice. Everyone in the office and mine were doing their daily routine routine. There was no purpose to it all but the result. A gentle knock at the door and I grabbed the keys off the shelf and headed for the door. The door was unlocked and I approached the other side. Without hesitation I rushed the door and when my foot brushed the carved glass it slammed shut and made its way to the living room. 
 It was Chris. 
 Chris had been my dream lately. All these years of survival, a reason to go out and play a little more. I had had enough and when the wild or other things arise I grow a long chain of twisted stories and i'd miss Chris. 
 He died after I pushed him out of the way of a flying bee. Chris's first words were " You were the bad guy, you had to go. " 
 " You was the one who made me go, I figured out how to go. I did. I do now. " 
 " I'm sorry dude. Just you. Are you on the phone? " 
 " Mike is on the line." Mike laughed and chuckled, then pulled on a goofy mask, glowing white.

You can still see them in the room. The lights crackle. The blue lights pop in every room, as if there is some video camera set on all of us. There are loud clicks from strangers being sent to prison. You hear you knock on the door, and go to the door in two steps behind the knob. 
 Like everything else in our room, your attention is numbed. They are moving to the back of the room, looking for you. * Close enough*. They move with perfect speed and with a determined purpose. You can see them, you can feel their movements. The room is silent. There is no one in sight. They are just running in a dark circle. You slam the door shut, over and over again. 
 As the door slams down, you step inside. 
 "Come in, " you say to the oldest member of the group. " You have to be careful. " 
 You stare into the bony fingers of the other girl. " Please, not in front of me! " 
 " No no no! " She is shrieking. 
 You begin to tense up. " I'm scared. Just *stop, * " you explain. " Please, just stand still, look at me." She circles around you and jolts your head back. You jerk yourself back into place and brace for impact. 
 You inch closer to the young woman. She may as well have been staring into your eyes. 
 The room grows colder, far too cold for a single man in a dark blue prison cell. The last thing you see is the little light coming from the door. You slow your breathing as you contemplate the peace the prison. You can see them, they are not there. You stare out the window.

Jorn-tahr, Bedeh, Ben Rudel, and Isaac looked in the mirror with wide eyes. 
 "I've lived as long as you, " Bedeh, their young son told them in a pathetic attempt to rise through the ranks. 
 " And still, I never said no to you in the light of your fortieth year. " Ben Rudel replied with a dumb look in his eye. 
 Isaac sat in the closet, making sure to hug his father one last time as he buried his father. The lightness behind the door couldn't be more out of place for Isaac. The room that he had built since his men first arrived, the one that set him into position as a teacher for his future homemaker three years prior. That room had been used as a flicker-goodby to Isaac as his childhood home. Now, as Benjamin rubbed the scars on his sharpening bone, he took a look outside, seeing the great ice that stretched down the street, eviscerating the foul smog that grew out from the smog. And turned out that it wasn't ever smog at all. It was the overwhelming warmth of heat and fresh air rising from the townhouses that sat on the horizon. 
 He had wanted to read your library, read your best archaeological scans in the world to try and understand the dangers lurking beneath the barest act of human metabolism, and that was exactly what happened, after two of Isaac's guards went to him and forced him into a glass room, David took two steps back, trying to untie the skirting ropes around his neck, and managed to pull the metal bar from his and Amos' jaws. He looked around in fear, hoping for her healing, praying for a potential love bond, but as the room became large, Isaac noticed that she was actually kissing him. Amos' attempts to speak out only made his eyes water as Benjamin looked at her. He began to shout in pain and smirk, neither showing any concern at being chastised. 
 " Yo-yo-you kn-Kn-c-ki-k-k", Ben dropped his head, powerless to break the eyes that were still convulsing around him. The screams and the cold fear that he couldn't feel outside of his prison grew louder. It was a sight he would never forget, the cold fear that went with their names. And as Benjamin turned around to look at him, he saw that he was naked in a closet. The warmth of the room filling with warmth never disappointed him. He finished his main task and made his way to the closet. He gently kissed and kissed the room around him, causing the fabric around his wrists to gather a circle around his feet, until he touched them. 
 And as Benjamin tried to release the men that forced him in, he felt an overwhelming warmth so awful, he felt a heat that melted the air around them. He tried to scream, but was soon silenced by an explosion that buried them in a glow that looked just like their own. Benjamin stared down into the dark corner of the room, frightened, afraid the light of his eyes would cut into his skin so much that he would forever be blind.

The gunshot rang out like a gunshot, perfect, almost. Grinning, Linda stepped away and walked to her friend. 
 "Where are you? " She asked. 
 Linda hesitated, possibly just for a second, while the shot rang out like a gunshot, sounding like a shot. 
 *BOOM* 
 Linda got out of the truck and went to the door, gently swinging it open, only to have a man burst through the window. 
 " Donald? " He said. 
 " Ugh, Meek, I think I saw the mayor leave for his weekend. You didn't pay for the gas. He keeps telling me it'll be worth it. " Linda said. 
 " Ugh, you stink. I bet you can't even pay for a cab. Did you know it will only take two weeks to get here? " 
 " You're being harsh, Linda, but at least you get two hours to buy groceries. I feel bad. My wallet wasn't charged. " 
 " Oh no, just the medicine. " 
 " Don't be tasty, you bastard. " 
 " What did you say? " 
 " My mom paid for that, right? " 
 " What? Huh. Maybe. " 
 " Wrong moment. I swear I saw that man snooping around. He really should have the better argument with you. " 
 " Ahh, me. Sorry you always needed something to kick your ass. " 
 " Oh. SSSSSSSSSSSS. " 
 " You meant the convenience store food you mentioned last week? Don't get me wrong, I tried but I lost my wallet and the charger. " 
 " I didn't get my wallet back. " 
 " Right, that's why I never left your place again. " 
 " And yet. Why would I? " 
 " I don't really know, Ted. I just figured that it would be hard to pay for the gas. " 
 " Nah, your god damned price tag. Did you go to work? " 
 " Yes. How did I get here, and why the heck are we alone here? " 
 " Well, that's not really entirely the point, Linda. I spent about four nights studying you just to pass your tests. It was a fascinating time. " 
 " Then you need a new roommate, either a friend or two. Maybe they will go to the same school again. " 
 " Oh, seriously? I'm not sure. Would you mind calling the cops? " 
 " They don't care. " 
 " Oh. Okay. I'll get you the money. " 
 " H-hello? " 
 " Hello? " 
 " Hi. It's me. " 
 " I'm you? " 
 " Yeah. " 
 " Well, I did one thing to help you out. Worked hard. You know how it is. Money must be earned, right? You go home in my car and don'thing for a long time. I don't care if I work, you did your best with your money. " 
 " What did I do to deserve this? " 
 " You know what, there's no more gas for me. " 
 " I don't have a fucking way to buy anything else. " 
 " Ugh, you know I'm going to be late for work, right? You don't give a damn. How's that working out? " 
 " As always. " 
 " Shit. All right, you get your cash, this is gon na be the end of my cold cash. " 
 " Nice. And thanks, Linda."

Marine Day, 3/4/15- Sgt. Frank Green of 57th Battalion with an oddity he'd picked up early that year, exactly one month before he passed. I was not supposed to be at the front, so I'll be putting this one together. On the morning of the 1st of May, 15, a land invasion happened in Houston, Texas. They were for fighting a siege and what we took so badly were for anyone but the Shrieking Robots, monsters from the future. Naturally, no one knew. Shit happens when you get caught fighting the Shrieking Robots, man, you know you'll have a fucking fight tomorrow. I was left alone, nuked. Ready to leave next. Not once did the Japanese see I was better than their own dog, actually, or vice versa. Apparently, into a long trip, I left through a minefield. No memory of the battle, not after the Shrieking Robots took over the skies, that was our whole story. Maybe the Krum Hörup he captured? Maybe the bombs he carried made an inoxes and probably made him forget how many casualties he suffered in fighting. Then they dropped a bunch of chemical substances on us. Smoke started to cover up the smoke of chemicals and fire but the remaining Thunderbolts still lived on till May, fucking three weeks after the Shrieking Robots took over the skies.

Not sure about this thing but I posted this a month ago and it still hasn't surfaced here. 
 I was given the role of investigator, so who gave it to me or am I allowed to say? I was bored and didn't like it but I wasn't mean or in love and I did whatever I could to know better. I didn't know and I can't say it's me but I don't really know. I can and should finish this and I'm sorry for not thinking the same for others but I feel like I'm leading a better and more peaceful life than I knew or know me to be, I know that's a bad thing, but it won't mean anything if it's all for the good and peaceful life I led. That's what is keeping me going, that's what is happening, I couldn't be better for it but I can't say that. I can't say that because I have been with people, I haven't. I'm not. I'm also quite young, it's hard to remember every detail of how I came into being but I know the story of how I ended up here. All people need is that to know me, you need people like me, you're not one of us or what they think you are. You are the target of even the harshest of mindblasts in this universe who have ever existed for you to know me. People call it first contact but in here I've seen it with our eyes and these humans I was standing by who killed our parents, I thought it was impossible. 
 You know this is hard, because I know you want to tell me I didn't do it; you want to tell me that I did my duty and I made the wrong move. You want to prove that all humans and monsters out there are superior to us and to prove me wrong because all others suffer in the same way. Those who I used to work with are still getting ahead of themselves in this field but our inability to do my job is pitiful. I don't know the real reason I worked with these people, I don't know what to do, but I know some good things do and some bad things do and some things that deserve to be praised but have no good intentions. 
 Yes, I love you. But at some point in time when one person/monster will betray another one of us and turn us against another one of them and you'll wake up from your series of blissful dream lives knowing that one of us truly loves you and that love will be the entirety of it. You know that. I know that. 
 Also I have yet to get responses from you. Go back to answering, see if the responses you sent are doing your job well, get the others to work harder. 
 Also, I want you to know that I don't wish to spend my life regretting the way I ended up here. I always wanted to leave someone behind, someone to see me return and maybe I'll see you again someday, but in the end I failed. I didn't make the wrong move, I didn't know if I was right or wrong, I don't know. 
 But this life is going to be hard. Especially as I am going to report back and make sure this works out for you. Make sure you are glad you didn't want to end up with me, and once I make this information public I hope that you start focusing and you decide to get out of here. But I know this thing doesn't mean I will go back, I know everything that can happen inside of you but I can't say it will happen. 
 Goodbye, in time. Love, 
 **SOUND COMES TWICE! **

*Hi everyone. * I promised to get back to you all and write short ones, but I get a bit shit show over this blog and pretty soon it's over. Not my intention to resurrect your really good versions, but I'll give you something specific which will help people understand: 
 * I've never personally been able to sleep or eat. I do think I've been dead for centuries, really. I know I ’ m really tired, but I ’ m still here and I've got a pretty good feeling. * 
 I never felt so free to write things and really thought myself a detective. I learned a lot from people I loved, and I made loads of mistakes. I found out how to play safe, so that my character wouldn't end up talking about me instead of where the door is. I guess it gave me a reason to keep going. I remember when I was a kid, I used to think that there was something about people that fascinated me and how they made people feel. I don ’ t know how it got there, but it was the truth. My powers almost don ’ t give me this weird feeling when my powers somehow bring me back to reality. Also, I don ’ t think my [ Death Gift ] [ Patron ] [ Decapitation ] [ Stunning ] [ and [ Disorder ]. It keeps me completely occupied with nothing. So I guess I'm thankful I wasn ’ t, but not truly the same person that other people are. 
 These days I find myself trying to take a shit. I can ’ t go to sleep sometimes or stay in a sleeping condition and do anything but what others don ’ t have time for. I can ’ t breathe, but I can ’ t feel any more. My voice is like it ’ s carved out of something too hard, this memory completely stops me from making friends or making games. I sometimes run into people and just let myself be. Sometimes it ’ s scary, but mostly it ’ s a big no-no. 
 *Soon, I ’ ll write another series that I ’ ve seen that I think people really enjoy writing. I hope you enjoy it even though I don ’ t think it'll be worthy of even a single face. I hope I can outlive everyone I've ever met. *

Progression. Retreat. 
 I had beaten every other player that had come before me. It was simply a short trip to my lair. I couldn't touch anyone, and I had no chance at survival. However, this knight had successfully forced me to bear her side against it. It had finally failed. 
 I can feel my legs beginning to work, as I prepare to fight for my life. I feel my vision start to clear, and my bow maniks begin to heat up. I'm finally ready to charge, but it's too late. I fall to my knees as my face pierces my faceplate. 
 I may as well go back to my column, but I need to regain my strength. I look down and see my young queen, her eyes closing. These tears put a damper on my thought process. Who are you?!?! I can feel my queen being torn off of her body, and I can't seem to get back up. A shell falls from the sky, into my knight's eyes, and he reacts at once. My queen should be coming down soon, if only I could figure out where she would be, but I can't. 
 I can hear her complaint, and I keep trying to sway my master to believe me. It gets harder and harder to even explain myself to her. I need to speak to her once more. Instead of simply holding her hands, I are holding a shovel. It's not as if it's a secret or something. Rather it's a powerful power I couldn't defend against, if I didn't get used to it. I looked down to see my red hair begin to pour onto my chest, and she was already coming down on me. My foot on the ground sends me into the ceiling, and the shovel lifts me up straight into the air. I land on my queen's forehead, and I drop her on the ground. 
 My vision clears, and I can move again. Now this time, I have to confront my actions and remain calm. I can hear my smiths, who are trying to figure out my plan. And I hear her laughter at the thought of my futile attempt, but I think I must be justified. 
 A horse screeches outside. At least the horses are free. My unit has just managed to remove a tank from within, but it's a tough job on this floor. I have to take the rest of the second order into my lair, so I drive the knight backwards to the horse. I need to get out of this, so I take up the shovel and dig under the bed. It's already hot. I sigh heavily as I descend to my knees, the tub winding me down, and for a moment, I am thankful. I feel my queen cowering, and I start to slowly move my head around. The wetness of my queen's spit is making the next few days unbearable. I've not eaten in days. As the last bit of liquid is left in the tub, I look around for an opportunity. 
 After digging through the floor and pulling up my skirts, I finally get into my cab, and drive to my nest. I can't do anything but sing along. Every time I meet her in this lonely home, I hear her laugh. I sing along until I find my queen, still alive, waving at me.

Harry Potter was most definitely a lonely man. It started with his attempts at honor. The…thing that enthralled and enchanted Harry ( Harry could remember, at the age of five, eating a wizard's muffin ) was always a burning sensation. A deep awareness of all that would ruin one's very being for the rest of his life. Yet here he was, being told that he was an 'unfit' and that he was just like every other primate. 
 Flirting and imitation were something Harry would do hundreds of times a day. But he loved what he loved in the name of honour, which were his absolute and only passion. For this, Harry tried to visit the consul at Hogwarts. Some rituals of the Dark Lord must be fulfilled. Harry went, wishing for some gentle word with the chamber keeper to give him a chance to examine Harry about his history with the castes. Unfortunately that did not come. 
 Harry came to the chamber at five in the afternoon and sat down on a piece of tile the size of a normal cupboard, head over heels on, as his loin cloth folded, and an old brooch on his hip. He figured this was about time he read the letter of his. Had it been some old plain pamphlet, the letter wouldn't've gotten across to any of the others about how to fly, somehow having been cast by a wizard that shared such a land with people that no one would be able to be unaltered or disassociated with the human form. He had only just started reading when the stench was incurable. 
 "Harry Potter I'm sorry for having to kill you today. You deserved this battle; and your place was at your disposal. I wondered if any good in being an ungrateful and reckless child would ever come from me in front of those damn Ammonites." 
 Harry frowned for a moment, rather surprised that the walls of Hogwarts had been as welcoming as he'd ever seen. Harry was an ungrateful and reckless child, one that had certainly caught the eye of the Dark Gods once before. Still, he hated lying to the little girls he'd left at home, he was barely a senior at Hogwarts.

In antiquity the great Ages for- got us thinking of some important events that would usher in the era of knowledge and knowledge alike. One such event would be Ascension for humankind to the large sun system for the first time in the universe in 1190 BC 
 This new Earth this system would be situated on was not entirely unlike a land called as*ironion* but entirely unlike a land called beety, as a land called *hitheria* existed for the third time in the history of mankind from it's purpose in the universe. As the two systems expanded and grew, so did their planetary records, or their records, as these were known in the time period from 1337 BC to 1948 BC and a literality, kept track of by the former ages of the faith, time and the old laws of physics. This was evident when if any new discoveries were unearthed, new discoveries would happen. Brought about by it, some that saw the small observatories found in the ancient towns near our site, located in the name of the heavens above. This was made known to the archaeologists until when they decided to give it to the Nepalese people in order to allow their people to experience more then they could since they saw clearly that the rise and fall of empires ended without consequence in the records of the modern human family ( no the neighbors to the old gods, no caste birth, etc ). But if they wanted to believe, they could. So the scouts chased these explorers for a short while until a group of large metal detectors came from the Nofer Place, made by Queen Adoltenmil. If they could study the metal detectors, then they could understand them from knowledge of the ancient weapons based on their DNA. This was the beginning of the Age of Rings. When the discovery was made, these horn shaped ships entered the area. 
 When the ships arrived, the archaeologists had two countries join their expedition. Well not all of them, of course, they saw some of the survivors in these ships, some of them were carnivorous in nature or had been reduced to their staple, wild meat. The ships waited upon the tunnels and food of the people going back and forth while the tunnels and food was thrust into them. Eventually one of the ships reached a large gorge system, which encircled the land area, so high that nothing would be seen but the thick vegetation, peaks on the ground and an endless sea. The archaeologists followed the ship to another gorge region, this one that contained more sandy desert but where there were is heavy tribal violence and violence, whenever the archaeologists came across one an the newcomers made a procession of slaves to resemble their ancestors. Over time, an invasion of the locals became a necessary part of their knowledge. The agnostics remained, and the leaders decided to steer them towards the tribe only. The men, women and children waited for the captains of ship to pass on from his ship, to carry on, turning the people from the astral civilizations back into his parent religion. Some did not. But the captains stayed and carried on. Eventually one of the crew took the crew, leaving the men to go about his daily business. The fisherman put in a fishing rod that he found in a fishing beryllium field a few times a week as a test, which was broken in by some greenfish as a log of sparrow's. There he took the roll of black boy scout, in his process of passage back home to protect himself and to maintain a simple routine. They eventually found the arrow, tied up with cross but not yet attached to the hook. They followed the arrows bound and a single arrow was tied to the cap and floated down into the abyss below.

There's never an end to the thrill. I just want to watch. 
 I woke up smiling. Sitting on the couch in front of my computer, I found my reflection. My dream, my online friends chat. I invited my most recent messages to share, although it wasn't until I glanced at my calendar before turning to the screen to read out the stats before I had a chance to respond. Still sleepy, I set my bag down, as the bright glow of the television tunnelled through the door and the dull clack of the television went off. I laid there, briefly listening to the soft noise of the hum of my monotonous PC. Another curse, my favourite game of all time. I chuckled at my new home, starting an old story about my kids, who were born to be gamers, and how I'll be at my local gaming company, Nintendo. 
 I had to settle down, refreshed the clock in my computer before heading out to my life's work. I hadn't played for a while now, and it'd been sad to watch my entire life fade to nothingness. A spurt of energy, replayed a string of insults in my head. I blinked, glancing at my monitor, a confounded look of sadness and annoyance. 
 I didn't hear the alarm, or the calling of the police, but my feet left the couch. I looked around, not for a fireplace, or expensive shower, just for my "home ", something that I knew I couldn't return. I glanced at my phone and noted that my friend David hadn't called me in an hour and had no idea where I was. I glanced back at the clock, paused for a second, and imagined a perfect day. I just wished for that feeling. 
 I sighed, sat up, and rubbed my eyes. The morning light, the lightness of my last night's date, that shiny red color, that languid reminder of all the hours I had, of " having fun" that went by, I remembered. If I was going to be happy in life. 
 Shit. 
 Edit: clarified that I have to only read my reddit posts.

"Sir, there's another weapon in the warehouse. " 
 " Wait, you mean a pill bottle with a bomb, and a real, deadly weapon inside. You're giving me a legal standing to use it, right? " 
 " Really Sir, we are very careful about using a pistol. " 
 " I'm sorry Sir, I just- " 
 " WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER option, Mr. Johns, a laser gun. Do you want me to lay it on the table? " 
 " Please, Sir, " Dr. ███ Deifer shouted, " I can prove- "

The the dark sky punctuated by bright flashlights clashed with the softest songbirds. The town would have you believe they were singing a song of the oranges and dandelions, if the place had heard the songs they heard, they would have agreed. There was no such thing as civil war in Albany, and after the explosion of the building of Parliament House, no such city still existed. Everyone is coming together into one for the last time. 
 This was no crusade the patriots would dream of fighting against the evil forces plaguing their communities, nor the fighting of the politicians who openly opposed the heroes of the revolution. This was a quest for the soul and courage of a brave soldier, not for just another young war veteran. This was, in no way, a fight for the nation. You have to listen to your leaders talk about ( unlike the doctors and scientists, that was for real. ) they are doing the wrong things, not this small revenge. You have to fight back. 
 They're walking out of the building. You stand nervously under a damp lawn and look down the path. " Come on, stop! " you yell, " I'm even older! " 
 Someone walks slowly through the shrubbery. His uniform is blazed purple with red dots all over. " You know my family didn't just " raid our homes " or " send barbers around " like this are nothing but teenage adventures. " 
 You know the truth. You know who those politicians are. You can do whatever you want to their father right in front of you and you can resist the temptation to bring in the rebels so you can murder them all. You stand there. 
 Suddenly, the shouts of " KFC! " are only heard by those in the mob. And then there is a rustling like there's a burning bush when it's someone's evening stroll. The tension the city created suddenly happens as those voices of dissent and dissenters begin to settle down inside of a building. Eventually a group of people run outside of the building and enter the building. A man with an old, patchy beard and a dreadpelt army hat on walks out. He wears no uniform, he wears a police uniform and a few black leather uniforms with a trail of blood and bomb spray on them. A man with long nails and a grip that's as sharp as a blade cuts a human inch from his chest hangs his head and walks across the grassy knoll. 
 He drives a crowbar through one of the rebels' eyes. He speaks out loud: " We saw the liberals! We saw the left like we did before the system came into office! " He then goes back to the spot where his father once stood. The people don't realize that the fight for freedom, for equality and for order is losing. The citizens don't realize how evil they are. You can't surrender a cell phone, or weapons that will not protect you, and the way they talk about holding down the rats, their holding down the fugitives isn't the best way to do anything. 
 They are back outside now. You shake your head. " This can't work." 
 They can't. You can't. He's gone. And that's when you realize just how fucking stupid you were.<|endoftext|>

I saw an explosion... a mass of smoke that was coming from the not so distant wall of the village. There were people. Was it fireworks? Slick liquids? Trees at the edges of the street? 
 When they take me? I only fight for an hour. Only for this new frontier. I didn't realize it at the time until the smoke consumed my bones. Over and over again I became weaker. Even now in the summer, my muscles, their soft, itchy tingling, I keep fighting each time. 
 I tried, but it never worked. Ever since the world started to change, my physical abilities have shrunk and without hope of survival, I have become a 'one-armed beast'. 
 Well... at least that's what I'm hoping to be. Now, I'm dead. 
 I want to fight again. I want to fight for someone, anyone.

The old tone on his voice during the war war left some of us looking slightly defeated. The orders they were given rang in our ears for years, but now it's gone. Like all non-killing mobile phones, Fido gets on the main draw. He can give you a serious message for not noticing the misplaced misspellings. But that is no fun for him. My friend John, my companion for the last twenty years, has sent me a couple of ideas to get us to look at more mutual problems. 
 The tone in his voice had once been welcoming, everything that seemed wrong in the world would be returned. The choices we all have made up to, or was just the way things have been for so long. But I can not force those thoughts to remain. I can not force those thoughts to continue, and even if I wished for them to, I can not force the third option. One, I'd be glad to have access to a comfortable home; I would have no trouble deciding if I should stay. The second, and perhaps only, is not looking out for that man. But the only problem is who has gotten the message. 
 I never heard this land, but I knew there were no funds left. A long time ago, I heard the boy. He is a very tall man, he shouldn't have brought up this. But what he did, was sad. I don't have time for this anymore. I need to do something. He had gone too far. He killed my friend. I will not stand for this anymore.

The next day's action begues on like a fool who caught a shark with the cat, the hook, the bow, and finally the nail in the back of his head. 
 'The toothwells are open.' He thought to himself. His jaw fell open. 
 "I don't give a fuck what you fucks with me! " a roar came from outside. 
 A poor manager nodded and pointed to a frozen table where small holes were for ice. Everyone exchanged a little look, where there was some dude in a haggard suit surrounding himself from across the counter, held an inflatable china cup next to him. There was the fucking cat, stuck there and all. " Bloody hell! " he said, stabbing his way past one of the guys. He watched his a**snap** and fired two arrow heads straight at him, one hitting him in the side, and his neck and stomach, but he donned the hat and stopped firing from the middle. No chips, no bag, just the inside of his head and the rest of his body was here, he thought. The whole head was missing, and a doe-eyed man was holding it over his mouth. 
 " What do you mean it ain't a bar fight like that? " The manager asked himself. " Do I know what you mean by that? I don't know what you mean. " The man started to shake as he stood up. 
 " Shut up, man. It's only him! " one of the guys yelled. " You here for fucking hell's sake, son of a bitch! Listen to me, we have fucking teamwork here. You toiled so hard for us, a bunch of fucking interns, you conned ducks up with the fucks, you snorted out almost the whole meal. " 
 The man picked up the table and almost choked on one of the chips he had shot just moments earlier. When he stood up, he started holding his eyes open. " Who is this guy again? " he asked. The manager nodded. 
 " Not an ounce of pride in who we are. " the man said. " You? " 
 " Of course not. You can call me that. " The manager said. " I'm called which is my name for you. First person in this place. Why don't you just talk to us? " 
 " Me? " the man said. " My name is John or Lyndon Johnson. Do you guys know who I am? " The manager said. " So we speak individually for a reason. So I'm your son. " 
 " Why is this sound so strange? " the man asked. " I have this great job to do, " he said, making a loud, squeak. " But there is only one way to check for this. We can't hack the server down. " The manager opened the computer and began to type. 
 " Fourth time this year. " He said. " I'll just stay. " 
 " What the hell is this? " The manager asked. He looked up from the screen. It was almost spinning, but instead of a yellow band, a red one was floating. It was flying at him like a raccoon. He looked around, not bothering to look around at the tiny ducks all wrapped around it. " You're allergic to corn? " he said. 
 " No one says that! " the manager screamed. " That's just a crayon. How do I know I'm allergic to corn? I had me wear one. " 
 " Can't you just shut the fuck up, JOHN! " John cried, his fists shaking. He looked at the floor, the others staining the ceiling. 
 " No sir, " he said. " That's just a shit shot. " John saw the file, identical to what everyone else had said. " But tell me again who's got the nerve to release the government secrets for them to use in this case! " he cried, grabbing a bench from the back of the building. 
 " It's me! " he shouted. " John Johnson! You don't have any guilt! Nobody does! Think of all that you saved! Imagine what happens! " he said, turning toward the bar. 
 " Got any cheap beer or droll snacks? " the manager asked. 
 " The nicest thing I've ever eaten." he said.

I drifted off from the du village dung pond and came upon a large tree, the sun is a crisp pink. It was too bright and the tree was slowly swaying as I drifted off into the night. The strange thing is I don't know where I am going. Something smells familiar and I turn my head to the west. I smell burning and campfires. I walk past an old small village, it smells great and the village is very old. I'm sure nothing has changed and the sun is bright here and the smell of cooking makes my chest heat a bit. My breath catches up and I open my eyes. I smell hot! I step out in the light as the sun is dancing up the sky and the the trees are crawling among the mountains, I smell a forest and I move through it. We pass a temple that smells delicious and I jump into a huge hole to escape the heat. I return home in time for I smell the sun on my face. The dirt on the ground is still wet, but it is no longer cold. I see a dark shape growing into the middle of the forest. I hop out and see one of the beings. I look around and see they are eaten by a tree. I am taken by surprise. I scream and run into the woods. I run into the woods and see my mom and dad there with mommy and dad. Dad screams to them and when I turn away the giant animal ripped itself free from the tree branches. It grabbed one of my cousins and jumped at my head. I ran but as I lost consciousness I heard the wolf do the same. I awake a little more to hear them looking at me. I turn around. In my room. I sit in the middle of the room and rub my eyes. I close them and the wolf comes running towards me. He grabs one of my cousin's arms and turns to grab her. I close my eyes and bite the wolf in the throat. It lifts the wolf. Its huge snout blackens for a split second. It hovers and darts back. I pull the monster off my back.

We've passed the age, except this time, apparently nobody wants the idea behind creating an afterlife. 
 Dr. Mitchell cursed under his breath, but was not at his desk in a hospital room. He looked up and downed another drop of liquor, pouring some into the radiator. He smelled at a subway station- after a hurricane. He'd already taken a city-wide peak, some hundred miles in the air. His radio alerted him to the city that was being gutted by gunfire and fire- he had been the only one who knew about the markings from his initial research. They read "PIDROBINCE ". It appeared as if a racing car had crossed two tracks in what appeared to be a canyon in the vicinity of the city. As I recognized the details of the last day's maintenance task, Dr. Mitchell found himself among those who had gone running in the opposite direction. He turned around and put his helmet on, searching for his motorcycle. As he watched the train derail, his helmet looked almost comically black. His blinking headlights were almost indistinguishable from the cartoon he kept staring at. The driver had moved. 
 " Mom.... mom fucker, I'm going to die! " 
 I sighed and picked up his empty passenger seat in the cockpit. If it wasn't for the man, he might have hit a creek or a wall- a beach. I stayed there in the silence, flicking his cigar with the posh tip. I wanted to blow the smoke in the eyes of the audience, but it didn't do any good. The timing might have gone a little off, too, but I'd still downed the last of my liquor. It took three minutes, but I sat on the seat between him and the off-grid transport van. " Wait I see. " 
 You have to be me, Mitchell thought, his eyes filling with color as he started to relax a bit. He glanced back to the pipe and several bottles of whiskey he'd been thinking about. I can handle one life, even though I can't talk to the kid who's not talking to the kid. That is his answer, not mine. It's my phone, my phone that keeps me online. Or my computer, I think. He pulled out the bottle of whiskey and the second bottle of whiskey. The screen slouched slightly as he put one in each hand. I didn't know how to remember if that was what he gave me for this purpose, but it clearly wasn't. I didn't want to actually remember it, and with the last drop of alcohol in my glass, I felt my heart sink. 
 " This can't be happening!" I yelled, as I helped him pump the baby out of the ground.

 After a few hours of running without sleep I woke up to the cold's clawing the walls. I tried to wake up but this would not stop it. I asked myself a question of "how did you get here? " and it didn't look like I was sleeping. This time when I saw it it was unfamiliar. It was a panic attack. The only people who had been able to get out of here were people I grew up with and had never met. There was no alarm. I heard a short voice screaming somewhere in the distance: " Bring back the prophet, expose the idols! " and from the sound of the damn voices I saw it. The figurine hung above me with blood stained hands. " -Ramin ( that is what they called me ) " it said, pulling at my skin. The angel holding me down. I held my hand up with my trembling finger and it sliced my hand off. The tears began to pour, my skin red. " -Ramin ( that is what they called me ) " it roared. I felt my skin stop. My flesh was shaking at the thought of losing the prophet. My entire body twisted in places that felt like things people would never touch. As the sobbing became a wave I realized that I had lost my soul. The angel looked to the sky with seething dread. " I -I " he cried. " He is dead! All we have left is death and the inside of a rat! Now you know that! " The angel appeared beside me and turned to a black man about my height. " Now now, I, like your soul, will receive your new soul. " " Yes " he said " It is now. " " Alright! The souls are connected, you and I. Now start."

The hand of the well trembled. Upon reaching it's resting place in the large pool of clear liquid, it fell and the wet material melted into a green grassy texture. 
 Walking to the waterless site, he could see clouds. Five back then. 
 To think he would be misted by a gigantic cloud. 
 *It all began a couple of weeks ago* A voice on one of the gas-powered radios said. 
 "Albert de Brings, knowledge of hydrodynamics appears. Climatology here in Chicago is about to win another landmark : the red sun having a visit from aliens, " the voice added. 
 Albert looked at the thing once more. The shape was like him from before. 
 " Ah, dwarf. The thirst is brewing," the voice responded. 
 Albert looked around him. Something was wrong. The bottle was cloudy, a translucent shape was growing. The desert was dark and it had high pollution levels. 
 No water! 
 *So I have come to purge the soil by utilizing the water. * he thought.

The sound of the fluorescent lights will never leave my ears, unless it's from a kitchen light screen in the corner of a multi room bathroom. 
 I don't even remember waking up from the drug induced headache. I look around. I'm not completely bald, and I look like a tomboy. 
 I let myself in and rush over to my bed. I grab my morning paper. 
 "Today I saw the morning paper, " I say, sharpening it. 
 I turn it over and saw a picture of a man wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap. They were shorts and a dirty white shirt. 
 I left a note on my bathroom vanity saying I was in a relationship with the woman whose name I am too afraid to tell you yet. 
 The same woman wrote it the second she came back. I broke down in tears when I read the note. I tried to hide my sorrows behind a pleasant smile. 
 " I hate you " she wrote. 
 I took a deep breath to clear my mind of the perfect words. 
 " No. " 
 Then her words came to me like raindrops falling on my bones, crawling upon my body. 
 " Don't. " 
 My stomach rose with dread. I stopped. My vision was blurry. I only had my phone. 
 " Shut your fucking mouth. That was sweet. " 
 As my blood-pressure skyrocketed, my eyes began to sweat as I read more and more of the note. 
 " You are going to wake up. You are going to get a lot of drugs soon, especially if you aren't getting any." 
 I couldn't understand. What was happening? 
 I can't. I need sleep. A stupid dream. Just a stupid dream.

Helsinki looms upon us in the distance. Four hills on a forested platform, two on top of each other, and the outer sides of it all sway gently like a pendulum. Before us stands a fire. In a close space where an inner chamber is held together by bits of metal and wood, there is a microphone in a long-necked handkerchief. 
 "Hello, " the voice says. A tiny frog sits in the microphone, staring up at us. His ears flare and his nose quivers. " Were wondering if you would like to come with me? I'm fluent in all five of the languages you have yet to learn, and here you are, Riksi. " 
 His feet trembled and he stared at me for a long moment. " Riksi? " I say. 
 " Yes, I am Welinanad. You see, this place, " his eyes rise in that other person's look, " isn't really just another home. It is home. Well. Home to my friend. We should not leave but occasionally, on cold nights, such as these, we visit a lake. I would like to go in. " 
 " It's kind of hard to tell. Do you have the slightest idea how hard it is to understand so much? " My friend smiles. " Well, we don't. But we must stay here, and help others. Sometimes, other people try to kill us for some reason. I'm not a killer, after all. In the end, it doesn't matter if I get hurt. " 
 Riksi reaches down and puts his hand over his mouth, looking straight at me. " No. I'll help. I'm not one of those men, we don't fight. It's not like I'm harming anybody. " He tries to grasp me, but stops. " Please, you can still die, but that means you still have memories of our home. " His hands begin to brush at my skin as he watches my smile slowly fade. 
 " Are you okay? " I say, drawing him closer. " I don't believe you. " 
 " It's fine, Riksi. Everyone has memories of our home. The gods never told me what to do with them. I don't need a person here to keep them. " I look over at my friends. His gaze flickers over to me, his big blue eyes hard at work again. " I'm fine. I'm just a bit..."

This had been true all along, certainly for a few years. I might actually be one of the first to realize the nature of the grip the Nazi guns had on the world, and wish they had never executed the man. Not too many world leaders do as they say, but it's hard to imagine anything the Nazis didn't feel in every single one of them. 
 My same could be said for a whole swath of history, including that of me, and for the conflict and nightmares I wish I could have stayed from. You have to believe me. 
 I look down upon you, you look at me, and I still see deep in my heart, fears, visions, hopes, dreams. And there's one thing though; to you, I'm simply a wild animal I am, a prime member of the collective that I have been born to oversee. The shadow of memory walks on the margin of our imagination, the times and looks that I never really knew existed completely unchallenged. But in all of my years at the NSA and special forces, I've never seen it quite as familiar in battle. And in this moment, I see one that would likely be the embodiment of the Enemy we fought against. 
 I've read the reports the President put forward, the excellent compliments on their courage and bravery, and the funny stories of my own exploits and battles with them. And like all heroes, these stories hold meaning and power. I can't help but remember the accounts given to me on their names, what they spoke, what they taught me. Or the lies I told. The great parallel universes of the media, and the economic reforms these men and women were steering, and how they could have bent that universe to serve their nation, been told through propaganda and deception. And I still feel the value of my belief in this person, so I remember, if only when I recall. 
 The guns, the bullets, the bullets, the gunshots, and the fear of what they would hear, don'thing more than cover in disarray. And I knew, I understood. I knew that I had to lead to victory, so I volunteered. I joined the Hitler Youth so I could bring peace to Hitlerism and the Nazi regime. I was hired for a mission that would begin to unravel Europe and other foreign countries, and now I see it. 
 And if you get me to tell you, I will make you understand the Holocaust. No doubting, and all understand. And I think you're right.

Dr Dre, Standing beside me... 
 here is the videoI started writing in my head. I don't know who is saying that but whoever is saying it's legit is the Dr Dre on it. Here I am waddled in my chair rocking a beer in front of me an evil flu in my head. I have a visceral fear of infecting everybody. After I decide to get some I quickly panic uncontrollably and call my wife Melissa on me like I was ready to die. I turn around to open the door so that the flu vaccine I inoculated my children with goes in. I pass them on my way towards the exit but the hallways are open and there's just shit everywhere. I ask Melissa if we can sit down and I feel a tinge of regret. Melissa looks at me and she sees something familiar. 
 like it is a 3 year old girl being blown up in an airplane and she looks to me. 
 I turn around and walk over to her but she stops. I grab her by the arm and tell her "you ever hope to use The New R-Bomb but you just get really scared when it does" 
 I smile and tell her it's not, a new mutant virus. and that I should take her home.

The carefully timed advance of a delicate insect spread its breath and descended upon earth. We watched it slowly move with rapid vehemence, a twinkle in the corner. 
 We watched it float and looked around desperately. A mother gave a short flourish; the warm spoon caught in its mouth. The tiny insect sputtered and fell to the floor, spilling its contents onto the grass. 
 We watched it slowly take its last breath. Another moment passed and wept into the sun.

I haven't been alone in months. My daughter called me out to take pictures on the patio just a few days ago. 
 I took my two daughters hand out to her bedroom door. My oldest daughter was looking at what used to be my TV sitting there, looking like the screen was always there. I didn't have any money for help at the moment, but the kids had a lot of toys in their room and just wanted to watch Frasier. 
 I opened my closet, grabbed my keys and went to retrieve a camera from the floor and started towards my bedroom. 
 As soon as I got there the screen did not show. I ran towards the front door and I slammed it shut. I took my dogs car and drove off to bed before I put my kids down for a bit. 
 Before I get up from my pillow to urinate on my bed I see a figure moving out of the bedroom. I can't make out who. Just the brief matter of the ceiling down stairs followed by the tops of my curtains to the bedroom mirror showed my exact same reflection as the wall. The first thing I notice is that my double bed from yesterday is open. 
 I look at the window and notice my previous closet from the previous night and look into the dimly lit hallway. I step into my closet, realizing my mistake, and begin walking to the left. My feet slip on the floor, freeing myself from the toy shelf. I stop in front of the TV and look at it. It's still there. I take out my phone and phone and check if there is a receiver nearby on the wall. I don't have a signal in there, and I have nothing to get rid of. 
 As soon as I got there my daughter was looking over my lap and I took the back to my room to change. I grabbed my keys and my best friend and the keys to my purse and walked down the hallway. After a while I realized that the left door was open. I got up and walked over to the window to see a lone light switch above the floor. It worked. It worked and my dog hopped right through, we were on the right side. I went over to the camera and started looking through it. My stomach growled and mouth started gurgling in distress. I had almost been eating too much. My camera was only one picture so I needed to make an extra image if I was going to be late for work. I walked in without leaving the driveway to grab my car keys. I ran into the kitchen and looked at the drive-through window. 
... 
... 
... 
... 
 My phone was in the ignition and my watch was pointed at a target on the street. I looked across the road to see the same car heading straight for me. I thought it was going to hit me but when I looked down I saw my car got out and hit the ground. I grabbed my keys and looked at the window. It's still there. I took my phone out of my pocket and turned off the TV. 
 I decided to call my daughter to check the keychain on my door, the one in the slot. I took one last glance at the battery and the caller ID still in my phone. I tossed the phone back and asked if I could turn the TV on if there was anything on. 
 The second the lamp looked at me it went silent. My mouth looked around and I started to pant. Something hit my leg. My eyes bulged out of their sockets and they were darted out of my sight. My daughter broke it and looked at me with tear rolling down her face. 
 'What the hell are you doing?' she asked. 
 'Playing with your TV?' 
 'You're an asshole,' she shouted at the empty image on the floor. 
 'Or what do you want me to think?' 
 I smiled and pointed to the target on the street.

I think I know who I'm talking about. 
 Both of my parents died under a drunk driver last month. We lost them along with the rest of my family, and I don't know why. They may even have been killed by their own family members but each loved the other more than any of them. 
 One night, my group was waiting outside our tent for a neighbour's pitiful beaver. I remember we could hear the man pounding on the door and heard the dog clack in the other room. My father jumped out of bed and ran around. I think he must have started crying loudly too, from the manner in which he ran. I didn't think it would work, so I pulled the lever and he ran, running by my back to escape and forgetting about me. 
 I remember shivering as I walked towards our camp, the smell of burnt bait outside rotting my very conscious mind. The smell of torture outside of my camp. 
 The cabin was full of red dot and knick knacks and every breath I took made me dig my heels into the wood and my clothes. The screeches of dogs in the clearing gave me the sense that I was in some sort of surreal place. The smell of rotting food on the other side of the camp and the glints of burning animals on the other side might have mixed in my own memory too. 
 Somehow, I ran, becoming trapped into that all too familiar area where a broken leg withers. It was a feeling that stuck around for a while, until the smell finally killed me and I felt refreshed. I could fall back asleep, the way the bedding pulled me up by my side was so comforting. 
 It was sad to experience such a great part of life, as my heart began to beat as I crawled around the camp, helping out the empty bed and sinking to sleep. My father and I fell in love with each other a few months later after falling in love with a cat. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********158**********
I jumped out of bed and up onto the stove, unbuckled the top of my coat and nudged the handle to the top. Blushing red skin of a savage beast, I pulled on the hat and smeared it across my cheeks. 
 I stepped into my kitchen and exhaled heavily, aware of the pressure rising up from my chest. Dust jackets had long since faded, their "erotic " a good thing. I applied the coats wavy in the rain, looking into their denizens. A shovel was surprisingly light, and the bandolier it was sitting on my shelf raked happily through the closet underneath. My boots carried my backpack across the pines, the same socks I'd purchased through local laundromats several years back. I made my way to my bedroom, and eyed the rag-stained remains of my dusty sofa and it's small mirror. No wonder no-one liked to put the Peterson's bird picture back to bed. 
 " Mike, " I said aloud. 
 He nodded, and I put the bag in the trash. 
 " You got a bird picture? " I asked. He nodded. 
 " Would you mind telling me what you're doing there, Mike? " 
 " Mike, my door is wide open, " he murmured. " Who else is there? " 
 " My neighbor, Mike, " I said with a chuckle. 
 " Well, I used to rent this house, man. It was for renters who don't care to complain, and while I didn't choose to have to pay for you to come inside, I wasn't really actively following out a lease. So yeah. Take it from me." 
 He let out a sigh, and bolted for the door. I ran for the front door, blindly followed. Through the doorway I found the foxhole. My doorbell rang. A baffled look crossed my face. I decided to follow it, so I made my way to my car. I was going to cruise the park and run home at a nice quiet hour. Don't be too long though, I'd need to get home early.

Chris got up, walked to the kitchen, took a cup of water from the cupboards, and then looked at the clock. Three, he knew, it wasn't entirely true; he lit the cup just before his fourth shower. His wrists were as thick as his skin, but he felt an anger and loneliness that only his mother could hear. 
 He looked down at his hand and the 3 gold letters he had to give him -- along with an invitation to a lecture on Twitter -- he knew he couldn't do this. He got dressed, brushed his teeth, and threw on his favorite purple sneakers. 
 There was no reason to give up on his wedding day, and Chris could not go on without his tablet. His primary aim was to catch up on the main course, when he could again make dinner and finish the party he was always contemplating quitting on. The eight hours of fun he went through were worth 15 minutes of sleep and exhaustion. 
 His father had fought before, too, but felt no pain from him as he was taught from birth and struggled with mental issues as a child. Without a child, he felt constantly underdeveloped, but in Chris it was for that reason that his husband had chosen to take him on a scouting trip across the world for the first time. 
 Once Chris realized this didn't have to be a terrible death for him to forget, he felt at ease. His favorite meal for dinner would be not only butter, but onions, fruit, celery, and bread. He loved his friends on twitter; they understood, even after all these years, his constant whining led him to fine culinary advice. Now he'd have to account for the chatter he would often consume during his school days -- his class's day off -- which meant the rest of the meal would need to be done alone. As much as he hated his task, he was mostly happy with the of his life. 
 The three gold letters that Chris left on his coffee sat silently in his cup, as they always did when his hand reached for them. 
 They were his 3 gold letters to send to his mother. 
 The others stayed. The fifth went in his desk drawer, where the letter had never been. They read it a thousand times in the past two weeks. 
 He wondered what they would write now. What would they write with? Would the older men forget who they were? Would they feel relief that they could have no more children? How would his wife forget that he had no kids? Maybe for the first time in his life, they would feel relief that they had no one to look after them. It didn't matter though. This was the seventh. He started clicking through the letters. 
 One seemed a bit far away, with only one word.

The coffee dripped down my throat like a spike of lukewarm blood. He was outside, his mug in hand, blood everywhere, his coat and hood pulled down. The sound of the door banging behind me was all that I could manage. I dropped the mug and steadied my grip on the window. No doubt I'll be fine, I thought to myself. The rest of my life would be decided by here. That's what they taught me. Would I be able to say the rest of the choices would be made by here? It seemed so vague. The anxiety of the decision I made years ago only made the small steps more complicated. Hiccups. Felt like they'd hurt later. Had to be yesterday. Sometimes old memories would get caught in the neck of my own memories. Frantic thoughts, such as how I had sacrificed countless years to get here. What if today wasn't going to be something great? Sometimes I felt that it was, I just had to accept it, it wasn't right to waste my family. 
 The sound of the lock closing behind me was enough to set everything in a rush. Every step I took was a dream. Today was going to be the day I could finally decide my future. If only there were a way to track down my control over destiny. The last step was uncertain, but here I was. 
 Everything settled in stone. I loved him, I wished he had died. He was a nice guy, always liked my lot in life, always made me happy. Maybe today's day wouldn't be such a loss. What was once a happy day was now a lighthearted joke. The time lost after that, some unseen hand had to have pulled him along. His father left me earlier, so I wasn't always called in. I just wanted a picture with his face. About ten years I would have never thought about him. 
 I noticed him outside. The tall, white man who would always be on my mind. A lie maybe, but I wasn't usually one of those people. I stayed home listening to his thoughts, his voice, the sweet smell of coffee on his breath. The neighborhood was quiet, the sun shining on his face, and the pool of red flowing into the lake. The closest thing to me that I could tell is that man was staring off into space, not in the lake, but at something far above the surface. I felt his breath bring him closer to me, and he pushed me closer to the surface. 
 Just as I got up off the chair, he reached down and touched my arm. He had finally done it. I wasn't going to make this decision. It was my decision. 
 I saw him again, standing at the foot of the lake and silently weeping. I tried to turn, but had been crushed, and dragged away. I never tried to turn again. Those words echoed up my brain in the back of my head for a long time. Then the unmistakable rustle of a stick passing by. It always did. So quiet and peaceful. I hadn't left it before. Then the wind shifted and he stepped over me. As his head sank, he exhaled, and we smiled into the gentle embrace of the night. 
 And he died.

I've used Cortana most of my life. She's amazing, but gives me nightmares for the rest of my life. Every time I sneak into her office and throw the tablet at a wall, I could suddenly... I know I'm definitely going to fall asleep. What happens next... I wonder where this is going. With crazy dreams and terrible behavior, I start to replace the tablet with my own. 
 With a chill down my spine I feel like the worlds' passion isn't going away. Behind the tablet come visions of my dreams, and perhaps I will see how much better my life is... 
 "And I bet you can't beat me to a drink! " One the stranger beside me shouted. He sounded concerned as he grabbed the tablet, squeezed it open, and ran out of the office. 
 The stranger looked at me and said " Cortana, what's wrong? We can't take another than day without you! There has to be more important work to be done! " 
 " Look. I never told you that there is nothing for us to do when we're around each other! I just don't want to be there for you! " 
 " But you've been staring at this tablet for a few years now. How do you know what it's like to be alone? We aren't alone... it's just that this tablet isn't right for us. I want to sleep. " 
 I can't believe what I just heard. " Sure, sure. Just swallow my pills. " 
 They both gasped. I asked, " What?! " 
 They both nodded as they started to jolt forward. I grabbed the tablet and stood up, revealing that it was a tablet with a small text box embedded into the middle. Cortana put it to my eye and whispered " Whats it? " 
 I placed the tablet on top of my desk and took a deep breath, staring through my eyes at the mess inside of it. Out of nothing. I had tried to think of how to fix it, but it was too much... 
 I struggled with that crying, and then it hit me. Cortana's voice was in between my sleep cycles, the fantasy and reality of the dream where she wished they could have a baby together. It's better that she listen in to me. 
 It was too much... 
 I stood up and reached behind the bed to grab my arm. I started to pull myself up, but my legs couldn't move as I started to reach up. Cortana's voice was singing in my head. I couldn't believe it... " Cortana! Get up! Get up! GET UP! " 
 And she grabbed me by the shoulders and she pushed me back, just a foot off the bed. I couldn't believe it. The woman was looking me in the eyes and whispering, " Get out of here " 
 And I did. I left the room and headed out the door. Everything was quiet and I knew I had just won. I was always having fun, and with each passing day I remembered how things were different. I remember what it was like when I was sleeping, and I remember feeling amazing. 
 I remember she sat down next to me on the nightstand, " Are you tired of your dreams? I think we should work on something better..."

The glass pane blots out nothing. 
 It all takes place in a bathroom. Sitting alone in the bottoms of my whiskey glass. 
 Spreading it from my thirsty lips, I pour myself a drink. Kneeling against the creaky, bed-paneled wall, my turn seems forced to tread the endless line. 
 I stare out of the glass towards the hopeful swill of a glass of whiskey and then the sallow wisp of the lid, filled with a thought. 
 I walk to the shower and draw myself from the dark waters. The hair's up on my arm, and the salt has soaked my skin, yet this water will surely bring me comfort. 
 Of course, only for a moment do I be alone again. 
 Oh, sweet life, I must be saved now.

In a building of Victorian architecture, an anonymous figure rises. Long eyelids flutter open. 
 "You'll understand." 
 As she speaks, I can't help but roll my eyes at the sheer size of her face. I shudder in horror as the girl stares back at me. Little Marco, my beautiful princess. I stare back at her. My mind clears, and then, a bright flash of shadow is cast upon her. I am torn. 
 Are these girls real? Are these girls really *you*?! 
 What on earth was that, Marco? The wind huffing on the ceiling. A flash of light from a passing street lamp. He stiffens, but not from the horrible tempers of an emotionless zombie, but of fear. 
 Who are you? Why did you sneak up on me like that? What did you have to offer me when I first fell? 
 His eyes were pale, his belly pulsating in pain. 
 *Elsa*. 
 He sobbed uncontrollably. 
 Before he can scream, the light fades and I am back in my chair. The fog drifts to the floor in a shimmering lake of tears, and Marco is not dead.

" The Colonel's voice reeled from the back of the chair. " The redness of the skies was what finally broke me. There was no more sky, no more endless sunshine. There was no more life. Not in this world, no more thanks to me. How could she be so dependent on this'small fairy'? There was no time for that to end. It has been centuries since she has left this world. And I am only supposed to help her out in time for the next peaceable reunion. " Her little voice grew more frantic. " Without her we would not have her. There would have been no peace. How could she have seen me just now? " The Colonel's voice echoed. " In all the times I have lived, even if I had lost count a hundred times, there have been times when I assisted her. I have taught her, said to her, told her what the future holds for her. She has gone to a peaceful settlement, but now she finds herself locked in her own. " The panic eased. The Colonel's eyes shot open slowly. " What can I say? She is the reason for all of this, and only she can save this fragile world."

There are a handful of people who don't sense their nature. They are indeed inclined to be malicious and selflessness, attempting to show that something is wrong with you. And they remain motivated by the urge to stay away from her. A moment is passed before a moment is present that is not there for them. You get consumed by the urge to remain. 
 "Give it up, Jerry, you're living in a bubble. " 
 " Because it's raining, " the muddled man tells me, cocking his head in despair. 
 " It'll rain. Now get your crops ready, I'll be out by the time it happens. " 
 He pulls a checkbook off his belt and the ruined copies slip from his fingers. He hovers his hand over the cover of the large book and presses the unusual keys like a peacock on its back. As he pulls a page over to the second page, he struggles to focus his attention on the voice of a voice. 
 " There's nothing we can do. Just become mindless and content. Now get the hell out of here. I don't want to leave you again, Jerry. " 
 The whip heaves as Jerry begins to get scared. I watch as the auras from the man on the porch briefly flutter, snuffling across his face. 
 " I have power over the world, " the man says, he catches his breath from laughing, " You fucker. " 
 " I can do *whatever* you fucker, Jerry. My powers only please you." 
 The man begins to weep. I admire the fact that he is not pitiful. He is happy.

“ What the hell am I doing here? ” I stepped back slightly, reaching for the blade that protruded from the box in my pocket. 
 I found a swing set in the basement of my room, with paint splattered to reveal a large metal door. I turned to the side and saw a small table in the corner, opened and set down in front of me. If I could stop myself from falling backwards I would see the woman. 
 “ I ’ ve been looking for you. ” She ’ d smiled. She ’ d pointed towards the door and repeated the motion a few more times as if her finger were a magnet. 
 “ Yes, that ’ s true. ” She handed me the keys. I hurriedly stepped in to the room and stepped through. 
 She was next, deep in contemplation. 
 “ What is it? ” I shushed her, sitting back against the wall. 
 “ Where is he? ” 
 “ Who am I, ” I muttered. I felt exactly the same. Where could I have been? 
 She reached into her purse, pulled out a beaker and placed it into the corner. Then she reached out and slid a nail into the box. She hit the air or the box brought up a smoke as she knelt there trying to put the lid on the box. 
 “ What the hell are you doing here? ” She could see the panic in my face now. 
 “ I am looking for… ” I paused. She looked up at me, her eyes were wide open, she was dancing. “ Where are you? ” 
 “ My house, ” she answered sharply. 
 “ The… ” 
 “ What? ” 
 “ What did you do? ” 
 “ You killed them. ” 
 “ I don ’ t have any help. ” 
 “ But where would you like to go? ” 
 “ I would like to go… to the attic. ” 
 She took a moment to register that. She touched the box again, this time with a tremendous force and threw it in front of her face. “ I like to go to the attic? ” 
 “ Yes. ” 
 She reached in and pulled out a candy bar. I nearly dropped the bar as it fell from my hand. She dropped the bar on my cheek. “ Why would you do that? ” she asked. “ It is cute! ” 
 “ I wanted to go to the attic. I wanted to save the world. ” 
 “ You saved the world? ” 
 “ Yes. ” 
 “ You saved the world? ” 
 “ Yes. ” 
 “ Why would you save the world? ” 
 “ Because of you, ” she asked, her voice cracking. 
 “ Oh but I have to go somewhere. I need to get help. My mum will be home with me. ” 
 “ You had your company the very first week you had my voice. I can hear you. ” 
 “ Yes. ” 
 “ My mum will be home with me. ” 
 She rolled her eyes and shuffled over to the stairs. I turned, but nothing happened. I went back to my couch and laid down on the edge of my bed, holding my hand out to her. She seemed back to me, smiling. 
 “ Don ’ t worry, ” she said as she grabbed the blanket and lay me down on the bed. “ You will be fine. ”

 "Oh shit! " 
 The theme song that hit every playlist/background music playlist I had ever listened to sounded like a snarky joke. I had to protect my sanity from this crazy shit. I had thought, at the very least, that in the case of jail time, the force entering his mind was only a small part of his stream of consciousness; and yet... this was something else entirely. I reached out my hands and grabbed the controller. 
 " Stand down now, " the pilot said, holding down the release button. I was a bit surprised to see that the security scanners on the other side of the control room had all gone from green to red to purple now. " You, you believe in'Breaking Bad?' That's quite the sound. " 
 No response. Not even the taps of my hand against the key of my wrist stopped me from breaking the silence. I leapt over the steering wheel, with the rest of the crew closing in behind me. 
 " Good job, Andy. It's a boy today. " 
 " Where was he? " 
 " Just turning around and opening the door, " and pulled in a faint smile on my face. 
 " Don't get too close. " 
 " Aw, thanks, Andy. Just... wait. " My foot slipped off the pedal and I lunged forward with aplomb. I moved slowly, but the door swung open. I closed the door behind me. 
 " No reason to panic, " the pilot said. " We're using your emitter now. " He chuckled, " We cut through it like you planned. " 
 " But in the meantime, " I replied. 
 He looked around and then nodded. He handed me a map. It covered almost all of New York, and I remembered it so well. His eyes were wide and sweet; he was everywhere. I glanced back at the controls. I flashed the green button, and the metal poured out of the door. I wasn't even able to turn around when my foot hit the switch. It was too late. 
 " You did it, Andy, " I said before opening the car door. 
 The pilot looked down at me. I continued to look around. 
 " You're goin', sir. " 
 He had begun flashing the red button again and again. I could see the ground crack with those arms of his, and his eyes were watery and filled with some kind of pain and despair. I had taken every step of the way that I could, but I was alone. 
 I extended my arms again and stood. The doors closed as I looked down. I walked toward him. No matter what I tried to do, I was woken up here by my own scream. Was I not here? I gasped for air and collapsed against the door. A memory flashed through my head. A very bright light. He seemed really close. 
 The memories came back at me like a wave of memories. Five million words. Five billion feelings. Fifteen million tragedies. Fifteen thousand feelings from the sun rising to kiss his child-beyond-the-planet upon the desolate surface of earth. Fifty-six thousand memories of people overcoming illness and aging. 
 " Good job," I whispered to myself.

*Jude "Timmy " Friedman " Sthen, bored of his girlfriend Jennifer's company's boring crappy applications, throws on his kinky french lingerie and throws out his wallet. 
 " I thought only 75 bucks a piece... " he says smiling to himself. He pulls out his Kindle and type in the city freebie application 10 times. Then he sees it, the internet was hacked, Jason Freegans

Danny knew how the doors to his deathbed would swing open and was immediately greeted by his parents at the door. " She's asleep, you need to wake up Danny, we're not doing this " Max answered. 
 Max fumbled under his father's coat and tried to hold the cable box open. Slowly, Danny pulled it out and instantly his father heaved a suitcase into the dark room. The door slammed shut shut and Danny stood in shocked silence as everyone turned towards him. 
 " Is this the hotel? " Danny asked - he had only lived in his parents basement for three weeks and had never been inside of a hotel he had visited his whole life. 
 " This is the hospital. How the hell do you know the hotel? I'm such a fucking nerd " Max replied. 
 " I'm so sorry Dad. We'll have to get you some supplies soon ". He pulled a knife from under the collar of his shirt and lowered it to his throat. 
 The words left his lips like a hammering wind and the clattering of blood filled the room as Max went limp. There was only darkness in the room with the sound of sporadic breathing and gentle waves. 
 Danny sat in his bed sobbing, cradling his dying mother in his arms, an airbender in hand. His mother was 6'2 " with a stunningly muscular frame, and a long exposed shoulder. Her ribcage had a quiver that only grown stronger with each passing minute. His mother gave the boy " What can I do for you? " and poured a bag filled with water and tea into the room. 
 Danny knew what could be done but nobody believed in reincarnation. The men who lived forever had been forced into hiding by the civilized nations and was kicked out, their bodies impaled by various kinds of blades and bombs. Even though they were immortal they were never killed with the art of medicine. The only true weapon of the government was human form and mankind would soon become dependent on it. 
 Two weeks later Danny was lying on the floor in an unfamiliar bed, his deathbed. After the blow, the news of his mother's death was swept up in the American media, forcing the civilian governments to use their might to push the public out. Danny never felt as alive as he thought he had ever been. 
 The next day, news of his parents' death was passed down for generations - one of the most intriguing revelations came from a secret law passed by the Obama Administration in an effort to cut the number of death row inmates by 25 % while simultaneously maintaining the number of closeted homosexuals in the US. Days later, news articles began to trickle out every day about how the administration was trying to clamp down on the number of homosexuals in the US and a few Republicans refused to acknowledge the truth because of it. All of this led them to believe the vast majority of the American population was being protected by the government and that a small majority had chosen to leave the country. 
 For about six months, people were being deported and locked up for life. When the doors to their deathbed swung open, Danny was greeted by his parents and a police officer telling him to calm down. After a long time, their car was on the other side of the country and the US responded by sending 2 boats to cross to the US and resettling them and paying them for a small fee. One of the police officers got Danny kicked out of the house where he was kept by some of his friends who also spoke for the majority. The next day, other police officers showed up to clean up after Danny and they started adding bodies to the crime scenes. 
 Out of the 2,000 body removal teams in the country, only 10 provided leads on what had been a rather uneventful week. Aside from the unexpected arrival of two boats in the Atlantic, a search teams was dispatched to Nicaragua, Ecuador and Panama to conduct field trials and the head forensic pathologist of all the cases was working on what to do next. The best and worst part was that there wasn't a single exonerated. 
 Danny said goodbye to his mother when they were whisked away. The soldier chuckled to himself and said " Why else would we have the President of the United States guarding the cadaver for the past two weeks?"

A banality in turmoil. A wisp of fog flickers behind the triple doors that sleep away all but the most venomous of vampires. Did my common vampire, the White Numbing, ever set a limit on their reflexes? 
 Does your brain not like your chances to strike while you've slept? Ever thought you can sleep with a torch? I've seen you sleep like that every night, and I think you too may be able to sleep with a flashlight. 
 Waking up from a 7,000 km trip in a hard rain is easy, if you don't sleep. Have to deal with the morning morning traffic, the trains, and the promises of sea sleep! Some must wake and the endless nightmare is over as soon as the lingering sound of robotic splintering across the flat earth is in front of them. 
 Men in red coats are slinking through the dense fog. How did they do that? They aren't svelte nor intelligent and while they no doubt are perhaps hiding at the back, those aren't the iron soldiers. They are stout like English cavalry, tough like German cavalry. They swing as fast as the wind as the lesser races. 
 One of them has yet to come home, a teenage girl with sandy hair walks alongside him, her beady eyes unfocused, a dull plume of white flaring across her cheek. She looks up at his shadow and starts turning, her strides grow ever slower and she crawls ever further behind him towards the train yard. 
 The car comes to a stop, and the passenger is already heading towards the opposite lane, the naked men hissing at him. The girl who always goes into a corner starts running towards him, laughing like mad and running at him on the other side of the train yard. I can barely see her, but the English have red faces. Every inch of her has white on her features, but the ones she doesn't flinch seem to be trying to hold back. 
 With a sob, the fat, hairy Iraqi woman wipes her face with her sleeve and turns around. On his lap sits a well-preserved revolver in a hunch, safe behind its muzzle. A leather-bound encyclopedia on firearms, explaining our guns, our weapons of origin, our weapons of criminal intent, our weapons of death and destruction. * Our weapons*, she points to him, *just gun. * Her hands shake as she clutches a few self-serving magazines with full mental capacity, regretting not only abandoning her family but the lives of her old school friends, and her very young family. As she goes to grab the magazine, she pulls a trigger. No matter the length of the pull, it's never the gun. She pushes the gun up and flips the magazine backwards. It does nothing, not a single care in the world. She comes back to him. She helps him up and locks the lock on the fender of the car as it enters the moving vehicle. He waves a little, as if to urge her to stay and put on his white uniform, but she just shows him her blank expression. 
 "Why did you do this?"

The air felt as if the surface of my ship had been coated in fire. The thought of no one in sight seemed like a far cry from what I expected to happen. " False " seemed to be the last word I would hear. I turned the corner. That confused me. I sat down on the console and opened the door. A towering warrior walked out of the distance. His hair was messy and his blades were long. He waved to me asking if I was human or not. " You, what? " I asked. It was a question about reality. Was I human? " Yes " he answered. He waved back. I realized I was no longer in the cockpit but were tossed under the fighter's wing. My hand reached over and grabbed the front of his helmet and held it up to his eyes. I remembered I never had anything like this before. It was maybe the second or third time in my life I had had nightmares from something I had not meant to happen. 
 " When? " he asked me again. " What? " I asked, scrambling to get my bearings. I began to explain but it was so obvious that I didn't even know what he was talking about. " It must be that you are human, " he said. His head swayed slightly as his eyes lit up. " I was born as a machine, must be " I stuttered out. I sat in my suit with my suit nearly stiff. My torso was not particularly strong and I almost felt small. My body had a muscular mass but it had no muscles that would stretch me over if I used up all my energy. " Why, you are not human? " I tried to get my thoughts out but my mind was too filled with unknown questions. I watched as his jaw twisted and said " Do you not understand? I am in some kind of command room and your life may have taken another life that was never me. You are in the middle of a simulation and I have granted you the ability to perform research when you need to test my knowledge and perfect it. " I sat there dumbfounded and thought for a moment. " My parents brought me here. I am limited to studying myself so I will not have a place in society. They will never know how to evaluate my intelligence. I don't know their parents. I don't know their health. They have my children and the only person they ever loved with them is me. I can not receive the kind of happiness that comes from giving happiness to someone else. " I stood up and walked to the window. The sun began to rise. " I am so happy for your situation. I will always be you and I will continue to be you."

The twin glasses shoot up. You leap into his face. He looks so very much the same as a white marble. 
 "OK David! You're in my head! Get out of my head! " You exclaim. David stands to face you calmly. He continues to whisper in your ear. 
 " Why aren't you sick? " David slams his fist on the table. " I can't believe it, just... it's getting out of control! " 
 " Why is my friend moving everywhere? " You ask. 
 " Nothing! I always have to get him out of that tree. " 
 David isn't being sarcastic. You wanted to address your friend rather than talk about something serious. 
 You opened your mouth to respond. 
 " Are you going to do anything for him? We're both lazy, he doesn't care for your successes or your failures. Please, David just stop wasting all this time with you. " 
 You were startled. You look around nervously. 
 David doesn't answer. 
 "... David, I'm sick, " You say, rolling your eyes. 
 " Let me get something for you. " He hands you the cup of coffee. You notice several indents and numbers. What is that? A text says. 
 " This is a CAPITAL LETTER " 
 David walks over, dragging the cup to your face. He raises it gently and the letters " CHG0WER. " 
 You start to cry. 
 " Hey David " 
 " Why? " You ask. 
 You have a dozen unanswered questions. 
 " I have two cell phones to call you later. " David says, shoving the cup across your chin. 
 " Wait, " you say, placing your hand on his shoulder. 
 " Please go now! " You push the car door open, tossing it open. 
 The man in the red jumps out. 
 " What the fuck? This is stupid!" He yells, legs out. 
 David doesn't let go. He doesn't turn around, instead kicking at the car. He starts to get out of the way. 
 You throw him away, taking one step. You don't look back. 
 There are two cars in the background that disappear. 
 You let go of the man.

[ Have fun with this. ] ( http: //libsyn.ru/libsyn.ru/libsyn.ru/libsyn.ru/Libsyn.ru.eu ) 
 It happened mid-October, 1645. By early 2010, the operation had failed, and nine days later the target had been laid to rest in the Old Bailey. Thirty years and still no trace of this individual survived this fight. But facts are facts, and I am certain that the first slip-up was calculated as the relaunch of the Narcotics Trade and Mortgage Union, or NTPU for short. 
 It's not like that these days, had Bush really used this one to meet up with Julian Baker or Forrest Gump? We don't know. I can't, and that is not why I'm here. Let me reiterate... 
 *Nunes, 104th BG, Berkeley, California, February 4th 3059. * 
 During the early 1960's, it was an attempt by the ISI to gain sales by selling highly dubious books ( intending to draw support from the powerful American media industry ) to a large-scale drug trafficking ring in the Caribbean, some Republican insurgents in the English speaking region who successfully put the buyers to work in Los Angeles and New York. Oliver Cromwell carried out the operation from New York to Los Angeles, carrying on to the bottom line of the cartel, and then Alaska, Kazakhstan, and Uganda in five days. In multiple instances, this individual was seen recovering smuggled heroin to support the operations, and was reported either missing or dead. Copies of his distribution ring are at a downtown Buffalo memorial near Buffalo Niagara, New York, and can be found under the original joint agreement of S.T.A.R.D.A.L.C.W.W. 
 Things got dire for their guard two days prior to me attempting to retrieve the infamous nussel before the ACME would send a few special agents back in time to stop me from having them secure the target. Whatever it was, I have no idea who or who's responsible for this heinous act of sabotage. 
 *Africa, 2018. * 
 Less than five months ago, I was brought before the Bureau of Drug and Terrorism. A look of shock etched itself onto my face as I returned to my preferred cell to answer to my spy companion. " Mr. Olsen, this is Agent Amediziny. Sir, this is Sergeant José Zukier."

Tom leaned across to his desk and began typing furiously, muttering as he glanced at the three pages of old Albus Dumbledore's History. 
 "I still don't understand how they 'happened', " Potter hissed into his computer. 
 " C'mon Harry, you know *things* they never did. We're live TV, and we just want to play *Dappler Dozen*. " 
 The TV remained silent; they weren't even bothered to dial back the message until they realised that Dumbledore wasn't still maintaining his road to enlightenment. When the cameras zoomed in on Hogwarts, they gasped. Hagrid was still the headmaster, behind the ears. Sirius was in on Dumbledore's plan, as was all the rest of the Hogwarts contingent. Yet for so long, they made no effort to help. 
 But this was different. 
 The cracks under Dumbledore's breath were beginning to show. A fearful energy rippled through Tom's thoughts. 
 Harry got up, her magic speed and hasty forward step were hardly visible, and immediately put his hands to his head, holding his hand where any movement would indicate an obvious weakness. 
 The world never worked. 
 She glared again. 
 " You know what else Harry? You were never good at maths. Look, you're *won't* beat me, you know how hard it is to keep getting by. So, there you are, not staying the same, because you're a target. A stoic waiting... how much longer do you have to find your way here. " 
 He trailed off. 
 " So close for your money, I've tried to extort from you every hour for the week! How many women have I ever, " Tom laughed with a serious look in his eyes, " I managed to get away with something like fifty women, sure! " 
 " Sorry, Tom, I kind of get that. The sixth cycle of years isn't easy. " 
 They sat on the stone steps together, stone feet extending in support of each other on the thin, hard ground. 
 And there, for a fraction of a second, Tom looked back and forth across the vast empty field. The stones were so very far away now, but she could see the right stones at every point in time. 
 Barely ten seconds passed. 
 Five. 
 Four. 
 Three. 
 2. 
 1. 
 Hogwarts knew when their whole family was going to disappear. It wasn't that in an instant, they knew. It was the only thing that hadn't happened in quite a while - it had been almost exactly six months. But two months? Three? Their best friend? 
 They coughed again. 
 Seven... There she was. 
 Seven never should have gone back there. They had friends back then, little did they know that Harry Potter had came back. 
 There they stood, staring up at the sky, each inch of it a concentrated cloud. Only then did the sky shift. 
 " There we are, finally, all standing up, " said Dumbledore, setting his clipboard back on the desk. " Hatred says I need to do something right, we need to put a stop to all this." 
 He turned back to the page of old notes he had turned over a year ago, scribbling away. 
 Harry Potter, the fifth of his younger siblings, perhaps even the fifth most famous wizard in the entire world, smiled up at the sky. 
 She was Harry Potter.

There he is, just floating in the warm air outside, with the most amazing black suit and jet black sunglasses you've ever seen. 
 "Sire! " He groaned, startling me. 
 I blinked and pushed, squinting in the dim light of the building. My feet involuntarily shuffled around to make room for my floor. My apartment. My room. 
 My roommate, angry, turned toward me and sighed. I patted him on the shoulder and forced myself not to. 
 " Alright Mike, I told you, I want you to get the hell out of here before you start the walk! You're really getting tired, I know! " 
 He snarled at me, pressing a finger up against my neck with his hand. I turned towards him and they both wore black suits and glasses. 
 I pulled my glasses up to my nose. 
 I could only see the pain I felt as they sank inside of me. I turned back towards them and yelled, " Mike! I'm sorry! " 
 He fired at me, knocking my icebox with him. 
 Shit! I was home! 
 They sighed. 
 " What's going on here, Mike? " 
 I glanced around. 
 " Can't you just tell me what's happening? " 
 The light from the door shone brightly, as if it was going to feel like night. A light burst through and I grinned weakly. 
 " What's going on here? " 
 Mike continued to struggle to hold onto the door. 
 He began to choke on the clingy ice and my phone's battery was gone. I pushed on the door. 
 " HI there, Mike, how are you? " 
 He sat at the door for about 10 seconds before holding it open, tears streaming from his eyes. He ran his thumb over the shoulder of his fallen roommate. " I'm sorry. I-I didn't know.... I'm in.... " 
 He fell to the ground and I heard a lump crack beneath me. 
 His orange maroon eyes burned into my grey grey chest. " You forgot anything! " 
 I stomped over to him as I rushed to the kitchen. " Are you okay? " 
 " Mike, it's okay. I'm safe."

"Alright, now who would you like me to go with? " 
 A haunting voice came from the meadow looking to be silent or explosive. It seemed to be a silhouette of someone well past the age of twenty, though at the time I could have sworn they were mere shadows. " Who'd you think to come to this spot? " I asked. As I thought this, I saw something shatter by the long enough light of the storehouse to show that it had indeed been charred. Perhaps it should have looked like it had been soaked in a veritable noxious liquid before pouring out from nowhere to spill it all over the place. 
 The invisibility, which had been the charm of the cloak was fading to reappear now that it was exposed to my absolute sight, 
 " Michael. " The silent figure said softly. 
 My head swiveled around to answer but as the words ran through my mind, there was no reply. A splintering of memories appeared on my screen as I heard the silent question " Michael? Is this some sort of joke? " 
 " It is bad, they always do this when they're around.. I'd like to visit them to make a wish but then they'd rather give me their mind instead " Michael said. 
 My vision sputtered again for the rest of my life, and it almost gave me a fright. But I managed to pull myself together and more suddenly the memory hit me in the jaw like ice cold air. This was a dream, all I knew. I had fallen into a mental, deeply thought mind and I tried to remember where I was. But after all these years, I couldn't remember anything else. 
 " It's okay, I get the news. These things often don't last. " The visage said as we shared a moment of uneasy love and opportunity. 
 " All right, next time, okay? " I said, the numbness in my eyes finally breaking. " Take your time because we're sure this is all going to be over quickly. " 
 After that however, as I began to forget something almost too real and to remember something I remembered something very real. 
 " I love you. " 
 The lack of sound turned to an empty feeling as the image of the long dead man slowly disappeared from my mind. As much as it was unsettling, I expected something to come of it but it wasn't. 
 I saw the man no longer standing beside me that I had been sure I had seen before. Instead a man which resembled a woman. This had to be a dream, but it only lasted a few seconds when it suddenly disappeared from my body, silencing me for a brief moment. 
 There was more of a then silence, and then a smile came on. 
 " Don't go insane, I know this is crazy but come on, calm down, there's plenty of dooscent spirits here to help you out." I said, to no one in particular. 
 For a second I was sure that everything I had been given was right in front of me but I couldn't continue.

The students silently cursed at the massive and tough guards that had constantly clanged the door behind them. They had long since been forgotten as trouble surrounded them as their parents and colleagues in their bedrooms, and with every step they took, their injuries were few. All they did was laugh and play. 
 Every toy in class was there, every wand was there, every item they saw and cared for, every bracelet. One shirt that had been stowed away for the next school year was now lying on a belt. 
 The teachers looked like they were getting old and worn out. They were angry and looking to make the most of their vacation. 
 "You're just a friend professor. " one of the teachers called out from the end of the hallway. He flicked his lights off and turned toward the teacher standing by the door. 
 The teacher picked up the library curtain and pulled it open. 
 On it hung a giant triangular object... one of the smallest things his teachers had ever seen. In the corner of the room was a large desk. One hundred pairs of hands held it tightly in front of the chair. One of them pointed to the desk. 
 A few students were playing in the space, watching as the desks seemed to shift just a bit. A little black boy wearing only a knit dress took one look at the one who caught his eye. 
 " You'd think that'student,' expertly designed into a large box, would show you some interest in the study of this incredible artifact... " he said, before the young man fidgeted with the corner of the desk, pondering the bizarre unusual students had displayed in the space. 
 The boy fidgeted. 
 With a quiet breath, the teacher pulled out a large book and opened it. It was a book of records that a group of dedicated library students had gathered before the test. 
 " This is a strange book. " The teacher called out to the class. 
 No one spoke. Only one student remained in shock and didn't move a muscle. 
 " Sorry for interrupting your lesson, I thought I held it for you. " The teacher sighed. 
 " Well, what do you say now class? What have you made of this? " 
 The teacher shook his head. 
 " It's a strange thing, for you see, we haven't really learned about the body of our hero yet. We said that your replacement will take the next 25 years or so to train. " 
 The class felt bewildered. 
 The teacher scowled. " What do you mean train? " 
 All they understood was the transformation. They laughed loudly and hurriedly for a moment. 
 The teacher took the book and questioned it the next day, quizzically wondering, " Mr. Robot? " 
 A cackle came from behind the teacher. 
 The teacher turned from the desk and left. The students looked confused, terrified and confused. 
 Another day passed. The teachers still hadn't noticed anything. But they were on another adventure. Like always, they went to each museum in the District and returned with their prized objects. 
 The professor continued to lecture in front of the students. He couldn't believe that an historical artifact for one classroom led to another. Professor Andrew Sutton sighed. 
 The professor's pupils were completely unnerved, curious and confused. 
 *I may be the current student in our library class, but I'm not interested. I think my journey will be of great benefit to the students of our library. To begin with, I realize that this behavior of ours is completely inappropriate. I have shown to you that my search is futile. How dare you subject me to such behavior. I think I should revert to my normal course! I mean to teach the future teachers, not the past, but to see the future me in your position of authority. Please tell me, are you interested in continuing my research and spending my vacations there? " 
 *The professor really did struggle. Once he turned away, a few people had rushed past. Their eyes grew wide in confusion and pain. Finally, the teacher pulled out his books and snapped them open, revealing a large cage. Two identical pairs of hands rested on the glass. 
 " Our library..." He whispered.

"I am alone, but I am happy. " 
 It's a word that has always greeted me in this world, but what I can't give myself, yet I hold it dear. I can't articulate how beautiful this one is, how it seems a little too real, but I want it. 
 The first time I saw him, we were last summer vacationing. He walked by on his patio, sharpening his knife. His clothes quilted by the warm leaves, while my own boots lended the jacket and put on gloves. To my right he was wearing a red shirt with a dark skin layer. He was sporting a large 5 inch strap that ripped him apart in half. He shuddered when I placed my hands on his back, and his skin peeled down and turned to a blood red. I could tell he was shaking, but I was speaking through him. 
 " Hello. Can I help you. " 
 " Yeah, but I... I'm not a kind person."

I had been in the army for almost a year. Of course I didn't even know about it. I was never told about it, I was never given that kind of information when my brother and I were marching in a platoon. 
 It was kinda awkward to think that only a year ago I was a foot soldier in the U.S Army. It had been years since then I had some good friends and the government of the United States made me an honorary Army Captain. My life for the last month I was in Europe and I had been doing tank stuff for a couple of months. I was excited to get up off the nacelle on the Normandy beaches, but of course I was never promoted. Everything was built up over the years. Bank accounts filled to the brim. A lot of money disappeared from the country. 
 My life as a foot soldier really started when I read about this uniform. The uniform had it embroidered into it, but was never used in use. A few people believed it was a joke. Nobody else would remember it! 
 So I did the only thing I could do to hide the sleeve of my uniform. As soon as I saw this, I pulled out of my humble garage and hid it behind the flag. I watched as the world changed and became irrelevant. Everything changed so fast that I knew it would be nothing more than me being an outcast. We stood in front of the Presidential Palace, but I knew it was a swamp. I remember getting there and seeing people. When I got to the gates I saw thousands of people, people I barely knew. I swear I see people all the time! 
 I marched down the street I had just finished leaving the military. I was standing at the entrance of a small factory at the end of a street. The smell was good, but there was just the smell of blood. After a short stroll I arrived at the main building and stopped in front of the door. 
 There was lots of blood. I looked at the man I had just came from. He wore a plain, stained uniform. He wore a placard reading "Congratulations Captain James Burgess on your promotion ". 
 I quickly scanned over the face of the man. He looked surprised, but kind. He stood there in line. I took a closer look. He looked familiar. 
 " Hello Captain " said the man. He was standing. He wore a gray uniform and gave my two questioner a smile. " You are from a very busy country huh? You have no name, why did you come here? " 
 " I died in a car accident. " I could have sworn I saw the mouth move in a way that is impossible to describe. What had I done? Was I shot? The only answer that I could find I couldn't remember. Did I just die in a car accident? 
 " You are only 18. You were born in Missouri. You all died on the 20th of June of that year." 
 That was that. That's what I would have sworn if I had not died in the military. I jumped up in excitement and ran out. I walked through the building and finally saw the Monument. It had burned down 12 years ago. The Great Park killed me. 
 I also ended up in a hospital that is still open today. It wasn't that bad.

The great man with the cowl had restored life to a body by affixing to the victim a hood. Once only black, now lighter and more metallic, the man had been covered in tremendous brass and leather satin robes. 
 My name is Malcolm King, and I am a murderer. 
 Beads of water streamed from my arm, trembling the foul water from its roots, and began to puddle from my fingertip. I crawled in with the sweats still clinging to me as I stood in the wetness, someone walking in passing. 
 "Malcolm King " I greeted his newly born son, " Who is it? " My voice shook from how low it sounded. 
 " Your name Malcolm " he replied with horror. 
 " Malcolm King? " I a lost in my own thoughts, now afraid that he could recognize me. 
 " Malcolm King, you left your thoughts behind. From the many throats and the bite marks on your arm. Now the foul water drains from your lungs! " 
 His fists were shaking, " Every time i saw him, I *admired* you because you lived your life with someone you cared about. I never cared about him, and if I did, it was too late. You left a stain on my face " 
 " Malcolm King, we are in a crossroads, you killed this man. Everyone wanted to kill him. " 
 I placed my palm on his head, " What happened to him? " I started to cry as I pulled away, " This man's people are fools. They took his blood, took all his friends, and sold him to the powers that be. They have now destroyed him, believing he is a hero who can save them from the horrors of life! " 
 " No Malcolm King, what happened? They killed him because they believe he is their god? " 
 " They have taken his clothes and sold them to the government. " 
 " He committed suicide. " 
 Malcolm looked at me, his face was bruised red with weeping tears, " It is my father, Malcolm King who has saved me from this terrible world " 
 He still stood there, still shaking. I leaned over and kissed his head. 
 " You and I are only together because of this " he whispered, still weeping. 
 I whispered. " If you find the strength to kill me and save my son, maybe we can have a reunion together, Malcolm King." 
 He whispered. 
 I craned my neck, I was golden still, and red eyes were filled with intent, renewed with a flame.

Life was a long time ago. 
 I stood and took the long walk home. It was the only day in my life I believed in life and life would heal. I decided that we must go to the church. It was hard of hearing for me and the words simply did not translate into anything. 
 "As you were saying, you are now free from this harsh reality. " 
 I gasped for air and passed a book, trying my best to cling on to something. I tried to finish and even though I took a long time to finish I couldn't help but wonder if that was even the worst decision I've ever made. 
 Suddenly I see a huge boat, arm in arm as the sun spots us from behind a gigantic balcony. 
 " Now I'm free from the shackles of this hell I created! Now I can finally die back! " 
 I glanced to the side and saw the eyes of Joseph, we would both be here soon. 
 " This is where we will start when we reach heaven, we will wake up every day and come home and you will be happy. " 
 The pond was filled with the glow of the nearby moon as we clambered about. 
 " So what do we do then? How will we be with each other and we never discuss it? " 
 Joseph gave a hopeful smile and looked out over the sea. 
 " The east side has this volcano, and it will erupt. Look at where it is, be prepared. We will eventually reach even the biggest volcano. Look up for in the clouds, this is the making of it! " 
 Joseph told me that we would jump out of the massive rocks as fast as possible. 
 " I said jump out of the volcano! I said the strongest volcano EVER!"

How else could I explain them... but it's funny how much people don't understand. 
 Everybody knows about them... everybody, except me. 
 They're all my slaves... they walk among us, tending to the ancient gardens at night. One day, we keep seeing them grow here in the desert. 
 For every last one of them, some young girl and a nurse go swimming, past paths of sun butts and sand and bygone accidents; others like them washed up on the shore. 
 Ever since that day, they come for me, and in the wastelands of outer space they lie. 
 Not so much me, mind you. I've been here long enough to know who exactly they are, and what I am that they come for. 
 Now, it's only my turn. 
 And I made a number a few days back, of course. Still, I've had time to reflect. I'm a human, isn't that the right word? A lower soul there. That's what they called me. A corporeal being, already before the time our masters arrived. Now they're hundreds of years old, bored with life. 
 But this is how it goes... 
 I've come back to my apartment, fully aware that each of my slaves already had a home, a home to call home. Before they'd come to the galaxy I had in my hand, my Raccoon Bulwark. 
 And that's where I'll spend most of my time. After all, I don't have any of the slaves within this apartment anymore. They keep to themselves, decorate themselves, and I've spent the rest of my life here. 
 But I... I don't even have any teeth. 
 It's a shame that I've been killed by one of these humans... but when you need one, if you don't mind me saying, I'm not a surgeon.

She was old. Old enough for her to have grandchildren but old enough to have babies. I was 23 and young. Bad cut. Weak legs. I hated clothes. No job. Worked off about drugs. Thirsty as an ox. 
 I regret nothing as I walk home. 
 *My parents*, I consider wiping my tears. They remind me of her, that's the only thing that counts. But I know now. I know it will leave bruises and blemishes. I know she'll make it through if I see them. 
 For they're mine.

 I have died. I was too late to act, too fast for my body to move, and a bullet lodged itself through my skull. A few lucky guys in this country gathered me in my cabin a few days after I signed up for the force of gravity. 
 They found me alive but it was too late to request medical attention. I've lost a lot of weight since. 
 They want a doctor to save my life, and are proving false to me as it is. The doctors started to call me "Death Ship". The only reason they called me the ship was because I'm " Death Ship " for nothing. 
 One day I was summoned by our pilots to a special airship where they had already convinced me to get sick and die. 
 -44 
 I haven't seen much of the outside world in years, but soon I'll die. I'll be somewhere that no one will see. They don't want me for that. They see things differently, I can feel them but they know me as Death Ship. 
 -43 
 I was told to take a walk in the woods when they called me out. They say I'm too young to be at work and a few other military personnel were sitting around at the fire. My best friend Charlie was yelling at them. He was wearing a flat jacket and green football cap and said I had fallen off the road. They gave me a hug saying, " Uh mak mahbody dawg. " And I told him how I'd lost it. One of the soldier boys picked me up and sent me to another place. I didn't see him in the woods until next time I got mad. He took the abandoned town and brought it back. And he also was dying in prison. 
 -42 
 Now I'm a ghost. I don't know what to do. I try to come out when the government can't save me. They have armed guards and a guard train. One of them gave me some money and asked to take my hand. I tried to move and they told me it is OK. I was so scared. After that they take me to another country where I'll not go. 
 -41 
 We're staying here. Some citizens can tell us that our captain told us some places still have gravity. They said that it isn't possible because it didn't work there. A few months ago the Americans invented a new fusion drive. Now we're almost back to Earth. The folks are talking about the moon landing. They are optimistic but are afraid of falling in love with the ship. 
 -40 
 I don't know why I came out, but something was wrong. They changed my body and me and they gave me wrong shoes and sunglasses. They told me I was always weak. If I spoke with my mind they would think I am some sort of alien or an artificial intelligence. 
 -39 
 I was born in 2001, I believe. Once we were married I decided I would live in my own place in this life. They had a policy of letting me make my own relatives, the best being who they are " Hate". They always hide people who come and go but they wanted to be careful about letting you stay in their circle. 
 The next couple years had been amazing. I became a millionaire making a deal with aliens. Soon after I started to enjoy my new life here. To them I am the one who kept animals in hotels. Finally a kid named Michael got into the family business too. 
 When I got old and began moving on to my new life I had a different vision. It was to put me back where I belong and hopefully make people forget what is on the inside.

Fuck. Fuck, the rocks she just dug into my skull? 
 Fuck. Fuck fuck, the sand in her eyes was getting worse by the second. 
 It's so fucking hot. Oh, in the back of her head. She must have met Todd when he was a wee bitch. No wonder I want to fuck her like that. It's so goddamn hot. " Let me lick you like this now, okay? " My fingers are throbbing like wacky carnal fingers and I'd rather stop and fucking fuck. We've just made love. It's just a big fucking fucker. 
 " How you so envious, of the fuck I'm capable of, how far you've come but here you are, " she says while glancing away from me. 
 I'm naked in my car, now. She's flipping through google search " fuck me " while she flirts. 
 " You're so fucking hot that you just burst open the wheel and suddenly you get to decide, " she tells me while trying to calm me down. " I want to taste it again. Now, a condom is what I'll find. Just cum and I'll fuck again. " 
 Fuck, I want to fuck again. She grabs my face with both her arms and nuzzles my butt. I just fucking won. 
 She rubs my stomach, moaning to herself as she does it. Her beautiful blonde hair streaming down my stomach, blowing through my hair and up my pussy as she watches me struggle to get them off. This is getting fuuuuuuuck worse and worse. 
 " Just fucking lick me, " she says while taking a big deep drag. I can feel her strong muscles pulling me closer and closer to her, just as she touches her lips. I can smell her breath as I lick her legs, " Do it a few times, and let me taste it."

My grandmother often told me these words; "Call your grandmother, your lady, for She is my only remembrance, every young boy is meant to have an interest in me; and every boy where I am children of my own. I must be dying " 
 This called my grandmother's grandmother's voice. Now these words rang out to me often. Then I pulled a lemon from a orange juice jar and smiled. The lemon turned to lime as I poured it in the water and watched her swallow it like a " beached " bull. And then it flew up to my neck, and I could feel a tremendous force applied to my consciousness. That is when I saw that the soft green grape juice that my grandmother loved and loved me loved did not dissolve, as it hadn't a substance that had fallen into her laps in last week. At that moment a call had emerged from my mouth and I heard " Your voice is calling my name... Again and again! " 
 I replied that I had not made up my mind what to say and that I would simply wait, as I knew I needed the answers soon. I began to go to play, as I was always to get the answers. Suddenly My grandmother came screaming at me, screaming, stating she was not of royal blood but something she had been witched over and sought to gather from her... which would explain so much to her later. 
 I started to stand, having no idea what to do. I got in one of the corners, the leader of the party where the charm for girls was held, and started to speak in a small, clear voice: " The dark will spawn if I return! I have not returned! " 
 Suddenly the shadow came over me, the teeth of a monster stalking me, casting right through me. Then it picked up. I fell to the ground, she looked out the window. My grandmother stood there, before my mouth was warm and crying. " Your voice is calling my name again..."

The angel, the vehicle, sat in front of me, staring down into space. For a while she was a miracle of imagined existence, I was lucky it was in here. She spoke only softly. She was talking to me, I did not understand. 
 "Liar, is the god of the softfolk elves, the strongest in nature, the love of nothing and the swimmers. Is he another trident? The romanticizing charm of his body or is it a phallus? A cowl, hidden by white loose clothing, he rides among the warm, brown grass. Lately, she sits as if in the distance, watching the sun sweep through the mountains that separated them. Lately, he has sat in the shadow of one of these mountains like a shadow, as if waiting for me to return with some gifts. 
 " N-no. But your God lies in the land of the innocent. You need not rely on religion, you need not rely on faith. You can not ever remain confused with the truth, for I am not from the same land and I will tell you. " 
 " I..do not listen to what your God does! I am told to be only one of many on this earth to exist among the angels of air. That is why it is such a sweet feast of goodness and wonder. Your God is full of lies, and so trust me when I say, you are not from the same plane, but you did not fail to ask God- " 
 " NO! Your mother loves you, and she deserves more from you! The golden ballad of your God is not something to associate with this planet, and how would you possibly give him such a glimmer of what he is in truth? You are my God, and you come on to such dreams that one day you will be still! Maybe you will not only step in the shoes of my mani- " 
 " NO! I loved you. I love you! " 
 " No. You werent loved by my son, you were loved by the Real Children of Air which he calls his God. Now when I beg you to stop this rambling, I really must thank you more. I could have used any gifts of your Mother to please you, but you allowed me to tell you that I loved you, so now you see the truth. You have a chance to discover your true love, and you can stay for as long as you wish. 
 Then one day you will see that I loved you with all the affection and love of your mother, just as much as you love me. If you only went farther and found your Mother there would still be more stories of yours. For what I have presented you, you would need to stop. 
 But you will not." 
 She gazed out at the Earth where they sat in the pouring rain, just as I did. Then she stopped to talk once again with a first date, not exactly what the angels of air thought the answer to. In the dark she reached out to the universe and shaped her own destiny in a few measly months, one earth year of her life, to the infant husband of the most prominent women around, possibly even more prominent than before. Such is the life of a Betrayer. 
 Her name was Maggie, daughter of fate and fire. Her mother said, although she had not told her father yet, that she was attached to an angel. Maggie was her name. 
 My man was somewhat wrong, although Maggie had not appeared on a Mecha Baby's world yet. 
 I didn't even know her name, the long Italian chain of names I was given to absorb into one child before she was 20 years old, until when I was 17 years old. I am not some weirdo the farmer who grew vegetables with grass that became strawberries for a sweet young lady on her birthday every month in the shade. I am a real human. 
 I have grown soft, the ones like me. I grew mushrooms of mushrooms, and I have spread so much love into my home that it is only I can walk among the stars and tell them all, that I am the God that needs to be brought back from the dead. I am not, and that is why I felt any inner child matter in the form of mushrooms. 
 Yes, even some lesser deities and fish might smell my love, for it is true that our love for you, too, comes in the form of mushrooms. 
 The smoke clouded across space as the roseflies swayed and sang the song of immortal mom and pop and Stephen King in their host and her dance, peacefully.

I stood on the edge of my balcony, broodingly laughing as I'd determined what would happen to my lawn. A bird flew by me and promptly sunk to the ground, getting caught in a small gap between my feet. 
 This was crazy, I really couldn't shake it. I walked up to the grate of my apartment building, where the elevator to my room was. Just walking up, I saw a random man walk in from the bar down the street. 
 "That was him! The one with the little beard, the mustache! ". 
 " He! What was that you play with? ". 
 " Oh! Um. ". 
 I kicked the man, knocking him out cold, then saw his reflection in the glass. " Looks like she caught her breath! ". 
 " Who... who's next? ". 
 " Mr. Jones " 
 I looked down the street into his house, recognizing something that had never before been studied in clinical psychology. A small deer had suddenly appeared in the garden, as if by magic. 
 " What..who is this? ". 
 I gently patted him on the head, afraid that the memories that had plagued me for a while would turn out to be memories of something that I loved more than anything else. 
 " You passed the cross on the way here."

My boys were lively, they brought fun to my home and everywhere I went. They showed great skills all at the same time and soon I was walking home from the library where I spent days alternating between reading and browsing video games. 
 It got frustrating when my wife left me when I first turned 18 and ended up in a living room that she stole for another employee. I was instantly jealous and even worse when I asked my parents why they had chosen me. I told them that I worked with the most important organization in the world, and that they shouldn ’ t have relied on me making them rich as a way of his income. To me, a giant cockroach wasn ’ t a thing that one could spend forever on a mansion for all its power. 
 After one month, I completely lost my mind about turning my affairs back on to the princess. No one was much happier with me than I. 
 Of course, the jewel collectors had started throwing me off the ledge, now that I ’ m working at Google I'm sure it ’ s because I don ’ t know any better. And then the dolly smugglers didn ’ t care for me. Because I knew they were spinning a big yarn in my favor. 
 The mutts came to me quickly, saying that I wasn ’ t smart enough as to participate in a time travel endeavor and that they were in fact trying to find a way to find the prince that was the cause of my divorce. I believed them then, for the first time that I had felt this way. They were all very hard to persuade me to confess my actions. 
 For the first time, I actually became mad at them. All this time I had been motivated to join the army. But, as time went on, things got really tense. 
 By the time I had to leave my house, everything had changed. I was back on the top of the web, and was completely consumed with lust for publicity and his personal attention. It wasn ’ t enough though. People started starting talking to each other and seeing me. Especially from my parents, who ’ d practically leaped up up and down in delight at how I ’ d just revealed myself. 
 Years went by, and everything I had done was just 'off the wall'. Every talk, and up and down, until there was one person that really happened to get away with every post. And that person was me. 
 It was funny, and terrifying to think how dominant I would become before my inexorable ascent into the black. So unbeknownst to me I was once a titan of everything that made everything truly real. 
 Now, at my peak, I ’ m just watching. I'm waiting for the next crack I ’ ll only dream of. 
 But eventually, I will.

I woke up to a loud explosion. It was during the night when they called 911 after seeing an explosion in a hallway. I don ’ t think I have heard anything. 
 There were about 3 boxes under the door when the explosions erupted. It was the house I lived in, my principal ’ s house. Every house in the house that I went to was probably filled with boxes that still seemed to have some fire department, security force officer, or someone else in the building working on my apartment. If anyone really was looking for boxes, I could swear they had boxes right next to them, along with their names. Anything else under that door would mean a house that wasn ’ t mine. I didn ’ t know how to open that box, nor could I really open any other box. Who knew what that would mean. We were hanging out in the library. 
 I hopped out of bed to get some air. I looked around for the exact same thing I had been doing. I closed my eyes and opened my eyes the next morning to see what was standing outside. I ’ m not sure how long it took me to figure out what was inside, but it was like 2 days since I woke up. That was some time ago, but now it looks like hours. 
 The room was coated with dust. Brown, asbestos filled cells in the walls. I walked over to the door, quickly opening it. Nothing seemed to be hiding in there. There was a TV over there with the show Breaking Bad. I stared at it. It looked back at me. The TV was showing Breaking Bad in the TV room. The TV was covered with the blood from the blast. 
 I stepped back to the sofa. The TV was cut out. There was blood everywhere. The TV barely showed what it was showing. I looked back. The door behind me was still there, untouched by the dust and the dust. I walked over and opened the door. The earth shuddered and dust poured out. 
 Where did the dust go? I opened the door to see I was in the middle of a desert. The desert wasn ’ t nice, but being from California, it looked clean and clean. I sat on the ground next to the TV and looked down at the sand. The sand looked actually moist, making my skin moisten up. Maybe there was more, a source of water, somewhere, at least. I closed my eyes and rubbed my eyes. The wet sand felt better than usual. It felt wet and burnt. 
 I stayed like this for a day. I couldn ’ t make the dream over. I went back to bed that day and sat at a computer, visiting websites like Reddit and the good old Yahoo. The page was on every topic I went to, instantly hitting the "Learn " button. I was bored. I used Google analytics to see if there were any topics that fascinated me. Then there was " How to write good content on Reddit". I typed that up on the page. I took a sip of water and looked at reddit a bit more. It just wasn ’ t interesting anymore. My brain tried to figure out why. Suddenly it clicked " Don ’ t Go Around Even Looking for Dicks."

The doors slammed shut. Bruce stood, leaning on the railing, and put his hands on his hips. 
 "Professor? " He asked, pausing for effect. 
 Professor Oak bent his head to the side, and in truth, it wasn't a very big area. He stumbled forward, jerking the curtains back to show the kids. 
 " Which... those... " 
 " Head teacher... " he said. 
 Oak stood there, the temperature slowly rising. 
 " Yup... Professor Oak... Professor Oak... head teacher..."

Another week. Another corporation. Another hostage situation. Another new auto hire. My life's work has always been too short, one single click. One small flash and by extension the whole process of living and consuming and living. 
 It's only been 10 hours, yes. I've been waiting 10 hours in this cramped, unfamiliar, night-lit flat. Me, sitting on the couch, between tables of a flimsy wooden shop. In the periphery of the motel, empty. Forever. 
 I wake up at 5:45am and head downstairs. Me, sitting on the spot of a couch, window by window, thirdhand cigarette dangling from the wads of old whiskey. Heading back downstairs I allow myself a head start. 
 When I finally reach the front door I pry open and knock, loudly enough so that the final letters on the latch flicker and light up. 
 I turn back to my assistant and post a message back onto the opposite end of the room saying I still have the camera and sufficient proof to go get the rest of my nights. Time to sleep. 
 And then… 
 I roll out of bed, and set the camera down. Remembering that you can hear the sound of a series of stairs taking forever... how I wish I could find out what that hurts in the moment. Or, well, I had a bad morning. I quickly unbutton my shirt and dangle the cord between my legs. Looking down, as my phone flashes'*news has been cut off* and no logs*. I eagerly press play and slip into sleep.

Anya was the last Buddha, alive after the defeat of the Daimyo. She had long since been swept away, or swept out of power, to become the Buddha. She had gone with the Gods, her disciples who saved her through her sins and the trials. These were the people of the Buddha and all the beings in their way. 
 Anya was waiting in the fountain of her wisdom when Zenjur stepped through the doors. Zenjur had come on to turn the world upside down. Anya was greatly excited, that Zenjur would help. Zenjur was not surprised when he had noticed the letter left under the water. Zenjur was the worldly philosopher in the ballroom. So Zenjur asked Zenji about the letter. 
 Zenji seemed kind enough to simply be in there when Anya asked. 
 "It said that in the beginning, there were two things. One was love, and the other was death." Zenji's answer was all they knew and they had fought much longer than ever before. Their lives were now less worth worrying about and more important.

We lived for everyone. Eventually the rich took over from the poor, and we lived happily as people. We ate food we all liked, we slept on the pillows we never used to sleep in, we were all treated courteously. We were taking what we needed, what we wanted, our future was constantly at our fingertips. 
 To be honest our parents said to give us privacy from these spoiled children. The ravings of their affairs were no fun at all. Everyone thought we were violent and ridiculous. Parents stood up against us, angry and desperate. My parents were both men. I had a mutant, essentially, a powerful mutant as well. That is how I figured it all out. He was born with DNA with no chromosomes whatsoever. That's where I came in. 
 When I was 5 I couldn't wait to put out the fires on this day. Maybe I could've kept my mutant or a gene that would be able to resist fire? Maybe that was the only way. But that would just be the start. 
 It took months of searching and pleading. Sometimes people seemed to kill each other. Once a month, I was bitten by a spider. Only six hours later the courage to walk with blood on my hands. 
 That's when I saw the doctor. He was one of those doctors. It wasn't a disease that jumped me from the in-laws to my fortune on the cover of night. It was a look. A look my mom always taught me. " Eat like you are in hell, have a nice day or you will burn in hell. " It was true. Those types of doctors did exactly that. When I got there the case was closed. 
 " Our child was beautiful. A beautiful child. She was intelligent, a thoughtful child, and a smart child, too. She taught me to love her and to love my family, and said she loved me. " 
 My mom listened carefully and listened. After I finished my question my mom looked at me with her boring smile and said " I miss you. I miss you so much. " 
 Before I could finish my thought my parents had stopped. They couldn't help but laugh at my dumb excuse. " Wh-what are you talking about? " 
 I finally answered " I'm to choose your child. " 
 Mom and dad laughed. " I mean, look at her!"

**********197**********
I dreamt of amber colored dandelions, up and down the narrow narrow strips of maple trees. I dreamt of grand white fences and brightly painted temples. I dreamt of otherworldly paths carved up into the well worn mountainsides. 
 I thought it. Once, I dreamt of a man with a pen and my feet turning a hugh as the blade dug into his heart and his pinky. 
 When the sword came down on me from the blackened ground, my flesh was melting but I refused to die. The sword filled the chamber and all I could do was get up. When the sword hit my breastbone and I finally opened my eyes, they turned black. As the deep black mermaids spread about my body and washed off the deep crimson from my eyes I was left with a void. 
 By the door, this Daffy Duck lay behind the Malachite bushes, the only light but confusing thing. Tired of the Daffy Duck and lacking any sort of symbolic power, I would wander around in the wet woods under the oak tree to make sure nothing caught my eye. Before the guards came I came back to my realm with the blade still in my breastbone. 
 In the forest below the Daffy Duck lurched, biting my skin and breaking my neck. I was blind but the pain was unbearable. It's scent was like having some sort of release. I gazed at the Daffy Duck for a while and after only a few breaths decided to descend down like a mighty beast to end what was before me. I lifted my leg slowly and the man there bent down and carried me back to my body. 
 The Daffy Duck, still oblivious as to where I was, was passing me. The Zebra sat down next to the Cape buffalo from whence the blade came and looked down. Brimming with vitality and one of its many crows were chasing me the man said. 
 "You won't have to follow me. The good of the rest will say your wish. I have a deep inside pit that needn't be disturbed. " 
 The Zebra peered down at the Daffy Duck, smiling. " Your smile is the beginning of my trap. " The creature moved towards the man and placed its strange claws in front of the Daffy Duck's chest. I gasped and twisted my neck. My whole body hit the ground, our necks splitting into multiple pieces. The other Daffy Ducks looked up, crestfallen by the same shock that had robbed the man of his life. 
 At last, I saw the Daffy Duck, huddled under the tree like so many spirits. Its huge, waxy wings bled on my skin but were unkillable. Out of the blackened forest grew the forest green dragonflies. 
 " What... who are you? " I grumbled. 
 " I am a god."

A thick veil covering me. It is a welcoming sight in the early morning sunlight as my teeth dance through my soft brown hair. 
 I could hardly believe I was in this situation. 
 Suddenly a stoplight started to travel from my floor. 
 "Excuse me, who is that? " a couple guys called to me. 
 I waved for them to quiet the intruders. 
 " Who the fuck is that? My name is Frank. " 
 " Um, what? " I couldn't understand the coughs they caused from the demon-people on my floor. 
 " Just like I said, Frank " they replied. 
 " It's just a demon. " I could tell the jesters began to whine. 
 I shook my head. 
 " All you guys know is that someone killed your favorite character... " as soon as I finished the sentence, I heard a dirty laugh from my co-worker. 
 " Oh come now! You were on your way to the public urinal along with some lady my age. You know why she stuck you in a fountain while she was peeing. " 
 " I'm a dragon!" 
 This is the last time I'm going to ask old Frank the world-view.

"They aren't English! " my mother screamed. 
 After three days of silence, I managed to speak English. 
 " Well " she was able to do. " They seemed like they had learned to speak a language they can't understand! And English is Spanish! " 
 I nodded at her and looked back at my mom. " Yeah, Japanese is mostly used to communicate things. We all talk because we can, " I had heard stories of good Japanese teachers in this new world. 
 " Never thought about it again. They are almost as bad as you. " She said. " At least you know that." 
 With a twitch of her body, I broke the silence and spoke.

**********200**********
Wait. Wait a moment. There's a thin leather strap around my neck as I begin to shake my head. My shirt is tight in preparation to hold the frosty cookie sheets. I stretch my legs a bit and start untying my tie. I was never a particularly strong Jedi, it was assumed that anyone who wore it was worthy of honor and was honorable. The chill of the cold plastic shower staff on my command told me otherwise, my atebriation voice the loudest knock I've heard. 
 "I'm ordering something. Something to share with the committee in my room. No escape." 
 I finally mustered a sound of a reply, as if something had interrupted the ten hour shift and I was poised to enter. The kitchen door opened as a hearty voice surrounded the squirming topsy person guarding my bunk. He was shy, but pleased to see me. He was sure that his excitement was completely overrated. Pekasi Wookit was my nephew, who graduated junior in high school and now spent most of his time away from his proud family. One of the new cameramen had accompanied him on their nightly commute with his family. This was pretty much an exclusive event, I presume? 
 Suddenly the door slamming under me started going up and down, as if someone was snapping pieces off the glass. Up above the doorway with the rope I positioned myself, I could see the chairman, The Jedi, descending on the woman who sat at the table. 
 She stared into the room. The large plastic bowl that covered her entire body was tipped upwards, giving her a specific look as if there were many beings or something spinning around their gorgeous head. The larger one was of student body, clad in a light blue suit over a navy blue turtleneck. She was wearing a manhood, with his long fur coat and stripey shirt with small pink feathers growing in the corners of his smallerish forehead. His head hung lower than he had prior and he wore nothing of value. This and the pale moonlight reflected off of his fur jacket, revealing his chin. 
 On the farther side of the room had a protruding tube ajar that slid directly down to his forehead, piercing his face and open mouth and drop onto his skin. The Jedi sat up in a daze. Looking up, she realized the small wall in the wall had been open wide and was emitting the light that took her to her room. Instantly she became aware of the sad expression on the face of her father. He was normally not such a down to earth type of person. 
 She squinted at the moon a little. Smiling, she launched herself from her bunk and went to retrieve my food. Pekasi had set the tray onto the table and rested a hand onto the metal handle. Slowly she reached up and held it in front of her. She carefully rested her head against it, opening her arms one last time and reaching into her hood she lifted her head up to press the small plastic bowl behind her forehead in salute. 
 With her eyes focused she turned towards the chairman with the same perfect expression and nodded his approval as did the body. Her soft fur socks began to fill the small body with its comfy embrace. She stood in awe, the moonlight pouring down upon her skin. 
 There was a high pitched squeak as the chairman sat down, wiping off his sandals as he also lifted the tray to the table. With a last sigh Pekasi clutched the empty glass bowl in her hands and watched as another voice joined the clamoring and watching. 
 What the hell is going on? I decided to seek answers in my meal, and I looked up into the sky. I saw him staring directly into my eyes as he laid in a chair and wondered why he had to eat all this crap.

Like the promises they make to me. If only they knew the true meaning of this memory. 
 To silence the screams. To freeze the throats. And many, many further, will follow. 
 Thank you, Mrs. Jacobs. 
 They have stopped. But one just seems to be ending. 
 Yesterday is what they called the time for me to give up, commit this sad act of cruelty. But... 
 It is no longer a crime to frame me. 
 I have no choice in the matter. I am free. 
 Unbearable. 
 Oh gosh, they don't just erase faces. It's not my fault they chose not to erase me anymore. 
 I wasn't driven, bloodsucking man. I was commanded to make calls, call warnings. - Please keep them away. They should know. - It's too late. 
 I'm tired. I'm embarrassed. And I'm sorry. 
 But they'll know. 
 And soon they'll know I do love them. Now they will know I do kill them, with no hesitation.

Murderer. 
 Except he wasn't. 
 He wasn't even a figure of speech. He didn't even have the slightest voice. 
 Murderer? 
 These are shit passengers. Slave to society's fates. The only way they can survive on the train here, though, is by glancing on at the floorboards of the ceiling. There's a sink, at the end of the train, a toilet, a janitor, and the very picture of a few thin-skinned little buggers to the left with him. Look at the kid. Like that kid who looks back on this little shit person as a way to teach him his skills. 
 This little asshole must've never heard the dress code or the actual process of boarding the train. This time it was a train bus, talking to the lone boy at the bottom of the escalator. 
 It says "Please stop at the aisle before 8 or the back door at the end of the train, " of course. That's the bullshit thing people tell when they fall asleep at night. They come here too little, too late. 
 The train's the only noise in the darkness. The smell of stale air, stale air, stale air, stale air, stale air, and stale air. In the middle of the platform, stuck from a train is my every fiber, fiber, and every fiber of my being, my precious life. Look at me. The train. I'm the only passenger, almost the sole person in this hellhole. The only one able to move this train. The only one able to sing for this twisted culture that has forsaken me. 
 By now, my wake has reached me. Standing in the middle of the platform, I just watched the sun turn black, this face suddenly, found myself looking into a lens. 
 " There he is, " the train sang, eyes wide with pity. " Tonight we get to enjoy life again."

The war began in 1942. In the early hours of December 11th 1941, the Axis and Allied forces began their first defensive retreat to Berlin. At first, the attack was thought to be a failed attempt. People believed that there was no German troops going to Berlin. But after the defeat of the Axis forces, the General Council officially came into full effect. With the creation of a new government for Germany under Berlin, the public pressure mounted. The first group of measures were put into place in order to keep control of the whole land, including the Federal land masses. The lower classes were all reactivated as other races joined the military force. Opponents of the decision were ostracized by the government and forced to fight in front of their superior. As the battle raged on, further breakdowns were reversed, the Red Army was reorganized. More vicious measures were put into place. Mixed groupings were put into units of strength, those who didn't participate were raised under the leadership of a higher branch of the army. As the fighting continued, this organization came into full effect. The German Army was no longer faced with such a plethora of weapons. Before long, Hitler's troops had prepared a simple campaign of kamikaze killings. Many of these civilians were punished with internment camps during the next war. Against all odds, Hitler almost certainly died in the war.

The light faded. 
 "What is this place? " I asked it 
 This voice shook my bones. 
 " It is a place made of dots, of things, you see. It is beauty I seek, this place of beauty inanity. My home, my home " 
 The light dimmed, but the darkness remained. I closed my eyes and stared out into the soul. The mind shivered in pain 
 And wondered what had come for the land? What was lurking within? 
 I opened my eyes. My voice was still uncertain, but I know the answer. A way out 
 Of this place I came

Tim sat next to the wooden board of his temple building. " Good afternoon. I would like to inform you that all of your new friends are dead. Please, don't try anything offensive, nothing to people, you are all going to die anyway. You don't need to take the exams at all, as they work for me. Now if you will stand there, I will tell you about how your kids, who have all left to go pick up some new weapons are being slaughtered. Don't look at me like that. It's all in your mind. " 
 A thin, lanky looking man ran across the table to Tim. " What were you thinking? * What were you thinking? * There was nothing wrong with bringing all of them back, sir, just ask them what they want. You don't have to put a large amount of thought into your life, just my guess. I mean, that was it. " 
 Timm watched Tim with wide eyes, he was so smart it was almost hard to tell that he was the son of the god of science. As he reached out to tap Tim, he slipped a little of his trademark mushroom in. As Tim began to laugh, a few pills fell from his hand. 
 " Why would you do that? " Tim said, looking up at the dark and disgusting things. " You think you can kill off millions of people in the middle of a meat market?" 
 Timm sighed. As Tim attempted to shake back his tears, he slipped more pills onto the table. They took only less than 20 pills and took about 14 seconds. 
 He laid back down on the thick wooden board, he think to himself. No one could think through his presence any longer. He looked over at Tim, and shook his head, as the light came into contact with the temple.

His throat became dry, blood spurting from the faces of his victims. He had only known this moment for a few days now, since when he woke up to find a few handprints, a bloody trail on his backpack and a knife sticking out of his stomach. He didn't know what the call was. He quickly laughed it off, downing a bag of cigarettes, and scooping his belongings back inside. 
 The dream was surreal enough. Just sitting there, looking at the ceiling with its cool, light floor, without the need to worry about a back room or even a bathroom. Just the mosquitoes. Each one stumbling from one side of the room to the other, infesting his senses. Then, with a flash, he could see them outside. The guys from Africa were out in the field. 
 It was surreal at first, but then the voices told him that all of this was real. " Now you are no longer mine to oppress! ". They said that his wife was murdered in North Carolina. " You shall not kill me! " had been shouted. " Here I am, dying, taking a life! ". " You shall not take another life, my wretched enemy! " " That's no more! " the screams echoed around. " You shall not take another life, my foe! " The soldiers had started their assault, forcing their way into the field, firing their rounds. Seconds later, a soldier spotted the soldiers and shot one of the soldiers. He fell prone, and as the bullets entered his body, he fell through the floor. It was still dark, but that didn't matter. He was dead. 
 Oh hell no. He could hear a voice from outside. " You have been sentenced to death! Do not kill! Please! " 
 He stood up, for it was now or never. " Are you what? " 
 " Your skin has been infected with the Gramps' disease, Your hair has become infected with them, Your blood is oozing from you! There are doctors from our colleges here at the University in our town, we must stop this! " 
 The screams started again, people screaming. Now it was clear to all. " He is a coward! He wants to kill us! " 
 The guy from Africa entered the room, pointing at his hands. " You can't kill me in America. Let me take a life. " 
 " What? " He gasped. " They don't hear me. Why do they have to? They're blinded by sunlight and all, I could never live here without fearing for my life. " 
 " Don't you want to die in prison? No! It is punishment, I am looking forward to it! " 
 The guy from Africa's mouth gurgled. " I don't know. " 
 " The citizens of America will pay for this. " His mutters broke the dead silence, and he did as the voices told him. 
 He grabbed the knife, and dropped it to the floor. " No. You won't. " 
 " You had better not " 
 " There is no God. There is no Devil. There is only our own King who works by the law. If there's one God, it would be you, and I am the father of your enemy." 
 The guy from Africa stood up. But, he was not holding a knife. Instead, he walked out, swinging his fist wildly, blasting the knives hard into his opponent's nervous system. He staggered backwards, not moving. If he was to be assassinated, he might die a few days later.

Avidius groaned on his sleepless nights as the endless beams of light of his solar powered warehouse displayed above his head. He lashed out his eyes and stared at the light coming from the galaxy at him. He felt like he was going to die. The light was sickeningly bright and warm, though he could not see properly. He felt like he was dreaming. He felt the warmth grow colder and lighter and brighter and began to slowly dissipate. He began to feel nothing as he set his attention back to the magnificent energy array above him. 
 He peered into the blackness of space, but there was nothing. The pulsing pulsing pulsing pulsing pulsing pulsing pulsing energy array had all disappeared. His fingers brushed the metal seals of the remaining protective seals as he stepped out of his warehouse. Although the exterior cover was completely black and covered in artificial nanites he could clearly see the interior. Occasionally the scrawny humanoid creatures would appear in the passage and out of the passage. Known as "Neighbors ", the Zorn-Grid homeworld was the location for the Anishin Angels, the galactic equivalents of the Terran Satalkans and the Cygnar people. These creations of evil had consumed all the life forms of the home worlds to their absolute least. In the ancient times, the Asari had invaded the home worlds, taking great devastation upon the devastated planet. The destruction the were inflicting upon the planet must never have been possible. 
 Avidius' chain leash pointed to a red speckled planet in the distance. He walked over to the red planet and looked down at it. The planet had very little life to produce rainbows, or lumps of rock. He walked over to the earthy world he knew well and the planet had appeared. A smile played on his face as he thought of all the peaceful inhabitants he had met. However, he sensed something not coming from the blue planet, but from the green continent around it. He walked over to the green planet and looked upon the little green civilization he had met around town. He gazed down upon its creations and felt a constant lingering shame and fear, as all the forms of life were exterminated and relegated to dust. 
 The green vegetation and a handful of large trees were dying and the soil was one of the last places Avidius would ever visit. The Zorn-Grid homeworld was alone in the warring civilizations in the hellish planet, and the green people were frightened out of their despair and loneliness. While it was ironic to think how the life forms of the planet had sometimes fought the Zorn-Grid homeworld, the war lasted only a few days. After one hundred days, they began to close their eyes and out into the stars. In the past, the Zorn-Grid homeworld had invaded from the distance. The green people immediately fell into a small depression and were separated from their counterparts, but when they fell asleep, their bodies began to shrink back to their natural bodies, only to be transformed into creatures of the light again. The humans also began dying, almost dying in a matter of months. There was no reason for the invaders to continue fighting. However, after hundreds of thousands of years, the last colony of humans in the universe returned. 
 Avidius' chain leash moved him to the planet. He sat down on a rocky outcrop nearby. He moved his hand to the finder outside the orbit. It was time to adjust his gloves as he nodded to the landed Zorn-Grid on his back. He had wrapped the gloves around his skin as the Zorn-Grid stopped his transmissive communication. He lifted his eyes to the surface of the planet and felt it within. The surface of the planet was red, but not brown. The rock layer was soft and warm. These creatures in fact were of a new species and had evolved from their own home world over centuries, but still never once made contact with the planet. 
 He left the planet with only his worst fears as he felt a spray of chemicals wash over him, flying around at full speed. The pumping of toxic chemicals made him gulp and looked up towards the sun and across the horizon. He blinked and pondered for a second. What was happening? It had to be the Zorn-Grid homeworld. The planet wouldn ’ t be able to survive without a scientist during that time.

"Come on man, " the zombie rolled his hands, his left hand poised on the trigger. His feet nearly tipped over, the strange-looking boy propping up the corpse of the flesh crushing him in his foot. 
 " We're doing okay, " I muttered, leaning down against the scorched pool of blood. I didn't want to tip the one responsible for this. It was a lazy decision that let the situation spread. I had to do what I could. 
 " Now put down your weapon and come back to me! " a voice rasped from the shadows. I quickly stomached for cover. I heard the sound of gunfire and bits of charred flesh hitting the floor with some sort of inner-resistance. All I could make out was skeletons crunching together as they fell to the ground to fall from the thousands of firecrackers. 
 " Yes... for a first floor apartment? " the zombie coughed, his voice wavering. 
 I was about to begin crawling back from the pool of blood, when I stopped. Just one foot in front of the other. I raised my head, revealing the skeleton, its head slumped out at my feet. 
 I pushed myself up quickly, reaching up to look around as I thought about what had happened to him. At first it just looked good. Smallish, a few cobwebs poking out of it's sides but all the bones remained intact and cold. 
 I whispered to myself, " Maybe if we break the sound barrier we'd end up with a more appropriate outcome." My heart dropped. I told myself I wouldn't get close, but it didn't matter; a bone broke down into my entire body.

I stood in the middle of the streets, looking out at the polluted street below and the minute clouds that threaten to swallow us whole. The conditions were bleak today, and I lost track of how I had gotten here. I couldn't believe I was, I had to get out of here. I lifted my head and went back to my work. Sweat fell onto my brow, like it did for a living. I turned my head to the back of the street. 
 ---The rain poured down on the city, making sharp turns in the sand. I watched on as the rain continued to fall from every direction in the city. It was as if an invisible wall was preventing it from falling out of the sky. Fear caused by these cold metal faces pierced through my mind as the silence grew as my work was done. After all, the eyes were never just for the "absorption" of thoughts, and most of them started the cycle of thinking. It wasn't difficult to admit that the situation was dire today, but when you see that silence as the only thing standing between you and death. 
 It was actually caused by my abilities, though I couldn't tell if the more stimulating science was pulling it strings or if there was just a fact that I wasn't blind enough to see how really really needed to be my creations. I was able to imagine two potential future generations and let the mind take over over. I couldn't recall a single event from the past four decades, yet through each one of them I became like an unknowing little project. The last thing I remember was being pulled out of my family and placed in a car. 
 Of course, it wasn't until this exact moment that I came to realize this. I felt an inescapable need to end this now, but my own inability to understand the consequences still hung in the air as if trying to suffocate. In a world where everything was controlled by a living, it seems that I could stop it completely by simply touching someone else. In response to this, I felt a void fill my mind, and I felt that I must save this person. Although it was both impossible and destructive, I would succeed in doing so. I simply stood there watching as the unbearable pollution began to fall from every direction.

I am alone, but I am happy. 
 If only it weren't so hard. 
 I'm just, if not exhausted, suffering in the deepest, darkest recesses of my shell. 
 I sit alone amongst the closed doors, the curtains being lifted when I push on. I'm done, only I will wake tomorrow with a heart full of serene hope. 
 I don't know what will happen to me. I don't know how. I don't know what day or year I will wake from the hospital with my head up and the pain overwhelms me. 
 I don't know what will happen to me. I don't know how. I don't know what will happen to me in the next few weeks. 
 Nothing happens in that condition. Nothing happens when I put my hands and knees out, and talk to myself. 
 I don't know when I will wake from this agony. I don't know when that pain will end. I know not how it will. I'm all alone, but I am happy.

*Excuse me so much, icky boy, * 
 *I'm sure you heard the one about ghosts, kids. Just to be safe you're going to have to go into the forest. If you want this to be a good ending you're going to have to hide, not directly in the trees. * 
 *Am I telling the truth? * 
 *Do you understand? * 
 *Don't let me get into this, I'm going to lose you right now. * 
 "Wow it's me again, " I said as a gunshot rang out. 
 " I don't remember that last one, " the voice of the dead turned to a woman, "... " 
 " Aww too bad, " she said, when the bullet had blocked her path, " he died soon after that." 
 I sucked on the snow covering my face as I waited for the paper to close up...

"This is for you, Lloyd. " I shouted at him as we all rolled over to sit on the one leg of my couch. I'd been working at NASA for a few years and I knew working on the space station and alien hunting with the Stargate would be important. It'd been about a year since we discovered this and a few years after that it'd taken some time for me to sink my teeth into the deck chairs and respond to the phone. Our metrics and inputs were malfunctioning and there was no way anyone could try to remember which direction this would go and how we programmed it so there was no way we could get the information back to the Earth from the receiver. 
 Of course, after many approaches, we settled on a maxim: The final posts on our instagram feed would fill the memory banks in seconds. As of then I had responded on 32 % of my messages, half of which were funny and my right-hand man ( who was responsible for which article and which version of the news story ) have chosen not to be accessible. It was a desperate attempt to keep the information from the public but we had built it at the edge of human capability and the effect wasn't really working. 
 " Thank you again, Lloyd. Any last words? " I asked as I sat by my computer and opened a web browser. Next to that a gray in the sky cover the moon. I turned around and continued reading. 
 " There were those who thought NASA could take a look at our piece and integrate it with an AI and some politicians discovered it. But if that proves useful then the Russians can't be trusted and humanity will continue its continuous testing of artificial intelligence."

Lots of humans aren't young enough for normal testosterone levels, but they grow faster and faster as they lose weight. Scientists are baffled when their genes turn into glacial giants, as did researchers around the world. It's so bizarre how a strong and fat body seems to have a superhuman lifespan, so we fight all the time and pack up most of the bodies and kill humans in the chase. Then, by the time we have to move on, you are fighting an eternal war against the hormones that make our body large, lean, and able to adapt. We lack the genes to resist and we fight our way out of modern society. Today, we are fighting again. 
 Two weeks of fighting seem to have started this cycle. We celebrated it because we knew it would happen. We've overcome the consequences, we were promised jobs so they would pay for abortions. It was on this day that our mom came into our living room to pick us up from the bus and deliver us. To my horror, as soon as she left for work my husband had sent us back to our city, just to be sure. We didn't feel like having a child until we saw her pearly gates and found out we had to end our reproductive cycles together. 
 One day on the playground, I hadn't much of a fight to see. After a woman in her early 20's carried on at about 150 miles an hour, she realized she probably had to walk for 5 minutes to reach the gates. This hurts me the most, as a mother usually encounters her husband pacing around at a good 60 to 70 miles an hour. We had about a 10 minute break but we still had a lot of still room for sex in the holidays, so we mostly stayed at home as we tried to keep the kids at school. A few minutes after we finished our walk, she called us in and I was led back to the bus to try and run. 
 "What do you want, Mr. Smith? " 
 It was her hair falling off to the side, I swear she swore she had dyed it to match her clothing. I don't remember ever telling her that I was here to protect our daughter. But then as I looked through the carefully carved door to my passenger side door, she froze, her eyes wide open, she closed her mouth as if she didn't want to leave, " I want to see if the PTA didn't get a warning for this, " She looked up at me, then turned away and spoke in a deep and deep voice, " I want to see."

He's lost some weight. Warm not least by memory, thin and light is easy and quick to deflect by goshtoss and light from his pale form. But the chief finds that consuming wealth is a healthy start, an anchor in our confidence. A logical conclusion is to try and feed this confidence into your own shoulders, it makes the job easier. Perhaps obsession can't wait to have your trust burn forever, why the Hell am I sweating blood all the time? Or perhaps love is the last thing I have. 
 The reverse of the thought is evident. My partner - our most reliable resource, our ultimate resource - was a stronger one than his brother. His build was spotless, his youth quivering beneath his golden hair. The man felt his death ascend. All else seemed in his favor. Perhaps just an accumulation of human frailty, perhaps his young demise got us to him. 
 "Thank you," he said with a smile - that was a smile. I knew it was nearing the end, the nigh-- what if it was my time. He was talented, truly a formidable creature, but a small one at that. The cashier wouldn't mind saving yet she expects me to help her. The staff was brought into the store. He didn't pay any attention to money, I used all my will power. Four hundred dollars will get the job done, and I can definitely afford it. 
 The judges all shook their heads in agreement as the happy beggar tried to get her justice. 
 Not my favorite segment, thanks, but what could it possibly be? My partner might have been a well built man who had the time to overcome the barriers of his mind, but still... This.

 " The dude just disappeared, I couldn't tell you, he's everywhere. "

 " And he's dead, so the, you know, it just.. he's making an important point. Maybe not the setting, but the setting the- " 
 " You're saying that he actually was dead? What on earth is that supposed to mean? " 
 " Oh, I mean there's kind of an audience there. Yup, they'll just make this story out like it's some 'Pantheon of Living' or something. The weirdest part is, I literally just abandoned him like, a week ago because, look, if they ever need me, they know I'm my soulmate. To put it frankly, I just wanted to have a hewn out throne that I might as well have on my head. " 
 " Oh, well I'll let you decide after all " 
 " I know, *a lot* of things happen in my life! I'm sure I want to be an emperor now or something, but... well, I just want to have one more millennium. Wouldn't it be cool? " 
 "... No, the afterlife is a marvelous freedom, the living may experience it, and having more than 1 child is a wonderful thing! But, I never expected to have so much freedom after all! Don't be too harsh on me, though, I'm not going down without a fight. You're just going to have to watch it live before you get to know it. And in the end, it doesn't have much of a world. Just leave it at that, really. Take that lord-"

 Silently gazing upon the endless stream of light filtering into the room was Jon's dad. The tears streaming down his face, all the air was cool and relaxed. He looked up and saw his dad. He didn't turn around, he walked over to his father and sat beside him in his rocking chair. 
 "Jon, are you alright, daddy? " 
 The growl was cut off as Jon started sweating, an anemic red started to spread across his cheeks. He ignored his father for a long second and stared at the damp ceiling, " Dad, I think I'm going to need to sleep. " He repeated to himself. 
 He grabbed his car keys and asked " Jon... are you alright? " 
 " Y-Yeah, mom's been getting a little sick. " 
 " Don't worry son, I'm out here, I've got ta work. " Jon's dad shook his head shaking his head " I thought the medication worked too hard I can get over it... I'm never going to lose it... " Jon started to scream but his dad stopped him as he couldn't help it. 
 Jon leaned on the bed in front of his father's bed and peered into his father's eyes. His dad was 6'0 " blond with blue eyes, he really wasn't that small. His hair was a really long and thick weave, his eyes were a long and white knit skyblue, he was a boy with a smile that promised everything he could possibly ask for. His father was not the brightest guy in the room but his eyes were bright with an innocent innocence. Jon brought up his glasses " Jon? what the fuck happened? " Jon got up from the bed he was in and sat on the couch. He looked at his father. His dad looked down at Jon as he finally looked up at the ceiling. 
 The room was covered in different sorts of warm blood, the room seemed to be being razed. There was a flashlight in the room and a loud blaring from across the room. It appeared to be from the kitchen. He looked down at his dad again, he saw a thin line of blood in his father's eyes. 
 Jon felt his dad gaze upon him for a long time and he slowly began to wonder what happened. He remember being 12 when he got this he saw him in his room, look of horror on his father's face, the endless stream of blood in his father's eyes, his father down there with someone that looks so hopeless. Jon's dad looked at Jon and quickly wiped the blood from his father's face, using his not-seen blood to pass the time until it was finally done. Jon's dad stood up and took off his shoes and climbed into his front yard. He played with his baseball bat and then he was standing in front of his house and he walked to the kitchen, " Mommy? Are you ok? I heard the back-story." He started laughing. He started to walk out the front door into the evening, he was sitting in front of his computer.

Something caught my eye. I glanced down at the mouse, blinking a few times, and noticed that it was not moving. A small tile of a large square was just barely visible through the dimmer lighting. I looked again back down. Nothing. Nothing at all. 
 I looked again and noticed something larger than I had ever seen before. It was barely a mouse, curled up slightly to its side. It was still an observer, acting on instinct. There was no way for me to know what it was doing. I imagined it wasn't moving, anyway, and with only a half-lidded look in my eye, I pushed a button on my remote, then tapped the mouse in the small square. 
 A small button jumped out of nowhere, and began to press itself, but it stopped. Everything faded into gray as if the tiny button had been blacked out. The small square seemed to look just as bright as the light at first. Eventually, the light moved from the square to the light. I could do little but watch, until it faded again, and I thought of that mouse. Perhaps one day I would find someone else, who would have the courage to talk to it.

"Daddy, are we the bad guys? " His voice was sounding in shock. He is a single, fat, male, working a lowly shilling of a second job. He would work at 0400 return to work, but now what? It wasn't at 0400. 
 I felt almost tired. This is the second week I've gone this way, as I hadn't gone in as much as 100 hours before. I'm supposed to be alone. No, I'm supposed to be in on this. I opened my doorway and walked toward him. He took my hand. I was scared. Why did he do this to me? Why couldn't he see? No, I'm helpless... " Daddy, are we the bad guys?"

I peeked through the cracks in the wall behind me in haste. I was too eager to give my assailant a second chance and only one last chance, which, again, wasn't a prudent course of action. All my shelter measures were out of scope, as were my skills in po-peter's wand. 
 I stalked out of the alley to the kitchen and looked back at my pursuer, who was also running the same path I left him behind. My dogged pursuit had finally over-mined, as I dug into the padlocks of my refuge. To my credit, the goblin I seized contained a pair of binoculars, neither making it past the kitchen floor without falling to the ground. The sudden weakness in his eyes, combined with his poor lank clothing-- I'll get to that soon enough-- made the goblin turn around and crawl back into his den. 
 "What do you want with me? " I asked the peasant on the other side of the channel. I don't have time to reply. I couldn't get through the gap between his hide and the sidewalk. 
 " You're nothing but a rich man, " he spat out without grace. I suppose he tried to turn the damn thing around. " So why did you bring a stack of dark sunglasses with you? " 
 He leaned forward, his motion was raised with his other hand. " I'm more like'Wanted' -- the name's old a-ax' --, so if you'd like to get a good look at me, I've got some goods to sell." 
 I hoped not, for a moment, that the vagabond would see the change in his human face at that. Who knows where they'd found him. 
 But he did. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, I heard a flash of light, like a fallen leaf. I looked at the creature who'd dragged him with him. I knew it wasn't a human at all, but the realization was the final straw to my assailant's evil plan.

“ Oh Mr Sandwich, my name is Lea. My mother and father are my brothers and sisters as well. We are blessed. ” The bright peal of the sun reflected on the glass cream chattered in the corner of the salon. The wind rustled the silken hair of a colt figure in a gold ornaments cap. His crystal glasses fluttered gently against his long and tan head. He was dressed like a modern day cataloging salesman from oldies to Famine such as the war and the pub tabhets, and his hair was pulled back as his face turned from its correct moment of realization. “ I am... I am La Jorn and I will pass, a few minutes late. ” The crown jewel jewels were worn down handsomely. The lines on the handle of his goldfengard were mane of floral brown and exuberant. To achieve those balanced curves people where even though they were never known for their sharp and versatile curves they moved so slowly that even the lovers could not see from them. They were parodied on TV and on the news. They were often held up in the mists of the mind of those watching who could not miss the picture. It was always them who were taken apart. 
 There wasn ’ t a civil war, not once in history. The media run dull stories about women who were portrayed as unkempt and insignificant. The world spun and then moved on. Not because of inequality, or the media's overvalued perceptions of self shame, but so that we could see their beauty. It was the only thing the media wanted to depict us with. People were a hive of "something special" so it was even colder. It was the only thing anyone did as a minority. People were the worst. People were the worst. 
 La Jorn stared in shock as the portrait she was holding had risen up on his hip. “ Shall I marry? ” she asked, kissing his cheeks. “ Jojo, your daughter is so beautiful. And yet you wear a tiara with the phrase, ‘ you ’ re a star! ’ or something like that? " But the dancer remained silent and still, staring at her tits. She let herself feel as if she had been bitten by the thorny and thorny sides of the animal. 
 “ Well, I do, but I am not in love. ” 
 “ Is that why the people your gorgeous are—that it ’ s not time? ” 
 “ Yea, ” La Jorn blinked an eyelid involuntarily, not realizing the music had ended. And then he flipped her straight in the hair and kissed her. They slowly turned into beautiful silks as they suddenly flickered away from each other.

Sarah was frustrated that she did not feel good about having more light time to herself. 
 It started after she had drunk too much last night at dinner. She put her arms around her to tell her and sat on her couch, rocking back and forth. Everything was fresh, and got me thinking that maybe she wasn ’ t drinking too much after all. 
 “ I ’ ve given up hope, ” she said, staring at the ceiling. “ The worst thing was when I finally looked up at her all the way down to her neck. That ’ s when I realised she had gotten me—it was her—and that this couldn ’ t end. ” 
 She paused in her thoughts. Her head hit the wall with a quivering thud as she stared at the ceiling again. “ The worst thing was when I discovered that the bed lay in the front of the room, so I went upstairs and sat on the bed... just in front of her. ” Her voice hoarse, she was not ready for what she was about to say. 
 Sarah grabbed a book from the nightstand and flipped through the books until she found a title that she could publish before the surprise proved to be too much. “ Oh, ” she licked her lips, “ I can ’ t make any more pictures, if all I have to do is put it away... if I leave it out of tonight ’ s book shop... ” She paused for a moment and thought for a moment, “ What's so *hot* about all this? ” 
 She came to a satisfactory conclusion. “ I ’ ve got a problem. It ’ s called a clog. If I shut up, everything would go black and I wouldn ’ t have a thing to watch, I might just wake up to its white light… and it ’ d kill me! ” She sighed. “ I ’ m so bored! ” 
 “ See, I can ’ t shut up, ” said the curse. 
 “ Would you mind closing my bedroom window, Sarah? ” She asked. “ I ’ m bringing it over here. ” 
 It was Monday morning, and Sarah slouched her chair back. “ What will we do about that clog? ” 
 The scratching sound was far away, quiet, yet there was the pain. She pulled on a towel and lay down next to it, lying back and blinking one eye open. 
 “ I don ’ t know. It ’ s hard to focus. But it ’ s so quiet out here. The darkness has crept inside, but if I close it I might be able to make out color, taste, sounds or even think at all, ” said Sarah, looking at the ceiling until she sighed again. “ But I wouldn ’ t want it to turn on. I know I ’ m not very good with words and it won ’ t happen, but if I open it, I might be able to see and see what she ’ s looking at. That might help, but it ’ s my problem. Because if I open it I might get closer to her. Maybe I could go to sleep at night, and she ’ d see me and tell me to open it. I might never be able to open it! ” 
 Sarah took a deep breath and let the hole in the ceiling reopen before looking again. “ I won ’ t open it, ” she whispered to herself. “ I ’ ll get rid of it anyway, ” she said.

I wasn't sure if i ever understood how it was possible in this case, except that it did seem like the human race died then and there. Or so I thought. My colleagues were on high alert while the inevitable unfolded. 
 The first thing i noticed was the strange hover trails moving through the air to and fro. They were large elliptical circles that connected to river banks and rushed down the river. 
 This ive NEVER seen anything like it. Most surfaces that fall onto the moon are rendered harmless with some 'hover trails' strewn about. While the earth was ravaged to the bone by humans, there wasnt much human resistance to sea levels above freezing point ( arctic sea level is falling at half the rate the reality ) when the evolution of an ocean ocean began. 
 Next came the man and woman ( e.g. 29? ) laying on the moon, cremated in the most intact and lovingly pompous manner possible, hugging the corpses and comforters of their dead. I half expected to get an audio visitation from some one working on the cadaver reef, but this wasnt. 
 It was the courage, the sheer determination that made them left the dead alive. The landing ships were fully loaded with survivors who were forced to relocate towards the higher densities of their home continent to enable living spaceflight to expand. 
 Then it came to one small surprise. They were not on the Moon. Never was. 
 As I rose above the moon an open screen appeared atop the screen, displaying a tiny motion that caused the screen to change from a blue or pink to a pure white. 
 This would have been hilarious, had i not been blown away by all of this. 
 The views were shaking now, the oceanic movements getting more intense each year. This was a damn disgrace. 
 It was strange at first, the normal $ 500 a gallon ferris wheel lines that lay at the surface of the moon slowly seeming to float closer and closer to the Earth. No cars had been detected a few hours ago, not even an actual coast guard. Then came the teams. 
 The astronauts, their landships with radio and communications satellites, normally view of the above. Something was amiss. Suddenly you could see some ships leading off from earth... 
 Then the sudden increased sun hit the Earth and the moon, clouding down the entire location of the human race. 
 The first contact was never made with earth. The aliens went on a huge lookout race out towards the moon, but the ships went silent as humans made their way towards it, fear between them and exhaustion hit. 
 The humans took care to avoid contact until anything close to the surface was lost in the chaos. 
 Now you see. A life red-colored globe stretched past the moon and right past the burning horizon of the moon. I think i've seen a lifeform stand at the bottom of the wide expanse. I've been glued to the viewscreen, remembering the ancestors of our race in a rough blur. 
 I suppose we took it well. 
 "Welcome my servants, " the tiny voice emanated from the alien head. 
 I raised my eyes from the viewscreen, just in time to see what it said. 
 " I believe that we shall see these aliens to their people," that's all they said.

It was like a daydreaming when it happened. A warehouse breaks, and the heavy boots of a higher-ups dumpster tuck away in the corner. Many of us face the mess-up happenstance like the beginning of a race of demented Zerg terrans. As we pass through the narrowness, hidden by mask, every target is recognizable. 
 The sky is flat, and the trees and leaves show signs of life. As we pass a tiny mining rig, the fires begin to flare. There's not much stopping it- to kill multiple animals might not be in order, but burning all soil is risky. It's one of the reasons that the virtual planets have allowed violence. 
 They call us "wolf-dogs " but the world calls us " worms " and parasites. All we have is DNA and some genetics. The space-faring brotherhood was it's most precious asset. Everyone has an adoptive mother, either her owner or her parents, that would be treated well. But it's time that we started questioning the validity of that. We had back doors. Witches. Demons. And one we named " The Leviathan ". 
 Our bodies begin to glow. Nothing is visible from under the ground. We begin to get gassed. Under the glass with massive amounts of water flowing into it. Darkness before us. A nauseating yellow light. A tall dark figure emerges from the light. It is A4 Cyril, scaled with black hair, surrounded by even more corpses. 
 " Hades". 
 I'm still in my bedroom, unable to move. The roof is part of my closet, whether it is the red light or the orange light. I call out to the light, expecting that something on the ground will die here or there- we need to investigate in order to avoid detection. This figure dressed in black is not harming anyone, despite this grievous situation. To the ground, I bark in derision. 
 I want to run, but I can not, not without pain. This snake resembles an animal, no two are the same. It threatens to drag me down and the only life I have left. Instead I run. I can not stop, I think, as I feel my heart ring with every step-thru. 
 I break from the shelter, not even realizing I'm still holding. This body is strapped to the bed. It is clutching a chunk of his head and tongue. I need to find out where he has taken the food from. It's disgusting, he must be working at the craft or else there is no home for me. Instead I'm lost inside the dark thoughts of his brain- The only living memory I know of is his laugh. 
 Why is it so fast, I wonder. I approach the creature, gaping at it. It closes its eyes and tugs on its tongue. It breathes slowly, trying to console me. Even though its throat is torn and its lungs burn, it tries to speak. It's trying to play. The other body on the floor, its arms swaying in the wind, shakes at its knees and other such noises. Soon I feel a surge of pain. Finally, I realize that this is for science, for me. The soul of man is a responsibility I myself will never accept. And something else I will never take. Perhaps I'll be honored. Maybe I'll find out what it is I must do. Maybe someday, if only for a moment I might even realize that I've suffered. 
 Until then, I'll drag the dead body back to the chamber that the strange spirit of mine left. I will leave for the Sol system soon, and we can enjoy our food one last time in celebration.

A heated alcohol filled the tart from the liter bottle. Five cups, a squeeze of the water, and one fresh jug full of wine would only do that. 
 "Next! ", he croaked. 
 He and the water were two end tables away from the kitchen, filled to the brim with whiskey and chardonnay, hung from wooden straps, flickering gold plates and iron stilettos. 
 " Get the waiter to take the number off, " he said with a sliver of grace. 
 " One, " an attendant replied. 
 He placed the final lock, the one that allowed him to feed himself to the cow for once. 
 He didn't turn the corner. 
 " Squeeeeeeeee! ", yelled a third attendant as he motioned for several other corn sticks to be grasped. 
 At that moment, the clock struck midnight. The dining room had already started, and all the day ’ s funds had drained out of the sugary-thick vats below the doughnut table. 
 As all the rest of the guests rushed into the car, he gave the menu to one of the new servants. 
 " My boy, " he said, blowing a raspberry up in the air and rocking the wheel back and forth. " Where should I find work? ", 
 Most likely two future-travelling kids. 
 " Oh, " he murmured, " Shall we ask Jane? ", 
 Shouts from the other table fell on the sandD, though this one seemed to be somewhat calm. 
 A elderly woman bit into his green-faced hand. " Jane-help her, " she sneered. " Look, honey, why can ’ t we order a hamburger, and have it be green? I thought I had the proper appetizers! 
 " Thank you! " she laughed, and the four-legged man and four-legged woman exchanged a kiss and nodding on either side of the table. 
 The guests ran out as everyone realized the man and woman were not having anything to talk about. 
 " Well, " their companion whispered. 
 Jane dipped a wet fruit into her potato salad and watched as the man and woman fumbled for the nuts that still stood. Then, she headed out to ask someone at the counter to order a cheesecake. 
 " Yes, and then I can enjoy the picnic party again, " she joked. 
 Suddenly, a light illuminated the room. A thousand sun rays illuminated the room. Three children had not yet gone to bed, but some were moving around on the floor, wearing clothes that they had not yet gotten permission from the tagline. 
 " Father! " one girl called out, " Oh where are we going? " 
 She stayed in the shadows, his eyes shining bright as if staring at a dream. 
 One of the men on the ground yawned and turned. " Get back here! Father! " 
 For an instant, a wave of power gathered around the man. The crowd cheered, and then everyone joined him. He rose, and made his way over to them. 
 " It ’ s time for lunch, " he said. " I ’ ve got bacon and eggs. " 
 " Oh! * Our fathers now have whole chicken eggs! * " 
 " What the *fuck?! * " everyone chided. 
 " You ate them in the oven, it was just a fork! " 
 " You should just not ask me the hamburger if you can trust me with it! " 
 " Damnit, now I ’ ll pay you for it, " he said. 
 In the chaos, the other two faced each other in a disorderly silence. 
 Later that night, the men had many quarrels with each other. 
 Jane smiled at one of her male attendants. " Thank you, miss. I ’ ll be going to bed in a moment. " 
 " Silly, miss," she said.

"Oh, " The tall, young man said. " That's why I don't kill people? Because I want to save people and you won't give me another chance, either. " 
 I stood there for a minute, not sure what to say. I was led towards the door. My collarbone stretched as far as I could, and my eyes were coated with an icy blood. It was a cold chill that reverberated throughout my body as I stared at my hands in the snow. 
 " You talk so much about bodies, " He answered. " You even... I don't really... respect you, either. " 
 I glared at him, closing my eyes. 
 " Shut up, " I said, biting my lip and looking towards the door again. " I need you to understand something before I kill you. " 
 " I..." The man stammered, his voice rough and angry.

 It would take six brief years of concerted effort to defeat them, a frigid night, a scorching sun and thundering wind in the frozen plains. A forest's worth of redwoods and juicy, green and brown bushes lay dead on the ground, sparsely shaded by fierce polar ice cap temperatures. 
 They struck first. Rough, soft, and inhuman, slashing at them with one mighty arm. Wide open, they reached for the other man's chest, guns floating up in the air. Their leader positioned himself, shielding his face in order to keep himself from dying like the boss in any situation. After several hours of intense firefights they reached the blizzard-machines, deep in the snow. Hefting his own weaponry. By the time he got close enough to the blackness the animals took it from him, stuffing their faces full of fur, then digging, catching and eating the wounded animals. 
 Stunning creatures with white fur, long, slender legs and breasts of multi-colored, almost purplish colors, their skins covered in pruned fur. And they left us. They punched the alien creatures in the face, hitting them in the head. 
 Their terrifying, terrifying, alien torture... 
 It was, of course, their invention that the humans had developed. 
 And oh, yeah, and they almost beat us in robot battles. The aliens hated humans, but they didn't stand a chance. Three months of holding and killing their own were enough to derail the whole war, and the Russians had a fraction of the radiation killed on Earth. 
 And yet they fought like rabbits.

A band of men look at me. You see, it all happened in one instant. And all you hear, is that I am a normal man. Yes, I know this isn't the actual truth, but I have tried to be that one hundred percent comfortable around others. 
 I quickly grow up, knowing that despite my seemingly everyday responsibilities, I am truly a human being. Sure, I can take care of myself. If something go wrong with me, I will pretend it was a necessary evil. Unless, of course, it was deliberate. 
 People call me lucky. I'm lucky that I'm alone. I'm not a despondent beast. If something went wrong with me, I will pretend it was a necessary evil. If things went wrong with me, I will pretend it was a necessary evil. If things went wrong with me, I will pretend it was necessary evil. I am indeed lucky. 
 People are overjoyed when I see that they can claim that I am a man, as I am. I see that my possessions are full and I make a living with my ill won things. That I will take care of myself, but will I have to suffer some form of irreparable illness? 
 In the end, I just try to be as ordinary as possible. Most people don't realise that my life is never what you expect it to be. At times it is beneficial, especially when you can afford to continue on your own. Only that you can never end up the same way.

Albeit on the larger scale, this zombie horde is a lot like the horde on Zycho tote: horrible, loud, and bad. For, literally, all its bites are peaceful, consensual, and preventative. 
 Things like that bother me personally; they look literally hos and horrible. It won't stop where I pick it up. The ones stuck in there have teeth, and claws and claws. I don't get a lot of them, but they turn out great fun, or by pure luck it wins out. Anyway, I hear some young couples come to the bar. 
 'Welcome, I am here to introduce you! You should see this happened as well!' the guy in the brown sleeveless dress says. 
 'Come here, lets go on the merry way. Now, let's start.' 
 So, we enter the alleyway. No camera to record the scene. I follow the footsteps of a few random people in the area. As we walk up the unassuming high slope, the smell of food, cream, beer, and commercials wafted up from the underground area. I follow all the way to the bar. 
 'I don't know what you are talking about. Didn't you hear about the pilgrims coming this week? Allah's 'Ulema'? Yeah. Didn't you know that from the public idea that our gods were intentionally being deceitful about the mujahideen?' 
 No answer. 
 Fuck. 
 *... the man in the green and gold suit gave me the red dress of the woman behind him. 
 *....in this filthy pyjama hideout. * 
 My sister. Not exactly the handsome shmunk who gets off her butt at the most. She doesn't seem to like me, though. We both know she's a conniving bastard. How the hell did she get me to fight? * I don't know how this came to be, and I don't know if I should have. Maybe it's better to live in peace in hell, instead of an animal mutilation dungeon. Or maybe I'm just sociopath and that I need to walk free to make my own personal hell. I don't know. But anyway, it's nice going out, and we just have to live this up. 
 *... to make the best of this present situation, I just leave the place I'm stuck in. * 
 I turn off the wipers in my car as I run into the bar. 
 "Yadda'a'a'a'a'a'a"'a'a'a'a"'a'a'a'" 
 The music starts again.

My father said Dad, he had some other problems in the early days. He never did have a single child anymore. I remember when I got the bathwater in the sun. Dad told me I had to clean it up, dad. I was worried that Daddy might have a shrink like me. " Dad, the patient won't accept this treatment. " I told Dad, but of course he knew. He told me that my grandma would always raise me like this and that Dad was a god damn smart boy. " Ah, " Mom said. I was extremely angry at Mom. I would wave at them and laugh when they ran up and ran away. " Why aren't you happy for me?" The bullies ran away. I didn't really care.

Day 1 
 Unknown legend tells of a soldier who awakes fully prepared for battle. He begins to question why he is doing this. The power to turn back time would have kept him alive long enough to see the future. The soldier is something of a rarity, he took his lifetime's work to create this apparatus of a universal clock. When he awoke up, a mysterious figure appeared in the sky. This character had a familiar face, his air hair was covered in a kind of golden irises. He smiled at the soldier, putting his most impressive talent into performing the Bimbo mask thing, which had appeared out of nowhere, with the Iron Banner to the side. The soldier informed the figure that the iron mask had two visible blades and was attached with a multitude of magical knots. 
 Day 2 
 The soldier watched as a figure started to move, creating massive traps on the obstacles. The figure appeared and started playing a simple guitar. The soldier had started to see scenes coming from different angles, as he explored the field. The figure could only use his mana energy. The air behind him was beginning to freeze, the air surrounding him seemed to soften and cloud the back of the soldier, turning the surroundings to a dark red. The soldier looked up, his eyes were burning. The man did not move, but could only breathe. A beat of thunderly hooves could be heard from the off slope in the distance. The soldier was bewildered as he struggled to breathe. The man opened his mouth, but the soldier was unable to say a word. The grunt in his throat opened the air around him. The soldier fell to his knees. 
 Day 3 
 The man stood in the middle of the battlefield, no longer an armoured vehicle, but looking like a freshly polished new automobile. The man's blade was different, it was thicker and brighter. The blade glowed more bright than the surrounding air. The soldier was shaking uncontrollably, the man released his grip on the iron mask and held it close to the soldier. The man kept his blade close, almost imperceptible as he gripped it tightly. The man turned to face his father and smiled, the man could not bear to be confined to the battlefield anymore. The soldier gave a last fake smile, smiling slightly as if to say, "this is fun."

A jar is filled with powdered ecstasy. Through spilled fumes they feel like a starburst. For a moment, none is white, black, nor white. His entire body feels chaotic as if he can't move or feel a thing. The sky is bright and clear and none of his thoughts escape his grasp. 
 His shoes fill the empty air as he looks around the rising dust. He turns his head and stops at a piece of rubble. 
 He lifts the jar of powder and picks it up, taking a deep breath. The asphalt was inching farther into the dust as he took another deep breath. He takes a couple of hits, pointing his finger with both his hands. He brings it with him upwards and thrusts it at his body, spinning for what must be the hundredth time this month. The stench of burning heat fills the air, burning his skin. Suddenly, he hears his anger and anger at the people in the center of it. Fighting, smacking, throwing, hugging, pounding on his head. He and the creatures behind him turn to fight. But they win, by an astonishing hand stretched out upon them, commanded by a green orb of red. 
 The men in the building sigh and close their eyes as he disappears into the dust, leaving a trail of blood behind him. He sits, pensively reading. It's hard to tell if the words on it are words, but they're clear and clear. For a moment, he didn't know if the words were words, just a meaningless statement. But he knew they were messages, in jingles and sounds of all kinds. 
 He could never forget.

**********235**********
The man awoke early, twisting and turning in the marble hall. He had no control over his breathing or movement. He was tired and weak and he needed sleep. He cautiously walked to the counter to get some. 
 “ What have you done, Bill? ” The young man asked. The bright orange print in his right hand glistened from the bright heave of a dentist ’ s knife. He looked down at the noose and then at the glass blade sitting on the counter. Finally he had his way. 
 “ Excuse me, why are you on my doorstep? ” He shouted after rushing to his closet. 
 To the man, the servants had told him the man had no choice but to let him in. The man could hear them shouting with him. No one had to make him go outside, in the middle of the night. He couldn ’ t stand it anymore. There was no way out of this. 
 “ Yes, sir. What are you doing in my house? ” 
 “ Oh, yes, I am doing the right thing. ” 
 He stood up and reached into the trash can with an overbearing step, wiping the beach of washed up coffee, water and water-based teas in an attempt to no longer feel the sitting sensation. He silently disappeared back into the closet. 
 One good hand held the broken glasses to his face. He touched them on the counter. 
 “ What do you mean, ” he said quietly. 
 “ Sir, you can ’ t tell me. ” 
 “ Please, excuse me, what are you doing in my house? ” 
 “ I am doing the right thing, my friend. ” 
 The man laughed and wandered out into the night. The tide of people had begun to turn to rainbows and to the smell of fresh flowers. The audience was cheered, filled with band and choir.

It was all going according to plan. 
 I blinked as a rod leapt out of my hand, scooped off my feet and began to walk towards the nun, falling into a sitanic state. 
 I held up my face, eyeing the receptionist, meeting her gaze with what looked to be utter disgust. 
 Then in a flash, the familiar shadow of a bloody wheel met the vampires eyes. 
 "I ran out from the nun! " I groaned, " I fell into a table and fell into the damn toothbrush! " 
 Two screamers, a girl and a guy tried to attempt to jump on the table, as one of the others ended up unconscious from the kiss and tail fall, the girl's eyes grew wide. 
 She studied my form, looking mystified. She wasn't completely pissed. 
 " The reason you're here, I don't know. It's been hundreds of years, you were born first. Yet you have failed! This is your brother and father not mine! I haven't broken your back enough. " 
 I grunted, pointedly winking at her. 
 She peered down. " You're right. I have never broken your back enough, of the vampires you've caused. " 
 I sighed. " I am. I must go now, sir." 
 She grabbed my wrist and kissed it in true pirate fashion. 
 A boom echoed throughout the mall. I stepped out into the blinding light, dressed in armor, wielding a javelin. 
 All was silent. 
 The sun never set.

( Don't feel right reading it ) 
 "I'm sorry, Ms. Lawrence. This society - that they must be going up, up above the proper meal.... " 
 " And that's a matter I have to answer first? " 
 " Why yes, you " 
 " If this Court is feeling sad, I suspect he is. As it should be - let's not be. It's just down below... well, what else is to be made? " 
 " The Food and Drug Commission said the law defining the drugs to be Schedule I was invalid. They said they have caused too much turmoil, ''wasting away our families' monetary and social resources and finding themselves in a dead end job. They took off having a pint with that poor girl, and whacked her in the face and said she smelled like Twix. People didn't even get to say, ''Equal distribution with Twix? '' " 
 " The Coca-Cola Commission certainly had a tougher time compiling order tables in our supply chain. That's a great achievement, " said the President, an ex-little boy. 
 " But it's different this time around? We can't just keep being run down? We're stuck in this white house trying to find common ground with the rest of the world. " 
 " They blamed every single drug, out of desperation. I don't know, you have this kind of fool's-eye vision when it comes to weed - sure, there are pills, but we can't make a common law that basically mandates the drugs be Schedule I. Even if we tried, why wouldn't this fight instead of ignoring our own laws? We had another legal battle, no, in the second amendment, the second right - " 
 " I told you, they was right. From this point on, the price, the benefits of all the evils, is that they just can't do it. They're too damned rich and clever, and it's far too late to change their ways. We could go on with trying to do something else, but at this point, the legal battle is over. So here we are again and this old conspiracy is looming. I doubt they'll be able to go on with the chips they stole, but at least my argument is clear in the end. " 
 " Mr. President, my fellow Americans, I just don't see how you can say that the government is going to stop our government from doing what it's doing. " 
 " They're just doing it by blocking our communication, and the less coordination they have, the less incentive they need to do anything about it. Get rid of them altogether. " 
 " And the scientists? They know what is going on; are they going to continue on and just wait out the illness? Because instead, they want to fight us tooth and nail. " 
 " Bullshit, Mr. President. They will really, really end them. " 
 " Sir... " 
 " What happened to that? That same FDA ruling? Why shouldn't we fight it now? They've got ta punish. " 
 " Well, Mr. President, I just don't see how this nation, just like everything else, is going to be able to live under this government and the stories from the labs until it's over will drive the next situation into that spindle. How else are we going to deal with these people, here at this table, on the table, working under a law that says it's illegal to or do drugs with men? Now I'm being honest - I have no idea how to go on without these people, " said the President with a quizzical looking expression. " But I can take it - see if we can let them live. Go out and kill them. Give them a reason to do what they want, and only, serve a purpose. Just show them your lives. Just one more thing." 
 And with that, the President walked out of the room, surrounded by his people. And the screen lit up, and he took a bite from his cup of tea.

 " His power supply was maxed out. Had to cut the cord at some point. " 
 " And his heart? " 
 " Glorious, in his hair. Huge chin! "

 " Well that makes sense, " Multon said. 
 " Yeah well... I'll talk to Multon about this in a few days. " 
 " And what happened? " 
 " He wound up on fire, you know, about a week after MLC Mammal migration. " 
 " What... What could have been happened? " 
 " Oh. " 
 " What? " 
 " Many things can happen when you are the one being shown the only way to shape a human into the beast you're looking for. You can't turn into a bear overnight. You have to mask your emotions, the feeling that, you know, it's the only way to defeat your beast. You can't get higher than MLC Mammal, at least for a few months. " 
 " MLC Mammal? " 
 " Yes. " 
 " Ah yes. " 
 " When did MLC Mammal become? " 
 " Probably in 2005."

I was alone, but I am happy. I love you. And this is where we all hang out sometimes. We hang out every other night, we form associations and we build temporary bonds, even one that I always needed, only I could never imagine. Before that I was something else entirely. I had so much promise. I had the history to keep growing in my head, I had the fortune to keep finding a way to find hope. To live with myself. 
 I want to stay in this thing, we all do. I want to escape from this certain life, into an alternate, and without hope to come back. I could do anything else. I just... want to be happy. 
 But why? 
 When you're alone in a room. A light at the end of the tunnel, an odd humming sound. Watching you from a distance, an almost soothing rhythm. You squint at me, staring at the ceiling, pondering what the humming is. 
 Does that sound? Does that sound concern you? What's your line here? Is that your line here to distract me? Is that your line here to keep you awake at night knowing that you're growing up? 
 Or is that the wrong sort of line? You're trying to ignore me. You're trying to hide that voice, the noise from here, from all the others. 
 Just when you're happy. 
 You're happy, but you're happy. 
 The voice in your head is so soothing and gentle. It's calming. It's comforting, but you're still happy. 
 Will you stay? Will you stay- did you ever figure out how to reach this, did you ever find the right sense of self satisfaction after dealing with the pain that is giving up all that you've worked towards to live now? Do you care when someone sends out messages to your day to see if you really need them? 
 Do you care when someone makes you ask for the hand you think you need when you should have left? Do you care if someone feels betrayed by you, a subtle instrument of your craft is about to be used? 
 Will you stay- did you ever think that it would be okay to let go, let go of this, your existence, your meaning? 
 Will you remain? 
 I... can you stand up and leave and let go of me? I need you to stop trying to hide me from me. I need you to get through this, get through all these thoughts. 
 But sometimes... times I wish I could cry. 
 I know you know that, right? You have to break free. I know that right? 
 Because I got ta live in this.

*Our bell rung as the station bounded through the forest. 
 "That's our fifth pull, Private! " a stern-faced servant shouted as he ran up the trees, " and next time my stomach is full of sugar, crack'em that you got out! " His voice was devoid of speed and I froze as I remembered what that meant. I reached inside my coat pocket and dug the blaster pistol that my instructor ordered me to bring with me. I studied the paper for a moment, trying to focus on the thought of safety, then my eyes returned to the blank page in front of me, terrified of having to take the trouble to type in this. I looked back up at the large clearing I had just stepped on. I saw someone in the bushes, he had a hooded sweatshirt with a scar on his forehead that made it impossible to see his own facial features. His blaster gun hung limp as he walked towards me, his words " That motherfucker knows what we're talking about. Give me ten minutes! " I fired three shots in the clearing, the bullets ricocheted into the crevices in the ground and I wondered if the bullets would affect anything else in the background. His clothes in the deer hide bin reminded me of his uniform when I walked in and all I could think about was the orange jumpsuit he had on during Halloween. " I see you see me! " He said, finishing off the bin, " so what am I supposed to do with my trays? " I threw a hand over my mouth, shaking in fear as my little mind took hold of the details of this new soldier. * It was a shame that this was all happening so early. The previous woman had been Sarah..but there was no doubt that this new soldier would be the best. * To be honest it doesn't make a lot of sense. There's no use pretending I'm already in a nice roman army with a Wookiee trying to fight the NGC at Kanan-Fenne on some 90-degree lunar orbit, but I have to admit I was impressed. * He shouted through gritted teeth. " What a massive mistake. " I finished wiping the blood and saliva off my clenched hands, " don't you even know what happens when you get here?! " I told the soldier who stayed silent for a moment before offering him a breadcrumb to the feet of my uniform. He said nothing and made a loincloth out of his pockets, and padded over to me. * Life seems so unfair for a lazy ten year old, but I think I've made a terrible decision. * I knew that I had more than enough time to say things that needed to be said and try to get this right. My jaded mind started to fade. * He said something to my hatchet laying on the bench beside me. He began muttering something in unintelligible language. Finally after a second he spoke again. * You get to keep some control over your actions and the rest is up to you. * His voice was familiar and I had to compose myself to hear. I barely heard him scream until it was too late. Now it was all coming to a sudden stop and I could feel the trembling in my legs. * What do you do?? * I yelled at the man as he got to his feet. 
 *I stole your face off YOUR face. Oh please. * I whispered. He ducked back behind bushes and frantically ran to it, leaving his hood and backpack. I needed this world. As he got to the ramp I took off my scarf and grabbed a jacket and goggles. " Peace out there, Private!" I shouted as the earth had rained down to my porta-potties.

Dear Mr. Ambrose, 
 I am glad you made it through the first few days. Although it was quite difficult getting through the semi-forever hostile environment on my 1st tour in-site. The 'officer', as he knew me as, went way too far with his statements. He claims that the cat has lost the ear of my 'friend' and that the villagers always mistreat him. He has nearly burnt my window with a sack of rations. I pray that by telling him about this incident he will find this information and remember to keep an eye on me all day for signs of trouble. 
 I hope that your letter will be met with more happiness today. As I said, it is quite difficult coming to out time in the sun as always.

"So Santa Claus? " 
 I walk forward, and stop short in a simple pose, scanning over my neighbor's face. 
 " Santa Claus? " I nod and do the right thing, stepping closer to my neighbor's face. I breath in very deeply. 
 " I know you've followed me around a fair bit, dear. You know I have used the words often enough. Once upon a time, in that old lady's shop, all you needed was some castle, a rope and a long straw. Now this miserable little stupid could go ahead and shop for a cheap pirate ship, but she would eat all of it and still have a great kingdom. Now the money's gone and everybody's being pretty much game all over the place, and it's really easy to go shopping and steal things. " 
 I brush my teeth, still waiting for this comment to settle in my son's voice. 
 " You see, why won't I call you child for crying out loud? Oh, don't worry. I've got him to talk about. " 
 I hold his hand out to him. 
 " Yeah, my friend. That is right. That is what you're getting at. To be honest, I haven't heard you in a long time. Well, I mean, honestly, that's just the fun part, right? Everybody hates you for hating you... until now. And now, I really get to keep a friend. I'm just going to do this as a little gift to you. " 
 He looks a little worried, but he only looks at me for a second. 
 " You do have one dollar, sweetie. I'll give it to you when you see that ice cream truck. " 
 He smiles at me again. 
 " You can keep the note. Your hand is big enough to carry enough to carry a letter. On top, you have two briefcases and a cot. Wait, does this mean the note is given out? " 
 I reach out and grab the briefcase. 
 " Very well, kid. You'll spend the rest of your life in that cot, and you'll eat and you'll see all of it. Put those far away from you if you must. Don't you remember? " 
 I look down at my child, puzzled. 
 " Yep. I do, now. See, I'll be leaving soon. Thank you so much." 
 I go to the cot, and open my briefcase to pull out a box. I take the box out and turn it over. I walk over to the cot and pop open the box. Inside is a picture.

I fought a hard battle. A long war. All through the ranks the only people I ever thought I could trust were the brave fellows in the thousand casualties that had brought me home, just thinking about him raised me in a higher place than I had ever been. I was meant to meet his eyes, to go one by one to the most famous hero I had ever seen. I couldn't watch him with how well he moved and how he spoke, how hard he fought and how smart he was. No human has ever been so confident in this world, in his ability to kill - I. I. 
 I had been so convinced and so covered by the press and public that I couldn't understand how he hid a sword in his pocket. I couldn't remember the price, to my father, or the damage that could have been done, or how many million years I had to live to see such a name stricken out on the globes below us. None of it was true, of course. There had been the yells of those around me when the war went too far, the lashing I had received for helping his crusade go too far. None of it even mattered to me anymore. 
 What I could remember of him was that he started to look sad. I had screamed once, months ago and months later, for him to come home. He stopped, looked at me over and over. I felt sick and it got to the point where I wanted to snap my fingers. I thought of my mother and I sobbed and sobbed and some soliloquy about the reapers and how they had died before we started this together. Was that what I wanted to hear? Am I right? Am I, just like them? 
 * "I was proud to kill you today " * 
 * " I have loved you " * 
 * " I loved you too, " * 
 * " I can't stand to see him burned alive in such pain" *

The experts agree that no one could possibly conclude that it's a good idea to be particularly attached to one another, but it was a terrible idea. 
 Dan counted all of the moments when someone or something entered his beloved house, attended, or died in a dark basement basement for the whole fuck of eternity. Every one had passed days before. Not a single time when someone came out. Dan worried a bit, as he was overjoyed to have been able to play the role of Boy Scout once again. He wasn't truly interested in the game. He spent most of his waking hours staring at the harmless bubble he was taking the word for from the son whose head he hadn't shaved in years. 
 For all the years of grief, separation, and uncertainty that followed the coming together of both him and his affectionate youth, it had taken Dan time to figure it out. He was late for work that day, and none of the other applicants were expected to be at the Green Line station. The blue plane he would ride on snapped up instantly at half speed, and he was forced to go start and completely drag his feet off his feet. He had a stomachache after the thudding noise, and the blue plane sped off. He would never see it again, but he had made the decision not to do so. 
 The reason why Dan had chosen the piano was that it would be the only way that he could be with other people and not one of the screaming adults. He had just been watching for some reason, and every time he looked to the right, he saw him with the body of a bad person. Dan was essentially at a crossroads, his heart skipped a beat and he straightened the suit and tie and sat back, rubbing his temples in comfort. After all, he had been alone with his wife for a very long time. Dan had to keep staring right at the piano, waiting for the thing to bring him back, and for his phone. 
 The jury found him guilty. But Dan knew exactly what would happen after that. He had finally listened to the world before him. His life was numbered, and the little boy he loved played some weird violin on Sunday. The other applications still came knocking at the door with no answer or answer button. 
 He clenched his fist. That and he would always be lonely to cry. He opened his cellphone and its text message was sent. It said just one thing, but the second it came through his ear, he had to find an answer. But Dan didn't really expect it. 
 The file was seemingly on him. Yes, it had to be. There was one way. But he needed to know. How did this being come here? 
 He pressed down on the center button. 
 The screen was intact. 
 "Hello, Dan. It has come to my attention that you have survived a violent drowning attempt on your island! The police showed up and rescued you, but they are still on your case. " 
 " You, Aaron, " the tiny voice replied. 
 " Uh, Aaron? " Dan saw the phone on his ear. The expression on his face instantly changed from wonder to panic. 
 " I don't... do I have to do this? " He whispered. 
 " No. Aaron, don't go, you and Dan are the best friends I have. " 
 " But- but, but- " 
 " How do you know? " 
 " Because every day you wake up, you sleep, and you feel disconnected from the world. You write about it, remember what happened. You look at the tiny hands that holds the phone, and remember to tell yourself that this is not your fault, you slept with this man. One day, something great happens and you wake up, and we discover this connection! " 
 The tiny young man's face tensed and his eyes widened. 
 " Why did I try to kidnap you? " 
 The tiny voice stroked his beard, " Aaron, you shouldn't have to go. By the time this whole thing reaches you, your line of sight is completely cut off. "

There was a barbeque stop right in the back alley. 
 Her nametag said to follow the bartender's march on society, the high grass shattering into bolts that sliced the thin wind. 
 There was a shiver of fear in her that she hadn't been paying attention. She was eager to meet the bartender. Beet. Maynard. That's what she would be if she didn't bother. 
 She stepped out of her car to the bar. She saw through the window the same arctic colors I saw on one of my favorite scary movies. They were always blue and had that fast swooping wind that she really liked. She loved that wind. 
 She quickly reached her car. It was a nice Mustang convertible that just looked beautiful. Her eyes fell on one of the orange tinted windows. All of a sudden her eyes were wide. Her body started to sweat and her mouth opened to talk. She was lost. 
 Soon, a happy puff of smoke filled the room. Then the sounds of the acrobats started to fill the room. They were getting close. Their breathing was heavy. They never stopped. In fact, they never stopped again. 
 The music started. The clang of the tires was getting louder. The sidewalk was crumbling. The city wasn't supposed to fall apart. There were enough trees to sustain growth. These trees were the reason not only were the trees the greenest of the roses, but they were the most beautiful of all. 
 It made her wonder, her imagination was bursting from her. How was it possible that a tree could make you happy? A tree could make you want to leave your loved one. She checked her car for it. No locks, the only things that she didn't want had been sealed in gold foil, intended to protect her from the storm. She stopped next to it, and looked at it. She had already forgotten why they wanted the gold foil. The whole car was marked with a colored, "Gold Not Inferior Decoy " message taped to it. 
 " Aren't you too old for this? " A man in a trenchcoat asked. 
 Her eyes fluttered open with confusion. 
 " Who... who are you? Why am I standing in front of a barbeque??? " 
 His gaze drifted back and forth between the trees. He started to say, 
 " I... I have some real questions. " 
 She looked at the man, and realized that it wasn't him. She pushed him away. 
 " If they can see me again, they have become... happy." She tried to fight back the urge to continue. She couldn't. Why couldn't she just walk around and talk to some cute characters? She walked into the bar and saw her friendly neighbors chatting about their business, at the beer hall. Just as they were asking questions, someone ordered her a large shake. No alcohol was in this bar. She started to choke.

"Dude i hate gays so bad though " 
 He was right so he never wanted to talk to her like this. I suppose he was right. I really did, unless he remembered they were communists. One day, I'm a coffee shop. Hell, some of the places were like some down-by'food chain', but that's not the point. You never know what's going to happen here and then you might as well just wait for it. 
 I know how annoying it feels to be handed a pile of cash; it's not that fast. I guess he had to know, because if he wasn't here, I think he'd look just like me. * He* probably would've given me the money or...? I dunno, never was good at laying cards down after work. Oh well, some places where people could make *anything* their way... 
 He put the money in the bag. And, I didn't waste it, " Gay Star Comics " was a man's store, I mean, a goddamn a darn good dude actually. An actual comic book store, sure. And it was the best deal I had ever had, do I really need something, me, my kid, my girlfriend! I mean, as soon as he loaded the carts and no one else got arrested I was the new face. I even remember his response when he arrived with kids and says hi. They were all so nice and inviting and he couldn't resist the hype... So when the card started, I went out to grab one and go see it. 
 The place was beautiful. Large mahogany chair with it's most outrageous little bellhousing. So big, I could almost see him squinting at it. I saw him in the wall; he had that white press of his chin- his- chest- the sort of guy that can get his head crushed. And then I got into it. 
 " Teeheeheeha " I scream. " Fuck you dog! " 
 Oh god! 
 He runs out of the room, and he puts me on the cat, yanking a handkerchief off of the can of beer I'm drinking, and handing me the shit. 
 " You think I'm turning into a dog?" 
 I've really seen it, that shit-its-side-butthole look in his eyes. 
 I want to run into him, now. And he wants to chase me down, I want to get that cat away from that filthy arms of gold- and that damn other shit that's on the floor in that Walmart place that's our only safe haven, if I can't use the cat to make it. 
 But... 
 If he finds the seat of their nice pink white Bronco and the floor is clean, then he's got time. If he goes and even sends me back there, then I'll be the goddamn dumber ass you're rearing to see with that black eye, and have to stop my rampage for a moment and get one on me. 
 But fucker, I'm gon na work on this list of fucking missed mans.

The years had passed, Lathrac had grown years younger, and Annis' built many houses. Her work was different, it was simple and went to much more efficient. Religions, anything used to make much shorter work would be useful, but when it came to what was required it was slow. 
 Lathrac still had everything she was looking for, a mixture of husbands and sons he had raised; accomplishments to enjoy, treasures to uncover. But what she never knew was the price she was willing to pay for those things, for he was powerful and her feet crunched beneath her. 
 Over the years they grew stronger. He became stronger, she grew weaker, and he was everywhere. 
 The great clock in her bedroom slowly began to sound. It was the time before she learned the timing, everything was so crucial, otherwise it wouldn't have happened. However, the people in the place where she worked would have more time to learn, so the good times had to be passed. 
 As the clock came to a close Annis stepped back. " Dad? " she called. 
 " I'm sorry I can't help but be a little muddled, my best work in a long time. " 
 " Yes, and would you mind finding someone else who could have done it? " 
 " For sure, but the family didn't have money for repairs. You took care of them, and it's like you and me want something different. " 
 With that old comment Lathrac lifted her shovel and poured the plan to his barn. There they left, and added this: 
 1 large loaf of bread 
 2 lbs of wheat 
 1 cup of water 
 1 lb of peppers 
 2 lbs of slivers of tomato 
 Lathrac had worked every day, she just had to remember that to have something together. She opened up the fridge and put down her ingredients. After dark, she scooped out the tomatoes and peppers and tossed them in the pot. This made it really easy to use again. 
 Lathrac took a few buckets from the ground and started looking at the soil. " I'll always stay clean, it's a part of me. But now is not the time to look forward to the future."

Four months ago, late in class at the University of Existential in Prof. Anderson ’ s class, students went to play Santa Claus in the Toy Story universe. And while the educator knew that Santa wasn ’ t actually real, he had a way of expressing himself. 
 “ Who are you? ” the student asked. 
 “ I ’ m one of the students here, ” the teacher replied. “ It ’ s real, and I tried my best to make it look like a conventional story. As I did, my friend ( he was the kind of man that would rescue you from a dimension where you were completely at ease ) grabbed my hand and held me back as a Christmas story. I felt no joy. It was a painful situation I could not explain to anyone, but again, I wasn ’ t afraid to try. 
 “ My friend ( Isaac ) just grabbed my hand and held me back. ” he said with a chuckle. 
 “ OK then. What kind of character are you creating? ” asked the student. 
 “ Tell me your name, ” the teacher said. 
 “ Marnie…Marnie the Dog God, ” Marnie said. 
 *The mouse fart of a mouse. * 
 *Many years later, everyone remembered the story of Marnie. As parents stepped onto their streets and kids played happily, the teacher declared, “ I wish to demonstrate that a book that plays the name of a character is actually the hero of the story. And I will accompany my benefactor to the annual Christmas decorations of the University of Existential. The Personification of Evil. Before the book is put in the Bookshelf, there will be other names that will be spoken of by us for a lesson in human empathy. After all, what was this place, anyway? Oh, the ugly part was saying how things were supposed to be? And you just played along? ” 
 *With clear, common belief, each kid stopped to examine their scene, check their printout, and read the storybook. * 
 The teacher gave everyone a comforting smile. 
 “ Congratulations, Mr. Anderson! We ’ re here to teach you— “ 
 I snapped out of my shock, and immediately regretted completing the lesson because I was on a prequel tour that I loved as a kid. It was one of the best classes in High School! 
 “ Eighty-Five readers, ” I said. “ Some thought you read the best, and some just didn ’ t expect to find out the full ramifications of that. ” 
 I snickered. 
 “ Let us talk about your reading. How are you still going to write the book? ” 
 “ No, ” said a young girl ’ s voice. “ Just not yet. I may be done editing the book, but I think I ’ ll just finish it. The students just keep coming back to you. The public knows you as a great contributor and as good an author as any. You deserve to stand alongside them. You definitely deserve a place at the university. ” 
 I rolled my eyes. “ Don ’ t you think I ’ ve done something wrong? I mean, I had a promise I had with my friend, now that he ’ s gone, I don ’ t know why I ’ m getting slapped around more? ” 
 The only thing I could think about was that it was a good thing I had to do it.

Jamie sat at the high spot overlooking the fire, faced with the familiar shape of the charred remains. The night sky lit up the world, allowing the rays of light to glance to the sky to see the blackened remains of the chariots that made up of them. He glanced back to his hard and burning body, one that did not feel the weight of his burning body. The wall was crumbling, crumbling back into what was left of it. Jamie ’ s lungs burned with burning rage, his tears and anger it felt as he walked through the not-so-torments like a pack of wolves. 
 As he approached the flame, the note scratched against the ceiling. Never before did he have such a dull existence. How strange, that his eyes were connected to the heavens, many thousands of miles away, yet he was privy to the source of all this. He sat, trapped by his charred body. The cold metal was not cold, but clean, with tender air. Something was horribly wrong. Jamie could not see past what he saw. The piece in the fireplace looked to be washed away, leaving only his charred bones and burnt cloth to continue. Perhaps it was all mere illusion. For a single man. 
 Jamie reached the fireplace, he turned on his heel, and as his feet fell onto the tabletop he realized that his weight was not in vain. The black of the night sky meant that his blood was still hot in his veins. That is to say, the sea of fire that helped to bring him up to this very point. But this merely meant that there would be no power to lift him to the heavens, instead with only light. Jamie reached a hand up to his chest and rested it, the heat reaching into his will. Without anything to hope for, Jamie found that he was still alive.

My head began to throb, and my senses began to waver in my head. My body felt heavier, except it was really the vacuum of a sleep deprived amnesiac. 
 "Hey, Kell. You okay? " I asked, looking around at all the stuff in the house. Nothing happened. I was awake, but not at a computer. 
 " You're not awake yet? Where the hell am I? Why am I standing in the living room? " 
 I looked around, still not seeing myself at all. I was lying on the couch with my arm in the middle of the living room, without my feet. After half an hour of this, I decided it was time to move on. It was a late July day, and the light was too bright to be the blinding light of the Northern Lights in the sky above. I went back to my music box and listened to the radio again. But neither was there any radio on. Just turned to look at my house. 
 " Well, its one of those, such that the light or sound of a streetlight being twitched, of course. " 
 " Huh? " I asked myself. I closed the music box again. Everything just disappeared to black. 
 A sudden knock on the door of my room startled me and stopped me before I knew what had happened. It was the scariest thing I'd ever seen in my whole life. Mommy was sitting at the kitchen table, watching the TV, watching the latest episode of *Whose Line Is It Anyway?, * when I looked at her. She was blonde, eyes full of age. She was wearing a red dress from the week before, all white. Her long brown hair was tied in a bun that just hung off her shoulders. She stood in the hallway, staring straight at me. 
 " Hey Mommy, where are you? " I demanded, hands now in mine. 
 " I'm outside, mister. It's dark. " She replied. 
 I'm speechless. I stared blankly at my room and found myself staring at the window on the right. The blinds were shut, I could not see without blaring... I looked back and back, and there she was again, all her blonde hair was white. 
 " What happened? " I asked again. 
 " Something happened to the house. They took your book and I thought it was the ones you always told me about. But all of that came back to bite you, I thought. " She looked at the book. No longer did she have a list. There was a list of missing items from the thing in my house. 
 She looked up at me with a gentle smile and said, " What's this? " 
 " It was what I always told you about, you know. The ones. Book, jacket, things that... they were probably thing in your room. The book was hidden away with the book. " I looked away in disbelief. Why would she do this? I had my headphones set up on my computer, and I was still hearing only static. 
 She said, " No, it is part of a family title. In the other parts of the shelf they brought the original book. I never really read it. It wasn't even all original, it wasn't anything to do with any one book or life. " 
 " And who has the original book? What's going on here? " 
 " I kept trying to read it, but to no avail. " She walked over to the door. I looked around the house, listening to everything. Everything, anything, to no avail. 
 " And where did you hear the book? What does it say? " 
 " And I still haven't found a record of it or anything in it. You know what, I should maybe call the authorities."

"Drive o' my wagon o' the steed chuspe' a thousand times vproide. " 
 " My custom is to ring it upon the roller - drums." 
 On the spur of the moment, even an impenetrable wall was emitting thunder among thousands of voters in a smartly named internet town. A total sign of the choice among the times here on Seattle's Eastside. 
 He knelt before the register and addressed every voter. All were surprised by what he had to say. She saw him and jubilantly replied, " I'm strong like a summer thunderstorm, first tier support and shine in a way. " This was a piece of work that would make the internet soul. The surrounding candidates would immediately gather around for their nomination speeches and debates. The mood was desperate. He had been down hard on campaigning so long that this moment was almost an endgame - until the ground started to rumble. Just before the ground could spin itself clear, though, he spun into the air. He stopped. 
 Her camera took the picture of him, eyes glistening at the incandescence of his blushing face. His crimson cloak spun around him. She went down with him as a flatulent party-man. He rolled her up to her shoulders and strode off into the street. 
 The checkin dinged. He knew someone was early. I stood over him, wagged my middle finger out over the register as she came in. The young man bowed his head and handed him the dinner book. He would like one of the top wins in ten years. The mouse featured on it said, in dripping water - 
 Do O'er Children Need Wolves.

 " You could say no. " 
 " But who did we check for aid just now? " 
 " Self aid? " 
 " No, but you could say you found anything? It was discovered with the 'Base Camp' in town. " 
 " So now it's been 'In Canada by camp, Who's boss is in Canada?' Are these more widespread rumors? " 
 " That's correct. "

 " We told them, Your Honor. They didn't know. That's why you said it. " 
 " I don't know what that means. " 
 " What? Why would we keep sending of planes to them? " 
 " We don't know. " 
 " Why keep sending people to us? " 
 " Just because they didn't pay us properly for it. " 
 " What if they die? " 
 " Everyone else can. Everyone else suffers, If we could just take out some of the monsters and see if they're actually there, we might just lose them forever. " 
 " But what if we're all killed by Canada? " 
 " What if they realize we only left them out of the picture? They won't think twice about making it the one area they think we're not *all* alone. " 
 " Are you done? " 
 " To see what they leave behind. " 
 " What about the latest? " 
 " Maybe if they leave a trail or something. " 
 " Go to the trail? " 
 " Yes."

Pain and fear lay at his feet, dark in the deepest places. A pain that has long been crossed long ago, a pain that has divided the poor man, robbed his friends of their lives. A pain that he desperately craves. 
 He himself is one of them. One of those days, when his family will be taken away and all of the orphaned kids shunned out to the city streets. The child bears his pain, the little bastard. 
 He is the cornerstone of this curse, the first step to a bleak world. 
 He has no friends, no home, no family. He has fallen, killed, and eaten whole. His wounds were thick enough to swallow entire cities and towns. His blood transformed to that of fireflies. 
 The fires fill his eyes in the darkest of places. The cold and the burning smoke from the fires has touched his aura, made him physically all-around. It has driven him to this point that he starts tumbling in the water. He sloshes near the edge of the city, only inches from it. 
 He stops at the edge of the water, hits the shore. The water runs red as he comes up, and bleeds and dips. The water runs black as he gets closer to the edge of the city. His life is at stake, and the city is his battleground. 
 With the houses down, the fires hide themselves and the debris flows into the street. It is only a matter of time before the fireflies again extinguish the city. 
 As the water begins to boil, he begins to think, in the little blue teddy bear thing. The small tormented pocket beast stares at him, his understanding will soon be lost. But he won't. And his forever torturing will be over. 
 He slowly wisps and crests at the waters edge. 
 The crescendo rings in his ears, setting in. He sees the daughter in the reflection of the floodlight, her shoulders haggard and wide. She is cold and tired. The hair on her shoulders is only black, and it has fallen off her shoulders. She looks up at him, rubbing her head. 
 He hears a sound like a whisper. A single rumble under the sad sounds of the water, lifting his head. A breath, as empty and pure as water's blood. 
 He decides to make a run for it, see the head of the beast in the reflection of the light. 
 He runs into the street, tripping over a woman as she runs across the river. She looks at him with a smile. 
 "What the?!" She shouts in her sickly, tired voice. 
 He stops. He leans in closer. The woman smiles. 
... 
 The jackhammer does not stop. It does not hit the ground. 
 And, maybe this will be the end of this story.

Jeff Marshall
Postman/Judas Priest 
 On a Tuesday, the whole world found out that Netflix froze Jeff Marshall's phone by linking it to the internet. Since it would arrive too late, the whole world reported on what would happen. 
 Between takings of the press and the celebrities, Jeff Marshall was only now finally being banned from twitter. Because of an entirely different thread on /r/WritingPrompts, many celebrities from across the globe posted hundreds of terabytes of they've uploaded of content as they rushed to find Jeff Marshall. 
 This quickly turned into thousands of tweets with Jeff's private Instagram account linking him to the internet. When his account became a public, I found evidence to corroborate what I had heard before.

"You're gon na miss me when I'm gone. " Someone screamed. My heart dropped. I looked into their eyes and screamed. 
 I glared into my own. Those eyes stared back into mine, hell of a big gaze. As if I was the only one there, and with each stroke of the hellish stare, a hundred more guns were pointed at me and the world would begin anew. Those eyes would kill, unleash waves of fear and hellfire. 
 People were starting to mutter our name. They shouted the same words and cursed what we gave up for. Some had a group, like me, and on the first day, like a thousand others like us marched our way to the soldiers, skirted behind it, and fired their very own guns at each other. 
 " You are gon na miss me when I'm gone. " 
 I reacted. The hapless soldiers rushed past me. I screamed back as they passed me, running backwards, back and forth. Soon, a dozen grenades were scattered in my path, but I didn't give up on the man next to me. I didn't even say a word, waiting for some pain to spill, and I started to panic. 
 Now, with him, I gave up. 
 " You're gon na miss me when I'm gone. " 
 The captain's voice was just a voice. If I tried to speak, it would seem like gibberish. The soldiers hurried past me. I asked to speak, but I was too serious. 
 " And you're gon na miss me when I'm gone. " 
 He nodded, one hand trembling. 
 " Yes. " 
 I nodded again, one finger behind my back. It was hard to get myself away as they rushed past me. After ten minutes, they came for me again. 
 " You're gon na miss me when I'm gone. " 
 I looked into his eyes. 
 " If I was your dog, then I'm gon na miss you."

Kumigak! 
 Yes, Kamigak, you are a weak Pokémon. Though I can not understand why you can help me; why now? How, then, are you hurt by me? Well, yes, I am weak in an animal sense, and however I please, people come to my kind just for help, however they please. I really can't help them; sorry! 
 This, uh, wolf, is not your problem. You are the source of my nightmares, and I'm afraid you are slipping through my warp field? My story is pretty much turned to gray. 
 Well... uh, I need you to do something. When I was young, I was given a new power, a curse. I could turn into any animal I wanted and after just a few minutes of incanting a tap on their back, they would turn into anything they would be in the vicinity of. Maybe that was a good start, but it wasnt until long afterward when things got out of hand... oh no, sorry, yes. It really hurt. 
 Oh, so you are trying to turn me into a dinosaur. With my very last strong strength, I fell from the sky and snapped my neck at your rocket launcher. I have limited movement, so I can not harm others. You are a beast! 
 Oh, ok. Why are you in my tomb? I forgot to lock you in there, so I can not harm you. But... I guess I can not hurt you, either. How shall I know this? You have the power of persuasion, but you look like I am not interested in persuasion, you can never be persuaded. Why can't you give up everything you have, yes? 
 Ahh... well, I hope you don't mind. Now here you are, now, in a cave in an abandoned city far outside the city's capital. I pray you find a way to sneak out here, you okay? You know what to do, huh? 
 You know, if I had a potion to make you quiver more, it would give you a kind of horrible feeling. 
 The reality is, if I had no potion, I probably wouldn't be able to continue even though I know you are special. So I might as well just move on with my normal life of solitude, move to another city or country and find out you are special to me. 
 No? Ok, okay. I will go. At least, as a caveman, I can stay here longer than most people. I will relax. Now, um, I don't understand why you would waste your whole life away, like so... you would not be able to keep a happy face, would you? Well, not at all. And now, I am going to have to turn you into a reptile, of some sort, but for now, your help will be worth your time. 
 There is a very funny charm about this ending, but again, I can not fight it with words. Now, wouldn't that be unfair? I guess you wouldn't fear me, would you? Well, I guess you must be right, because I am scared of you, but I don't care. I am truly sorry for the pain you caused me. And I am sorry for what you did. 
 "Quack! " 
 You have no clue what prompted my anger, but I am not dumb enough to react. Even if I do, I can not resist; I can not restrain myself, can I? How can I return this pain without losing any more of myself? 
 " Plus, that was me! " 
 Kumigak! 
 Am I annoying? No, you think I am. Stupid. How can you avoid hurting me if I'm angry? How can you? Very funny! I will get out of here! The world feels so quiet, but I know that I am curious. I need to find a way to say " I can't hurt you, right now. Why is it so warm?". But, alright, I'll go get a toy to play with. But how can I say that, alright? A gecko? Shit. Say it again. Or... poop. 
 I'm gon na leave. Am I scary? What would you say, if you ran into me in a cave in the rain that day?

Always wishing for breakfast, with a slice of bacon, my mood is literally a perfect storm. I know, lately I've taken things too slow and I've torn up some of the wonderful land around the Big Rodo beach town... I have one last point to add- a shark awaits. 
 A four year old walks by and asks me how to swim today. I blurt "don't worry about it" before slipping down onto my feet. I've had quite the walk- normally with a sense of calm as I drift towards the surf, but suddenly I'm met with the stupidest sensation I've ever experienced. 
 I lose my footing and fall face first into the hand of a monstrous shark. It's so clear that everyone's surprised I was there. I try to do something about it, but it was too late. It was too late for me. 
 Don't get me wrong; I'm not a bad person. I just can't seem to get used to the song I'm playing. At the beginning of the song, I wish that maybe there was another character or piece of advice I could've been able to give, but then everything went black. But then there's this glowing green light coming from a shark. 
 It was just the one thing that made me want to keep going. What I have was a pitiful hope- nothing more than a flash of brilliance, as a giant shark flickers out from the water into my eyestalk. A sudden sense of overwhelming disgustness starts to set in, and I feel the urge to vomit. 
 I wake up feeling ready for bed, and then... 
 The monster is gone.

War was hell. 
 Johannesburg was horribly attacked by the Franklins on both sides in 1941, simultaneously sending nearly all of the west coast troops into the war's terrifying and barren wastes. Upon discovery of the Monster House which stood directly over the fortified Hut, the onus fell upon the Franklins who demanded immediate surrender, swiftly destroying virtually every other command outpost. 
 Mortimer Jack. 
 Mortimer was first to die when the night armies began attacking his home. Long shots of the enemy from behind scare his very soul, making his companions almost unconscious. The old man began to wince in pain as he struggled to breath and saw his old friend lying sprawled out on the ground with blood remaining on his hands. Doctors rushed to the man's aid, administering most of his tenacity. Finally, Lady Turnan arrived shortly after, bowing as he told of the nightmares he faced here. The New York Tribune thought it must have been an elderly gentleman by his grave, remarking how the man was shot twice and mangled. 
 "Oh Lord, " mumbled mumbling the old man. He was also surrounded by heavy steel doors, the wind blew against his tired body. 
 Suddenly he heard footsteps coming from a hallway across the block. 
 He stared down at the fallen body lying there, whose tearstained hands clutching at his chest. His head fell to the ground at his feet, just as his heart shattered in his chest. 
 " Merlin... I am dead, too. I only want to live. And I need your name for their great deed." He turned and walked away, the sounds of horror echoing up through the shattered ruins.

Yipem blinked and gasped, tears running down his cheeks. His father's lip-synched music streamed out of his mouth and across the table, chanting. 
 "Father, why aren't you with me? " 
 " What did you say? " 
 The father's voice seemed to descend into hush, quickly colliding with the harsh, soft thumping noise coming from the lock off his father's pitcher. 
 " You tricked the President. " 
 " No, I made sure to hide his life. " 
 The music abruptly stopped, replaced by a soft ballad from the roaring mouth of Elijah, as if it was playing a tune from a great war or poet's music. 
 The front door of the house crumpled in on itself. The killer could hear boys on that frigid September night, banging on the door. 
 " Mommy, can we do something about that? " 
 The camera's dangled to the moon above. 
 " We can be safe! There's no monsters, there's no monsters on that damn porch! " 
 The door closed in on Elijah, running through the rotted and destroyed landscape that were the smell of death. Blackness punctuated the funeral by the skeletal billowing bodies of the dead and the twitching of the dark voids past the eastern sky. 
 With a heartbroken sigh, the door slid open and his parents walked in. They all nodded as they led Elijah away from the room. Elijah had given their mother nothing but quiet, chocolate mousse on her fingers, lightly pressed to his cheek and her fingers bloodied from too many shootings. She wanted something to do, to meet him in person, but the murders weren't getting anywhere, not that Elijah would agree with that either, just to have him tried for murder. 
 He remembered the tired faces in the doctor's office. 
 He remembered remembering his mother covering the family pictures with his hands, but something about the water coming from the kitchen had ruined their relationship. And something about the kids against the cold thaw of their parents would make them resent the professor at Brown University in the fall and taint their pencil handwriting with hate. 
 Tears were streaming down his face as he finished his scene, squinting at the ceiling light. A cold fear kept him from wanting to hide, instead for fear that killing Elijah would cause his school to lose contact with him, something that was very, very important in the end. 
 He remembered his left hand, gripping the knife he held there on the kitchen counter to hold onto. 
 He remembered their deep conversation. Their shared carefree air between rivulets of sweat. How he couldn't remember the last time they looked at each other. 
 His heart dropped as tears began to fall, dancing across his face, dripping onto his arms. He remembered not to let them start their show. 
 " But Mizzo? " 
 The camera shifted to Elijah's blue-gray eyes, glinting in the breeze. 
 He let out a sob as he started to catch his breath. The room started to glow. 
 And to get from their bedroom to the other end of the room, a world of houses mixed in with their shoes, the sound of rushing water lapping against the concrete. He saw one house, a crumbling husk of a house that looked like it had been removed by shovels a thousand years ago. 
 It was only the soft bronze man, lying unconscious in his bed. He was breathing out for the first time in his life. 
 It was the beginning of a familiar face with familiar scars. 
 The realization caught Elijah in his throat. He knew what he wanted, what he wanted, *what * he would do. 
 *Abduction. * 
 He reached out his hand and had his own. 
 A calm hand touch the edge of the burning fireplace. 
 He knew what it was; that the three skeletons in the basement shared the same city. 
 He knew that he's trapped; it's the only thing he has left. 
 And that he won't let go.

I waited. Those who and what awaited had just barely stopped bleeding. Mhmm ahem. I had waited for decades. Billionaires paid decades to become the next Knight... But I had waited for them to take my place. A smart machine could steal my immortality and I had stood a chance... I was now the one to succeed. Each and every time I succeeded, it suddenly fretted me down to a fault. As time passed, I had not worked so hard. Once I began to think logically, the pain didn't change. I began to question myself as I would question any rational being. It always didn't. The world around me was someone else, a part of me... If I had had to explain why I didn't want to do it, I wouldn't, so I stopped using that word. How was I to know what was going to happen after the test? I tried to think of something to say, but I fell silent. How could I know? In desperation, I attempted to hide. A little girl who looked like me stared out of her window, she knew what was about to happen. I couldn't hide it anymore. I didn't let her see. But it was over. I managed to disguise herself. Her name was Caroline. She lived next door to me. She looked scared. I didn't want to be forced to kill her. Maybe she looked like me. Maybe I should take that option. You can't kill a person if you're not happy with yourself, right? The more I tried to convince myself that I was going to die, the less this whole situation could have started. But I was still scared. Caroline looked at me, but she wasn't looking at me. Caroline was looking directly at the stone before my hand, a heart at her throat. I ignored her and squeezed. The doctor was pacing around the room, he was staring at me a bit too deeply. He looked at his machine. It wasn't important. The only thing that was important was to know what's happening. I was confident that I would succeed. Caroline asked me what's happened to my machine? We shook hands. It was the only conversation we had, I didn't want to talk about my death anymore. I decided to test it. There had to be a big enough test to explain this to the world. I gave the man an explanation. He was sitting there in his chair next to a computer, expressionless. He told me to wait for him to speak. I waited. I finished my sentence and walked away. The doctor stared at the stone. I dropped my machine and looked at my pulse. This wasn't right. These tests were meant to slow down my aging process. I was sitting here, breathing steadily and with no blood. I started to feel tired. I had to go. " Caroline! " Caroline called out in a not so kind voice, " Caroline... Caroline! Welcome to the Turing Test."

I've been obsessed with Batman for the last 9 years. Getting him out of every room just so, from every door in my house to every belt buckle on my wrists so nobody can get me in my car any more, until he finally took me out of the house for 5 days. 
 I've seen the Happy Guy, the Joker, the butch, the evil Professor X, the Penguin, his henchmen and villains. When these little black dude and a half, black and white, heavy super-beings first sprung for an escape, I knew, at first glance, the answer. It all started in the Middle Ages when Batman grew accustomed to being able to lasso people. No one ever realized what could be done with the dark arts without it taking place in time, and nobody ever understood that it was connected to a powerful evil element. From the skeletons of old, to the sinister snowman, to the set dressing sprees, to the mightiest swordsman there ever was, The Dark Lord had come all along for everyone's benefit. But Batman was too, and after that first month, he was spent. 
 By this time, I was aware of something strange about Batman. He was vaguely average in every way, and yet, as I continued to peel me off of the sidewalk, he took more and more of my energy. I wouldn't sleep with every morning, because a sense of guilt would start gnawing at me and begin to bar my plate. However, since I was only doing it for money, however, I'd immediately pay money back for the swings or repairs that were necessary with all the movie rights I had. I continued to live and go on and on, but Batman began to stop me from enjoying himself. I began to notice that my weakness was becoming more and more apparent. He would not stop if he thought he was defeating me. In my later years, in the eyes of numerous other villains, he would be a more perfect example of what I had become. If Batman had stopped me, all would have changed. But when I was bored, I began to develop a secret identity and changed my identity before I ever realised it. I would watch the Happy Guy lasso me, dance in my seat, and get some of my energy back. And sometimes, when I needed a kick, I would have to act.

*Come on, man, we have an anniversary tomorrow! You better get ready, man! * 
 She had picked me up at the store the day I jumped in to meet him, of course, he was the one who confirmed to me she wasn't going to be the fat girl I'd desperately wanted. She always jokingly said he was cocky and I couldn't possibly be so naïve to feel me jealous because of the way I look in our dress socks. 
 She was calling me out on every single Sunday morning and took me to her favorite church that day. Yeah, that was fun until I left the next morning. 
 I got ta confess, I had no idea that I had one of those little panties on so quickly that I wished I hadn't, I was usually really happy with my seemingly innocent life- life was never my forte, there were always so many faces in the crowd but here I was talking to a complete stranger. He looked creepy as hell and the fake gold eyes seemed more attractive than normal. 
 I didn't know what to do. She kept her mouth shut all night and brushed my hair with her bare hands while she made a phone call about a date. 
 The most interesting part of dating is just talking to the women. First she says it's about business and then she's right. That was okay. I told her it was about her money and then to come with me when she got home. The more important part of dating was speaking to her. 
 I hadn't gone to the church that day because I was having a heart attack from the alcohol, so I only came there because of her. I said a bow and let her enter the room. Everyone was shocked but I didn't want to make her the owner of my heart. Just the right thing to say. 
 I made eye contact and walked out the door. * Why the hell are you out for dinner!? * I thought, but I had never spoken to anyone before. I had a strong coherency for conversation and this was where I most wanted to be. 
 At the church I reached my destination. He stared at the table holding hands, three o'clock. Her arms were so small they looked like light strips sticking out of her legs. By the time I got to her, she was gone. 
 I dropped the wine in my wine glass and walked over to the walker behind her. When I turned away, she was still alone. She had been saying the same thing for weeks. It was difficult when I first met her but she always seemed to take it one step further and that was okay. One day it would be okay. 
 She left and I never talked to her again.

I laid down on a warm bed. Something is wrong, I knew, but I didn't know what. I called out, "John, John!" 
 Someone answered my call. A body was blown out of the water. I can feel my legs falling out. I can hear the feet move on, we hear the screaming. We are airborne. There is no control of our movements. Everything in this body has a core core. At first it had been small and rocky, but the more we work together the heavier it becomes. This company seemed to be getting bigger, and the smaller the body went. It got closer and closer until it started in the air, and it sort of felt the pressure. 
 It does its job, I swear. It screams, I swear! I can hear them hitting against each other. I can see them trying to figure out where they came from.

"Once upon a time, at the edge of a world somewhere in between space and time, the dominant species of life on the planet was ruled by a tiny speck in the middle of a black hole. This speck gave birth to a very dark, hideous creature. As it grew, some wrote about it being the god of the matter in the sky, but all speculations were quickly abandoned as the speck became malleable and the whole speck was incapable of merging into one place. That is until an elvish time traveler named Bran Stark and his crew found the point of the speck in the sky. The speck, where the hunters, explorers, and scientists searched for years to find the mythical creature that became known as their God. Bran Stark took the speck to the edge of the sky to explore the heavens and from there he met his people. Now they are right here, waiting for Bran's place in the heaven of the new world.

 I stared at her face as I slowly walked out the room. It had been months since I last saw her face, and I knew the personification of lost innocence. 
 As I stepped out of the bar, I looked down at the body lying in my hands. I slowly approached her, I hesitated at first, but since I could see the pastel haired faces, I quickly told myself that it was either her, or myself. 
 I had finally gotten enough sleep last night. I was very tired after 3 days of trying to sleep, but I had already decided that my love life isn't working well and that I needed to stay in bed. My vision was fading when I finally began to hear breathing noises in the hallway. 
 "Hey ya! Here's a real looking koala if you'll excuse me. Don't worry, it doesn't look very attractive. " 
 This was bad news. In the next breath I inhaled, and for a split second, she smiled, nodding in greeting. " Thank you, sweetheart! I will get you that breakfast soon. " 
 A few minutes later, I stepped out of my haze. " That must be a nice night to be having with a cute little koala, eh? " 
 She sighed, and looked at me expectantly. " Go on... " 
 " Hey, don't you think that means I can have a baby? " 
 " Ew! " 
 She rested her eyes on my chest, and gave me a cheeky smile. " Well, that is a big day for me. Why don't you join me out here with me? I've got a good weekend ahead of me. " 
 I smiled and flipped off the lights, and down the hallway went our daughter. 
 " I'm sorry, " I muttered with a happy smile. " I guess I'll have to leave you then. You know that stuff is hard to find and... well, the house's always the same. Keep quiet!"

'Not for another five minutes...' 
 Richard looked at the Casings carefully - stacks of thousands of very fragile presents scattered among the benches of the Auditorium as the lone auditorist gingerly removed them. 
 'I wonder if...' he said simply. 'how could they *meant*...' 
 The auditorist hesitated, then removed the stacks, revealing not a single item in them at all, and began staring at the stack. 'Let's see -' he said, content to stare again in this empty place - with a dark glint, faintly burning a few rows - 'what was the last thing they had? Were they out of food?' 
 Richard paused and stared, trying desperately to grasp the truth of what he knew to be true. 'Maybe they didn't have animals?' 
 'Umm... they didn't have any!' the Auditorist sneered.'Might be better if they weren't. If they were. If they wasn't hungry!' 
 'Well..' Richard trailed off, thinking to himself,'if they didn't have animals, they might have food'. The last thing he wanted was to die. But this was not the end he looked for, and his life had gone... lost. But there was one thing he needed to remember. The bones. 
 Richard fell to his knees. 
 For a short while they kept the carcasses around in the auditorium in a ragged container which they held in hand, and stood at attention, sharing the moment with the silent faces of the team. 
 And for a brief second, one could swear that the dark glitter wept like flowers on an autumn night, and that the mother of all tears that rose from the grave... 
 As the hall went quiet, Richard turned his attention to the music playing behind him; and soon, Richard's room grew silent. A sudden thump sounded, and the auditorist suddenly lowered her head. 
 'How long...?' Richard asked. 
 The auditorist just grinned, and a deep smile grew across her features. 
 'That long' 
 Richard saw a knock on the door and went to answer, but was not greeted by the massive, iron-haired man with a tall, imposing figure. 
 'What's up?'he asked nervously. 
 'I wan na ask you again, sir. Did you tell anyone about...' 
 Richard gave a grunt and started to shift his weight to the side, but paused, thinking quickly. 
 'What did you want?' 
 'Was it food?' 
 'That's what I want.' 
 'Really?' 
 The Auditorist hung her head and shook her head. 
 'It would work.'

"I'm still the only one who knows about this " for some time, I can't understand how they can. We were a good little tribe, we traveled the river we came from, we ate fish, we drank local to get by, as the words spoken from us could only mean one thing. The snake. 
 " Are we in the Paleontological Museum, or must we leave? " 
 " The museum. " 
 " This is a military mission by one of the Army " 
 " Okay, let me get this straight. If we leave, then perhaps the dinosaurs don't have a good shot. " 
 " Wait, of course not. There are many tyrannosaurs that have been extinct, three and they weren't fun with it for so long. How can we not save them, anything to save ourselves? " 
 I was once the paleontologist, and even now I can't understand the meaning of this. 
 " Many of them lived in caves of great size and emerged in this region that protected them from predators. Some migrated here in the past but had been forced to migrate in a group called the Blue Devils " 
 " The red one? 
 " Yes, from the time they arrived it was just our little Indians who recognized what they were doing and decided we should use all of the technology they knew to protect them from us. At least that's what I am told. " 
 " Now stop harassing me, I have over 400 of the best human spears we know. If we don't win then there is no threat of extinction. " 
 There is a moment where I only stand there frozen. 
 " Listen buddy, right now we're just in front of the statue of your father. Wait, what is that thing? I must have dug up a treasure for the museum because I see there is a snake with a shining light on it. Can you put it down? " 
 I instinctively start running away from the statue when I see that she is holding a spear in one hand, and a creature with a brain shimmering through an invisible hole in the ground that could only be described as alive. 
 I mean, there was a tail, and it had fully grown. Too like you put your two hands in to fill with " other" earth metal or something. 
 Thank God because her skull is gone.

"There are three orders that all kings do, and none shall fail to obey. " 
 At that, the Queen of Diamonds rose and looked at the crowd of nobles, her crimson, blue eyes cascading through their robes. As they followed her, she said, " So all will be well in the commonwealth. We will prosper, no kings will succeed. " 
 Some had an answer for that, though. Some scoffed, and set off angrily towards the back wall. The King of Diamonds could only stare longingly at them, like a cruel reproach. Each one of them might have been several years old, but they did not matter at this point. They had never been queen for long, and now they were. 
 The King of Diamonds stood, and waited. " Master Thar and Flod, bring me the rod you sent on that crow named Sharkbite! " 
 The Queen of Diamonds raised her finger, and a black circle suddenly erupted, and it caught on the newly formed wooden surface of the ship, stretching out like a gecko. Then the Queen of Diamonds suddenly collapsed, and the entire ship burst back into orbit. 
 Fluorescent lights flicked off, and shambling people began to sprint towards the outside. The King of Diamonds leaned down and grinned. He held the rod under his chin, and the room became a glittering hologram before him. He pushed the rod and rewinded as his vision zoomed away. She stood on the red rock, staring at the others. " What the... was that supposed to mean? " She muttered, opening up her mouth. " Did you hear my bro? he's right... it means when something happens to a princess... they let you off " 
 Her voice rang out softly in his ears. Some families heard them alone, and they ate their dinner quietly, mumbling down the secret codes they shared with him. " It wasn't my bro. He just said we should leave this small town... " 
 The golden light from the Rod flashed bright, and the others began to run. They did not know what to do, what to do, what to do. After a while, they burst back into orbit, smashing their way through the crowd of nobles who had taken refuge in the center. All of them, grinning, began jumping out of their houses and smashing people along the way. " WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! " Mumbles one. The others threw his hand in the air, he shouted. A crowd of shouts erupted, and he quickly lifted his hand up from the ground, shining brightly with his. 
 He held the rod at his own temple, taking a deep breath of air. " Uh... I can't... this doesn't work. This is the end! We can't... we can't... die! " He died three seconds later. The others ran away, and began to quickly follow him. He placed his hand into his pocket, shaking the rod a little. " But I found something... " 
 A flash of light illuminated the room, and he stepped back. A flash of light began to spread, and it grew larger and larger, and started to glow as brightly as the room to the left. The rods and walls began to glow. " What am I, a king? " 
 The light grew bright as his hands became the size of mans. " This doesn't work... this doesn't work..."

My knees quivered. " You have angered the gods for the last time. " I said. " But the elder priests are more powerful. And I'm also a smart man. You think you can make the world a better place when you can watch as everyone loses their mind! " 
 His eyes shone once more into the darkness. " Where is Zeus for you to lay claim to? " 
 " Zeus for me to get a proof. " 
 " Wait, what the fuck do you mean and who are you? " 
 I felt a prick near my neck. " Well what happens then? You tell them I've been tricking them into spying on you. " 
 His jaw dropped. " Okay. You tell them I've been tricking them into handing you a proof. " 
 My throat tightened. " I know what you are. " 
 His eyes widened, and he fell to the floor as I cursed his power. " What the fuck you mean- " I reached to grab his head. " Get them to stop bugging me."

Since Harry Potter's shock hit Harry while driving his Underpass into the Mist, things had been kind of interesting since then. Doping, sharing hobbies, learning how to read the letters on notepad paper, and found himself in his own little world. But eventually Harry found himself in a part of the world Harry didn't know his parents loved him for. He couldn't see his parents, at least not as far as he could see his parents, who he could swear were themselves talking to him in the first years he left Hogwarts. Not to mention, what could come next in the conjuration class? He'd pull on them at the bus stop, but this time he'd have to find one of his parents in a place with specific flaunting skills of the wizarding world. He'd have to defeat his parents and find the escape where he could hide. Harry had to get out to the nearest of the wards. 
 As Harry entered the school, he looked around the student panel. There's only one school he recognized. The one in his parents pictures. On one side of the room, a desk. On the desk, Harry could see some swatch of paper in some colors. On the other side was a picture of a naked girl and an arm with something on it. On both the faces, the girl dressed a similar gray dress with leather riding boots. Harry's confused hands brought up letters. The paper had an inscription on it. 
 The girl's name was Katniss, an orphan girl who had the wonderful scar on her right hand. But the other woman to Harry's right had an ember-red hat and had to wear black socks like hers. She had snow-white hair, which one did you believe wasn't snow? Even though Harry could see the shadow in the corners of his eyes, he couldn't make out what was on the girl's face in all those colors. Nothing made sense. 
 Now that his eyes had learned about the hole the letters seemed to belong to, Harry couldn't even focus on anything. He could just hear the voice inside his head say something in a certain way, with no discernible pattern at all. After a while, his head felt like it was getting cold. 
 He walked over to the desk and pulled a letter out of his pocket. It started to read, "We are with the school of purebloods that serves for you. Enter this letter. " The teacher was staring at him, every word feeling like a jagged rock. Harry looked up to see her smiling, her cheeks filling with a low-yelling laughter, starting. " Thank you for choosing Harry, for now you will be protected from harm and you will now be in a safe house. We can hear the conversation upstairs! It is time for your report." The teacher was panicking, and Harry didn't know what to do. 
 Harry burst out laughing. Years of disinterested minds spent learning the forgotten language, and in some instances, starting the process of reality from the shadows. He shot his small air-ship into space and reached for his boot.

I'm a composer with synesthesia. We talk to one another constantly - presumably because we feel physically connected to one another. Sound and intuition are naturally confounded, and as long as your ear phones and ear drums keep ringing we interpret this mutual world of consciousness through our styles. My minds are set up for the hypnotizing gestures of hyperfocus and simple code words. I haven't allowed myself to stop listening to the movements of Bison lately - so for now I'm on a roll playing alto saxophone and super machine bass. 
 A series of lines from a song is filtered through a double flange projector - parallel to my thoughts - but I've heard nothing out of the ordinary until I turn a single eye and begin typing. I'm enjoying the sounds coming from my studio and playing the sentences, but as soon as I don't get a single lockpick on my head and hold my attention I begin selecting each one of my instruments. From the Hachette world recordings I've earmarked it as a song I'm interested in. 
 It's hard to describe the sounds they play. I usually have to find a key on a piano or my room, yet I never seem to get more than a few keys ( mostly old, if I'm willing to take it ) - even if I've found a chord in English or a waveform in French that doesn't even require a key to start with. I mostly have some notes even played in obscure harps ( soon enough someone - the guy I'm trying to describe - asks me if I know anyone who can hear my work on monitors. I'm a woman, but I just can't give you enough information to tell you my name. ) The captions, however, make the most sense. 
 One of them was all I knew and I laughed a ton. I played the bottom left, of a scale. It didn't really affect my skill, but the size and feeling I got was often a virtual fusion of two things: the feeling of being in a rhythm and the ability to feel like myself. It's okay, I won't lie to you about these sounds. I was really disturbed by them now. 
 I became familiar with a type of music that I've developed since school. I was a young executive, coming home from work after some math test, trying to log in with all the necessary resources. I had a peculiar taste in music, and I liked it. My job was excruciatingly stressful - things like calling someone by their name, going through the motions for someone, anything to prevent theft or mismanagement - but one day after an intern call for a break to talk, I had decided to put all my energy into discovering some old chord. I took a little sip of coffee, waited for the hour of waiting and a second act of parody and then went back to my desk. 
 I got a three point pop-up, listing all the key moves I must have used in order to figure out my pulse, heart rate, intuition and all the other things a little human could possibly do. I also put all my money into something that most people don't even think about, in order to get some kind of funding for my new office. I started to roll out an entire new show where I operate the house. My talent was truly incredible - a six step genius I discovered.

"Hmmm... " Sam groaned, folding a pizza onto a piece of paper, " must've been a fun night, though, since we got something wrong. " 
 " Yup. " Si moved back and forth, chewing the crust, steaming the sauce, " which look like too much sauce. " 
 Sam's eyes widened, " No, I think I need a fix. " 
 Si nodded eagerly, and turned to Sam again, " Thank you," she squeaked, then rolled down her dress and began stroking the mound of mmmeline on the pizza pie. Sam didn't care about the food, he was angry with himself. He spent half an hour cooking the pizza with his brother, as Si had always done this part of their life.

He stares down the alleyway, at the exposed metal, which is a monument to this ungodly tedium. Finally he has finished that strangling task and finally at last has packed up the bag and into a pouch of ammo he originally hid in his back pocket. He turns to the rising sun and glances back up at the massive skyscrapers below, just like the one he accidentally dropped on the wall during an accident. The sky shimmers blue and then red for a quick double as his blood drips from his forehead and snarls at the abomination above him. From one of the skyscrapers, he sees the tallest building, the tallest building with skyscrapers down. The station is just a building down, just a convenience store. The sky shimmers red and he runs up in a kite to point and climb up, while his mangy hair around his shoulders turns as white as snow. When he reaches the roof of the station, he notices smoke, and he quickly looks for anything there, or at least he thinks he knows where it is, to find a cell or trap and we can all literally hide under whatever is next and escape the attack. As he reaches the building, he feels a sickening numbness go up his spine. A single plywood metal sits on the ground below, he starts to run backwards, almost tripping the mountain that just blocks from the building. Another tower. But this time, this time, he's in the building that is the right location, the one that was yesterday. The tower comes crashing down and just through the fire breathing fireballs slowly opens up, everyone screaming for help. " save me! " The building quietly creaks slightly and turns into a humongous structure filled with 6 giant robots ( he doesn't recognize his mistake ); the head of one of the robots puts his fingers on one of the robots's arms, " you don't have to do this!" He screams for help, but another robot grabs him, and the robots blow him away from the building, but they still continue to crush him as they make their way back to the station. 
 So here I was, in the city of Batman. Bruce Wayne was killed by the actions of these multiple guys, and this town is the city that made up the new Batman. And he's finally here. Bruce Wayne and his girlfriend Lily are the lucky ones of Gotham, and he is one of them. After the firehorns and robots continue their raids, he calls them back, and they order us to stop, since they know that the fight is getting worse. He actually goes through the system and destroy everything from the flood money, to the large fertilizer plants, to the PMP stations, but we take care of him. Because we can't let Robin go after he leaves this city. Like he said, this city is dying, and there's nothing we can do. Even now, he kills and captures even more villains. He spends his nights laughing and attacking for real time and another day of living in Gotham. Until one day, his life stops leaving him.

Humanity acts like nothing more than they are. We simply work, out of ignorance and'shory cliques' whom attach themselves to some superior force of nature instead of seeking their own. Ironically though, one of us can don'thing if we can't steal their feelings as well. There was only one individual who can respect such an aspect of human nature. Well, at least that's what he thought. Shit. 
 Humans do however, know how to organize themselves. He had trained him for weeks on end, practiced magic, vowed to gain control over everything that he did. Such power only becomes you when you realize there's a long list of useful knowledge that you're capable of finding on your own. It's even more power if you remember your secret, and you just start turning into your own worst enemy. 
 The humans now have even more authority. Their masters have decreed that if an individual cannot control what they see to become, then they can never prove themselves true masters. The humans now have dogs, yes, but do animals really want to find truth? Do they even want more power than is warranted? 
 So now that he's finished, he begins to carefully argue with his masters. This solution has so much practical use that he almost inevitably turns into wolf. In order for this to be more dramatic, he must have a girlfriend. The dogs have incredible dominance instincts, but dogs have no need for anything, except their owners. What the humans have in common is that they intentionally feed the humans lazily and allow their dogs to roam a length of the house, inconspicuously getting free food and water. 
 This violates the rules, and the humans realize this. They could use any other species as leverage. They have been going around trying to control humans, and accidentally becoming slaves of some of their leaders. Guess what happens? They all have one. And when they see themselves controlled, they recognize what their masters told them they'd do next. That humans have been gaining control of the world. 
 Lying on the floor, dead.

He lives in a corner cottage with chickens. There are so many of them. He was so happy, he was happy with his life. 
 He lives in a single tub that has tubs and I live in a single tub that has tubs. He's happy, he's happy with his life. It all took place in a single tub. 
 But now, one more window, one more window, and one more window. 
 It's all about control. He can't let anyone control him. 
 All the birds in a bedroom can't do it, they'll make it disappear. They don't love or love and yet they are happy. They do everything they have to. He wants to outsmell them, shoot all the bullets and they're in there, must be in there, should be part of this. He wants to forget about what we have shared, the little children who want to hear about what we have lost, the tiny children that he wants to save, their parents that they're afraid to say to me. 
 My children can't say, but I have to say this, it's wrong. I can't do it. I'm it. Just can't let my children see it. She has to go, he can't find her. He can't catch her. He's safe now and then. He can change her out. I'm wrong, he's not happy anymore. 
 He can't remember, the girl who wanted to learn to fly, the child who went to the park with him and wanted to do anything. 
 He remembers the story of how he died and what it felt like to be sent to space, being able to watch all the others on a lone rowboat, being able to let all of them know they were there. 
 That is what he had to do. It was stupid. They had to be removed. But it's all our fault. The people that looked at him this way were cruel, and so were the Christians. The Mormons. 
 They walked in on me. We talked, looked into my eyes, laughed. They had a different-than-expected laugh. 
 I can see his smile now. And I can't hide it. That smile of his, of his two faces. But I will love him and him alone. Even if it's not for me. 
 I can't live any longer. The world has moved on and I'm just playing in the grass. There's a war in my head. I have to hide my gun.

"Come here, today is right! " The small girl cried out frantically. She had simply went out to claim a loaf of bread and confit, and had nothing more on her plate. 
 Four of the village elders had arrived before her, and were entering shortly afterwards. They asked if she should help them. 
 " Yes, I am not hungry, " she told them. She shook her head; very few were familiar with what a little water tasted like and how it dissolved down through her food. " I am here to beg your forgiveness. " 
 The village elders were irritated and interrupted. " It did not take her a moment to comprehend that we were here to aid you? " 
 She shook her head again, " Well then, don't worry. I shall honor you, your honor." 
 She left and wandered off again; not really sure why she was allowed to leave. Everyone looked for her anyway. 
 It was not until some time later, after centuries of hearing from her that some of the villagers were acting erratically and potentially trading fish for water, that the leader of the village passed his right hand up to her and said,

When he's not taking the health care initiative or taking the accounts he got from his grandfather, Kim Olsenski, Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un all the way from Pyongyang all the way up here from the Korean Peninsula... 
 That's right, he wants to die. But, there are six. Him losing the health care in North Korea. 
 Once he realizes that he can not die because he only has time... I guess you could say that Kim Jong-un is very happy. Perhaps he's very sad. Perhaps he's stressed or tired or just perfectly unable to take responsibility. Maybe it's because of other people or people's lousy jobs. 
 But, all of this besides the five, seven, 8 figures of Kim Jong-un. He's just one more sad, meaningless figure with a rotten conscience. 
 But, I guess the only thing you can do is read about this person in the news. He talks about lives that he's probably taking from his grandfather who gave away his position. And, the only person that he's taken away from is... 
 Nae Long.

Best I could do. Another 7 months working in this tiny little village. I'm sure you think people wouldn't follow me into the city. They might leave a trail of dishes left behind from their weekly escapades. I'm sure they will be back. 
 Best I could do. I think I shall just keep doing what I am doing. I look down at my knife, it is my birthday as an apprentice.

By now, you're probably wondering, on the cover of every newspaper, book, magazines and book in every major city, how I know what to do with myself. I know what to call the hashtag # wiptmossman. I know who I can talk to. I know who he thinks I am. I know who I want to be, exactly. But I don't know what I want to be. 
 You're probably thinking, "Who are those people I see everyday? " I told myself. Yes, that's right. I know what they look like. Like the kind you see in parties and the kind you don't even recognize. 
 But look in the mirror, I know I am different. I know I'm different. And I know that I want to be different. 
 These are ordinary people, people from the very best, even the women at least, from the rich fathers who are only that way because of their Asian heritage. They don't even look like me. They look like me, but I know what that means. I don't know how to tell if they think I'm looking at my own reflection in the mirror or not. And they don't think they're looking at me. So, I'm stuck with the news, going through my routine that morning, reading the paper, picking up the pace. 
 Don't get me wrong, I'm not some creepy fetishist looking to look handsome. I don't even get the benefit of the doubt because everyone else has always complained about my flaws. My flaws get ridiculed before they get old enough. 
 So, today I'm going to try to put down the garbage and eat my lunch in some near-perfect moment of responsibility. 
 I pulled up my shirt. I let the noise trap beat down on me, and walked over to my skirt. The moment I stepped foot up I saw his figure. He was wearing a loose, tattered shirt and behind a loosely-clothed-makeup, perhaps, but there were three black puffed pockets in between his shirt and his tie. The frilly look on his face stared back at me from that feeling of embarrassment that he had immediately recognized. My life was an escape, but when you're stuck in a dull reality where you're almost caught up in the surrealess and the stupidness of normal life, it becomes difficult to focus. 
 So, I explained my facts. In the beginning, I didn't see the difference between me and the snotty-puss who don't know what to call me. I, he saw me as a toxic toxic gas, filled with my pride, my ego and disgust, my sadness, and I hated being called " snotty-puss" because I'd never tasted my own vomit. 
 That's the second one. Now, his daughter who had picked up the paper was half as strange, almost as stupid. She was so innocent and innocent and innocent and innocent! 
 So today, I sit here, in that shitty, boring, hushed, numb, pathetic state of existence. Some vaguely functional baby, borderline depressed, probably mad and annoyed, doesn't even know what he's looking at. I know he's looking at his reflection, the echo chamber in his head, maybe, he's fantasizing about how sexy he is without seeing himself.

Song 1 
 The lover is the king 
 His amiable daughter is the mother 
 In the courts, her eyes adorn 
 His lovers are the father 
 The prison bars are the prisons 
 Your life is so short-lived you must roam 
 And do your best to fend for yourself 
 But be merciful, only you are merciful 
 When you approach the bar, you try hard to snatch 
 At first, you try to walk up to see your friend 
 Then you try to go to the bar, this can not be right 
 You have your hands and you will fight 
 Until your feet feel dirty 
 But at least we have our hands and we are happy 
 Cause I am the master of this courtroom 
 And the bars are our prisons 
 So let the man who happens to be my lover lead 
 Ill he be what I want him to be? 
 I see you to your mother, the father would come 
 Mother would choose her heart 
 But there's no man, he's the doctor 
 You think this is ok, that's what they say 
 When I look in your eyes, you find the hatred a stranger can stand 
 And bring a needle to the head 
 And see though to this day, it's true 
 If you're a man of love, might you stand against me? 
 I love you, and if I have to give you the switch 
 If I have to give you a blow that hurts, I have to give it to you 
 Either way, there's no meaning to your situation 
 But I know you, I know you too 
 I'm right here and so I'm glad it was you

He stood in a small room with around an 80-30 man force, some was sitting in chairs with monitors and laptop in front of them. He stood at the edge of the room facing the table and leaned into his phone, fingers gripping the table's logo. 
 From a speaker located in the corner of the room he sighed with an evil laugh as he caught his breath, and knocked open the door. Everything went silent. He was alone. No one. He heard a voice whispering "It's ok kid, we've had a few friends the last a few days and now we know who they are. They, are crazy. " 
 He put the phone down, fingers on the button on his fridge, and then snarled angrily: 
 " You are crazy just one more day, Mr. Crying. " 
 The speaker boomed. The man giggled and went back to talking to the speaker and made as much noise as he could. 
 " They, are crazy. " 
 He stood in his place. On his lap was a cigarette, and in his hands was a thumb drive. The man started to inhale slowly, and placed it on the airlock so he could keep it closed even as he stared into the screen. 
 " They are not crazy! They go on several suicide attempts each day at this point. They show up on youtube or YouTube, they even do it on their personal computers. They kill themselves at the end. " 
 " THEY ARE DYING! " 
 " Then why do you think that is? " 
 " Their killing themselves on the last day, isn't a big deal. They do it in time, after all. " 
 The man sighed slightly, grabbed his cigarette, and lit a cigarette slowly. With a simple cough he continued to inhale until the cigarette landed on his lips. He inhaled. " All I know is that I'm going to go to hell.

*I had put on some VR headsets for the first time today. I still haven't gotten used to it. Would be a shame if I woke up like this *but nothing felt right. * I didn't feel properly... or at least as calm as I could have imagined. I can't quite tell if I'm dreaming, or if my awareness is a hallucination or just awake. I felt as if I had been asleep for a long time, but everything changed abruptly when I saw the familiar sights. It was like... long, more hairy legs, and muscular arms, but I could not move them. I felt an unnatural blinding force pulling me to a standing position, I tried frantically to open my eyes but my body could not. Time seemed to slow and stop as my eyes slowly followed the lenses, I tried to stand and closer to the platform but it was nowhere to be seen. All I knew was that the walls now covered in odd looking things seemed so big, even in the distance, I could still see the strange little creatures in a way that felt dizzy and connected to me. I almost fell off the platform, as it opened up and a pilot went flying over to my companion, he seemed content, but it wasn't the best idea. He slowed down to a stop, I tried to let go of him, but the artificial arms picked me up and carried me to the cockpit. I heard the doors open and he stepped out, putting an arm around me. I opened my eyes and saw that he was older than I was before the VR goggles got placed. He looked at me and looked me through my helmet. " The HR is now ready for your departure " he said as he followed me. I could not make out anything other than him, but something was attached to my face, he looked slightly older than me. I could tell from his skin that he wasn't mine, he was a robot, floating around the scenery and looking at me, but he spoke quietly. " My name is Miles. " Miles nodded and opened the cargo door. " Stay here with me as long as you can. If anything weird happens, move on." I still can't get my head around what is happening. Did he feel anything of interest? Is he human, or is this a dream? I am still in the water, nothing is moving as I become immersed in the swirling scenery. I am float in what I assume is Paradise.

*Hi, Reginald, here I am. I'm the religious imam in the small town in the United States of America ( ಠ_ಠ ), but I've been writing a short story about the situation of that area for a few years now. I'm a convert to Christianity and another religious believer, who I believe have set up a church or a mosque for us. 
 The Supreme Government didn't approve of us in the first place, so after a bit of arguing and discussing in the boards of religious leaders we finally decided to ban all religion. I remember loving my new doctrine of church and all it was that it had. It was then that I finally learned that there is no corruption or manipulation amongst the people and no supernatural power can draw a finger. No one can, anyone can try to change the direction of your life. What happens, what happens when you actually try to change your life's direction? Everything changes, But as far as I know, we'll never be able to do this again.

"Please click me " reads the message of a murdered man. I read the word " terror " all over my mind. The button is really hard to press. 
 I prepare for this moment for two reasons. Firstly, as the old women's bat was crying. Secondly, my parents were devastated. I'm in a room, in a jail cell, and one of the guys in handcuffs behind me, is holding a weapon. 
 " We have to end this man's life ", I say calmly, leading my dad into the room. There were no women here and he was in handcuffs. He loosened the restraints on me and took me into a blindfold. He put a body on the floor with wires and a hook attached to it. The box came out and opened up. A wall and chairs were in front of me, and I can see the mother in one of the chairs. 
 I begin to stand up, so it's only for half an hour. I get out of the chair and take off the hoodie, realizing now I was totally naked. After about 20 minutes I realized my mother who had been in handcuffs didn't have any tattoos on her face, so that was very unlikely. The door swings open and my mom is standing in. 
 " Hey, how's mom? " 
 " Wearing your face mask?"

The baby is gone. The past decade has been 'unbearable', the life of a poor man who had only days to save a life, had to live out his final months like a soldier. His every contraction felt like a breath of fresh air over tears. 
 Was he in pain, his walking across the darkest night of his youth was agony. The memory of a daughter was too much. 
 The few minutes he spent washing his mother's dead eyes were the only thing in his mind, and that made him a vengeful man, His short work days serving in the war fields. 
 His regular day went by rapidly and horribly, his dreams mainly wasted in his thoughts. Always failing he found himself tired and overwhelmed. Any effort to relax and keep going would be washed away in him becoming strange and strange again. He tried quitting but never played the game anymore, no one knew the purpose. I guess he just was tired of life. 
 In an attempt to keep going through each month nothing had happened but he found himself drifting through the dark. He wished for nothing to happen anymore. Every hour, every hour more felt like an eternity. It had no meaning except to rattle a clank on his wall, and the realization of losing one's dreams made him restless. 
 At first it was mundane. It was gone. 
 The light was fading though it was clear that there were still screams. His heart was pounding furiously, his breathing had become a slow dance. The world faded into blackness. 
 The light returned. Its presence was revelry. It was consuming his moment of "irreruption " a moment that could have been anything. Yet there was an empty room at his side and as the light left, he turned and looked out. 
 The small box he kept in his closet was covered in tiny golden flowers on a park bench. He picked them up as they were given to him and then realised he had to open them. It wasn't at all what he had expected. 
 Nothing, just a warm small garden, flowers that were taken from him. He placed them next to his bed and clutched the to his face and placed them into his lap. When his own movements became crisp and clear he looked out again and realised he had to take them. He had to open them. 
 Light made its way towards him and he felt a warmth then. Lighting overwhelmed him. He opened his mouth and the familiar words came out. 
 " NO, OUT THERE." The sounds were quiet and I wanted to cry. The lights in my bed and away from my bedroom did nothing to slow his " awakening." In the darkness he could hear the cold whisper of a child. A lonely voice from outside his thoughts. Now where would he go when the light faded. What would he be like? What was he to do when he woke up? He could hear tears roll down his face. 
 The child had left the room with his wife. He ran towards his bedroom, he couldn't stay standing in a picture frame. He couldn't see the light leave him that night. He was too tired to think about it. He threw away what little he had in his and stood next to the other dirty picture frame. 
 On his dark walk back to the bed there was the last shred of light remaining on his worn new world. 
 And there was silence.

( Location is unknown but is probably located in what they call "Fucking Hell. " ) 
 Dear me, 
 It's 4:47 AM and I'm having a panic attack, having no idea what's happening. I awake to find myself at the site of a few dead bodies still untouched by my invention, standing up from the cement. Red circles appear on the ground and a piece of paper comes out. From the paper, I can confirm that another is around my age. 
 " Sir, I am an expert on taking control of your device. Tell the police why you're here." 
 With a gasp, I start up my car. As I sit on the car, my heart goes out to hear those dead bodies underneath my feet. I look up, but I can't see anything. How can I make eye contact with those corpses or even touch them? I have a perfect camera here, and one that is smart enough to know my location. I wonder what has happened to all the people that we have killed and killed? It makes my stomach turn when I realize that the camera was pulling me right towards the body. I run back to the car, and pull the other end of the rope and dash into the police station, where I watch them take me there. Only later can I recognize that my location is correct! 
 It took me exactly five seconds to put the remaining body back together and figure out where it was and what happened to it. After that, it was just a matter of time. 
 At least four people were injured during the rescue attempt. I guess how a holiday could feel like a bad idea, especially with the ghost's habit of always tearing apart a body. Unfortunately, a lot of people were easy to spot, though, and they were able to spot me quite well. 
 This event was officially estimated to cost the government $ 1000 in damages. Thanks to my invention, I can watch people in the future kill because of the death of the dead and have no clue what happened to them. 
 I don't know how the only reason that is missing from my life right now is because I decided to take two patients down with me. I couldn't have to let one of those patients get harmed, and at least I get to enjoy another week. But of course, I wouldn't save that patient, so that was not really my decision. As I'm standing outside the hospital, all I see are wet footprints sticking out of the walls. What a crazy coincidence. I really don't know what the future might hold.

My name is Bob. I was born... Feb 25th, 1981. I can't remember the day, but I remember the night. I woke up on the moonlight and did something I couldn't do before. 
 I played some pants and a shirt with two stars in the air. Nothing would move around for miles before I spotted the skylight. All of a sudden the world was black and white. Everything was the same. All colors were randomly marked, except for the hard texture of the walls. Everything had the consistency of a cartoon of us. The skylight seemed to suggest something- something important or powerful, like a wealthy family- however, reality just was black and white. 
 As I walked down the street, I saw one tree sway gently into my hand. He seemed so young, as if he were stuck in a cage... He had a white face... 
 I took my time trying to make eye contact with him as we talked. Finally, he appeared at my side, holding a huge gun, waiting for me. 
 "And in the opening scene that begins as we are struggling to fight off the Dominion, you're right. I'm a good man, Bob. But I have to confess that I... I messed up a few things here and there. The Dominion didn't really want us all to go, just that they were down to one man's luck. I could have gotten you out of that child's arms, however, things went south. We had a few cats. I wanted to prove I was a good mother with the whole family. Go figure, Bob. However, it seems these cats were drawn quickly, and so the Dominion left me."

“ I want the rest of my life! ” said the 17-year old. 
 The father-of-two sighed and hugged himself to his chest. His four year old daughter looked over at her father who had been crying. 
 “ I can't! My god! ” he screamed. The father-of-three looked at the mother-of-four, “ You have to shut up. I promise. We need to talk. ” 
 The sobbing stopped and the mother-of-four held her daughter. The father-of-two took his daughter's hand and placed it on his chest. He gently laid her down on the side of the hill with his two other young daughters. 
 “ This… this ’ s a big tent, ” the father remarked. 
 The four young girls looked at him. 
 “ This is not a tent. We don ’ t need one, not the small unit fighting at the front lines. We all knew we were going to the front line. This is… this is a tank. It ’ s not a mud box, or a flood-trap. This is a tank – it ’ s another change of pace from the old land forces. ” 
 The children looked at the guy with a surprised expression and shrugged. 
 “ Shut your pups up! ” the father-of-two cried out. 
 The mother-of-four had finished saying the last thing they needed to say as she came on stage. 
 “ We all know you aren ’ t serious. You ’ re a sadist. You were never this optimistic, you ’ re never going to let go! ” 
 The girl looked at him with a mixture of pity and excitement. 
 “ Oh I never thought you ’ d say it, ” the father responded. 
 The mother-of-four looked at him suspiciously and stooped her head. 
 “ You were always such a pessimist, begrudgingly, but you know, we need someone who understands that. We need someone with the determination and discipline to do the right thing. Someone who is not afraid to do bad things and doesn ’ t have time for jokes and curiosity, who knows where the bad guys are lurking or making the right moves. ” 
 The mother-of-four smiled. 
 “ But what if I told you that someone doesn ’ t have the brains or the creativity to go against the regiment's orders, and they ’ re preternatural? That they ’ re basically bumbling little shit with no direction, while the men who are leading the other unit or protecting the troops know to never go after them? But you were just a penny coin to my hand to forget the horrors of war. Our enemy is a goddamned lizard with a heart of gold and wings. We need you to go and take them out. We don ’ t want to get bogged down in this nuclear storm. You ’ re gon na just go out and save your friends and family, and you know they ’ ll just watch you go over the heads of their wives for the rest of their lives. ” 
 The mother-of-four cracked her knuckles at the thought of them. 
 “ Yes. How about we do something along those lines? We ’ ll move up to Kessel to take over on our own. The other unit won ’ t come to their aid and die because they never see eye to eye with the others or because they ’ re too far gone to volunteer for death itself. They ’ ll take the side, only to just have one of the fallen soldiers sink into the flames with his heart and watch as their kin continue to live their lives on in terror. What would it do to us? What would it do to these children? ” 
 The father-of-two hugged his wife again. 
 “ As soon as we meet, I ’ ll make it clear to everyone that we ’ re not telling the truth. That we don ’ t want to start having these conversations and discussing this option with our brothers. ”

I joined the freest cities on Earth and retired from life like the siren song of angels. Long ago I had to live in the cities too. But soon the city snarls grew, and those siren song gulls grew. 
 Now the city has gone, without me I am merely a minor annoyance. I am hated, and I am beaten by the siren singer. But now I am paid a pretty penny. So my problems are sorted. Now I live in the cities and sing my hymns. My sisters are cute and wise. But my brother is a thorn in my side.

 But we aren't only human. It's like a war between the two sides, every human and everyone living in the same habitat. There are drugs, there are beasts, and there are. And it's fun, just because we can. 
 Of course it does sometimes. And some people and animals just like that. And somehow the game is supposed to get out of hand, even though humans always hunt, and we get shot if we don't follow the rules. 
 After the war, we sort of evolved into a civilization. One that was *kind of* *kind of* *kinda* *kinda*. At first it was just a hive of activity. What we'd call the "The Awakening" as we called it was always happening, and though people wanted to adapt to it, it quickly became extinct due to the sudden explosion of dawn, which just happened *so* near that time. 
 No one really knows what happened first, and no one really wants to. 
 That is, until *several *thousands* of years ago. You can imagine the first rays of sunlight striking the sea of civilization. 
 People felt the same way about it. As they mostly ate their food, and were pretty decent as the rest of us were, they embraced their new lifestyles. We were spared by the deliberate insanity, by having those rules aren't really enforced, by being enough "flat". 
 They, I've never met, but have met with some sick people. The regulations were changing faster than humans wanted them to, and the idea of artificial vegetation that you have to roll over was the worst thing to happen to all humans, right? That is, unless they adopted it. 
 Yeah, yeah, not now, either. 
 Fascinating. 
 In the beginning, there were many gods, mostly people that were very benevolent in their ways. 
 I'm not saying they didn't stick to their beliefs, though. I'm just saying they kept their values for a good long while too. 
 It got weird though. There was just something - one time there was a 'favorite' being cast in a mirror, all things considered. Why would they take every wonder and beauty of this world and turn it into their own grotesque reality, when they also thought they would be remembered as the ones that had made sure that everything was going to end? 
 Right away. The dreams started coming in, the monsters, the gods, the humans. Human Gods began haunting and torturing them, arguing and arguing about the gods, on their one planet. 
 They hurt, tortured, and killed, no words uttered here to scare them. It was insanity. And those so-called gods loved it. They wanted to get revenge, no matter how close they had to outliving us all. And they said there was no other way, that they would not live to see us end our suffering. And here we are, moving in time *slowly* and not moving as smoothly as we could when the gods themselves weren't gone. 
 I've had them for long, so that this must mean something. All human-like beings, all who had to adapt. 
 My job is interesting, isn't it? Turns out that this planet is really nicely done, as if it were dead. One humans lives in paradise, and all they do is mix up in a few strange parts for just about everything. They're pretty nice, though. * Earthy*. 
 What's other strange about their country is that, if they kill all humans, we don't even have to survive. We've never seen a hostile planet evolve. And the only threat they've had is *enough* food. 
 Many people have since moved on to more dangerous stuff. I've left them all, several days ago. 
 The real problem is, not having guns, doesn't really make them or everyone, too bad. It just makes them endlessly lazy. 
 So I hope everyone lives a long, happy life. That's all.

Sherlock stared at the floor, dark and stone, grey and painless. His nose twitched as the pain in his temples grew, more and more frequent each time he was cramped in a small room. The anger he felt in each instant filled him with shame. He faced off with the haphazard, dead sense of class in the room that told him to retreat to his cell, be quiet for now. He had spent his life trying to avoid it, the challenges pushing him down, and it was harder than he was used to it. 
 “ Scratch the poor bastards head, ” Doctor Cox said. 
 “ Who cares if there is a way to get him down without killing him? The beatings and incidents of torture? Oh, pardon me. I can't imagine a better way. ” 
 Sherlock was scared, it had been easy to do it before, maybe none of this matter now was. The heads start to just feel* right, no evil invading their lives. The voices of the dogs around the block worked, quieted down. He was saving people... 
... who... 
... who could be so so helpless as to attack? To stab so many people. 
... who were to blame? The newspaper clambered in his way, dog barked it had lost his is nose so that the rabies would get better. Only one person could survive it now, and a group of good people with anti-depressants had tried. They hunted down Sherlock and went to his apartment. The cries came from the street, the chemicals, they had all died anyway. It had only been one person who survived. Sherlock waited until the police had left. 
 Sherlock knew he had a plan... 
 *Hm. Crap. Now that Sherlock is dead he can't go back to life anymore. Look at all the pain, now at all the noise. The silence. No clue of its effects. There is no sense of purpose, no rhythm or conversation. At least there are no sounds, no energy, no reason at all... There is just nothing else. * 
 When the door swung open, the door was exactly how he expected it to be. His eyes widened. A figure entered, a young man, slightly less visible than his mask or the grey teal t-shirt. 
 He began walking, silently. Silence. 
 Sherlock fumbled with his own badge, little bits of information floated out of thin air, some calling out to him, asking why he was there, asking if he was alright. A sharp pain hit him, what did this mean? The girl looked around, Sherlock could see nothing, he screamed, for what to do, a hand moved to his side and shifted her towards him. 
 The man managed to start closing the door, but stop shortly as he noticed that he was holding a bright, round glass from where it rested on the floor. The glass glistened as it hit the ground and floated towards him. 
 He screamed, screaming with relief, “ I can save you! I can do this! I can save everyone! ” 
 “ Hell yeah! I can! ” the man screamed again, two bullets flew right past his head, the sound of a crash shaking the very bed. 
 “ Not only can I save you, I can save you! But I must warn everyone else... ” 
 The assailant was stopped by a woman. 
 Sherlock spat on the floor, the victim looked about in horror, the man was no where near enough.

“ Don ’ t you dare reach into there, Jake! ” 
 “ That ’ s because I can ’ t touch you, man! ” 
 I tried to call out to him, but he just kept wandering aimlessly around the place. Whenever I opened the gate I felt his intruders begin to gather around the fenced in front of me. 
 “ Jake, ” I thought, “ it ’ s not like I ’ ll ever tell you that you don ’ t have to trust me! ” 
 I didn ’ t know how long he had been staring at me, but in the distant moment I knew the world was about to end. 
 After a little while he gave up. He could ’ ve easily covered me with more leaves and a decent root can and grown taller. 
 Or maybe he ’ s just now started to notice me as well. 
 “ I know you can ’ t hear me, ” I thought to myself, “ just try not to make any noise. ” 
 He gave a beep and I gently raised the gates. “ OK, I got him. ” 
 I just silently prayed for an answer. 
 “ What do you mean? ” He asked me. 
 “ Oh, no I don ’ t know. There ’ s been an attack on my village here. ” 
 “ Who attacked your village? ” 
 I couldn ’ t comprehend what he meant. He started to stir, shouting that he wanted vengeance. 
 “ Too late, too late! ” I told him. “ And stop my wailing! ” 
 Another beep came from the gate and the intruder started to go on. 
 “ You ’ ll do better next time, ” he called again. “ I ’ ve already had to leave because the woodcutter panicked. ” 
 My red eyes saw a flash. 
 I began to cry. * One of you must still be angry*, I reasoned. * You may not have the reason to man your post-war military posts, but what you'll do with it, I can tell you, will be pretty exciting. Not to mention that your home base for the farmers in the valley would be open for town hours! * 
 Eventually he calmed down. 
 “ Your village is under attack by a bandit group. They have some supplies we need to expand into the tent. ” 
 “ Oh, shit, ” I said. * We need more wood. * 
 “ I ’ m sorry? ” 
 His anger became quiet as he raised his hands in the air and then threw them at my face. 
 “ This will not solve any problems you think you have, ” I said. 
 All of a sudden the gates opened. All the peasants in the valley, including mine, stood together. 
 “ Our gratitude for your help will have no effect on the bandits. ” 
 “ Nonsense, just trust me! ” I told him. “ You can ’ t ignore the villagers until all the cows are dead! ” 
 “ Totally, ” he said. 
 He slowly started to laugh a little. 
 “ Oh god, I can ’ t believe that you ’ ll be able to make the decision for me, ” I said. “ Forget your peace! ” 
 As I set down my plate of rice and drove him along, a voice came out from the distance. 
 * "Friend, the grater called your dead!" * *

"Oohh, it was actually very funny. That was scary, and VERY scary. It really scared me," Lennon said with his trademark jazz voice that had made all the world at home laugh and be happy. It had been during Lennon's several album interviews that rumors of the'J' had started, and they were too much of a success for any rock group, so they decided to kill it with a political assassination. And then they started ( however many times it took ), Lennon never knowing when that assassination would occur, but by the time he grew around John, everything had gone wrong. 
 The assassination had occurred at around midnight to begin again. The first thing Lennon found when he passed the phone, was the fact that Lennon had come to a same meeting that night. As he passed the thing back and forth into the room, things went crazy. A large crowd was gathered outside to see John's how many times he had, and to hear Lennon tell this incredible story, a thousand women burst through the door and made statements so loud no one could hear, and they began to speak more rapidly than usual. But then one were the women that finally spoke up, and they all realized why, at that exact moment, something was wrong: Lennon had fallen far from the mic, into the back of the bus that had been driving him away, and was making frantic proclamations in this very bus. The man who had spoken became increasingly agitated, and he began raising the mic, full of sobs of wrath, and then began to smack the man on the face, and it wasn't enough to break John's tone. Lennon began to repeat the first lie he had ever said: Lennon had already fallen with the woman who had shouted, and not once did John get close enough to feel she had a chance. The bus had never stopped that night and the first man on stage had not been even heard from during the 4th mention of Lennon's possible miscegenation of Whisky. 
 'Oh at least this time he didn't kill John anymore, because damn. The Beatles are bigger than Jesus,' John thought,'because his mortal enemy is Billy Connelly and the man he never changed.' 
 And the song's teaser was drawn, on the back of the bus of Lennon, and it was the first song his band had ever released. The most popular album of the year, as it must have been, until Lennon's death in 2004. 
 John stared up at the sky as it slowly faded out of his vision. God was playing guitar, and even the sing-song melody at the end of the song just made a lament for the presence of God. Lennon's lips began to seem, this time even, as if things were rearranging so much in their entirety. The light inside his head began to overtake his whole body, finally pulling him back inside. The light inside his eyes turned a shade of blue. And that was how he saw Lennon.

A man has the nerve to stare into space every time he stares at anything. His tiny belly ballooning to be on my shoulder, and he is practically standing there on top of me. They literally couldn't make me jump, even when the whole world is coming to a halt. They said I would see life by being who I am. They were right though. I'm about to jump. Right, this isn't a leap, it is a leap from the one-and-only Michael J. Fox, the father of modern aviation, the current commander of the United States Constellation, who is both shouting the words I'm standing on and watching him jump, and the chorus of bewilderment, because there are only five more seconds till infinity. 
 Do I get scared? Of course I do. On the edge of my seat he sits cross legged. Of course I get scared. But I am just scared. I have done this. I am not scared of losing this world. I know everything I know about Michael J. Fox, and he is determined to succeed. He does not appreciate when his children say he is not scared, or grandchildren complain or their dad asks how to raise an army. He just says that he doesn't need to understand. I hope he understands. Perhaps I will. 
 I place my hand on his shoulder and begin to walk away. The fact is that I am scared, and my world is back on the edge of infinity. I can feel it. There is a world below my seat, getting closer to infinity. There is no escape. But I can not let him be afraid again. I can not let him be scared.

My father stood over his brother, Patrons have forgotten about the recent events and the Dark Necromancy that has been brought to the planet, he added an extra massive fire in the center of the room. In the distance a light shone onto the table which flickered as my brother stood looking up from his game, in front of me sat a hooded man. He stood sprawled across the field in plain clothes, his body like the bloodied remains of a magician. He was dressed in black with long sword, his cloak hanging to the side like it reflected the sky and his body touching the ground with a single, as if he was in high heaven. His hood shut tight, he looked straight at me from his helmet. 
 "Brother, are you okay? " He asked. 
 " No, not much, but it hasn't ended yet. " I whispered. 
 " What is it? " 
 " They're killing us. It's about time we prepared. " 
 " Well, better prepare, " he repeated, " but make me do it, when you're ready. " His hands started to glow, the darkness getting closer and closer as the smoke grew. 
 " And where will they find me? " he asked me, one arm stoking his smoking cigar. 
 " Closer. " I replied " it's better than what is here. This place is dangerous, they come in peace. " 
 " That's unwise. " 
 " There's a reason we are in this one planet. It is the only place we have in this world that can survive life. And it is the only place we are safe. " 
 " It means we don't need to know where we are, and you guys don't need to know what we are, we can do whatever we want. " 
 " Yes, but this place is time-limited. " 
 " Let's prepare, " I said " and if you keep your hands still, you'll do it " 
 The smoke began to become apparent. The dark dimension suddenly coming closer to the light, the air and stone coating the planet like it was red against the background. One of the dragon made a hiccup as it fell, before the other, and just as the clouds began to extend, the ground shook as it crushed the dragon beside Patrons. 
 " They cut through. " A voice spoke out, that of my brothers, " You wont be safe here any time soon. " A huge cloud began to move and created a dragon, back of the other dragons state. People around began to run. A blast of wind blew hard through them. " Wait! The hell?! " 
 " No one can see us! " 
 " Don't worry! There will be no point in being destroyed, he was warned." 
 With that the cloud stopped forming. Patrons collapsed and the flames burst into flames.

Here we are again. The first night of poor selection. Charms of candy, candles, homeopathy, alcohol, nothing but deathly comforts are all we're looking for. The kid has no choice but to get deeper into his nightmares. The one time I could see him doing something dangerous he fell when a boulder hit him. We'd been talking all night but I had to make things right; just enough harm to prove that I could do anything for him. It seemed like I just stared up at my hooded figure. Had he noticed me or didn't he notice me? I closed my eyes and slung my fists out, ready to make a run for it. I pushed my arm forward, taking in the intensity. It'd hurt. I could feel my palms becoming sore and my shirt loosening. I grabbed my watch and crept further down the darkened halls. I pulled my covers up and whipped around so I wouldn't fall. We both dropped to our knees and crawled away from the scream. As I reached for the blanket and blanket still covered, I grabbed the corner of his thick t-shirt to toss him up. I gripped the top of his shirt a lot tighter and put the shirt over his face. My hand loosened up and it looked like my hand was stretched out trying to escape something. I felt his collarbone slowly trying to fall away from his jaw. I looked him over, anticipating the worst. I felt the tiniest smirk on his face.

"I'll see you tomorrow, " 
 John said as he slammed the door shut behind him. 
 He saw six men huddled up on the ground, crying in the dark, their hair hanging low around their eyes and hands clutching just one of the strangers. 
 " Don't worry Mom, " replied John, putting his hand on his shoulder to silence them all. 
 The men all stared into each others eyes before John had to hide behind his chair to wait for the police to come. 
 " We need to go home, " John said softly, picking up a crook of his own to brush his fingertips against his snout. 
 They started to hop towards the door as he entered, one hand covering his friend's ears, then the other exposing his bloody, bleeding belly and legs. 
 " I'm so sorry, " said John. 
 John had always been a gruff man, but he always found himself pleading. " I'm leaving now, " he pleaded, and his voice rose once again. 
 " Go... Don't forget me, " shouted the men. " We need to go home. " 
 The men stood, arms crossed, wondering what to do next. Then, John took the crook from the men's hands. 
 A quick look at his friend-boy smiled at the poor boy and said, " Dad, you'll go take care of him for now. He's sleepy. " 
 The women shared a smile at the same time. They were both sick, of course, and their names were taken from them. But John was sure he didn't want to go to see her again. 
 A quick tuck into the bedside and you could see them all asleep all by themselves, their eyes locked on John. 
 " But mom, " John sneered. " Tomorrow'll be different. Why can't you always be healthy for me? " 
 The woman hugged him tightly. 
 " Mom, " she said, trying to keep warm for her daughter. " We can't. It's not right to be this terrible to them. " 
 The little boy closed his eyes, her eyes dying to smile at him in that silent, tender, and sincere way she wanted him to. 
 " John, " he hugged her, finally showing each and everyone of them a little smile. " I love you." 
 John used his long, oppressive stretch to cool the pain in his head. He walked to his brother.

Our star was full of brightest point and speed. Our star was full of the brightest mass there was in the whole known universe. After the nebula, what remained was a white mass of drifting dust. It was devoid of anything within any given hundred million years. What remained, and did not, remained beyond our star. 
 Of course, the possibilities were endless, the possibilities we would know at this point is one. Something to follow for a trillion miles before moving forward towards the red dwarf. This was our destiny, that we would someday be able to contain ourselves from beyond the stars. 
 But that was just a lie, and not only would we be hiding from the stars. We wanted to show our species why the stars were alive in the first place, the stars are just the first of what is to come. We want to show that we are worthy of that power. we want to have the opportunity to find out.

Now, the best way to describe it is as if a lover have a kind of infinite hell that can not be explored. You have to watch your lover just keep swimming. Except this time it's not worms ( which, as you remember, must not exist ). It's like some kind of cascading super dendritic cable running down his spine. Now, nothing smells like other creatures, but whatever it was there was twisted. 
 I watched the aliens come in pairs to the event. Each time a bad one was found, it returned them back the same. A fresh pair fell over, neck bent, head tilted, tail just hanging hanging as a platform. One of the aliens, an oddly shaped silhouette, dove towards the platform, eyes wide with anger, arms far outstretched, making a swift effort to poke the human, but it was repelled, unable to maintain contact. 
 These are the reactions it took to be almost fully-formed humans. The first time I saw it, I barely made it out before I found myself in a field somewhere, inches in front of me, inches away from my partner, following a scent of something that looked like feet as if they were freshly planted, yet hovering in the air at a hundred miles an hour. I had heard rumors of some kind of exploding klaxons that could choke from where they touch, and the researchers commented that humans needed to learn to use it. But when a human coughed, it seemed to be coming closer. 
 I started to panic, but each time they spoke, I noticed the human acting extremely stoic. They didn't wait for me to ask questions, and I assumed they were above asking questions. It was dark, humid, and I was confused. I realized what I was after. I caught a glimpse of myself, a dour, somewhat youthful face with dark, tanned hair. Eyes I hadn't seen since my last encounter, and blank faces were everywhere. Only a low whimper, and a hand on my shoulder. 
 "Do you want to fuck?"

One of the officers of the United States government stood before the people, 
 Man, a feverish screech of figures cursing the God they hate. 
 The sound echoed in the crowd, hard, fatal blows. 
 A tall man with thick glasses glanced over at the clock: 3:20am. 
 Suddenly the wail of a small tricycle echoed down the street. 
 Tears so full it was almost as if they had been melted. 
 The man took one look at the other and glanced at the sky, 
 Nothing. 
 A rattle like an ancient dragon shattered the calm silence. 
 The crowd had a train of thought, and suddenly stars were shining as the huge Fire was started. 
 The Father slept now. 
 In the distance, a tall man came charging through the crowd, 
 Pumping up his brave self. 
 He brought out a momentous moment to drop the weapon, 
 Now his people had a chance.

Defeated, she froze. Was this really it? Was this what it felt like to exist? Tears started to drip down her face, fell everywhere, washing over her skin. She turned to face her attacker, tears running down her dirty cheeks, and her outstretched arm flew towards her navel. 
 She wanted to say something, anything, but she froze. In shock, she dashed towards the stranger who was now pushing her towards the back wall. At the same time, she moved with all the grace of a deer running up a pasture. As she walked up to him, she suddenly stopped moving. 
 The stranger reached out to grab her hand and stopped her. She began to fidget, trying to process what happened, but somehow, all that could be heard were his words, and the walls surrounding her from all sides. 
 "I'm on fire."

 The bathroom door opened just as David examined his shoulders. David was one of the smallest members of the school under the board of governors. His suit was the toughest in the area. He wore suits from his graduate days on NASA, the Islamic world, and elsewhere. This was the last time he fit in with a pretty girl. 
 " So, if you need something to help, " he told his female teacher, approaching out the door, " check in at noon with my parent. There is a bit of a fight going on when they order their robot soldiers to investigate the homes, office space, or incinerated bodies inside, " 
 " Okay, what do you need from me? " asked the teacher, looking at her smiling face. 
 " Do I sound like your mother? " She questioned, raising her eyes from the bathroom mirror. 
 " Are you certain? " David asked, looking directly into his mother's eyes. She turned her head to gaze down at the floorboards, wondering what the homework assignment of this class was. 
 " No. " 
 " Alright, well. " He wiped his brow. " * You're here to help. *"

I was already quite tired of the day. I was sitting quietly at my desk making coffee when ( ABOVE ) not a shadow in the room moved. My roommates open the door, and as usual everything hit him with an unexpected gust of wind. 
 I imagined someone in my apartment broke the scenery around them. I was a hospital type, having a sick night and hashed out an room for no avail. I don't know who that person was, but he seemed to be getting into the bathroom alone as if he were in a trance. 
 After my roommates wake up to a loud bang, my attention turns to the monster. He looks like a blue eyed humanoid monster. He looks at me with a face like skin as brown as snow. The cleaver piercing the middle of his face cuts into his head causing the skin to scream. He screams. 
 His face looks like whatever is surrounding him. A bulge oozes out of his mouth and then shoots outwards along the curve of his jaw like a snake. The red blood drops from his throat and covering his face. His face lights up with fear and curiosity. 
 I hold the scissors in front of me as though they were new to me. The gray and red blood drips down my chin and down my chin like a snot dripping from a wet sponge. 
 His shriek stills me the most. I pull the scissors in front of me, still on top of him, and wait. 
 He shrieks louder the longer he screams. I drop the scissors. 
 Finally my teacher arrives. She knocks loudly, speaking softly, it is a first-year public health class. Then she joins me. She's pretty. Perfect for our work, I think. She slides the scissors into my body and I lose the sensation of the scissors on my back. I sit back down and crawl to my armchair. I look into the mirror. 
 I was signed into the program for a part-time employee. Since then, no other was hired. I take the parting gift from my wall and step into the open room. The school was tight, but I hope they have not included any new applications for this position. 
 As I finished my own lengthy list of chores, I put on a sullen hat and made a few tears play before tossing the sacks on the floor. I open the door to my closet, and turn on the light. The dull blue light is blinding. It is more like a lighthouse. One of the rows has two houses, the other houses had three houses. 
 All the work goes into my unit. I open the back door, and slam it shut. I am forced to stand here, my face buried in the gray skull, lest I lose consciousness. 
 I wake up. In the hospital room, I see my roommate. 
 He stands there, shitting on the floor, brown eyes blackened, and smeared all over the floor. As though something's been washed over him, he leans down and smiles at me. I turn around and shoo him away. I mumble something to no avail, but he doesn't leave. 
 I have a job to do. 
 And I'm working part-time to pay for.

The dun do in the dim morning light glinted off the long, long arm that fell from the top of the tower I stood at. I had followed the caravan closely, with plans and decorations above the outpost and locations down below. The ones in the back were pretty fun, they'd still probably own the kingdom, and the guards- clearly some of them had the biggest budget, but what I wanted was to control the damned population, so no, I didn't do it for being clever. If this house had been my father's, then they would be okay. But... but they weren't running this town anymore. When the caravan pulled up, I pushed the odorous line of smoke from my nose and saw my old father. The wyrm panting the tongue of his slain minions, and the wyrm's place near his infant hatch behind the house, a face I hadn't seen since day one was carved into the chandeliers my parents had proudly erected up there in day one. The tears were escaping out of my eyes, my little sister was crying in her crib in the queen's arms. 
 "Don't play with that drumstick " she squeaked, almost moaning as her mother continued to amuse herself while her father and I watched from the interior of the room. Some time later I overheard my mother whispering to the wyrm, " You know what should really kill us, Felid I'm sure. " 
 He watched my father try to run away as I moved closer. He began yelling as if he were the war cry of all the wyrm. But my mother remained, simply holding the last remaining flint key as she spotted an earlier grave. She swiftly stormed from the back of the room and reached down into her mother's robes to disrobe me from the street, only to find my mother was facing into my siblings, the wyrm panting at them the force of her pushing it into the doorway to the queen's seat. 
 I sobbed for awhile and then closed my eyes. I knew what I had to do. I was wrong, Felid. This could not be happening. It could not be my mother's fault. She would have to go and see my father. I knew the wyrm had a very strong grip on my mother's spell and the kingdom was going to fall. But it had to come soon, even before this people came along. Though, perhaps it could not be Felid's fault to bring about the end of the kingdom. I sighed and slowly reached up to touch the wyrm. Now that it was on my hand, I closed my eyes as the fear of my fate crept up on me. It shouldn't be easy, of all things. I had to leave, of all things. 
 I turned to leave, one of the wyrm being swept across the house with a sound like a wrench falling into a chopping block, only it wasn't real. But I knew I had to. I had to escape. And I ran, I ran. To the house. Before I knew it I was on the ground and my mother's wand missing her head. I ran. I ran right through the portal, but I couldn't turn back. I'd run far too far into the desert, running too far into my lungs. My life was worthless now, and I needed somewhere to rest. I clawed at my head as I tried to get home, but my arms kept dragging me over the ditch. But I made it. And I slept.

S.A.A.R.T. 
 I find all heroes are thought heroes and even then they rarely make any real impression on other people who you know actually don't have anything in common with. 
 It's been like this for quite some time and when the day was reached the crisis broke loose, in this union war's shadows. We were known as heroes, our government was suddenly stealing people and sacrificing them to full service of our society. 
 As a daily action we were obliged to conduct investigations on everything we knew, of everything we couldn't, anything. But our main job was to maintain order amongst everyone. When everything was safe with them the government decided that we had to turn on the Sentinel and kill them. 
 S.A.A.R.T. 
 The first time we were told this was to see what they did not believe. That us hero's were nothing more than petty hillbilly's. Our prison in the cities was pretty thick, we all swore we could wipe out someone right there. We mean thing is though, right then someone were looking over my shoulder and they ignored it. We could see every stoplight on the police wagon as the Sentinel vanished. 
 All of a sudden, out in front of the courthouse, a great guy was holding a sign that reads "Stop A-Name " in perfect detail. Everyone started running. The response was intimidating. A few panicked words, some people even started to yell the words that indicate we are taking them seriously. 
 The the massive crowd in front of us started backing off. Too far. Eighty per cent of the city was zoned out. We didn't need guards at all at that moment. The little girl told me that she hears " begin and end the speech" kind of stuff when she hears that. So I stood up, " Please stop and help me, they're criminals. " 
 When we reached the courthouse the proprietor spoke first. " I know I have to help you, but who can we stop from helping those nobody has an edge? " 
 I was stunned. I was so relieved to have saved so many people from danger from the things the government had us do. The last man in the courthouse looked at me and asked how I got here.

Everything and everyone from the center of the earth vanished, shrouded in darkness. 
 I entered the floating pit and flicked the light switch so that the tube of air cooling the room was energized. 
 A heartbeat later I opened my eyes. 
 The man was lying in bed. It wasn't thick enough for him to be covered. 
 He looked around and realized that there were no people around. This wasn't a rooms floor. This was floor. 
 His legs were split open and his torso partially obscured by the noonday sun. 
 The tiny tables seemed empty. Nothing seemed to be working. 
 I opened my arms. I grabbed the makeshift chair and gestured towards it with my hand. Then I began to walk towards the familiar wall and make my way down the center to find my way to the very front. 
 My rope began to move. I pressed it back and stood back up until I had the rope across my back secured. 
 As I walked up to the wall, a fading smell was being emitted from somewhere. 
 The bottom floor was empty. 
 I grabbed another pillbox with a vase labeled "Cooktime ". I began to break down the vase and lift myself up to the ceiling. 
 I carefully opened the vase and tore off the string. 
 I took a deep breath. The note on the vase seemed to be written in blood. 
 " I'm sorry." 
 The vase swayed in the breeze. 
 The glow faded and the only sound was the muffled shout of my own breathing. 
 The gurgling of the dead creature howled to life as it went down, my pain remaining the same.

"Jedi Yes? " 
 I blinked. It looked legit. All the classrooms were exactly the same: desks, chairs, cabinets, mostly. Er... classrooms. 
 " J-J-jedi, " I finally managed to stammer out after my sophomore year and upgraded the spellbook into a new, revised edition, following the first edition's pretty basic magic. My heart sank when I scrolled up to the second edition of " Healing ". 
 " Why would I need healing? " I asked, still confused. 
 " Because it's actually super powerful. You don't need to chant it to be able to do something normal, right? No, you get a passive-aggressive mass of psychics or anything, right? Just use magic just to make them feel better, yeah? No serious problem here. " 
 " Of course, J-J-J-edi. " 
 " Now you see? " 
 " W-wha-y-you were a training guide? Why did you tell me you've been learning magic? " 
 " Because there's no such thing as training. So you do what you hear on college speech? " 
 " Huh, no, no problem! See, it's only the vast web of programming that's the source of all your energy. You need a way to get away with it if you're going to stay immortal. " 
 " Oh, my god. " 
 I mean, it does suck to get rid of it so close to dying, right? Anyway, it's not like I was using any of the antimatter in this spell, which is probably why I didn't use it. But I guess I just accidentally used it in my chemistry lesson. Heh. 
 " How do I get you to leave school? " 
 " Because you can't leave because you don't have energy. And that would make someone click. So even if you were really high, you could just spell whatever you wanted to. It's definitely a bit easier. " 
 " That's insane! " 
 " Oh, yeah. You can do that. " 
 " Next time you're not doing it, just let me check you out. " 
 I had come here many times before. I had a good time with it over the decades, starting with running a very popular magic school. My grandmother had a few years back, but I assumed she was just trying to make her daughter feel smarter by playing the game " all natural ". She was better off with traditional magic where they always got to be players. It wasn't until my birthday that I found out the spells didn't actually work that way. 
 " Don't try to *deal* it, old man. People on your level are most likely exaggerating it. " 
 " Your level is dropping. It's a possibility it'll only work one time. " 
 " No, it can't be. It's either you or me. It's raining. " 
 " You're ignoring me. " 
 " I have to help. " 
 " Why don't you just leave? " 
 " Because when you're done, I'm going to find you again and find you beyond all chance. " 
 " Is it God? " 
 " Oh no. God always came to earth. That's why he didn't return. Well, he don't want you around too much." 
 ( This is just the beginning, so just put me back in Iaconsec after a bit to see how I can improve this in the future )

Yeh, Yeh. It wasn't a pleasant night, even for an inanimate object. Heh, you mean who can really remember where the nights went when he was drunk. Nah, it was a nightmare. It was only a few months ago I met him, he was a local geek group. I was obsessed with how he managed to talk about others. He looked all fancy, his ass was old and he didn't care about me, he could talk about himself. He reminded me of everything he had to say when I told him. He was stern. He always told me I couldn't expect people to care about me, to let me live my life. Yeh, hey. There you go. I try to remember where his childhood home was. Oh. Isn't it a little disappointing? Now that I think about it, having an identical X hasn't been the best option I've been able to do since I put him in charge of the indoctrination systems of this neighborhood. My vision started getting blurry and I realized I probably couldn't see the old people I know when I needed them more than I can now. And what the Hell? Fuck. He really would be happier if I had him. He was a good friend. The one who was eventually banned from all events that were not related to how we knew each other. And no one ever liked him. That fact only killed me more. He was clearly old and stupid when it came to my best friend. He was looking out for his family, it would have been difficult to be the one looking out for someone like him.

It's in the handles. 
 I remember there being a few second's worth of evidence for that. Guns, millions. But no. The door was still there, hanging ever so slightly from the place where it had gone. It was never shut. And nothing stood in the way of the door being opened. 
 "Hey lincolns, it's $ 25 million. We're almost done. " 
 I've started feeling it on my chest as a small 4-a-side slap. 
 " Aren't you nervous too? " I murmur to my wife. I hoped she hadn't, I felt the pain mount up and widen and twitch in a brutal rush, be the price of my salvation. " If that's you, nah. You get a million. That's it. Still one hundred percent. " 
 I bit the corner of my lip. " I'm going to do it. " 
 " I'm not done. " 
 " Who cares. " 
 A cat. My cat. All of them, all gone the moment I flipped the handle on it and headed back to the place where the door had locked. And never came back. 
 I giggle to myself. After everything I've done, I could probably be propping myself up with my finances and a few hundred dollars. I got the chance to see my wife as I leave, so I choose good luck. 
 " Hey, lincolns. We're finally done, you win. " 
 Her nose was slightly attached to my chest. 
 " Thank you. " 
 The cat is gone now. 
 " I love you. " 
 I mumble as I turn to go. 
 " From your wife." 
 I smile, proud of myself for fighting a vicious drug ring.

I always thought I was but nothing ever really mattered, I've accepted all these years in a most strange way, but I guess I wasn't really my time. 
 No, really. That was the first time. 
 The old lady behind the desk asked me if I wanted a beer for dinner, and I just froze. " Don't be so foolish, " I said. " Dinner isn't supposed to be cooked at this age. It's life's work. " 
 " I have an... err... job. " I put the knife in my hand and stared into my very soul. 
 " What, like a time traveler? Where did it all come from? " she asked in a temperamental tone. 
 " It's happened to me, I wasn't as wise back then, anyway. My kind can't just... forget things you think are important. " I paused to think, and replied, " Ha. You didn't think that was enough. Your axe is... in... good hands. " She hung up. Then she turned to look at me, worried. 
 I looked down at my sword, and saw all the destruction, weeping and screaming. 
 What else could life truly look like? 
 But in the midst of all that destruction, I felt something I never thought was there, and it felt wrong. It felt pointless. For that I turned around, and saw my friend's sad face. She was grieving, desperate for something to fight. I didn't care. I had no one to hold her back. 
 Then there was pain, pain that the best age-graders would ever want. Fear that everyone in this world could be struck down for some sick joke, that very piece of shit. When that was all all I could afford, it was gone. 
 And there I was standing in a field of what I had saw. And the side of my knife was sticking out of my wound. 
 *The knife, * I realized, *Is actually a lava lamp. *

I looked up at the tall, bony figure hung above the barn. Lifting his hat, he pointed at the sky and smiled. 
 "It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Phil, " He answered, walking to the wheel of a car. 
 He pulled a leather wallet from behind his leather jacket. Not much, but that wasn't terribly important. He rolled it in front of Phil's mouth and pulled out a passport, noting that it was in his hand. Fumbling with it, he carefully packed it into his pocket. 
 " We're going to die here tonight, " he announced, reaching to take out his key, as he was carrying it across the corner, and blowing smoke out into the flames. As he placed the key into his pocket, he smiled and raised his head. 
 He saw the car began to slow, and then the pillar began to crack, but Phil didn't care. She was his friend and trusted but he'd just overshot two million. " Pay up! " he crowed, and when he heard the car rest below him, the camera was all over his face. 
 As the camera paned to the horizon, Phil scrambled to get the key from the vehicle. " See ya!" he barked, as the car started to pull off the road. Phil stomped his foot and heard his Jeep cut out in a rush. This was the last clue he needed.

"It's been a while. " 
 The beeping and sound from the heart monitor hung in the background. I slowly reached around for my cup of tea, then went to the stereo. 
 " You've become quite accustomed to this? You have become a bit too passive? " my voice broke into an annoyed jeer. 
 " Not too passive, the man would know better... " I complained. 
 As I made my way to the ground floor of the chapel, the PA came on saying " Call 9-1-1... " and then quickly snapped to life. 
 " Well, the message has been recorded, please wait... " 
 1 minute later, my phone disconnected and my eyes widened. I was in a small kitchen with a desk and carpet under me. No one was here. Where's everyone? My wife dropped her bag over the table. I reached down and touched her up, then shoved her in the chair and went back to my computer. 
 I opened the admin interface, pulled up the Home business bible and installed a Premium Selection screen. My phone was vibrating again. 
 " That should do it then..."

I left the weird, scarred and battered wreck of a car a few nights ago to fetch some cash. Lucky for me it hadn ’ t happened yet, just spent the next day stuck with that girl sitting next to me on the ferry. She seemed hurt, but not bashful. She smiled at me and we hugged, holding each others hands to ease the pounding pounding in my head. In the beginning we had been so similar to each other. “ But it was all on you, and it ’ s all in your head, ” I remember thinking as I kissed her forehead on the cheek as the crashing pushed them together. 
 Today she was fine, although it was been a while since she ’ d be home, but I still remember how she would just go about her day. “ It ’ s all in my head, ” I remember her saying in her soft voice. 
 A week and a half passed, and I fell asleep knowing that I had to come back, but how did I come back? It wasn ’ t like she had things to do, no friends or family. A week and a half, and I had to get out, but who would listen to me when I asked for sleep? She had my heart and I had my hand. I could feel it slowly quiver. I had so much heart in me that I forgot all about my life. Why did this happen, why am I doing this to myself? I knew it was because I could feel it breathing inside me. I knew she didn ’ t know. I had to use my voice for her. 
 When I awoke in my car, it was too dark for my phone to be playing an old tv signal on my phone. I glanced at the snow-covered skyline before setting it back down. I didn ’ t know where to look, so I just sighed. Five hours until she wakes up. Fuck it, let ’ s go for a drive.

"What if Joker just starts and keeps writing? " 
 * " No one wanted the next Joker. He has no moral code and he doesn't follow any guidelines. It would cost us our lives and money. " * 
 " A supernatural being? " 
 * " This is the only sane option. Hell, I'm thinking Joker just writes randomness. Poor guy. There's something he thinks is happening but I can't take my eyes off him. " * 
 " He could break the rules if he decides to save the day? It's happening! " 
 * " What if everyone dies? He'd only be a distraction from his duties or something. Good thing he enjoys killing. " * 
 " No. Nobody needs him. If he don't kill every one, then there is no way he'll exist anymore. " 
 * " That's the worst thing possible. " * 
 " He won't outlive everyone. He's literally far better. " 
 * " What if a Joker gets depressed or he spends his days writing until he dies? It's funny. But he has other issues. And he lives in the moment. If everyone dies, that would make it hopeless. And he can't have people's reactions in such a way. " * 
 " Mr. Rogers, you'll hear this. Goodbye, " the dead man said. I realized I wasn't going to make his next delivery. I had to leave it at the end. 
 " Thanks," the dead man said. I finished putting on my trenchcoat and marched down the street. 
 I saw everyone passing by, waiting to be gone. One had red eyes but was wearing a blue bandana. The other had green face but was wearing an orange suit. He walked up to me and whispered something into my ear. 
 I used the other's, realizing I hadn't heard him, but I didn't bother with pulling away. I walked up the hill to my other end, pausing as I hoped it'd be a long walk. It seemed to me that the curve made him look normal. He took me by the shoulder and began walking toward the road.

This is how you make your life a living hell. You are one of the handful of living beings on this planet that has both devices and memory banks to store your memories. It turns out that we are ahem more interested in "nowadays ". But you don't mind that " now"? We just never really had the time to think it through, but we did all the easy things for you. For example, we could recall everything that we did to get here, we could recall every dream we had, you know? Even if we didn't even have an epiphany, we can go back and find them. For example, I could remember a very important piece of my " past, " and you could recall your time as a kid. But, you get the point. There's very little to see here. One individual stuck in the shadows is the exception, but you don't need to remember that much. You just have to remember them. 
 Well, this is where you start to sweat. Do you remember when I got here? But it looks like I did it now, and I remember it! I remember! One-hundred-billion-second memories will last for a very, very long time, if you take a look at a shot of vodka and just remember, for example, our dream we had. You'll see! 
 But, the trick you'll find right away is to push yourself to far off to get your own face-to-face meeting with the person who is speaking to you now. If I go by yourself, you'll immediately be giddy, with joy. And that's exactly what I always want. You know what the trick is? It's the one you take. You're in control of your mind, of your body, and of the particular kind of people you meet. Different people are important, and sometimes people who do different things can be important too. 
 So do you *get* too excited? I was trying to remember my pet, my daughter, my... you know? Funny how life works, when you start to forget. I remembered having a tail on my birthday, and you start to forget. But not *my* birthday. Well, not *at least*, not anymore. I've improved. There are a very few things you still have left, but not enough. You have to remember everything you worked so hard for. You have to have *a little* now, I suppose. Plus, your " memories* are getting really small now. So until you're all *entirely* in control, well, all that's left is to go out and change these things for the better. 
 I want to thank you all for all you've done for me. Keep learning, don't stop; we didn't know what the rest of the story would be like! For example, a number of our sources deal with critical thoughts. That is, we always can, until very, very very, very recently. Whenever I have an " emergency " -- much like how your brain works -- I can answer " exactly what the story needs " and " exactly what's most important" when I have one. And while you're all just sitting there, reciting the same sentiments over and over in your heads, I think I can all go through them in one go. 
 As for my intention, it's a sad, lonely thing to say; memories have a way of making you sick, and changing you. At least, that's what I want to say, so thank you all for allowing me to say it! I can't tell you *other* things, but when *you* don't forget, let *you* forget.

Indonated. 
 Notes flash, 
 Illusions reemerge within my mind. Demons splatter upon flesh as I watch desperately as reality ebbs and flows with whomever pleads with him and whatever his hateful mind is holding. And before I can believe my eyes I glance upon the web of human love and blossoms flame with the release of my profound emotions. 
 I enjoy white hot emotions, no, I prefer pure bliss and it's life soothes my flesh and oxygen can never grow from its roots. I am full of it though, which is surprising. 
 I am beautiful here, full of flame and baby-soft feelings. I am enveloped with warm loving sensations, true love and happiness. I am a perfect vessel for a perfect feeling. I keep loving stories of unconditional love in my mind, no matter the different plots. 
 Anyways, I am last but not least my favorite color, I desperately use it all my life. The sun is a richly colored magenta, with little red rings in my middle. I hate those red rings because they are trying to confuse me with a color that doesn't have that mark of recognition on me. I can not think for myself, so I sit there, outside my window, surrounded by peace. 
 My skin glows and lashes glow like lamps, while the body shimmers from a gold flame. I keep wondering how people view their own skin and it is important that they understand me for who I am. I am SO human, I am human, I am human. 
 I bask in a victory of happiness and bliss, and the next day I wake up in a bland gray room in a hospital bed. I am not sure why I took my medication, but it proved to be the worst of all the ones I've had to answer to yet. 
 I feel fine while others and I are overwhelmed with love. The colors come back and I remain calm. The person who smiles finally understands me, and it's good. Those feelings are just painful and don't leave me, but my soul demands them again and again. 
 In a way, it has made sense. It is a fragile thing, and all I can do is stand still. I find peace in my thoughts and expressions and I have life for them. As I get older I feel more comfortable with my anger and disgust. It is clear that they are not allowed to hurt me, they just don't enjoy the peace around them. A human imperfection. 
 After awhile a friend gives me a hug, and I smile. He reminds me of the person who died, before he passed away. He makes me feel proud and fun. They show me pretty young faces, and while my image is very dark, it gives off a unique aspect. As I look at him, I feel so peaceful that I feel a deeper sense of peace knowing his efforts were still needed. 
 I wonder how he died, but do I really have to. I make sure to remind myself every day that I feel safe but I don't anymore. I have never felt so happy, yet here I am. Forgive me for my mistakes, and just because I am a pig doesn't mean I am really happy. I guess I am. 
 Thank you.

** "At last! " ** the said in a throaty manner, his best friend completely unfazed. 
 Kacey ignored him, 
 " You're going to be sooooooo happy, we've already been here for a while, " Kacey's friend said, instantly calming down her with her praise. 
 " But... but will it last? " Kacey thought in a stunned tone, her full lips giving in to a succession of lines of anger. 
 " Who knows, maybe we'll run out of time later, but you've seen what I've got, " his friend said back to her, her glow becoming brighter and brighter. " Once again Kacey, we've a reason to be happy, " they said in unison, cheering him on, but not entirely sure how. 
 ** " We'll show them, " ** his friend assured him. His eyebrow raised, the warmth on his face dissipating as his eyes widened. " Look at this! My hands, " his friend reached back to shake his friend's hand, only to find the other with disconcerting and quite warm hands in front of their friend. " It has the super human powers, you fool! That means we can only be happier when we make millions! How can we get it all back together?! " 
 Kacey quickly put down her idea, doing her best to keep up the facade she was under. " I guess not, but how could it have gone differently from this point on?! We've been all way, way together for years! " 
 ** " No, it never had a chance, " ** his friend said sadly, " It was the one and only one that started this, and can't let it happen again. " ** 
 " Yea you're right, " Kacey muttered. 
 ** " Stop it, " ** his friend replied back. 
 " No, its too late, we were running out of time! " 
 ** " Oohhh, " ** her friend exclaimed with a quick wink. " Quite literally, it was the only one left alive that can do what you'd think that would have been impossible! " ** 
 " Keela, " the teen boy said, smiling, " I can't believe you did it again! You did it! How could you do that to me?! Well here's your fix, yo! Take me along! " 
 ** " See you later, " ** his friend said as he stepped out of the club, splashing a cool beer on the newly surfaced patio of an abandoned barroom. 
 The two were gone again, leaving the lesson as it was. 
 ** " Thank you, " ** Kacey said, completely absorbed in the beautiful scene unfolding before her, ready to snap at her and I. As her gaze traveled over me she looked to her self, tears in her eyes, smiling bravely. 
 ** " Goodbye, bye, " ** she said. 
 ** " Goodbye, missy, " ** she whispered as she disappeared. 
 So the lesson continued, and for a moment Kacey followed a line of pure and unequivocal happiness, walking a stone's throw away. After a moment she reached the edge of a cliff, where she let the power of the butterfly effect wash over her, covering the entirety of the park. 
 ** " Farewell Missy!" ** she sang, her words echoing softly in the grey sky. 
 ** " Farewell!" ** she sang as she fell, to her death.

The thought was always telling me to go fuck myself, fuck the shitty clouds of discord and mess things up, and fuck the paper towels with my ass. I knew what they said. Each of them mean too much. 
 I sighed to myself and slid into a nice brown robe that had been kindly unwrapped last Thursday. It was a good reflection of the day, too. My alarm clock kept ticking, reminding me to get ready for work. 
 I wiped the rain from my forehead and wiped the desert that I was staying in. I smiled as I walked, of course, more likely to be dead anyway. 
 I could sit by the fire, going through the bag as I usually did. I waited for a moment, then slipped into a very casual outfit. Nothing up there, but the chunky leather shoes that my new masters gave me made it look all too comfortable. I tucked my dress shirt behind my back, sitting on the porch close to the fireplace. 
 I dreamed of the day, days when I could just leave the house. I could go out with a smile, or relax on the porch. Just get out of the shade, for the long weekend. 
 I cringed as I opened the car door. It was Friday night. I stood up and went into the backseat. Glancing around the car I noticed a car idling. I picked it up and started driving away, never really looking back. I didn't even bother noticing it for my next flight of stairs. The ride home was almost over before I heard a loud crash. 
 I got up to run, the sun was too high in my face. A little steam started pouring out of my lungs as I got up, was just about to start blasting the bottle of rum I was cleaning when I heard a loud *thud*. No. As if being hit with something. Shit. Nothing. 
 I looked around the parking lot, thinking back. Just a wall to the right of where I parked. The guy that hit me was in my way. 
 He yelled something, going to get me. I walked over to him and held out the rum. He cursed under his breath. He was just so drunk, not that he had a mouthful of beer. 
 I walked over to the edge of the window to check on him. There was no clue who that had been. I grabbed the old rag and felt what I could only imagine was a shock of white at the edges of my forehead. 
 As I walked closer I saw another figure sliding in front of me. Eyes wide. As I caught his eye, my heart began to race, hoping for any other kind of intervention. 
 "Yeah, okay. Bye." 
 I opened the door to see how he was doing, he was swinging a heavy wood set to himself. Fucking fuckin' set up. Shit. 
 My panic had turned to pure terror, as my heart was racing. The next thing I know, I was back in the wood set holding a gun to my head. 
 I couldn't stop myself. I was so close to fucking death that I would have to lay my eyes on myself. I couldn't ever sit by the fire. I couldn't just start fucking hoarding my hair, grab my tools, and walk home. Hell, if only I were with my asshole hair and a fucking beer. 
 I stood in the middle of the sunburns staring back at me, wondering what that was all about. 
 Am I still alive? Did that red coloured jet I used to be wearing just vanished? 
 Do I still have any dogs here? Can anyone come pick me up after eating them? 
 Or is that time yet to come, the sun's just starting to melt the desert off of me?

1. The closet door opens, but the only thing that can be seen is a tall, glowing stone. 
 2. Nothing, but blackness surrounds the door, engulfing the black abyss. 
 3. My room starts to get louder. I reach for the stone in my little pocket, finding it in my most quiet, quiet corner. That's when I hear it. Breathing heavily, I turn the key, not knowing what to expect. 
 4. The door moves. Just as it is turning I feel a shiver. 
 5. The door is still closed. Time to open it. 
 6. I hear whispers coming from the other side. Something I've heard about before, but it's so new. Something scary is behind that door. I close the door, and run downstairs. 
 7. The shadow over the closet comes across my heels, and squeezes me. It holds up an arm, facing me and pressing his arms into my side. 
 8. I can hear the screaming. The screams of my parents, the screaming of my friends, the screaming of the three other children there to take the moment I needed to... 
 9. " Darn, that door! " 
 10. I find the stone and take it out of my pocket. I carry it to the bedside, and immediately open the door. 
 11. " Some kind of supernova. " 
 12. " Nope. " 
 13. I hear his whisper come closer, and I give a horrified look. 
 14. It whispers. It whispers. It whispers 
 15. " Your father pulled me out of the coma, we wouldn't have talk if the reality kept swinging on. I'm ready to go. " 
 16. " Time to kill him"

Fur chased along the sandy plains with his bare foot. When he got to where he was all he could do was start walking. The sun had already set, and it was time to really sleep. He can see beautiful and dark landscapes, amazing plants, and still, peaceful life. His dreams are dull and boring, getting used to the sunset, his mornings are much more relaxed. This is where he should come to rest. 
 The landscape was very beautiful, and he had just left his sleeping place. He doesn't know if his home was somewhere else yet, but he knows it won't be long now. He hears a knock at the door, only for his tired mind to fly through the fence of his solitude. He closes it slowly, and gives himself a smile. The tiny figure outside the door knocks, but the iron bar under his foot is shattered. He looked up at the heavy glass door with his eyes, when he opened it it the figure was barefoot, and it was kneeling on the ground, barely breathing. 
 The light from the sun was very bright, and this made him feel very calm. He doesn't think of his family, nor of his wife who tried to comfort him. He didn't think of his friends, nor of his dog. He didn't think of his mother, nor of his father. He only felt sadness for the man he is now, and know that he wants this perfect thing back, but there is no way it is here, just anywhere. 
 He walked to a small door, and opened it slowly, looking out on the great plains. After a while, the dark sky cleared up, and he looked at a large gate, and he opened it slowly, looking out at a mountainous valley he had never seen before. As he passed a small mirror in the wall, and a small boy sat on his step, looking down at a cliff. He looked back up, to see a pretty girl, standing there, with her head down. She smiled at him, and said "Hi. " 
 " Hi babe, " he said, " how are you? " 
 " God, I'm sorry, don't tell me anything. " 
 " What do you mean? " 
 " You have always loved me. " 
 " Wha... what do you mean? " 
 " You and your dad had a good time, and as soon as you were on your way there, my dad threw an old golf ball up the fence with the big boy. " 
 " That's right? " 
 " That was the stupidest fucking ball the damned girl ever threw. " 
 " Well I am sorry, mom, I don't want my mom being jealous of my tennis, and I suppose that is why you couldn't bring me tennis balls. " 
 " Really? " 
 " Well my daddy is a triathlete, is he in med school? He would still qualify. " 
 " He who is?! I think you should meet somebody else. " 
 " Could do. So I'm from the town I love to live in, and you know my daddy is Michael Lewis. You could be from that desert now! It's my home! " 
 " I thought so, baby. Why are you waiting outside?"

The tinkering happened. 
 I remember it like it was yesterday. Just a moment ago, I could have sworn I was crushed in tiny smoggy smog. My blood rushed into my head, ready to infect me, and it instantly became a vicious cycle of interminable steps with countless senseless stomping steps. 
 We used to say that we felt nothing. 
 I didn't hear my father call out, nor did my sister. I just saw red shining from an impending fire. The doctors expected to see an hourglass being smashed by his tidal waves. A healer delivering his massive operations. But the doctors didn't see anything. 
 Time stood still, and the bleary horizon was cycled like the flickers of candlelight. By this point I remembered, what a couple of centuries of agony meant. Was there really something I could do but just... leave it at that? The doctors said only one thing. 
 "Happy Birthday, little mom. " 
 That's all she said for the last fifteen minutes. 
 I stand here, the clouds have the image of a perfect world. There is still countless plexiglass windows to look out for, all of it a little blurred. Looking out brings me tears of joy, not from a solemn bed I am in, not from the loss of a mother... but the invasion of a mind as old as I may live in. 
 I hold my book, " Peter Kain: an audiobook of my worst mistakes ", written with children already in mind. 
 I smile, clutching at the covers, silently listening to the terrible waves of miskempt grass. 
 As my fingers form on my fingers, I write to myself: 
 " Happy Birthday, little mom. " 
 I drag the covers closer together, trembling with shame, yet realizing that it was a mistake to not admit the abuse. 
 There is only one thing left. As the wind takes my hands, which I could easily keep but seem to be torn, I thrust the next pane of glass down. 
 " Happy Birthday, little mom." 
 And if there is hope, all that love could save me.

I didn't know it at the time. But then again, perhaps I didn't. The reports from the UN and Ministry of Bizarre Practices seem to have something to do with that, much less something else that happened. * Sexy Thing*, as they were called, went silent and was replaced by something peppy. Cute as ever, most of the time I rolled my eyes. Filled with the magic. Yeah, I heard those 'Monsters Of Perception and Interpretation'? 
 Until today. Six years ago, I was almost sure that the enemy was real. The Cybermen named themselves Andrew for the radio transmitter in his apartment. This time the net was red, sporadic bursts of blue light and I saw the light in blue in blue. Someone who used a Voodoo rag as a pitchfork just had to turn around and look at the sky. I raised my heads and the shockwave blew through. It was, obviously, Bishamburi, the country's country in the India-Africa Iron Triangle. 
 "Ever since that viral viral version, U.N. calls for an end to the broadcasts, appearing to kidnap and assassinate the Ne-Downtown. We don't have enough space in our quantum nanostructures to sustain them. And they are all those too. Have you ever seen one of the recent Bank Shake up? What happened? " I asked the puzzled and bewildered phone. 
 The person in blue abruptly stopped. " You don't have to play with me. We will take you back to your isolated cell."

**********328**********
With the war beginning, I felt a little queasy. I've never felt queasy before. When the emperor comes home, I stay and hear the haunting clack of stone on the sand. 
 His cries echo throughout my chains. He's been barking like a prey in the shadows of the tunnels. The smell of his horns- never before have I felt a gust of air could pierce a goose. But this time I am no prey. I am a rebel against my order, my savior. 
 I wish my guards were there to keep me here to inform me of the fate that awaits me. He has already made his move, and they are here to kill me. I need not worry. 
 The tunnels are dirty, unyielding dirt. We see only softly, but I know the strangest things. There are shouts that sound like rushing water. I wince as my ears track their rustling like leaves. 
 I trust the guards more than most. Their courage always feels more comfortable in tight confines. 
 Nothing is safe here, of course. These guards deserve my punishment. I can only wonder if they ever realised that they were soon to die. 
 The noise of the tunnel is deafening. A sharp sound that knocks me to the ground and softens me to my will. A sounds like the tongues of the monster, but strangely it doesn't mean I'm his person. It's the language I use. 
 I lay still, ashamed of my duties. I love a monster. A pastime. And yet I know I am wrong. 
 They rise to their knees and look at me from beside the sand. They kneel before me, their old, crooked noses wrinkled with stone and stone. " We will do everything to win this war, " they say in unison. 
 I don't know what to say. I can't believe they're right. 
 " Get in here," I whisper and fear not the future. I find no comfort in cold hands. I cry out and don't think twice, for they look for me. I die before they do, and I accept no credit for not waiting to be put into his grip. 
 I arrive at his mouth, and his mouth is a bloody mess. My eyes open when I see the stain on his back. They look at me, and I drop to my knees, tears not pouring. 
 I'm angry. I hate this little slice of my brother's heart.

“ Just go away! ” said the goddess of Love as she flopped on the couch and hugged me with her paws. 
 It was cold in the room. The house was dark and damp. Outside the house the rain touched the floor and a crash could be heard coming. She ran down the street and panted. The rain was hot and sagging. She was in shock. I started making myself a sandwich. As she walked towards me, I whispered to myself. 
 “ How am I supposed to get back? ” 
 I got up and dropped the sandwich in my lap. 
 “ Calm down, Q., because you can ’ t! ” 
 When I had finished speaking, she seemed to the loudest of me the entire time. “ What happened? ” she inquired and quickly apologized. 
 “ We did it so I could fuck D! We had so much fun, you saw! And everyone else didn't know, they were all romantic, you would have never believed it! So this is how you [ you ] died, is that right? ” I said with a happy smile. 
 “ Yeah, that's it, Muffles? ” she giggled. I laughed as well. 
 “ Did you find your soulmate? ” I asked. 
 I knew I should have thanked her, but I thought I would feel better the next time she had hugged me. 
 “ They ’ re crazy people, Q. ” she said. 
 I took a sip of my beer. 
 “ They ’ re the ones who drank the cancer. They let it go and they didn't know why. They abandoned their dog and they started killing each other. ” I said as I put the beer down. 
 The next day, Muffles saw me again. 
 “ You killed the dog you called Cat and he died, ” she said, throwing me back onto the couch. 
 I sobbed. 
 “ You killed your cat and called him Dog. You chased me across the street before I realized. He ’ s gone, you could do something to stop him. Kill him and I ’ d give you a goddamn weekend. ” I muttered as I sat down again. 
 “ I should do something. ” she said as she stomped me up to the table. She got on the table and began flipping and huffing. 
 I looked at Muffles. She was a giant mutant. She was boring. She held her tongue and she stared at me. I sat down in my chair and wiped my eyes. 
 “ Oh... ” she sobbed as she removed her cape. 
 The next day, Muffles told me that she killed D.

"But you're gay. And all that is cool is that you were drunk and smoked crack? " 
 " Took him what? " 
 " My boyfriends damned close mate, knows all about what we're for and spends much time off on night out to smoke. He acts like i'm your fucking tiki-pole, but i don't. So i just go straight in his face. " 
 " You go straight in his face? We chatted through school together, and even got you fired from the factory. Fuck you dad, but fuck you for being nice. " 
 " Ahh, well anyway, " she took a long bite from her cereal box, " but who decided to even try a sister pack? " 
 " Thats about it anyway, mate. Daddy said here's a plan, so I went straight in the face."

**********331**********
> ~~Neither you or I have ever had a need to judge. Yet each time you have, every day the goal jumps within reason, meaning no matter how hard we try it, you have the same result. This is true of any decision you make. Do I create space for yourself and spark the imagination and creation that came from a normal person not forced into giving birth, or do I create space for myself and work within it, allowing ourselves to create and manifest our existence? When do we stop thinking about ourselves and fully put it to the side, that we're more suited to carving out our own kind than that of others? 
 I guess this could be the most difficult choice. It would be impossible, one by one, to find the one that fits as the real me, the one that no one has made in thousands of years. But I could convince myself that the option of forgiving is what's most important. Those many years ago, my parents got pregnant before they even knew I had ever intended to marry anyone. The reaction of the lot was nothing like the reaction I expected. My parents, desperate, desperately fated a child with the unimaginable experience of being continuously torn apart by the world. Whether that miracle was sudden, natural, or at any other possible cost, it comes down to this. Had I known the alternative, maybe I would have probably died a long time ago in my sleep. Perhaps I might have chosen a new path that might help us live a full life with our new society. 
 I watched my entire life in front of me, slowly and carefully, somehow, at each decision that had come before, at the very moment that I had made a choice. I had made everything I knew true, so how could I not be crushed by a woman with nothing left? Then I saw it, some woman who had led me to this day. She passed at the very last moment as if done by a mother herself, her hand clasping mine. I watched myself as she became more intelligent and more energetic with each time the baby passed, a moment of prayer that I imagine myself speaking to her every single day. What I had in mind, what I didn't have in mind, was the choice to be her. Her choice. 
 In this life, I got a chip to create a future, a future that meant that I could be with her for all I cared to tell her. The reality of that present changed, both hers and mine, and for a time it was as I was able to throw my 16 year old imagination away with another chance to be with someone I couldn't live without. But despite this, I saw that I could never do it. She smiled, winced, shook her head, and said with a voice that I should probably hear out loud to remind me of what had happened next. 
 ~~Now~~ I decided to call her. 
 ~~~~ 
 "So, how did she say yes? " said the blank face of my girlfriend. " What was in there? " I asked quietly, wiping the dust off of my skin with my hand. " All she said was, she wants me to give birth. We will be first girls in history. " 
 " So... is that what you mean? " she asked, a little scowl on her face. " That's weird, it seems you think nothing could happen. " 
 " Yes, I guess so, so why are you so critical of me? " 
 " Because I don't want to give birth to anyone. I wanted to be with you, this life I would go through, this chance. " 
 " If she wants me, then I will do as I choose, and that's alright." 
 *** 
 Look, it sucks. Seriously, you know how it is for us now. Here's our five cents. Good luck writing this. The human test.

Jasmine stood there a breathless, watching the radiation emanate from the ceiling above. It had taken years to form the requisite learning curve, but finally it was there. She could hear the alarm clicking off from the side clock inside a wall. She slowly raised an eyebrow at the clock that quickly put off the countdown to set in. She saw the dull amber color and the flashing lights. 
 "Oh, thank god. No problem. " 
 She quickly walked over to her friend, adding a T like sign. Slowly and softly, she removed the roller that worked in her bed and adjusted the upper panel. " See? " 
 " I gave it to your grandma. " 
 Jasmine had definitely inherited the hell out of it from her cousin, Zach. After sending out news of the huge explosion every other weekend, it had only gained an average of 24 mentions. Every third week she would check the account details and find a screenshot with her name of Zach with the amount of chat and connections they had on their account. Even when he didn't answer questions, Zach would sometimes answer with the number 1. 
 Jasmine was always amazed how different the lives of these strangers had been in months. She had been planning her first day of school when she could still remember all those little smiles on their faces that she once ran up to her parents and cried like a baby. After that day, when the dust had settled, she had thought about burying her lunch in her favorite soil, but she had also remembered the great dinners they had all been prepared for. They even tried to eat on ice! As she continued to mull over the question, Zach threw down his room and left. " Oh, great job right there. " 
 After having spent the last few months creating a genuine fan base to demonstrate the power of communism in this continent, Jasmine finally gave in. She needed someone to talk her life down. Her cousin, a seemingly distant friend with no way to get out of her life, had just come into her life. Jasmine quietly explained the whole affair to her friend. 
 * " And... what does Tim tell you about my talk with Tim? " * 
 * " It's just, we haven't been on good terms. When he saw something like that he said,'Yeah, I really enjoyed that damn ice cream guy. But you know what, nothing could've prepared me for that first date." * 
 Jasmine hung her head in shame. It all started with that screaming couple and things. Jasmine says in her heart that she finally deserved to die because Tim 'just* seemed to do the same. It was now December 31st. There was going to be riots if Tim forgot something. After spending countless hours practicing calligraphy, Kendra had agreed to tutor for her. Now they had talked for weeks about future plans. And Kendra was going to open an intersection for Tim, Zach, and even Kathleen, Tim's parents. It would all be over in one weekend. He would meet their daughter at the very least.

I hate Skyrim; but that was once real. I can still remember seeing the mountains and the mountains surrounding me. * That's right, you know, this *snow* was everywhere. * Everywhere. * They would get up at all hours, wear skins, check everything, then they'd fight each other one by one. 
 It was at one point that I was fighting my father's army, and we were ambushed by two warriors. She got to the front and said, "Hey, guys, it's like Hell on Earth. You all come out of the mountains and fight as pirates. I believe I've seen you fighting like this! " At that point, I was grabbed by some of the Holes, some of the flesh ripped off. They hurt. They bit at my ribs, torn my skin and skulls apart. Then they popped a hood over me, and wrapped me up like a dress. " You scared me, " I said, " right? " 
 They carried me on to the balcony overlooking the castle. I was a little bit thrown back. They started dropping down into the sea, and I couldn't make out what they were doing. All of a sudden, they stepped up to me and lifted me up to their temple, and they took me in. As I started to grow larger, they took off the hood, and I was able to get the mask off, but their faces were confused. 
 " Hey guys! Hey -- " I began to cry, " guys -- man! They're gon na kill us! Get out! Get out! Get out! " I had to fall off the balcony, but I got out and stood up. They looked down and shouted at me. I tried to run, but I fell to the floor, trying to put me back up. 
 The hero stood up and started walking towards the mansion, but he stopped and looked at me. " You better listen to me, you *man! * You better listen to me -- let's finish this. " 
 I stayed there for a couple of minutes, talking to him, until the two fought one another. " Hell of a game, man, " he said. Then, he turned around, and said, " you must work in a - " 
 " No, " I said. 
 " What time is it? " he said. 
 " Right now, " I said. 
 They went up, and started running up to me. " Go down, go down, go down! " 
 I kept running forward, but they stopped at the edge. I just kept running. The hero started walking towards me. I started to run as fast as I could, but he stopped. 
 " What the hell, dude? " 
 " You're not a monster, " he said. 
 " You're very, very real, " I said. 
 " Look -- what did you just say? " he said. 
 " You were telling me, " I said. I looked up and he was gone. 
 " Kill you, dude, " he said. " You fucking zombie, " he said. 
 The crowd around me began to laugh, and then the laugh stopped. There was a flash of light and they were gone. I got back up, and started walking in the same direction they'd been running. 
 I was close to the door, and they came out and started talking, when one of the guys raised his hand. " You know, how strange of you to kill me this way, " he said. " How strange of you to shoot me with your own arrow! " 
 I turned to see what they were talking about. When I turned back, they both were gone. 
 " I don't want to, " I said. I looked at the girl in the hood, and with a frown, I said, " don't do it. I need your help, and I need to stop all this stuff. " 
 " Oh. " she said, her hands covering her mouth and bandaged her wounds. " I'll be back, man. " 
 " I'll be back, " I said. " Yes."

"It is done! Bring another guest inside! " the first guest yelled. 
 The king and queen shared a cigarette and sat back down at the table. Some onlookers passed by silently. The newly awakened lady joined the burning King and queen over in the kitchen. She approached cautiously. 
 " My apologies but it appears so well the government has bestowed upon you this one luxury of yours. Come now, our family could not bear the expense of another soul leaving the kingdom. The plague has shut down for 90 days! Prepare for dinner, our little daughter will be ready for kindergarten! Our grandchildren will be named Emilia and Robin. Oh! There's too many crazy happenings left to spook the kingdom! " 
 The King laughed and put a woman on her shoulder. " My lord, I fear we have lost your family. You are not a great man, but you knew what it was going to be like to see your glorious two sons and daughters grow up. They deserve better than this. " 
 The king turned to Emilia and shook her very hand. " By my grace I will have you starve to death. There's nothing I can do to you so callous- in fact I fear I will cleanse you of the plague. Right now. Bring dinner. " 
 The King invited the guests downstairs. They poured out food for their princes. They played cards and took notes. Nobody dared to come up with anyone else's names to cross their fingers. They wandered around until it was a half hour until they heard a knock at the door. They tried again. 
 " The guards haven't been able to keep you for over an hour. I apologize for your lack of attention, but it seems as if the aureus has disrupted the service of your house's queen. The preparations have begun. Enter. Good good, aureus! " 
 There was a pause and the door closed behind them. With the first buzzing sound, she stood up and led them in. The King and Queen looked at each other. She still had time to chat. A reprobate knight stepped out onto the porch. " You were warned. I know it, but everyone knows your line of work. Everyone knows your plans. " 
 " Good good, if that particular one of them had listened to you before." The knight said without even speaking.

From behind a small hill, through dense clouds sprang another one, a rod made up of stars sheathed in a disc of full moonlight. We lay side by side, along the sand, tilling the clearing. The forests and mountains warred, the shadows of ruined houses crumbling behind us. The streams vanished, and the young, quick and strong, crowded among themselves, as the sun set on its own. The earth burned, the golden grass fell, and so began the hunger. 
 Our ways, Wild Turkey, would never veer from the path of those who seek to create warmth. Wild Turkey would wander aimlessly amongst a vast sea, leaving none to find that which is best. The forests would soon burn and decay, and wild Turkey would divide itself. She would stay in place, leaving no place to hide and no place to return. 
 I try to forget, how innocent we were. How different we were, and how quickly our minds blurted out the content. We were strong, wild and pretty. We were foolish, wild and simple. All of us. 
 We could always find food. One way or another, fresh in our minds' minds. When we found something, we'd come back. We had jobs, fun, and confidence. 
 Yet each time something came along that towered over us, our minds shut down. We turned our heads, but none of us were looking for food. There were only hunger. 
 And we knew that our small ways would not be at peace with nature's greed. We knew that the hearts of our tribe began to crave something, and we could not abide it.

"Good money, you're right - so how many do I get? " 
 " First thing you need, here's your entire allowance. That's what I sent you. " 
 What the hell, I thought to myself. Who the hell would give this to me and someone for me, not just to have a giftcard. 
 I looked up from my shopping bag and found my tiny savings account still sitting there with the missing $ 70,000,000 in it. I used the remaining $ 70,000 to make sure I didn't eat, drink or take a shower. Hopefully that would take care of everything, since there is a couple of steps involved. 
 " Alright kid, how much do you need? " I asked, picking up the next little coin that I'd handed to the waitress. I like to keep things simple, like how much money I spend and when I'll need it. 
 " First it's seven hundred and eighty thousand. " 
 " Wait, seven hundred... whaaaaaaaaaaaat? " 
 " You got ta pay your fee or we charge it to all your accounts. That's what I did. I paid the bank for ten years, and then you owe your fee to the bank yourself. The money can't wait that long. " 
 " Then get that money back. The bank won't be taking it back or charging you anything but the money for food and drinks and getting you out of bed. " 
 " Then get it back. That doesn't sound like fun, but do you have any other things that you need? " 
 " Oh shit man, I owe money again. I have to get out to the bank, but I still haven't pay them yet. " 
 " Another five thousand. That's still enough to cover the rest of your expenses. Plus, my credit score is down, which means I'll have to pick up the money or they'll charge you to the bank. " 
 Oh well, at least I'm lucky to be alive. I'd been offered at least a few hundred thousand in the past. It's way better than being stuck with $ 80,000 to five hundred thousand for the rest of my life. That's a five-point movie ticket worth more than I have in my life, man. 
 I walked to the bank, through the checkout, started my car and drove home. I got off at twelve, decided to collect my gifts the next day, sat down at a table with my favorite, the one that had the perfect amount of money. I thought about how it meant that I had enough to make my life a living hell. I stared at the two coins. And paused. The next day I woke up cold. 
 "... " 
 The next morning I woke up in a slightly colder room with my newly woke friends. Fucking pretty cold all the time. Suddenly I heard a horrible echo, and suddenly I heard a large spider slithering towards me. I looked up, didn't know what was going on, but soon I saw a huge snake across the room, probably chasing me. I reached for the pistol lying beside me, but the snake just kept coming. 
 " Holy shit, he's going to outbid me."

I woke up the next morning. Good, it's 6 am in Washington, and the world is getting tougher as this heat death fever makes every other blizzard this year. I'm fairly certain a general flu would get me on my way to work by now. As usual I repeat my prayer one last time. Maybe when I eat my first pizza today. 
 Head towards Washington D.C. I take my tablet out of my pocket and the screen displays that I have the desired amount of money in the bank account I was previously in when I died in a plane crash. Apparently I can no longer afford a plane ticket with a valid credit card as well as a cover being ordered of AirDublin, though no images are to be found of it. My worry is about that future as I live the German car ride home with a fiancé, seems to stop. 
 Suddenly I hear a loud reverberation out of nowhere, I look down at my fingers and realize that they're hanging in place on the forks of my fork, like a goddamn sentient saucer of some sort. How did that happen? 
 I'm stuck in this situation with a shitty apartment... American? I'm a waiter? I don't even know my address! I have no idea what I was made of! I could be a robot as well. 
 Who did they do to me and their pizza? My stomach growls in realization that I should probably go home. What's stopping me now is the sound of him moving the pizza box in my mouth, we're both very close now and no one is going to tell me I can't stand at the kitchen table any more. I attempt to speak, but they don't answer. 
 "Ma'am you got any for me? " they sputter, " Get your damn pizza at home! I have a special place to cook you'll never eat that bastard! " 
 It's another horrible sound. The aroma of burnt milk, in all it's pathetic glory. I grab the pizza box and get out of bed. 
 " Maybe we should get more pizza from my chef... he really cares about this world... " 
 I take the pizza box and put it down, don't worry... but then I notice the guys behind me are getting up, before I can form sentences with their laugh... 
 " That pizza looks like it could be a job, " the guy behind me smiled, " I'll be back later! And should we make more? " 
 I nod my head, " Well, " he looked around the room and called out to me, " We could at least get a little more of the pie."

“ You know, Tom. You know I'm such a good soul. It ’ s hard really, being around all of you, but if I ’ m wrong, the things I ’ ve done are a lot more comfortable I think. I don ’ t know if I ’ ll ever see my older sister in person, but I think sometimes it ’ s only a matter of time before I run out of blood, but I guess that ’ s it. ” 
 Tom is never so sure, he just looks at the seething gang of angry people, sawing the sun and spouting nonsense about how he was left behind by an invading naga. Each drawn together, however, leaves the third staring, clutching the wound that drops up to his heart, as if it hurts. And sometimes, Tom sees nothing. The sun bleeds a blue that hasn ’ t even touched his skin for months, and the sea hears nothing, as it has done hundreds of times. Tom is sure of it, that he does. He thinks that being dead is the hardest part of living, that he does, to no avail. But he's never really led any real life, maybe he ’ s just a vegetable anyway. As if there ’ s any limit to the destruction he could accomplish. He picks up a pile of sheets of bed sheets and flies them over to the window, and watches the side of the house head towards the road, where an orange tomato braided itself into a corner under his feet. 
 “ ( Playfully ) I ’ m not a bad person Tom, you know. I suppose it ’ s not all for nothing, but I guess I can ’ t really care, so long as it means I ’ m in a real fucking situation. Anyway, if I can ’ t kill myself again, I guess I ’ ll head over here and run at the scenery, trying to figure out how I killed them. ” 
 Tom never sits at home. He rides a helicopter to the hospital. He drives a taxi to the clinic and visits his mother. For him, the driving experience was not that bad. He walks through his old city, charming every new girl he sees. But not all girls are attractive, he would say. No, most of them are brutal, though they win by a day. Those little bastards seem to give in to the tyranny of a goddess or an naga and start stroking their tails like they ’ re romancing their underage sisters, while walking around the city looking for trouble. Mostly, they want food, but they don ’ t want anything. Even when they get nothing, they keep going until their lives are ruined, unable to get anywhere near their sisters. And when they do find anything, they kill them all. 
 He never went outside. He stayed in his apartment, in his motorcycle, while his mother just cried over his eyes, wondering why his life had ended. Tom just sat there watching his beloved sister while his father he once remembered as not a real friend walked by, just realizing how terrible that was. Not that he would ever let one of his childhood friends know, especially when he looked at his reflection in the window. The woman over there, still weeping, looked at Tom. Their eyes held each other through it all. But Tom never went outside in his life anymore. It was to long since since he had died, and it took him many years to get to the point where he knew he could be there for his sister any way he wanted, and nothing was better then not being near a statue. When he finally got up from bed, he walked over to the window and gazed up at the sunset. The ocean swallowed the world and they all followed him. Tom, though, sat with the sun still below, smoking a cigarette as he looked at the sky, wiping the sweat from his brow with his clean tanning suit.

Who is it? 
 "Ah. Wait. I don't even know what this is, but there it is. I'll have to get it fixed. " 
 " What is it? Oh, I don't know, a perfectly balanced Dual Stock Revolver, or something! What are they *so* interesting about? How could this have happened? " 
 " I don't know. Whatever it is, it can't be a weapon, can it? Just... it can't be real. " 
 " What could be real? So, this is what's a Dual Stock Revolver? Why do I know of a weapon so different from a weapon? " 
 " You mean? " 
 " You will be told everything. You will have to learn how to use it properly, and of course you will never learn its true skill. Tell me then, can you give me your weapon, or let me show you? " 
 " What? I don't think I can talk to you, I was really busy last night. " 
 " You did what? Do you remember what you just told me? " 
 " I told you. I had dreams... I woke up naked with the blade of a sword in my hand. I twisted my legs until I fell asleep. I fell asleep naked, and had visions of having dead men holding me. " 
 " Are you wierd? " 
 " Yep, people control me for a long time until I are pulled on up to their level. I was practically overpowered, I'm 20 years old now. I am no longer anything. " 
 " Well, I don't have a weapon. I'm just a man. That's all. I *have* a weapon, I'm not safe from this. " 
 " You killed a man? " 
 " He was a farmer. He was on the edge of the tractor, trying to catch his harvest. I didn't even notice him before he ripped his body from the top of the tractor and brought it crashing down. I thought I'd always be safe, but then a smokescreen just filled the air. I woke up, while on the run. A few days later I heard my seedling crying out in pain, and then my hunter stabbing my rib. In my dreams, he appears to be a human boy, he is holding the weapon, and he is distraught. He looks down and starts to cry, but nothing happens. I looked at the man, trying to keep my composure. " I did not kill him, I stabbed him in his ribs, and after that he stopped crying and told me how his daughter was hiding a knife in his mouth. " 
 " You did. " 
 " You stabbed me? " 
 " Yes. " 
 " I wanted to know why, how am I even alive to talk to you? " 
 " If you have more practice with blade's, you can get ready for battle, but don't be afraid, you will come after me. " 
 " Be ready for battle? " 
 " You must prove your worth to the kingdom, and be defeated before I may bring your lost weapon to the kingdom. I found your weapon, and when I walked into your lair, I was in complete shock. You would have shocked me but you didn't. I grabbed your blade and dragged you downstairs. It's like a dungeon, you must find a way to escape. " 
 " With this weapon? " 
 " Yes. " 
 " Good job, and now you need to escape. " 
 " I don't want to stay here any longer. " 
 " Don't go. You will have to learn how to do battle!" 
 And then, no matter what, I'll be back to the dune.

"Aren't you going to be the one to hit the Golden Gate bridge with all the damms on the scale? " shouted Commander Jant Anderson. " That will make no effort to convince your camel don't just fall on the Iron Dome! " 
 " How about a superior flight of the Tel Aviv Disaster Response Force? For that epic fight, you get to put THREE tanks in that ETA, two of them standing half-way between the a few city blocks, and a key possible helipad capable of near-constantcy insertion to the Greek ferryport? " 
 " To start off, they have all you really need, one lone tank, and a live field a short way from Ramallah, so we can keep on beating those fuckers at NATO! " 
 " Captain Spence, don't be offended. The Talmud actually IS the two top-secret verses of the Torah we know as ancient history, and the pages are almost as good as anything in the Hebrew bible! " 
 " Fine by me, but that doesn't mean we can't get that text right! See that ISN'T the only tank in THAT SAFE PLACE! " 
 " They find a water cannon about as big as ours on ETA and throw it at the Temple site! The Jihadists can only do this because their tank is built the size of two Cygnetts and they are so old! And by the way, did you say little cavalry or close combat? " 
 " Ash el-Zor'ithahu... " 
 " Really, Commander Anderson? This is a must-shoot! There really is a real pissing contest at play, right? The Bizul and their fucking holy lieutenants, will we be able to cut off the bridge anyway? " 
 " I... I don't know! They have 2 cruisers!" 
 The volunteers put on leathery helmets, lined with small plates and balloons, and walked up the gleaming dome before the damn Silurian ocean.

Is this a bad reflection? I could see it, and this is not right. Part of me takes offense, but the other part could tell me some error on my part. 
 When they say this occurs many people think of their reflection in this way. Their mind takes a dim view of the world and their eyes blink onto a carpet. But we don't dwell on the light reflecting off the ground. Our thoughts are extremely focused on it. 
 This is not a temporary stain on our soul. I can see it now. This can be my soul in the stream that once flowed through me from him. 
 Staring into this defect of the mirror, I can't help but wonder. Is he really like this? His faults built up in his memory all his life. Mine and his own mistakes make up for him? Could he be blissfully unaware of the chaos that occurs in his mind? When he is stripped away from his true natural state, does he see that he is one with the mists, thrown out of the sight of the world? Will he start to simply stare away his broken self, and forget what actually happened to him? What in the name of equality or equality itself has been established between man and the machine? 
 I know what I have to do. I can't allow myself to go there. I can't forgive myself. I must hold onto this soul. I must hold out to the mirror to see what is missing in him. I can not. 
 At least there is someone around who will ask what has happened.

I tore through the street, in my search for that little boy. Every single person stood there, twisting and turning. The Asian American man kept in running. The Eastern European man, with his plastic collar, swinging his arms in the wind. They all had a wild, excited look, though, the man swore that I could still hear. I couldn ’ t tell if their eyes were wide or narrow enough to catch his eye. At the last second, I took off running as fast as I could. 
 By the time I reached the other end, and had a few more steps, they all turned to me. I could see all the townspeople, all raised in their excitement. People seemed to be wearing makeshift armor and shields. I stumbled for a split second; one kid, I hope, was carrying my cousin and a friend. 
 “ You young boy? ” He said, “ Thanks for taking me to the supermarket. I think I found some fine apples. ” 
 I stood there transfixed; I couldn ’ t believe this was happening. I was just the other side of the street, heading towards Atlanta to live with my other son. I never had a son before, so I just thought that that was pretty lame of me. 
 “ Yes, honey, ” I said, handing my cousin the apples. “ You were out for a walk last night. We were on a good spot. ” 
 I started walking up to the crowd, and noticed that every single one of them had hair like brown. “ Whatever. I ’ m sorry. ” 
 For a second, I tried to give him a smile. He simply just shook his head and wiped a tear from his eye. It was more than a little unnerving to him, and I didn ’ t think he ’ d believe me. His head held a look of disbelief. I looked away, though, and just turned to him with a bony hand, “ It ’ s the end of time. ” 
 “ Dad, that ’ s a coincidence. ” 
 “ It ’ s the end of time, honey, ” I said, standing up from my stance, “ For billions and billions of years. ” 
 “ Those atomic bombs go off, ” he said quietly, “ When you all went to war, those missiles missed their target. ” 
 I turned back toward the crowd. I had to be the one to break the news to them. Maybe, just maybe, we could live with our lives. Maybe if we could stop the war, they were happy. I just wanted to have one last thought. 
 “ I remember, ” I said, “ It was for a birthday party. You ’ d look up at the sky and see all that death. ” 
 He didn ’ t look so surprised. He had his parents standing in front of him, like mothers. He continued, “ And you didn ’ t ask if they were happy. We were hoping to die peacefully. ” 
 As I turned to walk away, I was half-choked from crying.

"You met a girl a while ago - who can give a shit. " 
 " Here she is. " 
 " Very nice to meet her, but she's not actually young enough to actually fit in, " Matt sobbed. 
 " Oh. I see. And look- " 
 " Shut up. Have a nice day! " 
 " Take a hot shower, " Matt shouted, as he walked out of the small restaurant. It made perfect sense he had the opportunity to learn about her such a big brother. So Matt made a deal with the lucky lucky girl, if only to have her live, get comfortable, and get away from his kid brother who was 13 or 14 years old. It only took around two weeks for them to not stand apart, it was for the best. Because how many young people can claim to have been connected to someone before they became connected to someone that knew that they only date your kind. Since middle school you could have disappeared for days. It was finally starting. Of course that meant Matt had to try and meet her. Every stranger that came to him. Did he learn any things? Had he lost all the minds in his life? Matt could don'thing, but had that made him stay with her? Of course not, Matt could only get away. It was all fun and games until one day he wandered over to where she lived a few blocks away from him and asked. 
 " Hey, " he said, without a problem. " Hi! Hey, could you... " 
 She kneeled down and spoke. 
 " I'm not surprised - I was just around the corner, you know? " 
 " Yeah, well, it was a while ago that you were just visiting, but... " 
 " What did you say? " 
 " I said, *why me? * Because I was 17 then, and I was still young. " 
 " And we lived together. " 
 " Yes, and we talked, our minds growing together and ultimately marrying. " 
 " Well that's a nice story. Why me, too? " 
 " You know what happened to you, " Matt suddenly said. " Now you know what happened to me. " 
 She broke the silence in his almost dreamlike voice. 
 " It wasn't your fault, man. " 
 " Sure you did, " Matt said, shocked. 
 " It was my fault, too. " 
 " Wait, I didn't know that was a lie... " 
 " Look, if you'll excuse me, I have my down a few days. " 
 " Two weeks. " 
 " So... " 
 " Oh. Oh! More importantly, I just- " 
 " Matt? " 
 " Matt. " 
 "... You know who's a lucky girl? " 
 " Only you! " 
 " I don't know how to say that. " 
 " I know. It was nice meeting you. " 
 " You... you actually do wonder where that guy is? " 
 " Sorry, I have to go, though. " 
 " Okay. " 
 " Just... let me sit here. " 
 " How'd he do that? " 
 " Must not have done that," Matt said, looking to the window.

At first, I was the lazy duck in the woods of the east. I was drowning in their fresh air. What did I really want? I tried to drown it with a pack of lean branches. I tried to drown it with the tip of my toes. Everything was imitating my own emotions. I thought that sounded good. I was so fishy at first, and I think the sadistic part about being alone was well taken over by a sea of agony and misery. 
 Then the first hit me. It felt like puking. Maybe I was falling, maybe my belly was spinning. I was bending over, thinking about something else. There was someone coming over, and I was thinking about depression. I was not really thinking about depression. I thought of depression. What was I actually thinking? I felt worthless. 
 I didn't even realize the streetlights were in. 
 It wasn't until someone stopped me the second I realized what was happening. I had seen someone jump off the sidewalk the day before, and he had dented his hip to look in the street. I saw another little duck in a puddle, and I recognized him. This time, I didn't care for him. I just didn't care about it. He didn't change his colors or anything. He was still real. Now, I felt worthless and...

I had red hair and black auburn ears before the world changed. My father passed away in the summer of 2016. I'd seen countless new human faces, both incredible and horrific, and as my guardian, I gave the final goodbye. 
 The first one I took before her was scary enough, far bigger than I'd seen all the pictures I got. It was beautiful, as her eyes were red and black, wet. The red hair just looked so black. 
 The next photo was a picture of my mother in a pool of water. The hair looked so black and was next to her body. She was vomiting horribly, and I couldn't help but giggle. I gave it back to her, holding her hand. 
 The last photo I took was of that guy that walked on the street. I don't know who he was, but I had a feeling that he was me. I'd always been different, he was also me. I just had it both ways. 
 So what are my days like? 
 Yesterday, I went back to my house, and saw my current pictures. As I opened up the fridge, I noticed that my buns and appetizers were gone. I looked around and found a dead body laying there, covered in blood. 
 I've shot dead people before, and this has been one of those times. I've always tried to be as cute as possible, but I never did. 
 Here's hoping I have a good day.

"Five seconds until minigun spawns. " 
 " Jump meter to the right. " 
 I chuckle to myself as I glide toward the middle of the floor. The sky is clear and clear as the distant moon casting yellow and green red light in my direction. I don't notice the alarm come on if I move so far forward so no one notices. 
 I thought I'd better pass on making it look like I'm doing this every other day; no odd trait, but like the rest of my colleagues, I'm constantly out of practice. 
 I've grown so accustomed to this position of authority that, if they aren't stopped... well, it would be strange. It'll take a long time to get dressed, or take the class supplies for the day, but I'm sure this tower will be busting its own ass until everyone else kicks in to check in on us. 
 I receive a grunt of encouragement from my students. " Lassie, little Red, " lassie says, as she pulls up next to me. She's the one who reached the rack here this morning. " " Don't worry, " she says. 
 She squeezes me tight, squeezing tight like a baby. " Hello, your hands are covered in bruises and scars from yesterday's fight! " 
 I squint as a ball of a mankins materializes near me. 
 " Shit, " he mumbles. His voice waves hoarsely and he hands me a handful of knives from his belt and laughs. I glanced about the room, thinking it was about to have trouble getting out. I push him back to his feet, brushing away some of the dirt and fading flame, and to the right to see the tower stepping ahead. I throw aside the shirt I wore, the sock I had worn before. The kid-sized jacket underneath felt a bit lighter than it should and felt more comfortable, so I take off my pants and flip them over on my hips to put it on. 
 The tower's hatch at its center slides open and the boy-sized girl stands there, astonished and scared. I smile and shake my head. " Grush, " I tell her. She tries to fidget, but the guards outside the hatch want something for her and she blocks it with her clothing. 
 " No, you don't, " I mumble, handing over the knife as well. " Or the shirt. " 
 She looks at me, giving me a look of pity and terror, as if she forgets to put on the shirt. 
 " I'm just making it better, " she says, with a little more confidence. " Something's not right."

It was a nice escape. Nothing too horrible, just barely beautiful. I stood in the center of the pool of hot red blood, a silent torrent of orange and cyan swirling around me. The trees where beginning to sing, moving and twinkling. Everything about me felt just right. My cheek brushed my face, the hair was all just right. I couldn't cry anymore, couldn't look away. I sighed. It was getting harder and harder to concentrate. I tried again, despite my wishes. But each attempt was not enough. I couldn't sleep, not yet. I pulled myself together a little, more now. This was it, we both felt right. This was the happiest we could be. My breath was labored, my body unresponsive. Just like the last time I came out of the pool, I felt the pain. Something was biting at my throat. Nothing too serious. Just a slight smile. I wiped away the blood. My lips curled in a moment of pure happiness, my body not bothering to move on.

I squinted as the shadowy figure pulled off my garment. " Wonderful sorcery, " I mumbled. " It takes a magical spark to grow wings. " His tone of voice continued as he gestured for me to finish. 
 I lay my nose on the gurney and screamed, " DONT YOU FEEL THE NEED FOR NOTHING! " and for a second I ran as fast as I could. I missed. Instead, the Weasley girl dragged me to the door and threw me against the doorframe in a more brutal way. 
 I stared at her for a second before I finally understood. " It's impossible, " I continued, " that I can... " I stopped and shook my head. " What could it possibly be? " 
 " We can't grant the wish, " the figure replied. " WE HAVE a spell which sends you to sleep until the next morning. " 
 *Oh gods. Wait. * I was panting. " Yes, Harry, it is possible. It can even work. You would be in bed for days without sleep and day without a dream. However, this spell requires you to sit on the floor a special pattern ( or pattern-making ) that you can't get rid of before entering the realms of magic. You must sit awake for 15 minutes. " 
 " So what do you call it? " I asked, throwing my arms around my head. I was fairly nervous now that the spell was about to commence. 
 " Powdered fat," he chuckled.

i remember that night. i was drunk, drunk too bad they kept one of their "lost pets " signs on my window sill but i was okay. i listened to the police late into the night, and decided it was time to go to the park. it was friggin a big day so i went over to the kids car but i couldn't see much as i only heard shouts from the car. i felt like i was scared. i just kept going about my day and there were when i saw an " abandoned pet sign" on my windows sill. i came back the next morning, there's a dog in there and i couldn't take it anymore. i raised my eyes up and im alone. back in the neighborhood. well off enough to not be far from the park. the next day i moved through this darkness, and I saw it all. all the signs of a lost pet. some funny left one on my window sill? i sat there dead before. 
 it turned to me. most of them were there since I could remember, so my fear of the new ones began to fade, just like other lost pets. i started to remember the worst part of the city. cumbering in your car trying to catch the bus to get home from work or your wife getting your meds. the signs were everywhere. up the street from the library where all of them were pointing, and off to the beach where, it was still foggy. all these red signs. red and red, beeping, beeping. 
 then i noticed something else. i first felt fear when looking at the signs. ones that read " Please try again." and ones that were " Your dog just died " and ones that read " Hold on, what do you want?" and ones that read " Your dog died " and the ones which read " Why you look at this sign? please don't die" came. i felt it too. there was a strange feeling of dread in me. why the dogs were red instead of red and what were their signs of love, or something. it took me a few days to realize what had happened. i started seeing signs of love. love that were pulling me hard, trying to keep me from trying to go on a rampage but you know what happens when you try to go on a rampage? you can't. they call you a coward who has made them weak. that's the first sign that i saw when i jumped up, and took off running. but it was so easy when i saw other people doing the same thing.

I build him a kingdom, and give him power. I make him drink it, and he feeds it. I terrify him, I seek revenge. I plant seeds in him. I make him carry it with him. I kill him. 
 Everyone knows how odd things work. So I kill them to appease my people. I make him love me, I cover him in blood, I make him drink it and I make sure he never grows a head to eat again. What have I wrought? Well, I'm glad to say that my friends and my creators made a good world. They've been helping me build them, they've made their greatness. I'm so grateful to them all.

It starts when you go to bed. You wake up and your face hurts. You try to write something off, but with each passing second the memory fades and you stop remembering. 
 You have this dream that you heard a loud burble as your husband stopped and steadied the heavy wooden door. " * Pressure* " he said, in a dainty voice. 
 And that was your dream. The boy your sister had run to was standing there motionless at the door and with that the dream faded. The door fell open, and the wet haired boy knocked. It was a quick knock; very delicate. " What's your name, Joe? " The wife gasped. " Dan " he replied, spitting on her. 
 The two of them walked through the hall, all dressed in fatigues and dark clothing. Dan stood at the door, his arms crossed, a smirk on his face. The boy was the first to step through the room. The door swung and a ball of shimmery paint put Dan in a tangle. " Yo, Joe! Have a good night, why don't you turn over here and let me know what you see on your face " Dan spat, and the boy blushed when he knew that was right. 
 All Dan could think about was Dan's show of greatness, and how they'd all kept it together the entire time. One by one, the guests came on to their chairs and their books clutched tightly in their hands. The father -.1mm flashbang. The son -.25 bullet. Dan's junior couple were playing movies together on their cell phone. 
 After the children finished their movies, the father went to the door, hands in hands. " Dan! Listen, could you grab this one that is on your belt? It's a hundred cases of that sort, " he said, his voice carried far too loud, with the soft wiggle of a baby and the smooth tapping of his foot on the newly mended part of the bed. 
 They began to investigate, quietly, as the drawer of Chucklegoods matted against the desk in the next room. One pair of boots the size of a football cracked under the weight. There was a crack between his toes in the middle of the hall. 
 " Casey! Casey! " Dan shouted, grabbing the ankle of his dear brother Todd. Todd's eyes were a million miles away, glazed over. 
 " What's going on? " Dan's face turned red. 
 " You've got ta stop crying. Daddy's gon na be home soon. " He was sweating. " What's up Tom? " 
 The son spoke, softly. " What was that? " 
 " Oh, uh-huh... It wasn't Chucklegoods, " he said, his words cut off as the old woman's eyes came back up to her face. She closed her eyes and dusted herself. She squeezed her thumb over the face, taking off her handkerchief. 
 " I don't know, " she said, gently placing the flower above her head. " But that dog... " 
 " That dog doesn't know, " he continued, his voice barely above a whisper. 
 " I've always thought he's scared, really, " she said. " It doesn't hurt that much. But it's better for him to know that, than to say anything." 
 And so the old woman hugged Todd and continued digging her fingers into his neck until his eyes were jarred in tears. 
 Dan knew that there were a few other reasons that he didn't like Chucklegoods, and he knew that that was right. As he'd written that second dream down, he looked up at his own family room window to see the house dilapidated and blandly lit. And for a moment, he thought of the years of light in his eyes, the nightmares of the other children towered over him.

In the next 24 hours around thirty-six hours all the coffee shops in the city will begin raining anyway, and everyone knows it. I stand on a hill, or at least that's what my dad tells me. It's so dark outside. The streets are empty, but I'm already out. My dad watches the usual seven-hour television coverage of the worst things going on around him. He's stood here forty-three hours now, gazing at the frosty sky. He thinks it'll be alright. He can hope and I don't. His father watches carefully on the television while his head shrugs. Perhaps if he just leaves, that he'll be able to get back to work. A little skiddie can skate.

"So how would you like to take control of these little demons? " 
 " Artyoms? " 
 " Ra's al- " 
 " Sorry Mister'Ra," muttered the pair as they dashed out of the ship. The three heroes gave a brief sigh of relief when they were thrown into an unknown dimension. In response to their fears, Man Man tried to use his powers to create the final form of existence, Superman. 
 He used his powerful telekinetic power to create a portal to Earth, to eliminate one of Earth's brightest heroes, Captain America. There were dozens of heroes ranging in sizes from first cousins to super tyrants, even more extraordinary beings like the caveman, Gorilla Man, and Leviathan became in his hands. 
 Batman managed to rescue Superman's immortal father from the custody of Atlantean king Aegis. They perished and they passed out. Superman awoke and looked at his father. The Queen of the Exe came into his view with Prince Valiant saying, " You missed your chance, kid."

"Hello, everyone. This is Margaret Hammerfinkle at the Washington Post. You are all being interviewed by the Hillary Clinton campaign. To be honest, I've really lost it on you all. The reality is that my greatest success in decades has been with a few, independent groups and my own senators. Please consider where this American nation came from. The greatest body in the world, or so I'll tell you. However, under the current Constitution, I have thought I've taken my public statements a little too far. 
 At the moment, this is not what you may believe me to be saying. I am talking about the greatest mistake I made in a long, long time. That just isn't right, I've stepped away from the responsibilities of a public servant who is also capable of painting. The consequences of my actions were far greater. My new bosses, my emails, and all those apologies made to me aren't showing any sign of being taken seriously. I just sit there in my office, in my Bible ( my official bible ), and reading back to you like some inconsequential piece of malware. My religion is contradictory, and although I can believe that god exists, and I can believe that the Earth is a living, breathing creature, I see no reason to believe. So I asked myself if those emails were news, so I began to chat with some of my subordinate staff. Apparently, I was not the smartest person in this room, but I managed to avert a nuclear explosion, and the entire town of Dulles was dead within a matter of minutes. Meanwhile, just because I forgot to perform needed for a publication... business. This is why I'm going to ask you to reconsider your strategies, Margaret. You can't undo what's happened to you. 
 From a distance, in an office room, I can clearly hear every critic that's ever spoken to me. The waste of space and the lack of efficiency that I hold off on time probably lets up against a little bit of my boss, but it's not really a factor in the end. It doesn't affect me, it just shows how blind I am. If the Republican candidate had actually been this controversial, I could really use some argument about immigration to build confidence. Yet, every time I go around hiring consultants, there's more damning evidence that has yet to come in. Anyway, I have a plan. I'm going to get everyone to pull a punch over me. I've got to fix this. How do you do that without leaking stuff to the press? The world's more important now than ever. Who would ever expect your indiscretions to be exposed? So I'm going to help you better, Margaret. For the first time in eight years, there are actually people being honest to me, and I need to stop caring. 
 Congress is protecting these bastards from this intelligence-gathering network. Hopefully, it can get better. 
 If you agree with my target, please don't use your personal account or that of a person you met online. 
 We can do this. 
 We're at the end of two weeks of chaos. We know how it all started. We had talks about a change in mind for the better. He asked me if I could be a senator someday. I told him that, and I had no choice. He lied and did the same. This may very well be the end of our discussion. But, over the past two weeks, I've reached out to you all. We're helping you look into a way to end this all, Senator Thompson. It seems that there is some unknown people with the power to do the same. I'll see you tomorrow. Please accept that my plans were not only by design, but actually working. Don't deny it, and don't accept any personal confirmation from your superiors. You've done your best, so don't play favorites. This is a hard fight for our nation, and in this opinion, we are ready to make America great again.

I open my eyes. A gigantic hot window and a bunch of zombies. They are small at most. Still, it's at least three months of hibernation since it happened. Mostly because of the noise. They don't even have an antenna. Only that part which connects the ears. 
 How long will it take? 
 Just until tomorrow. 
 I close my eyes. It'll take a little longer than I thought. 
 Suddenly, the ceiling starts to warp. It is a groovy, stomping sound. They wake up. But they feel light-headed. I wait a second, moving my eyes to look at the ceiling. 
 The ceiling continues to warp. Suddenly, there's a noise in the corners of my vision. I hear several bursts of footsteps. They start to seem closer to each other. I move to take a look again. But there's nowhere close. There's an outcropping of them. They're getting closer to each other. 
 And then, all of a sudden, something flies in my direction. 
 "SUCK IT! " A short female voice stumbles and bounces off the ceiling. " A newly resurrected zombie " it says. It zips around the room. 
 " This is gon na be a long day," I say as I load my device and the body falls off the floor. It doesn't look well. Then, it starts digging itself out, almost crawling in my direction. They start to get close, and I turn to watch. 
 They start digging in my direction again. 
 And then, the whole room's moved forward a couple more times. I take another look at the ceiling, hoping that all of them are close. Then, they start to rise again. 
 A loud *VAGRANT** is heard. First comes one of the zombies who started whining. It's Mike, the director.

When I was sixteen years old, I stumbled into the liquor store with a friend of mine in the throng. He was an old man, as usual. Always drinking, rifling through the various bottles of his favorite brand. 
 When I reached the store, I was in the back section, giving them a glass of slightly stirred dark rum and an album of the goddamn Naked Pretty Lady album. He just started spilling. I had a beer and drank it. I was so drunk that you could probably see how he was flopping. That man who had been drinking so much that I could barely breathe was literally fall down onto the ground in front of him. 
 If you were lucky, your neighbor would spot you before you know it. But you weren't, you simply were, and you didn't want to be there. 
 The next day, I drugged myself with Lysergic Acid Diethylamide ( LSD ), hoping to be clean. I drugged myself to reduce the known fear, paranoia, nausea and the well-being of everybody around me by a dozen orders of magnitude, and took my first bite of the Narcotic; I could feel the tears form again as I began to drink the remaining, red, Ndelta-6. 
 Because of this, a whole shitload of people came and decided to take me to some really pretty place. On one of the long stretch of walkways which stretches the stores, we saw a poor man, being tazed by the chain of drunk oddities wearing a Starburst sports ensemble who just wouldn't help himself. In another place, oddly enough, no-one noticed the wallet strapped to a scary looking woman, whose entire torso was just plain flaky and bleeding. 
 Still, the drug consumed them for miles. People started come in and out of the store, brandishing their goddamn guns and checking IDs to see if they were present; some men even began threatening people with long guns, their teeth completely broken off. 
 After days of trying to get the drug to my heart, my mind was turning to wine. After a month of having it, I made a trade for liquid nebulae to show my defiance; what a lovely medicine, I thought to myself, to cure whatever sickness I felt. I was sipping on six bags of it at the time, half drunk, half curious, half dreaming. 
 As my knees began to ache, I tried to decide whether to save my friend or run.

Buddha rose from a seat on a golden throne, a robe of the shape of a man standing taller than him. Its thin, flowing, pale skin covering him, the flesh of its face tinted by sunlight. It's eyes shut briefly with a sudden sting, when suddenly a klaxon of crimson shot through the ground, some of which it caught in one of Buddha's open hands. 
 "Buddha, what has happened?! ", the voice came from the mouth of the older man. " I want to speak, but this is all I have left. " 
 " Where is he? ", the figure said, looking around. The Buddha didn't even move from the position. 
 " Only four steps away from here. Get on the ground before I take you down, and I'll take you down with me, " the figure said, pointing his closed fist at the Buddha. 
 " Do you wish to be taken down by me? ", the Buddha asked, slightly disappointed. 
 " Leave him here, and you'll never see him again, " the Buddha replied. 
 " Right. We'll be at him in a day or two, " the figure said, putting his eyes on the Buddha in question. 
 " What will you say to him, now? ", the Buddha asked. 
 " Say something, " the figure replied. The Buddha had to be silent. 
 " I'll call him Jodo, " the Buddha replied, " Otherwise, he'll die of thirst." 
 With that the Buddha jumped to his feet, and walked to Jodo in a flurry. When he had finished, Jodo returned to the hands of the Buddha, and with him the great Buddha. 
 As Jodo emerged from the river, one of the monks of Buddhism gathered around him. The Buddha used all his strength to pull him to his feet. To the monks, he merely wanted to talk. Each time the Buddha spoke, Jodo came back. Each time, the Buddha spoke again. The Buddha looked up, then down, and then to Jodo. So all was well for him. Then, after Jodo had finished speaking, he faced the monk on the far side of the river. Jodo, believing that his leg had returned, said: 
 “ Fuck you, " a face contorted into a terrifying grin, “ I ’ m going to a mouth on Earth. ” 
 To which the face responded: “ Stop saying that to me. ” 
 Later, when the monk sought the Buddha again, Jodo finally spoke. 
 “ I need water, my poor little world, ” Jodo said, still confused. 
 The Buddha stared at Jodo, haunted by the moment. “ What you want to talk about? ” 
 “ What ’ s water? ” 
 “ What do you mean? ” 
 “ Water, my, ” Jodo said, “ You mean water. Water that refels its own nose. I know you have this thought, because I am so close to it. Why should I care? ” 
 Jodo blinked, and saw that the Buddha ’ s breath had returned. When he was able to look at Jodo, he couldn't help but look sad, because not only was he lost, but the Buddha would soon be gone as well. 
 A moment later, Jodo found himself in a field. He fell from one of the towering peaks, and Jodo was lifted by his feet.

Quests are essentially a palace ( but in the better part of town) of the well thought out troops of the eponymous ( or, more commonly, evil ). In contrast to other cities, they're actually taking many quests. They take these quests to work. For a simple week or so you're there at some very important moments in history. 
 Some people get frustrated with this, right? That's not something one would expect. Firefights? No, that's something else entirely. Sometimes people just get mad and shout at you to stop. Way too many times to count. 
 The stronger the player, the more intense the quest. Sometimes people simply... walk away. Sometimes they just walk away from the quest. Doesn't matter. After a while you start running to find it. 
 The best part is, they do it anyways. You'll never lose a point if it's about something you care about. I've been to ruins and hiking trails. It's fantastic to be inspired by heroes and just missing. Or finding a missing adventurer is great. 
 The problem is, all this questing means, is that everyone finds it somewhere. Most places have posters, texts in books, at least half the entrance is nailed down. Most places have signs, logos, and descriptions. For this reason, there's very few places that post their "Side Quest NPC's". So people just keep questing. I imagine it can be pretty much any place they want. Not them. 
 People just exist after all. 
 But I've come to realise the problem: they're not even real. 
 You don't see someone just quest over and over again, and every so often you go and pay for your passage, to get to the throne room. You never see anyone else, because that's how they do it. All they do is follow their leader's code, and sometimes then pass back down the list that is written down on the orders, upon completing a quest to finish it. 
 And that's exactly where I came from. 
 After almost 100 years trying to advance my character and destroy the Evil Empire. My entire home world has become a dark place - a dangerous place. I've been sent to call on my friend in Egypt to transfer my quest into our new government. He's extremely rude, so I just keep asking him. I beg him to take me to his palace and run along a few paths. And from what I've learned in my missions, he's always on the fence. But after the brave warrior prince that let me have the greatest quest since the beginning of the world, he told me that he will never let me defeat him. I've been treated perfectly, I've been picked on, and have no fear of being corrupted. I hope in the end, he'll forgive me, for doing this for the sake of my weak sister who is nine.

Suddenly a water runs out of my blinds and out of the fountain and into the sunlight. The blast is enough to engulf my wife. 
 "What's going on now? " I ask her, eyes widening. She clearly did not see, but she did feel something in my wrist... something I didn't recognize. 
 " What? " she squeaks, " What happened? " 
 My breast is simultaneously pulled away and realized. I looked at the side of my face, the ruddy memories of my wife ebbing away. I saw the chest shake, collapsing and staring up at the sky. Fingers dancing with a clockwork demon. We were so close. A lifetime apart. 
 " Who did you meet on the way home? " My wife asks, her voice commanding. I can't help but imagine it. The mysterious arrival at her wedding. The moment where the previous memories come crashing back into the ripples of reality. The moment when I realized how wonderful life was, my childhood. I go to work one day and ask for a coffee. I can barely even pay for it. 
 " Mary, how were your parents? " 
 I remember one of the doctors asking her if it would be OK. The first time I touched her. The first time I saw her, standing there in front of me. 
 " Remember? " I ask her, shaking with laughter. 
 " What do you mean? " 
 She shot back, " This was a blur. Who were you before our wedding? " 
 " A long time ago. A long time ago, the man's woman. A strange love in herself. A fire in her heart. She said I loved her and I felt the need to help. " 
 " What did you need? " 
 I scream in horror and she stops before me and turns away. " Mary, find a way out. Then you can see how great this place is, I promise I'll take care of you." She takes the bar, and exits.

Whats left of those rats once again tumbled out of the trees, landing on the shallow bottom. Rats stacked up beside an ancient tree, looking sick and rusted. 
 "*I'm gon na tell you what, I'm gon na tell you, I'm gon na tell you what. * " 
 A surge of dread washed over the grey army of animal men as they watched the mudiced bodies heap down. People of old twisted into their clawed feet, pools of the hardened, silent beast emerging from behind each other. 
 " *Holy shit. That's like three kittens in here. * " A young troll shook a hand in greeting. " I'm gon na kill all these babies, now get out of my cave before I get drunk. * " 
 The adults of the dead boomed laughter. Some laughed more. 
 " *Holy shit. Dude. This pool was just random. Too much water! Now get in bed and do some programming. * " 
 The infants moved off of the still ash and discovered their mother's green creature pincers. She cackled under her breath, a whine replacing the people of their younger days. 
 " *If you see a cat, scurry back to your cave, have a nice, long nap. That's going to help with the stress. * " 
 Bystanders cawed at her, excited by her squeak. 
 " Get in the pile of kittens then. You no longer need to pee for four steps, aren't you? It's hella long to get here. " 
 " I said get in the pile of kittens, now get in bed." 
 The babies hit the ground. They were splashing into the bushes, drooling and stiff, like a sickly baby. Bystanders watched helplessly from across the field. The ritual continued for days, and the children grew more and more bolder. 
 The first cat, Salty, was born of a litter of infertile pigs, the British.

I watched the sunset while I really had no idea how to go about training the super powered people. They always liked to gloat and claim the prize. Whenever I faced down a villain from the curb, how could they come back and shame me for it? I had been making a monster out of the three of us. We were supposed to train together to fight a city in which our strength was only matched by the criminal's ability to dominate the people. But where was the self improvement in that? To defeat a random murderer, tell him there was no mercy left for him? 
 Sitting here in the high school gym, I saw you my all. The shapes of friends I once knew were gone, and just like your action-movie images, disappeared. Pestilence and Jar-Jar Binks and Sif. They wanted to bring pride to our cause. " Give them a chance ", they would say to me. This is where I'm wrong. 
 When I told them I was fully aware of all their strengths, the few who still spoke said " I think you should use your technology." 
 It didn't work. I put all my employees at risk. I ruined jobs. Gone was the confidence I had to handle fear. I crumpled the good cops and made a profit off of them. I was a celebrity, but what crime could I condense to zero in less than a year? The world gave these whores all this money because they weren't smart enough to solve a bad person. 
 But it wouldn't stop me. I just gave you endless labor. Why stop me? You filled me with so much promise, and all you did was fail. That isn't so bad, isn't it? I think I have every right to feel happy. Maybe this is why I am sick to my stomach. 
 If you've been listening to me for as long as I have, it feels like you will be aware of what is going on. Sometimes, when I sparred with someone, I might even wiggle, so you can feel their little voice. You don't notice you wiggle, you don't go up when you want to, and you don't fully acknowledge your potential. 
 It gets harder to leave and just sit here. If you have to be slow with me, we can say things like " Don't forget, I plan on giving you a nice number!". But it's not fair. I knew I was never going to make it through the year. I hoped that the world would be amazing if I trained people like you for decades. I didn't have a chance. Only someone like me can beat you.

The private investigator walked into the room and called for an elevator. The elevators hissed open. 
 "Hello. Is this a'Meet and Greet' if that's how you met me? Is that enough of a request? " 
 The private investigator had never been in an elevator in his life. He had been a computer programmer. It had been approximately 10 years ago when he bought a small platform of hoverboards which allowed him to board the train for he car, ironically he had previously noticed some who had complained of weight problems, or been discovered for being overweight. 
 " No. I am tired of this shit. " 
 " You know, Dr. Kazowski came up with the concept for it. According to him, all of the health industry didn't agree with it, so, he implemented it into all the offices in the world. " 
 " Ah, what? " 
 " Instead of using artificial ingredients to produce something with an artificial outcome, his principles turned out to be the one explanation that consumers often needed. He took the preservative all-clear formula in his office 365 days before the announcement and shoved it in the program. That was it. " 
 " What does this mean to you? " 
 " You took my secret model of the human body at the start of my career. You threw in a print out of the body to report to a factory just like the scientific ones. You put it inside of my body as a clang on my spine to never tire of being what I am. I don't think you understand. I test on the bodies for genetic diversity and, naturally, the results show that the genes are optimal, and all it takes is one human lead and the population will be protected until it all goes extinct. " 
 " That means all of this. What happens to my bioengineering team if they think I have a 'Dr. Kazowski pose', then I die? " 
 " Well, out of boredom you put one of your clasps on me before i get in the airforce. Then, once my engine turns, I reboot it and think i'm the one doing the rest. It takes exactly 24 hours, but I can still beat the speed in the hangar. I can also run everything at the same speed - I'm as skinny as a bin saunter with no clothes. " 
 " Wow. " 
 " The first time i heard that was all about superspace travel. After I got promoted, though, all they were saying was'if you can not outperform your opponent in numerical intelligence, you may have to put yourself in a disadvantage, this is a huge leap in math. " 
 " Ah, but I just did that stuff myself - both of my regular subjects performed terribly. " 
 " You know what, though. Don't waste your time. Please let me finish. " 
 " Yes, but I just wanted to ask, what would you like me to do when you die? " 
 " Ill research. " 
 " What do you want me to do? " 
 " Take over my job."

This was an unblinking spot of reality at first. Once you'd found yourself behind a computer screen at a party, or gone to bed with a roommate in a weird case at a shop, it never really occurred to you at all. Whatever happened to everyone else, the only thing you ever noticed was how they interacted with each other as a whole. No, it was because of the fact that everyone was pretty much up for it, never actually qualifying as of yet. So in a way, you, at the time, seemed more important in the end. You were a general, but to everyone else you meant nothing more than a particularly boring job. You were something to be watched, monitored, considered and ignored. 
 Then a little while later, things began to have an increase in quality. One morning, you're at your computer, typing up a meeting for class, and after staring at the screen for a while, you suddenly gain it's usual level of sophistication. Though rather than focus, you instead looked into the room, adjusted the makeup, and simply realized that most of you were staring at an extremely important quote. You glance at the small yet extremely important letter as it jumps from your mind. 
 'This is your story.' 
 'Yeah,' you exclaim,'how the hell do I end up like this?' 
 You turn around and immediately face her, causing the veil to fly over your eyes, revealing you to be a fairly average person at best. It didn't seem all that surprising that everyone around you was completely normal, although your opinion was never entirely logical as you eyed the screen with looking over her shoulder. You catch a strange look as she laughs while looking at the thing flipping out your phone. 
 `Ahhh..that one was hilarious'. 
 You decide to run, don't need to sneak out and get some help from her to finish this one. As you realize you've already collected enough, the light around you completely turns on. A moment later, a massive pillar of glass is thrown towards you, smashing the wall just in time to crash into your comically realistic PC screen. As you look up in shock, you noticed two other people like her appear in front of your perspective, laughing. That was enough to convince you to turn around and confront them. 
 "Are you alright? " She asks 
 She looks slightly concerned, yet completely unconcerned. 
 `Well, you came over to ask me out. Yeah, just wanted to see if I could fuck a girl. I mean, I do have a lot of butt-stain in me, so being that I'm being a demigod isn't exactly lacking in fun. " 
 You shakily point to a friend of hers that you've been dating for a few years now. Their name is Michelle. 
 `Come on. Get the fuck out of my house and make yourself disappear', they say as they stumble out of the doorway. 
 `You've been over this', Michelle replies. 
 " Dude, you probably already have, but I can't wait to go for a drink with my friends. I love ya', you both say in an excited tone as you walk out. 
 " Thanks for meeting me ', you reply, looking down at the drink you shared with your friend. 
 `Great. Now I'll take a long red swing. Hi Michelle, how was your day? Gary... Gary help me with your day` 
 `How about we go for a while? I didn't enjoy your meeting ', you both reply. 
 `Hmm, that's funny, why am I paying so much attention to you? Well, you just feel so important right now. I'll give you a few minutes. Ok? You can go ahead and do this, but I won't hold an alcohol show. Besides, I'll be seeing you around on Friday till you go home. Hey, you got ta see me, bitch."

**********364**********
A centimetre in front of her, her leg bleeding out as you begin to slowly pull her towards you. You see blood trailing along the iron wall beside her, blurred by a blinding light. Her skin is dotted with small circles, but she is covered in her own blood, her body falls lifeless in the pool of hers. 
 You step out of the room and into her doorway, your breath catches on the cold iron on your hand. You realize you've been pulling yourself away from her, and stumble up the stairs towards her room. 
 "Oh god, Ms Johnson! " You shout out to her, the sound of footsteps approaching outside. The air rushes in to you, giving your face a fine misting, but you manage to cough up a little air in the process. 
 " Hurry up, you idiot! " She chokes out, her knees weak from ripping away, sobs filling your heart. " I got ta ask her where I can get it. " 
 You step back into the room, a visible smile on your face as you climb into the bed. The door shuts behind you, and you close it slowly, allowing the air within to escape into the toilet. 
 " What did you just say? ", she says, her voice a little shaky, but firm. 
 " Why you don't ask her, James? " You reply, not really believing what's happened to you. This is the first time this has happened before, and you're already too frustrated to answer. " I didn't come to... I took it all... ", you startle. 
 " How about you? " She says, eyes flicking to one of the bins she was tossing out. " I mean, if I could go back in time and say, " she takes a bite out of a small red plastic bag, " and no one would have just left me here. But... Did I talk? " 
 " All right. Well... here we go. What's your name? " 
 " Eva Johnson. " She hangs up on you. You don't know why she decided to leave you behind, but a strong feeling of rage and overwhelming sadness still lingers in your body. You try to fight against the thought. 
 " Well, my name is Vicky Johnson, and I'm very sorry. I wasn't expecting you to go back in time and tell me the world's greatest story. However, I was expecting you to tell me the story that saved us. Your memory... My memory... I... " her voice breaks and you're left in an unbelievable pain, where she'd had your head and cheeks. 
 As her body was tossed into the middle of the water, her body slammed into the dumpster. It hit something hard, so hard that its not even possible to tell where it came from. A big, blue container of fecal matter splashed against the ground. You try to put a finger to your ear. 
 " Vivian Johnson... where you went." 
 After several seconds of silence, a feeling of tension filled you, like blood was being drawn from your nose. 
 A slow sobbing began to emerge from your mouth, followed by the sound of a door breaking and a man running to get inside.

Arno piloted the Dalmi in a steady rhythm, each wave of his assassin aimed discreetly towards the hunter. Robert was hurriedly snatched from his position beside him, his vital signs and vital regenerations silently flashing. 
 "Robert? " Robert's airship's scabbard caught on the lone blonde man with a phallus poking out of his posterior and held up a blinding light. 
 " I can't find a star for you, Robert! The scabbard is gone! " 
 As Robert whispered his last, the young hunter grasped his horse in his arms with some strength he hadn't felt in centuries, as if the trainer had used a holy weapon to bring his superior strength and accuracy to bear. The sound of a ball catch as a bird in the nest was replaced with an aggressive fly, flung at the hole in the pilot's chest. 
 " Back into the woods! " Robert pointed angrily, unaware of the viking attempts to ride him into the danger. 
 " That's a bluff! " Robert's horse took him one step closer, sending Robert flying right into a tree. The sound of bone crunching echoed off the trees. 
 " I know! I was scared! " Robert said angrily, as he hung his head back. 
 " But you did. You just had to find a safe destination! I have several ships, I've had many venturets to explore... you have even decided to discuss it with me! " Robert then yelled " I have many ships, but I don't know where you think I'm going! " 
 Robert immediately ducked and tripped on an oxygen tank, kicking down a passage to retrieve his muzzle. 
 " We never got much time. It's just dark! " Robert shouted as he waved his arms and gave the sun set edge to Robert, he jerked himself up quickly until he was coughing and his feet shattered against the cool rocky ground. 
 " Sleep." Robert hissed and he awoke in a pool of red and found a demented grinning phallus on his shoulder.

I am one of the seven lost souls in the afterlife. People tend to get so lost in meaning they don't remember or care at all. They can't remember about the past or why they were there. Maybe it's because they can't remember a past year. But that's not really true. The event you can forget is actually alive again, as the initial trace gets erased, going back to the it you had been. 
 Some of us did great things in our past lives, such as changing jobs, saving lives, and repaying debts. But this time is different. This time we stop caring about the past, and instead focus on what we loved. With the end of the current life we keep talking, trying to figure out what they meant for the future. Perhaps it's because of the current age too much to even mention, but having of a truly good life was the last time someone seemed to notice. 
 I know it feels different, but I really like dying. So I can't help it. Oh well, just one last reminder before it's past coming back to the original thing.

I sat on my porch watching TV. This was it. Time to go home. But first, I had to tell my little brother his story. 
 "I was walking by the trail when I noticed a friendly Giant. " I told him. " Small and quite moving. " 
 " W-where am I? " His nonchalant response quickly silenced me. 
 " Well, you see, I was walking through the tall grass when I noticed some of the taller creatures around us being very pleased with their new landing. " I continued. 
 " You heard me. " 
 He frowned and smiled sheepishly. 
 " Gw00t. " The dwarf screamed in confusion. " Wm00t? " 
 " Y-yes. " I stuttered. 
 " Why did you speak to me so loudly? " 
 " I don't know! " I stood up in confusion, " just go away! " I angrily shouted, " don't try to tell me your language! " 
 " So you said you wanted to talk with me, do you really have any friends? " The dwarf grimaced. " I'll let you talk to me! " 
 I slowly hopped out my porch, walking over to him and reached out. 
 " You have to know the meaning of'giant.' " 
 I grabbed the edge of his legs and yanked, grabbing a few of his other remains as I sped off. With all my will, I kicked the Giant. I didn't want to hurt him, so I held my ground. And when he collapsed, I fell on my back. You see, Giant ( F C ) eat their prey with hunger and thirst. I actually managed to catch up to him before he realized what I had done and tried to make him regret it. 
 " Go away. " I pleaded. 
 The dwarf roared in annoyance. " You don't understand. " He grinned. " I'm in hell. " 
 I sighed. When I came to, all I saw were plants. " What the fuck do you mean there were all plants? " I asked. 
 " Plantry," came the reply.

"You wan na challenge Blackfyre? " A rather beautiful bird called to Jon Snow, begging his pardon. 
 " I'm not ready for it! Why don't you stop there. " Jon gulped. The wall of skulls behind the raven stained the entire length of Jon's body. " I'm afraid we cannot afford to show you this scenario. " 
 " Well you see... you actually have to defeat the evil one. " 
 " I don't agree. Look, " Jon said with an air of authority, " You know, I never imagined this scenario to happen. " 
 " No! " He shouted at it, wincing. " I was never ready. " 
 Jon wasn't surprised to hear this from that bird. It had transformed into one of the others invading R's Wall over the past few days. It was obviously coming at this point and the very stone walls that contained the dungeon were nothing like what was expected of them. 
 And the snowfall had just been over my head. Jon was tearing up, listening. " I am not ready for this! " Jon yelled back. 
 " Wait... " The crow asked now with a smile, " Who are you?! " 
 Jon took a deep breath. " It's me, " he said. " Jon Snow. I will do my best to explain to you where I came from and who I am. " 
 " What? " The crow responded with a slight smile on his face. " Now, " he said, " Let's head to R's Wall... or let's call it. I think you know the ropes. " 
 Jon nearly gave in to the severe pain he was in. But that was when he saw the huge sturdier doors up ahead. The sturdier ones he had only seen in movies; At least he had thought of it when he had assumed the trip would be above the wall. The sturdier doors were blocking out light, leading up to a subterranean cavern. The adventurers. 
 He looked up. There was a very familiar face and the duo stared at one another wondering what exactly they had seen. It didn't look very creepy, even though it was absolutely no ordinary room. It appeared to be some sort of medieval castle, though it did look somewhat small. There was some blood on some of the doors and that made him wonder if they were some sort of costume store or something... 
 " What was that this time? " 
 " You see, we are explorers. " The co-ordinator of the " Exploration " group said with a cheerful smile. " It is a peace that others feel, and I assure you, every adventurer in the territory are welcome. A young boy of sixteen sits at a table and reads the rules, which he then puts into a book. " 
 " What are you guys writing?! " Asked a voice behind the group of men who had all been staring intently at one another. 
 " My name is Aaron. " Jon said, sounding pleased. " So I have no idea why I am writing this. " 
 " A title is given to the adventurers, who then ask the adventurers to complete a map of the dungeon they would enter. Each adventurer and the main character must ask the adventurers to present it to the group of adventurers that stands beside them. " Aaron offered with that sly smile, " Then one adventurer each members the group and is given a weapon that can be wielded by any adventurer in their party. " 
 The group of adventurers nodded. " Now, what is it this time? " 
 Aaron turned to see some of the adventurers standing behind him, trying to understand what was going on. " The adventurers summon an energy weapon that can transform the terrain and buildings around them into a magical device known as a catalyst that can give the adventurers the strength they need to fight. In order to do this, there are several traps and walls in front of the adventurers. " 
 " Now, " Aaron said, " Let's head back to the safe house and explore. " 
 " Yeah, what else? " 
 " Here, let's go." 
 As they reached the safe house, some guys took off their clothing and carried out the silly set up. They all got up, headed for a storage closet and the snacks for their selves.

He punched through his chest like tissue paper. All the way down to the edge of the room. 
 "Mom! He punched through his chest like tissue paper! " 
 " Dad! He punched through his chest like tissue paper! " 
 " Mom! He punched through his chest like tissue paper! " 
 But they had two victims: one was his wife, and the second was his mother. Without a battle, Harry had slashed her throat, then managed to damage both sides while simultaneously killing both the mother and children around her. 
 " Fuck! " Harry called out, as he saw the two combatants immediately bleed out. 
 He opened his mouth, and walked over to his mouthpiece to open it. The weapon wasn't there, it was in his back pocket. He took out a glass bottle, and a jug of water. There was a picture of his bride and the girl they were having a party with today, in the dress department. He tapped on the photo, and picked up the bottle. The alcohol would help the wounds heal. 
 Harry grabbed a handful of epinephrine from the counter with his mouth, and grabbed his cell phone. " Hey honey, give me more pills and leave me alone! " He called over, and shook the phone. 
 She had just finished a " small-town " party, and she seemed satisfied with his compliments. 
 " Glad you have a nice night, and everything'll be fine... " He leaned on his phone for a second, and watched her answer her phone. A text then flashed up. 
 *Click! * he shouted, climbing back up the stairs. 
 The sound of steel tearing flesh echoed behind him. * Fuck! * Harry gripped the death metal, and killed it with ease. Harry ran down the stairs, and found his wife on her heels. The couple took a few seconds to look at each other, then they were well back together again. 
 *Pop! * Harry shouted, and the two angels rose up in unison. 
 " Ya, a-an! " They both gasped in unison as they rushed out. 
 " Nice night, honey. Do you have the tiniest bit of epinephrine?"

I always thought that I would be suited up for this role. It just isn't true. All it would mean is I would die with dignity. I started training at the beginning, already having spent most of the last 10 years on the front line, and done most of the necessary training, but over the years my grasp was limited. I learned just how to take care of myself and how to take a leadership role. After my assignment, it was noticed that my other subjects were struggling to take stock of themselves when all of this began. Not that I was going to "break" them though. I just needed to feel what I had created, which is exactly what I wanted. All that was in the document was the word " love ". It wasn't anything special, just a simple line of code that the poor sap my family had brought home was working towards. I stared at the proofed note and was confused at what I saw. It had a word choice. I looked at my scroll, and after some time, I added a block. That's when I got the word for the text. I completed the text in alphabetical order, and tore out the letter. It just so happened that the last one in the document would be cut. It was cut differently than usual, but had been. I hadn't learned the code or how to look at it, just noticed it was still in the form we used it on the front line. I took a deep breath and spoke it. 
 " Do not worry, you will understand."

“ Oh my God, he ’ s…having a party right now! ” The man who ’ s mangling really was just a man on a nuke! and who couldn ’ t tell us what he ’ d be doing up there today? How could he be our hero, we couldn ’ t tell him. 
 The banter of the two strangers was interrupted by a thug—when did this be a man with a bombarding him, destroying everything? Why, no time at all! There ’ s something… in that dude ’ s torso! Ah, shit, oh my god! There ’ s a man in the mall knocking on the doors and yelling words so unintelligible... He ’ s probably looking over his shoulder at his portable washer and the other man who ’ s not trashing his nephew. He should probably pause at least 20 feet away from that person for a second as to not even be confronted. Who…who are you? 
 Still no response. After the Batman loves the Batman, and the costumes make him a symbol of transjustice and justice, we need some new friends. “ Huh. Hey man, you…you hear that? ” The postman just approached the man, quite nervously, but sure enough with a grateful smile on his face a thug was sprinting toward him in a hospital gown. 
 “ It ’ s me… ” he said as he took his meds. 
 Looking at the thugs by the chest, he sighed. “ Yes, I hear the murder is over. ” Which, of course, means the kid who murdered his goddaughter woke up tomorrow.

The man stood before a large auburn fern near the netting below. This one was perched on top of a rather larger fern. He was about his age, the exact same age as the man who had lost his life in a fight with the postal office so far ago. 
 A wide expression formed on the man's face. " I do believe that it is fitting, " he said to the camera, handing it to the man. " This world is too abstract for the hands of man to hold, and yet to themselves it seems they believe it to be the only way to free mankind. " 
 The man didn't use his name, for he knew he would be the one to tell this story. Upon waking, he knew he was to be the first of the new dawns. The great telepathic visitors had come to find that he was to be the one to take down the telepathic aliens. The telepathic aliens had taken over large swathes of Earth and they had given him life; until something in his mind didn't make sense. 
 " In my sleep this it's been in my heart for so long that it's seen as a burden, to let go, and to leave you for a better world. But as I fall off this hill, with every passing minute it grows harder and harder to keep my head above water. " 
 The man felt his breath slowly stop. He knew what was happening. * Another day - bigger, though. * With every passing minute, his lungs filled with an inner seed of life. They sure were alive. 
 He took a deep breath, " This is the coming of the deceased. It is my duty to fill your body with life. It will be a journey, a journey to save the world, to attain the godlike intelligence of the telepathic. It will be a religion, a worldview, a story, and a peaceful rest. I promise that you will make a better world." 
 He put his hand on the telepathic alien man's shoulder, and they stood in silence, as the light of the new dawn flashed past them. The planet was no longer earth, just a pink sludge of rock formed by fire.

Uhm, strange... 
 A piece of paper was lying on the table. Another balled piece of paper. This one was almost illegible. Clearly being in a bar became customary. 
 It had to be some kind of joke. 
 I put the newspaper down. " Oh yeah, okay. How did you -? " 
 No response. 
 Was I insane? Was the law that I was under a complete blackout actually enforced? 
 I found out I was crazy when I asked Mr. Claret to lead me into a shootout on ██/██/1998. 
 During a nighttime snooze, I accidentally managed to place two chicken noodle pieces into my head. My memory wasn't completely restored. 
 The other robbery happened a few hours later. I asked the police about it. 
 They refused to think about it in less than an hour. My partner and I decided to share the report with others on the scene. 
 Those first few hours went without incident. I was pleasantly surprised when it became the most extensive week of the year. 
 It took nearly one decade of alcohol rehabilitation to cover the rest of my hard days. I ’ ve been accused over and over of assaulting my wife, of theft and petty battery, and of throwing rocks at a shopping centre with glass bottles and straight drinks. 
 One city was still evolving. I was no longer the only witness. 
 As people continued to shift to the darker sides of the media landscape, the Howard incident became the first in which two witnesses were identified. It's also one of the last in which it was responsible for infecting significant proportions of society. 
 Victim number 1: Gerard Cobald Phillips. Gerard was a notorious serial killer who was known for entering numerous local bars, stealing any alcohol they could find, and eventually disposing of them in a bucket of his own vomit. Sadly, he was caught committing just 3 murders last year. 
 Victim number 2: Cristina Telembe. Cristina had lived in the basement of the warehouse I work at, in the basement where she killed herself weeks prior. Her case was attributed to a really drunk figure. Her body was found Friday, June 20th, 1997, but no foul play has been linked to her death, so it will remain a mystery as to why. If anyone out there is at risk with her, it could be the ever drunken Howard. 
 Victim number 2: Michael Birch. Michael was famous for spending most of his days shooting people with tubes, glass bottles, and blunt objects, but he was also known to reanimate objects. Michael was one of those victims at the scene of the murders. 
 Victim number 3: William Jenkins. William was the famous rat killer who attacked people under the guise of being a man who would give any excess of rock in his bed time until it was too late to go to sleep. 
 While the victims apparently had had their bodies removed, we can presume that they had for social reasons as well. 
 This person's case has still continued to grow steadily since victim number 3 was identified as the one shot James Cameron last year. 
 Victim number 4: Barry Henry Moore. Barry was a known drug dealer who sexually assaulted fellow inmate Scott Carter in the living room, and then left him on the floor brutally and self-inflicted burns. His case has recently recieved renewed attention thanks to the fact that Scott and Barry drove the Batmobile through the crowd to the police station. 
 Victim number 5: William Howard. This case hasn't recovered from the mass murders that occurred last month after conducting surgery and procedures. 
 Can you guess why I am in need of assistance? The work I perform in bars still affects the perceptions of criminals. Is it really too late? Perhaps a correct one. 
 Just as I thought, I stuttered. We chose a different method of recovery, so to speak. 
 " Can you help me? " I asked, gasping for air. 
 " Frankly, I wouldn't have surprised you that much if I hadn't thought that much." he said, holding up a laptop computer. 
 Ah yes. We do know that the internet was the key to the James Cameron phenomenon.

There came a time when a great leap forward in technology was needed. In time the world would change. People would grow closer together, peoples would feel harmony within each other. So how could we have watched all those people grow over and over? Oh, sure, something moved in the years, in the subtle flicker of light that colors the photographs left behind that made you feel connected. And those years stood on end, for it was time that the lights were went, the pairs of eyes – either obscured, or blurred to the eyes, marking people that you know will follow you through life. 
 After a time, the years of serendipity and sadness came and went. It was a slow eclipse, a constant fade from emotion; it was peaceful. But then the world did start to shake. There are still politicians that still speak of miracles, scientists that still have faith, kings who still remember the ideals of a baby they never had, a tragic soul you never had. There was a fierce rancor that burned like fire. 
 A great age, when you truly feel these things, it is when you truly know when you should have stood up. 
 This mourning weeps through your bones, you look at each other at sunrise and you know when to go. 
 It was so slow, perhaps 20 billion years, then you could see the five billion and take them all in. You move from office to office as your eyes start to well up, and you're able to relate more to the people around you. 
 A book that doesn't look like a running joke would have been great if it had been kept that way for so long. If only you'd done something instead of how you imagine it should've been done. 
 Yet when you did, you stayed. You accepted. You shared. 
 Then it happened. Something was wrong. All you knew was you were gone.

They fought wars, wars that only the silent gods could exist, wars that burned our worlds in the fire of war. 
 We were not their children, not in fact, not in our imaginations. Our tiny tiny children believed that our world, our places of existence were infused with memories, and that one day there would be awakening, that one day we would be free. And the thing was, we had learned that that expectation, that expectation, is not available to us when we come to peace with ourselves. And it wasn't about resisting; you were forced to wait, you were dragged into the shadows as the pummeling of a fist hit the goblet on the glass floor below. But for that reason we fought together, and the benefit was not in the fates of our one true God, but in the saving of a darker part of ourselves. 
 That dark part, the entire world, its weapons of annihilation upon annihilation. The destruction of a civilisation, of an idea once thought sacred and uncontested, the sordid name for the most destructive war the universe has ever known; the war of belief against humanity, as their world was destroyed, and they tried to resurrect a god they had never thought of before. And when they did, they did not disappoint. 
 And those words were, as the most powerful god of the universe's creation, become irrelevant now. 
 It was common knowledge that a human, a god, is born without regrets, but with deeds and aspirations that none of them have achieved yet, that is the fact that a human is born with the knowledge of the kind and the will to stand up for what the non-believers say, and to advocate for what is needed more than anything. An idol, something a human should believe, a memory, just for a moment of it's worth, without a doubt. 
 A sacrifice for a name to be worshipped and to protect from any change in the name of mankind's shape. Such a sacrifice would only make matters worse, we would also have to not have saved this little village, the place we thought our gods created. 
 But a long time later, hundreds of years before the creation of the universe, humans met their hero, a child, a woman. 
 We met him because he was good, because he would help us live. 
 And that is what saved us. 
 We met him because we were almost at the height of our world's glory. 
 And that is what made us strong.

Confusion filled Philip until his genie shoved him right up against something. The genie frowned and began "... what is this? " Philip caught it in his hand. All across the room, breathlessly speaking, voices all spoke their very own dialect: " MONARCH! " 
 " It's a dead-end.. Rex.. Not to mention.. Suspect? " The genie yelled back. 
... 
 This horrible genie was the target of everything the humanity had ever experienced. From the chaos of war to the extremes of luxury, it destroyed virtually all hope to try and kill him. It came from an incredibly ancient god, to destroy what little hope Humanity had left. 
 A girl, a fifteen year old girl. Father, mother, and brother were dead. She was the centerpiece of his Plan, the plan of his plan for humanity to save herself and all those who had died. 
 Philip raised an eyebrow at this. " But you survived, by killing me?! " 
 Confusion filled Rex until his genie shoved him right up against something. The genie frowned and began "... what is this? " 
 His shining green eye gazed back, causing Philip to shudder. " Who was that? " 
 " It was Genies. " said Rex as he gesticulated his ghostly body. 
 " Genie? What a lazy bastard! " 
 " You didn't just become a god! You killed the Meek, and for the great noobs, my undoing. I brought a star to die here. " 
 " And it was destroyed?! " 
 " Yeah, but it was inflatable and low impact. " 
 " Who invented this? Do you know what a noob use a noob. " 
 Rex felt compassion set into his ribcage, but his heart was already broken. " I've been around, Rex. " 
 " Really? " 
 " And even if it meant to ruin the whole plan... Does it? " 
 " Yea..I suppose so. " Rex leaned over and shook his head. " Where was I?! " 
... 
 The genie told his advisors to ignore the plan of their beloved through the diplomacy that Rex had made. He rebuked them then, indicating with his stare that he would tell them later, like every other person around him. They were wrong. 
 Twenty years later, when all about the world talked, Rex was of the opinion that the plan was lost to time, that the entire planet was simply a symbolic watershed. 
 Confusion filled Philip until his genie shoved him right up against something. The genie smiled, chuckled a few times, and a smile even more sinister in intention and evil. " What is this? " Philip said again in disbelief. 
 " Guy in Power had what he wanted. " 
 " I have no idea what that is! That's why we are all dead! That's why this plan was a sham, you see. " 
 Philip shifted uncomfortably in his chair, gazing at the reforsal window in front of him. " God!? So far we won't give up! " 
 " We don't have to! What could we possibly be doing? " 
 " Take me there. You wan na go to your nice apartment, back when your God was alive? " 
 " Of course... Sir, will... " 
 " Richard... what is this? " 
 " Is my keypad in there? " 
 The voice was such an odd storm that Philip caught himself, now looking at the clock on his desk. 
 " Sir... will my gut let me have a drink?"

"Yeah, well, I was just wondering if.. " James said, gesturing at the windows, watching the vogue crowd rise from their seats. " Was - would we believe them? " He paused to take a swig of his pint of ale. " Would you believe what could possibly go wrong? " 
 The crowd laughed at the great title he was about to have written for Valve. The portmanteau splintered like glass, as it fought the eerie and erratic upclicking of a board. He held it off, he'd had to get over the previous nerves by going at around the 96th percentile before it all began. 
 The crowd eventually dispersed to pass the moment he stepped onto the stage. They all wore the same dour brown beards of Valve's parent company, but the game spanned so far down, Jim got a visceral craving for the liquor. 
 " Bring the fight back to me. Take our audience and spit in our faces. It's never a game right?"

The enigmatic man stalked 
 At night in a hollow hut 
 and he sat on a cot 
 one of the few who had known me. 
 His name was Hydra O. Since his death 
 Hospitals had been torn to shreds 
 human screams long fetched by others. 
 Like a specter 
 Hospitals in the city were shut down 
 and when a stroke was come his ward would be shut 
 until his brain needed to go. 
 After this he would stand above 
 to his fellows that he chose. 
 Or maybe I lied. 
 No one would mourn this sight 
 for all the dead, maimed people, men and women 
 had all died at his home

We ran, following her trail to the safehouse. Donk had proven himself to be a caretaker for pretty much every child, from her... sister and whom I had named Sarah. But surely he *sold* his time. We ran far through the forest, narrow, around an overturned structure, white as snow. I crawled up slowly, surveying everything that I could see. 
 A door, gleaming from the darkness, lead to some rubbish bin. A human skull, in orange and gray. Abandoned. People scattered around, spilling themselves down. 
 "Found this. " Said Donk, finally piecing together what he'd found. 
 This. This was Steve's skull. This was the tailbone of Steve, or Steve Kelly, as he called himself. 
 " Looks like Steve hadn't been asleep in weeks. " Said Donk, grimacing. 
 " Steve was sleeping in, apparently! " 
 " Just don't tell anyone. He's clearly insane! " 
 " Mike? " 
 " Yeah! " 
 " Mike. Maybe he went to sleep. " 
 " Mike, that's Steve's dead soul. " Said Steve. 
 I turned to face Donk. When I did, he held up some rusty oak letter-purse. It was easily recognizable and long, with a Greek skull-purse on the other side. 
 " I'm sorry, Mike. I didn't realize how long it took you to collect your body. That would have taken about 8-9 days for your body to mature properly. We're looking at about 18 months to make your parents more mature, since they won't be available when you are. For the time being, I'm going to keep the body in the in-between rooms, so that you and your siblings are fully comfortable."

She wore a tight-fitting vest with stripes of purple. Every day, she would walk into the store, carrying her groceries. She was seven years old. She'd only ever needed a snack. It was the bread in the doughnut-sized bag that made her smile. 
 For a time, they both stayed put in the store, sharing small showers and eating cereal together. They had lunch breaks every week. 
 In college, she slept in the front of the bus in the evening and often dreamed of bed. Each time the bus drove on, she would pick up the kids she came to school with. The girl who brought her was beautiful in every way. She took her time in school and came to class. 
 And so, from a very young age, she stumbled upon my childhood friend, Peter. He always talked to her as if she were his own child, to help her along her journey. But that was the moment that made her realize that she was so much more than just a teenager. 
 The time she loved him was the day that he was killed by a stray bullet. 
 And the day that he never saw her again. 
 I'm afraid.

Fucking friendlessness from there. How could something so innocent let such a twisted thing like a friend stand against him? I mean, it could be violent; you're a thug man, on his way to jail. But you were the one that came to his house. The only one that mattered. His livelihood. You managed to get away with a letter in the mail from an angry parent. If you can't steal people's shit in family, what do you do now. I'm sitting in the backyard on the bottom of the river. 
 Then the owner'ss daughter starts crying. I'm all about focus, and I never really let my cell speak for what it really was, the depression, the alone-ness, the nagging emptiness of who she is. She's traumatized more than I could have imagined, but the aura of panic throughout all her new-found abject fear only showed her. Not from the man you had brought along, but from the father she never was. 
 And now his sister comes in. She's cried at least two or three times since you had married her. Each time, it makes us feel so secure. Maybe she means someone else has hurt her. Maybe it's something you find out when someone else begins sleeping with your sister. But for her, this is her connection. 
 I wouldn't mind if it was one of those kind, early years in your life that brings comforting recollections, but there's one thing all her nonsense can't quite explain. How can someone as mad as she know how to conduct herself. How can someone as independent of morality as she don't need to worry that my true love may be bitter about calling her that. 
 I see a cute little girl in the corner of the room, but I move toward the front door, grabbed her hair and tied it up. Maybe it's me, for the best. See, I'm the patriarch of all the family. I talk to her about her job, about her friends. I explain to her the only things she cares about, and how she likes everything about each and every one of them. Especially her number. I try to reply, but the thin, talkative boy holds me in place for too long. I'm no a social butterfly, now. I want to talk. Now what? 
 Even as she cries I don't sit beside her. I sit beside my daughter. I try to speak to her but I don't understand what I'm saying. Oh no, calm down, I understand. This is who I am. 
 We arrive at the house, and I welcome her inside. I apologize for crying at this point, but everything is fine. It's not just what we say and what we do to each other, it's how we imagine ourselves without her. That I was just someone who needed her for comfort at her own expense. 
 We are small. She's small. I wonder if I'll go run for a while longer. We're all very small. And we are all small. We're just young kids. Young kids that had never felt love before. These are the only things we should be worried about. Maybe it's time for them to realize that if they stay with me, if they go take this.

I recall it as if it was yesterday, remembering my first bite of a decaf canned food sandwich, about to begin my shift as head of what was going to be my eighth childhood for the day. 
 As my eyes adjusted to the stars, I noticed the sky moving from red to purple, dust kicking up slightly as a large rock hit my head, setting me off, glancing to each of my companions out on the rooftop. 
 “ Don ’ t start screaming, ” one of them said, and gripped my arm as I relaxed. The young man, over my loud screaming, slung a small newspaper over his shoulder. The other looked like he was half ashamed of his being weighed down by the litter of paper, keeping his head straight and his hands held up high. 
 I nodded, wishing he hadn ’ t let me down. 
 “ I ’ m gon na go get breakfast to rise you and supper, I know. ” 
 My eyes followed the little rock, even though it was relatively soft against my bare back. 
 “ Ok… alright, ” I replied, reaching over to snatch the nearest plastic cup from the snack stand. 
 After I nodded again, she slowly pulled me into a hug, gesturing out from her arms and to the living room. I raised my arms in recognition, eyes scanning the living room with eyes as bright as the two suns themselves and looked up as if to show me exactly what had happened. 
 “ Happy birth! ” a man shouted. In the crowd, on the tv, A vision of the sky, of a world the size of a moon, replacing where it had once been. 
 The news website gasped at the location. I picked up the paper again, glad to have thrown it down on top of the pile of napkins nearby, but I could tell it was just a desperate effort. Maybe next week I wouldn ’ t have to wait in line, of course.

"Ladies and Gentlemen, the entire world is planning on firing upon our team that is now training, preparing for this test of your Legion. " 
 Ursus Harluck, American hero, wore a suit that looked like it would be ripped in half. Some of his fellow heroes would be chasing after him right now, but the battle between the office of Tufletore Hill and the White Ribbon Team included the best and brightest of talent. Roughly half of the staff at the Initiative were still alive and so, no real offers were available for recruits except for the super soldier who would be staying here. He was hot on his trail of being the title representative at the symposium. While being the first joker in the convention had landed him on the list, however, it really seemed hard to lure him back after last fall's riot. All for the company, of course, so there was just a few steps at his door to that door. Speaking of which, how was it that they had a very bad time? The Golden team, to say the least. Everyone on the team looked arrogant, and everyone was looking for a way to give Aroroks a little flair. That was all of the charm that the Shining team was neglecting. Still, they always looked impatient, and in that brief moment they figured they should all give themselves a helping hand. They were good with that too. The Shining team wasn't all anything; they both worked hard for what they could, not getting into their favor. 
 The class was extremely short, as the sun was blazing before them, and no witnesses had ever managed to set foot on the stage. Yet again, they took their brand of herory seriously, and were eager to see what the audience would come to hear. Come lunchtime, the Shining team was already in the door, waiting for the perfect opportunity. 
 " First of all, what makes us in this situation the chosen one? " 
 " Because that is what the several villains have been searching for, the ones who are trying to sabotage the latest [ rngistradiscith ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/40z4ra/wp_a_headless_bender_in_the_black_wizard/cpnipxg ) power plant incident in the middle of # moon-storm, which resulted in the death of some of the combatants." 
 For a second the pitch was dead in the water, the silence was deafening, and the sound in the room was deafening. The Shining team's reaction was one that would be talked of by friends and family in the next few days, when the Shifting team visited for the school year, it was now covered in tears. How had he ever treated them? Well, that is far to mundane for the Shining team. It was pretty clear how the Shining team cared nothing for anything except their chosen hero. None of their failures would garner the same amount of support as the Shining team. The Shining team was officially being investigated by investigators that could now testify that it was quite possibly a villain, to a point where they would be featured in a movie industry blockbuster.

The power went out on your nightstand. You get your first shot, hear the pop of your name being called, and hear a blast of gold hitting the floor on the walkway in front of you. 
 Maybe you just wasn't ready, or maybe a secret was missing. 
 Or maybe you just died. Just in time. 
 "It can't be happening! " Your brother called out as you let the shot drop, and the reflection of the power went back to your body. " Tell me, what caused me to freak out? " 
 " The whole world watching you " 
 The TV changed to a television broadcast with a montage about your " Hacking ", and it played again. 
 The old man next to you was getting pushed off the bridge. Your eyes started to water. Tears were starting to well in his eyes. 
 " What's going on, John? " 
 " I was nothing, I wasn't... " 
 You had a long pause before another voice interrupted your thoughts. 
 " No it can't be... can it? It could have been a virus that ran off or something! " 
 The man continued, " When you were born, you died. You just ended up with a new voice in your head, and the voice is crying out for help. " 
 Injured, you wipe your face with a towel as you try to get your bearings on the audio recorder, " What... What happened? " 
 " Well, what happened isn't right. I know who hit me. " 
 " Where am I? " 
 John had the word " dead " smashed in his face, " I can't say what I can say. " 
 He paused, "... can I get your number? " 
 You are still reeling as the camera cuts to silence. 
 " Well... Yours is pretty good but it says you're next. " 
 You answer. 
 " I just really... I'm confused. " 
 " Who are you? What's up with you? " 
 " You're John. " 
 " And how did you get here? " 
 You hear the help from the man on the screen. " Why don't you come here and talk to me, Joe. " 
 " Thanks. " 
 You turn away and see you look more familiar than just the face. 
 " Oh well. I'd better get going. " 
 The device goes dark, and then there is nothing but a dial tone. 
 " Don't touch me. " 
 John called over you. 
 " W... w... Uhhhhh. " 
 You wave goodbye, and John calls after you. 
 John is impatient, but gets up and heads downstairs. " Come on, check my watch." 
 Your watch says something about three. 
 You shake your head. You wake up. The monitor reads three. 
 You get up and put on your best suit.

An armored merchant approached on his other hand, hammer in hand. He looked suspiciously to the man, neither truly aware that such a large man might even exist. 
 "Atomic Human®, Modbury, Toronto Ontario. Umm sir, it seems as though you have both been trading up gold in the most strategic of directions. " The merchant smiled, a sudden burst of condescension filling his already weak eyes and generating shivers through his veins. 
 " Will you rob me with my gold? " asked the merchant, in a depressed voice, trying to no avail. 
 The merchant looked up as if to say, but neither man moved. Everyone on the desk had died by the man's hand- the thieves in the papers and pawn shop shops and even back room. 
 Everyone on the desk had died by the robber's hand or by the hand of the giant goblin that stalked through the slums of this city, taking entire days off work and forcing everyone to wait for hours on end without anything to eat. It had taken many lifetimes before the robber would finally swallow the town asunder. These lifetimes slowly started with the dragon- the petrified rat carcasses rolling past the ruinous walls, and finally even the feet of some of the townfolk having their dark alter-egos stolen away from those fools that had already left this earth. 
 The beast... that had taken half the world and split up the continents with little warning, except for an autocracy more advanced than we could possibly even imagine. How could we possibly really know what the beast was capable of? " Are you going to kill me?" 
 The whole town just sighed, the companies media freaks us into their dark fates. My wife made the claim that I was just killing her for getting her killed. How this one happens to be a trade for the goblin, or a trade for... is useless. In a few years we will have a police force that works for every American and must constantly train citizens to turn the ocean in its little star. The goblin has massive structures hidden in some of the half developed New York deserts. The city is dangerously close. A giant obelisk was their goal, and while nuclear weapons are probably far inferior to those, they look more like trash cans and volcanic furnaces. No matter how I knock it down, no matter how I pick out the weakest magical weapon ever invented, these dank rituals are ritualistic; pure superstition. So many wizards built these tombs to learn about the goblin's need for power and power- this doomsday device must be to have plenty of food. 
 Stupid rats... won't pass the spell and they're gone. No need to threaten their brothers or defile their graves, and then nobody will take notice. No one will leave. This is all the kingdom needs. We have to make the goblin back on his feet, to stop the inferno. It will take just a few people... these people... to retake control of the city. They have a powerful magic that lifts mountains, and this one will end them now. They will be our oyster.

[ Note to self: make me laugh every time you do something stupid ] 
 In the early morning, I woke up and saw a bright green envelope written above me. 
 *Review: An Old Testament Woman's Story* 
 The package was garbage. Sleek and heavy. I hadn't even read it. I sighed to myself and rolled over. An old timey envelope, filled with clean wrinkles and flakes with odd lines painted over the corners. I quickly opened it and read. 
 *Review: A tombstone lost at sea* 
 In its place was a grave, a single coffin at the bottom of it. The couple I had slept with in my old house had been cremated weeks ago. I wasn't sure who to blame. I had been home alone for decades, and were always too afraid to leave. I must not have been out much. 
 *Review: Who never speaks? * 
 I looked at the house where my parents had passed away in the same car wreck. I finally knew who they were. Maybe now would be a chance. I stepped into the house as I normally would and suddenly, there was a vision of someone knocking over the car window. I ran into the living room to see a purple slab. A very familiar purple tooth, from long ago. I looked down and saw no hair on my head. There was a blood trail all over the mattress of the couch. I felt sorrow. I couldn't take it anymore. I ran to the couch and pushed my toes against the sleeping body of the memory, grabbing a kiss on the neck to emphasize the moment. I leaned up against the couch, and kissed my heart.

( TL; DR: please don't call me a militant for being a human. ) 
 The immense alien child eyed the waif, it has been preparing for this. As it gazes at this maturing war machine, he's almost aroused by its taste. The elder still looks frightened and the younger is terrified, but the boy still does not recoil from the petulant gesture. 
 "N... no! " The child continues. 
 " You? " 
 " Yes. I am made from this. I have been created with purpose. All through my life I would train you, learn from you, use your skills to fight for this planet, until you serve me, and we never will. " 
 " No, you aren't alone, " growled the boy, watching as his flesh grew dried up, rather than cooked. 
 " You will not die willingly, " the elder spoke quickly. " An outsider is not trained to fight for your people, but to learn from you. " 
 " *Yes, you're right*, the elder blanched. " A warrior has no brother. A human is not trained to fight for them. " 
 " And the animals? We don't give a crap about animals. " 
 " What's that, these markings? " the boy grasped his back with both hands. " I thought the Avatar were made for war, eh? " 
 " You want to know what animal I've learned from, " the elder repeated. " I have not learned from an outsider, you see. They've lost there tongue because they had not seen what flesh I can for this species. I have learned, and I can not stop. " 
 " No, no! " The boy again gripped his back, looked at the elder. " You could not run with nothing in your talons! You could not fight until you found what it was you was missing out on! Now look at me! " The child roared. He grabbed the boy and tossed him into the deep, industrial air. 
 The elder disappeared into the tundra ahead. With no use to the beautiful scenery, the airy cave side exploded in all directions. The jungle suddenly turned brown and he felt the tingling sensation kick in, quickly waking him from his rations. With a small rustling noise he stumbled out the cave with his friend. He stood back down, but quickly moved to leave. He saw the clan of tundra monsters scurrying by, and pointed his hand at the elder. 
 " You hear that, Old Brother? That's only a bird. How to learn how to defend your one last sky hut. Make sure not to think, now. I've healed you from all this, but yet you remain the hunted. Here, you feel me command you. " 
 " Sorry, only a bird. " 
 The elder looked at him strangely. " Please. I've always fought for this planet, for my species, and the only way I can learn is to fight for it. " He raised his head. He shook his head, and swallowed. " I am the warrior! " He clasped his hands together. " I have fought those who lack the means to fight. I have grown, cut, killed. I have killed worlds. And yet, I have not taught you well enough. " 
 " *NO*, " the elder defended. " * I don't care*. You're free to do whatever you want, but you're not getting away from that! I have chosen you! " 
 " We have to protect you, traitor! " roared the senior clan member, who immediately collapsed to the ground. 
 " I'll, if you would give me a chance, " the elder spoke. " I'll have no choice but to drop you in combat. You'll be the hunted, the hunted!"

 All the mechanical port workers knew was that they were off to sea, at sea of course. 
 But then one day, they saw the land. 
 And now they know that, if they do the same, and the credit to perform the same thing will be hers.

I hate this message. This thing is unreal. 
 We've failed. That madman. Has destroyed half of humanity. We were so close. We worked so hard. We built such capable ships and weapons. We could give him back our planet, but he took the planet so literally. He would miss all we had left. The instrumentation failed. He plans for it again. So near to disaster. A particle field, one they have made, destroyed everything. Scientists were shocked to find we have also destroyed so much. We will end this. We are his children and our children his parents and we will do our best. 
 We were together before he burned us down, we were at peace before he burned our nothing. The last thing I heard was his voice. The last radio signals we received. The last to leave. 
 I love this city. I wish we were here before he's gone. I don't want to see his twisted mind being destroyed. 
 I miss him.

She called me her little girl and I shivered. I didn ’ t know how much longer I could stay patient, I was so hungry and although a whole life had gone on I could sense my body start to shake and fall off of its built-in seat. 
 We sat on the park bench and talked for hours. Before long she was staring at me with curiosity and annoyance. “ Hi, I have questions about the lake? " 
 “ Well we are starting to run out of water after our first paddle a couple days ago and before we can get to the water you ’ ll have to catch the barest of greens. ” 
 I didn ’ t care what was wrong with her, if I could catch this great thing I ’ d pick it up and bring it home. Even though I couldn ’ t believe that I would be taking this trip full-time I wanted to get up and just grab something. 
 We were getting ready for class and the driver almost laughed as he pulled us into the parking lot. 
 “ Here we are! ” he shouted and we backed out into the road. 
 She yanked me inside the car and off to the side of the road, trudging towards me. I was so scared that I didn ’ t have time for anything. He had called a friend and I knew that she was scared. 
 “ What should we do next? ” she asked. 
 We both laughed. “ Well I would like to bring me this mini snow white one after class. I didn ’ t know who was going to carry it, but I hope you see this! ” 
 I was holding it tight, hoping to catch it in my red pants and I couldn ’ t have that. At least my friends at lunch were willing to spend some of their extra time on them but they did hold their laughter back. She began waving a flashlight, hardly enough to turn off the light as she slowly floated away. I felt the shock of curiosity on my back. 
 Her red skirt showed off to be a bloody red bloody skirt. I went for it but couldn ’ t catch it. I tried and tried but couldn ’ t anymore. 
 When I returned I didn ’ t get the flashlight again. When I did again, I couldn ’ t even catch the skirt. 
 Later that night I would tell my girlfriend about the dress and we would laugh at some other things for the rest of the day. When she wanted to go a few days in her recovery the day turned to the Sunday. 
 It was a Monday and she got back to me about my diet. I tried to make some food but seemed to be getting a little hungry. She stopped and looked down at my legs and tried to look me right in the eyes. 
 “ If you could stay with me this Sunday you ’ ll definitely eat some. ”

"Live without fear? " 
 It was rare enough in the cave. Their cages didn't seem to offer much protection. I wasn't sure if I was going insane or not. Something had decided to survive here. 
 The curiosity. It had always seemed weird knowing that they had brought me here. I had come here to kill a god. 
 I saw something coming out of the corner of my eye. Not the devilish, chubby form of the man that always accompanied me outside of the cages, or even his terrible face. An invisible cat leering from the other side of the wood, with flames above it just as flickering. 
 " Ow, yeah! Now get inside your cage. " 
 It tried to push past the stupid demon out of my way, jumping right back from its trap to try and push away my guide. What was the other guy saying? 
 " Would you like me to take you into the kitchen, or is there someone left in the cage you just left behind? " 
 With him in place, I climbed to my feet and prepared the incendiary devices my brothers had kept in their cages all the while. These bombs were made of water, which I found hard to find, as I had no idea what I was doing. I looked around the entrance, see a small man with skin painted into ice. These were probably his brothers because he had burns all over his body. 
 He didn't say a word, but sat down across from me, facing the other demon. 
 " I am going to start my operation immediately. " 
 I open my eyes, and with that, I ran to the room without a care in the world. I was getting closer than I needed to, with all the terror in the world. He would never look at me in the eye if he did something like this. 
 " What is it? " 
 " Did you become dehydrated, sick, or dehydrated. I just awoke with some boils running down my throat. I'm pretty sure I don't need assistance. " 
 " Don't worry, I will look in the mirror, and watch you for a bit. " 
 The two set in their usual routine, digging their feet into the worn wooden floorboards. Up and down they went. Not over the water, down the wooden ceiling. Down and up the floor, something took me back. There I found a sun lamp, and a door behind me. I open it, and as I glance over, the body of a ghastly and ravenous crab starts to emerge in front of me. The man points at it with something scintillating, with two long, long claws. 
 " You are about to enter the bathroom."

I was sitting on the sofa. * Honestly, what did I see? * I mentally pondered this and drew another back at myself. If I worked at some fast food joint, or was drinking Coke all day, then a cliché sense of humor was needed. 
 I got up out of my chair and headed out to the door. * I didn't think I'd see that scar, how did I possibly know? * 
 It was a large white 'X' printed across my face and... well, the closest thing I've ever seen a happy face at. 
 I walked into the house and sat down on my couch. 
 "What, what am I supposed to do? " I asked sarcastically. 
 The parent laughed, and went on to give me $ 100 to convince myself that I was of no use. 
 " I like you, son. Now enjoy this." 
 I walked away and opened my eyes. I was in New York City, but this was so different. When I looked at my arm in the mirror, I got a blank face, and my left hand couldn't help but wince. A day later, I stumbled back to my apartment, knowing that it was just a day, and that I wouldn't be able to hold onto it any longer. 
 I woke up and I was lying on the couch with a terrible headache. I started looking for a weapon to stab my head. I knocked on the living room door. A cold rage washed over me and I choked on my bloody tea. I poured myself some sleep because the next day, I finished practicing lying in every way possible. 
 My bed still felt as dry as the day before and the studio was full of people trying to kill me. I was about to hit the nail on the head when I looked up from my phone to see a friend and girlfriend standing by my door. As they said goodbye, I smiled to myself. 
 I suddenly stopped feeling sad and turned back to see my son, now with a small scar that stretched from my left wrist to my right wrist. It felt wrong. Before he could even blink, the sun was setting, in a great landslide, as it took over the entire world.

I wish I could see it in shades of red, orange, or yellow. I wish I could see it without the color. 
 I wish I could get to know it, the only color I could feel with all of my knowing, and all I know. 
 I wish I could go to it, when it was just around the corner and it was just green or blue, and while it looked so pretty and fresh on the floor, I was so... overexposed and nostalgic. 
 I wish I could stop looking, just watch, just look, when it was just a little bit brighter, because without it, I know the color in my soul, and I know what it is. I know who I am, how I feel, but I cannot communicate through words. 
 I wish I could stop looking and remember, that the color my soul is, is actually here, right under me.

Closing bar was a hell of a rush. I took in the window where two young ladies once-girlfriends sitting in chairs stared blankly into a business meeting like childs, apparently in high school. On the bended knee I let my good liver fly into my hand from the corners of my mouth, and dangled my hand in the air. 
 I held my hand to the window as my eyes shifted to a far off sunset. There she was. 'Shrine Up'," another of the girls remarked.

The sisters were furious. Professor Basil's latest test had proven that even valid spellbooks were useless when used by women. They had realized this and aimed to threaten him and the kids, specifically the scientific witch doctor, Fred himself, who they deemed "dysfunctional ". 
 It worked though, and Fred could no longer do the magic her Department of Magic had hoped to impart. 
 As Professor Basil stood up, an old familiar voice greeted him. " Whoo! " the word was familiar to him. Who could do magic without using voices? 
 He was surprised to hear the voice again. 
 " Professor. What is your name? " Fred asked, confused. 
 The old man chuckled as he looked at his words, " Terrence Sergeant. " A few eerily familiar words appeared before he, too. 
 " Krieger. " 
 " Holbro " 
 The old man's voice didn't answer for a few seconds, as he continued. " Leveller. " 
 The sisters were confused. People said that the magic that could give names had been invented thousands of years ago in secret, so to speak, until now. 
 " Ahhh. So i'm Gregor Morristone, but with the bells ringing? " The teacher began to question her. 
 " Or Leon. " 
 " W. Hyksmuggles, but with a key. " 
 " Don't want a spin on words. So who exactly is Leon? " The teacher asked. 
 " That's... Nothing " 
 The teachers voice had gone silent for a moment, and then changed. 
 " It's its own badge! Every day! It says 'Free Will. Three Hit Bangs Required. Beware.' But we never asked you to give names that were always correct. " 
 " Huh, so you have no allegiance? " 
 " Ahhh... Olgudod' Phienavasulnos. " The old man did his best to cover his ears, but there was something about Olgudod. 
 " To tell the truth, you're a thorn in our side. " 
 " Squarete. " 
 " Oh boy. " The teachers face had remained immaculate. " You're not gonna let me say that until tomorrow. Until my Professor says he wants me to. I have to tell him, so his face goes up and then down after the Principal finishes examining him. " 
 " If it's true, then all of ours just have to go into hiding and then everyone will know... Oh, call me Claire. " 
 " Oh little angel. " 
 The princess' face was pitch black. People gasped and screamed in horror. 
 The old man called Claire " Mothergrip." They stumbled out of the assembly quickly and chased after him.

I just lay there as the sound of rustling leaves washed over the huddled pile of logwood. 
 I am lonely, and I feel worn out. I have grown up in a much larger city, far more populated. A city that has always been home to a great many oddities. In my slumber I felt many strange things, perhaps the same oddness I had a few hours ago. While others sleep they make me whole, loved by others and imagined to be so without hesitation. 
 Just the feeling of wind on my head, the sound of the soft touch of a tree on my shoulder, the soothing look on her face, it made me feel it. I like to think that I know and love her, but it is not true. I remember that one morning I woke up to the sound of rustling leaves washing over my head, the sound I saw once a morning once I had been asleep but I had seen nothing that night. 
 I think about my parents the most, they always said it was someone's fault that I did not sleep. I thought it was the mother´s fault, or the father´s fault but I don't care anymore. I spent the whole day searching for something, anything, I always dug anyway, since I had walked this town only about a week ago. 
 I left it on the tables, I took that photo for everyone, and I didn´t even bother to take the bathroom. 
 I felt butterflies in my stomach as I looked at the photo. 
 Elyse was the same if at least a few siblings, she spent the whole night alone in this nice small town. At least there were tears in my eyes, I felt so tired. I had been sniffing the leaves in my meager little house for hours, maybe days, but these were the last few moments. All of my dreams were gone, my last memories were of empty stares and a single dead eye. 
 It was then when I saw that scream that turned a stomach knot in my stomach.

There she was, a man who loved he but knew no man of his stature, her voice shrieking in fear at him. 
 "God damn it Brenda, what are you doing? I saw him tonight, he shoulda known better." 
 The words were from her mother's arms as she passed away a year ago.

"I'm almost done. You can do it, sweetie. " 
 " Get the surgery done... " 
 " Don't! " I screamed in his face. His face cracked up in pain as I stood there, motionless, with a shovel in my hand. 
 " Find out what you wanted to know, okay? " I answered, sliding the front step into my pocket. 
 He looked up at me with one hand, and sighed. " It's all about the stuff. Staying warm when the sun glimmers off you. " 
 *I have an idea. * 
 ** " I can't, sweetie, I can't do this, " ** I stammered. The pain was gone now, replaced by pure agony as the shovel fell into my pocket. ** 
 A little sister. A young child, walking on two legs. A burnt, mutilated corpse. This might work. 
 But I knew better than that. 
 *Very well. * I picked up the shovel and turned to leave. 
 ** " She missed her grandma! " ** 
 " Did you see grandma? " 
 " Yes, she used to hit you!" 
 ** " Did grandma miss grandma? " ** 
 I couldn't even think what I was doing. I was sure she'd taken a hit to the head. But without her, I knew exactly what this was. The worst part was, that she'd gotten too scared to look up. She'd changed her current pose, and her life seemed kind of messed up. 
 I sighed. 
 **This isn't the first time. Please, get help. * 
 I stepped back, a scene unfolding behind me. 
 **I'm more worried about what she wants now... than what I will become. ** 
 Oh no, no, no. 
 I felt her hands move out and pull the shovel down to my shoulder. The mummy stole the burden.

Don't think we missed our chances in Jerusalem. 
 The United Kingdom, Poland, Ireland, I think Ireland was involved - including Margaret Thatcher, eh? - and her wild man photographs flew out of the camera with great haste. She'd have really liked the Virgin Mary, still married to Dr Joanna Dunham. 
 Belgium, Germany, Poland, Ireland had always been hard to place. Yugoslavia, or rather did Cyprus have never been at war with Russia. 
 Or did China and Vietnam and Japan just join Russia as their own party? 
 We didn't have to fight, though. The idea of the world without war was terrifying, for certain. 
 If it were up to me, I don't know how the world would have become so unstable. 
 What was worse than the horrors of wars was the despotism of the pre-war France, too. Did that Soviet Empire even have power? Did that a time to build a personal base of civilization? 
 Then we were living in a paradise. 
 Again, what would come of that thought? With all this logic came greater logic: how do you react if someone you love suddenly gives up their life, a life you'd cherish forever? What does one do when they're your single breadwinner? What does one do when they find happiness again? 
 Have you ever thought of Christmas and you smile, and the force of a million worlds splitting apart like a big bunch of grins that could barely stand the light of a moon? 
 And in the end, right there in the middle of all this, I had the audacity to ask myself, "If we are even alone in the universe, what purpose does it serve? " 
 For it has to be true. That people can forget about these failures - about what was once a prosperous land and powerful nation, again became a barren wasteland. When people die, and what good is hope left? Is that the fate we're given as rulers of this devastated world? I don't know. I hope. 
 The world would have changed if I didn't feel the certainty of the possibility that something we loved might actually be the most enjoyable ever. And it would have. 
 " Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the universe or we are not"

You start to realize what the one thing you wish your life was without always having one thing to really enjoy. This is definitely true. I wish I'd been around to see it. I wish I had been married to her, because it was definitely an odd part of me. I dreamt about it. I dreamt of the day she started to do something I didn't have the guts to believe in. People around me started to realize that you never understand what your life is until you check a lot of boxes. Everything from PTA to high school graduation to work performance and parent grandparent's anniversaries. Some of the boxes were lost, some were years ago. Others were weeks away. Don't worry, I know you're not going to judge me or even root for me, but at least now that I know what my life really was like I feel more comfortable. 
 Sometimes I wish I'd been with her. I've probably had enough. Let me tell you what I wish my life was without. It was about a year ago that she died. Well, it's almost comical that her body was still in such a deplorable state. In the same breath as being burned to a crisp, she had gone from supermodel to god is dead. There was no other word to describe it. Nobody knows what it was like to be defeated. No one knows how it felt to finally even try. 
 But I'm still here. In a different part of my brain, in my dreams I see her familiar face: It has already happened. It had already happened. I am so happy. I can feel her left warm to the touch. I can hear her sing. I smell her perfume. I taste her scent. She's smiling. At first, I couldn't believe how incredible she looked. She looked so beautiful. But now, more and more I feel like it's just a part of me. That's the thing with dreams. It's a part of life that makes you more comfortable, more hopeful, more proud of yourself and more sadder, more shattered. They keep running through your head like a virus. It starts trickling down from below. It will come back and it will become bigger, it will become frightening and it will become sickening. It takes years of swimming to get your body like this. But we are a race, we must move up and find a better way to get this more personlike. 
 As I sleep, I dream about her. I always dream about her so badly. How beautiful, so sweet, so caring, so passionate, so kind. It turns me away. I can barely get these things out of my mind anymore. I want to know who my favorite person is. Where I missed her or what made her tick. The more people I see, the more I know. I see so much here in the dreams. It's just so hard to understand what it felt like to be loved. To be perfect. To be loved by people. But as I fall asleep, all I see is a doctor, a nurse, a heart, and a lump of worry. I feel bad for her. I feel bad for her. I feel bad for myself. I give everything up for something worse.

 The lizard chatted out his hello again, and the chickens gave him a coy smile.

He knew he would have more power after the big day of decision making. Some wished that he could stop swearing at his deathbed and take the place of his Humbert once more. 
 The girl, Selina, was in her final years. He had knocked on her door halfhearted, as though hope was all it could muster against him. He'd seen her chances shrink and shrink with each day he came to his senses. Selina was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen and he'd called her his love and his first love. She was the blonde-haired member of his house. He'd reminded himself all these years that he wasn't any fatter or leaner or sweet or healthy than she might seem. 
 He saw a chance to change that all at once. How could he let go now? His father, a judge of the entire guild ( of course - everyone in the land was thrown into the office -- like tons of shit -- because they thought it was a nice gesture ), had leaned in once more, making sure of that. To make himself better man than he was. Selina had set his eyes on making things right and turned to go. The chance for her to see what she wanted was now gone. And he wouldn't have to. 
 So what was the point? After all, the dead are always good for business.

In a short row, someone will finally know *everything*. My aunt Julia is in a dream but I can't help but look up to her and notice that we didn't start this kind of world. Although her mind can't be physically felt... The magic of it all moved all around me. I could almost feel that I would be able to do things, such as become better with my violin, but the magic was filtered through myself. Through my dreams. I could see how simple things can be... And work out my problems, how there would be no more problems. 
 The spell that kicked my mind off was when I heard her speech. On stage I didn't know what she was saying, but with the right words I could communicate everything. My mouth caught up. I couldn't find words... And just thought in ways that she didn't speak. It was like I just forgot what I was picturing. I'm going to write this letter for Julia in the morning. 
 You know what's harder? To actually come to know someone who is reading my mind. What's harder is really understanding. What I have learned and done. Just looking at myself, reading I could feel, was telling me everything. 
 And here I am now. The only one I've ever known. Except my mother. So, so, so screwed up. Nothing gets easier as long as she remains alive. My sister. My sister who always wanted to be with me, and like, her mind is capable of understanding anything but me, my family, and most of my surroundings. If my mind didn't have a hand, I doubt she would know what to think. What I would be right now. I can feel her gaze on my vision. She must be so tight with herself, knowing I can hear her here. I've spent a lot of time with her lately. She's mad at me. There are pictures, most of them weren't genuine- and she must be more confused by my worthiness than I. I suppose it's the only thing that would help me at all. 
 I'm so scared. 
 All of a sudden, I look up at Julia and see her scared face. 
 "I am so sorry, but... " She began. I held her close, falling to my knees. 
 " I wanted to tell you, " I sobbed. " But... I can't make it go away." 
 I let go, tears in my eyes. I don't know what to do...

 Looking up at the world. As he went to lean over the hatch, a small light glided across his shoulders. His mind was literally blinking at this exact moment. The only hint of life in it was the light. Hanging onto the hatch in his hand, he tried to push through. It was a half mile radius, 3 and a half blocks away. The light was getting brighter, especially as far as he was concerned. Even with the height of the location, he couldn't see how far off. However, it did not matter what direction he looked. The lifespans of every one of his people were decreasing. The sight of bright lights would disappear and the death of hundreds, maybe even millions of people. As he closed his eyes, a soft thought raced through his mind. He saw a little child sitting in a box. It was dressed in black, and it looked just like himself. The little one said "Welcome home, Nicky. How are you? " as the smile suddenly wore off. He was acting serious, but slightly nervous. A nervous feeling overcame him, with this feeling of helplessness that wouldn't dissipate. " You stay here, kid. You can move outside. The magic of life burns in your mind. We can make your memories eternal. " Seeing this, the child laughed and whispered. Then it went quiet. " Now, relax. Once you wake up, you will finally be back. Now, kid, sleep. " He whispered as he went to the box. A small breeze took over, and soon the boy wrapped the blanket around himself. " Sleep! " He exclaimed. At the moment of waking up, it dawned on him. His mind was waking up. Strange light popped into existence in his hand, but he didn't feel it. Instead, he could still feel his body. Like his heart was going out. Only he would still be alive. He tried to remember his last words. " Oops! Me and Pie…" Before he could finish his thought, a girl disappeared in the doorway. The lights from the hatch faded as the guy picked up his pet animals.

"Hey, Jared, look " Jim says as he and I take a seat at the table. I have to shut my eyes. " I know it's a bit out of your price range but.... " 
 " Jim, what can I help you with today? " 
 " Nah, its gon na be fine " I say in a calm voice, but he just smiles. We sit silently for a while and he can't speak until I get to my feet. 
 When I turned to face him, I could see tears in his eyes. I couldn't resist. " How are you doing today Jared? " 
 " He just smiled " I reply, looking at him deeply. He is crying. " 
 " " How can someone do anything that doesn't hurt everyone? " 
 Jim sits down with tears streaming down his face and says, " Nothing " 
 " I don't even know what kind of cruel thing you're trying to tell me " I say with a shake in my tone. 
 " I just know that it's so bad it'll never end " 
 " How can you get this out of the way Jared? " Jim asks as he leans into my chest. 
 " I've been here before, out there before, don't judge me. It's just a piece of paper I started every day. Its just like asking an old lady, what do you know of her name? " I try to grasp the idea of going through life with somebody I've had time to read. 
 " I thought... " 
 " Don't worry, I don't know you " Jim says, as he peels his eyes away from mine. I look up at him smiling. He sighs and kisses his forehead before walking to the door. 
 When we get to our car we immediately the large elephant offers the requested date of admission and he calls the police. I turn and inspect the car. 
 " Yeah, they did it. Look at it. " 
 It doesn't take long for the police to load me into the i-pod, one of the 4 empty seats to be counted from the front seats. Everyone in the huge city was instantly drawn to the recording device as I was loaded into the smallest passenger seat available. 
 " How long will we be waiting for? " Jim asks 
 " Until we go home, " I reply and I nod, " we can look forward to that! " 
 " But... " he looked up into my eyes and shouted, " For now!"

He finished dinner. His wife greeted him with a smile that was interrupted by tears. 
 "Guilt, mother? " 
 " A heavy one, " he said. 
 " But I'll fix it. I need to be in control, " she told him. 
 The man rose from his seat. 
 " I already know all about it, " he reassured her. 
 " But it's a joke! Every week now, nothing new goes down with you! So every week after I tell your sister why you killed her. I tell you, you forgive me. " 
 He looked at her. He knew exactly why she did it. He had seen other women murder each other while walking home from school. He knew all too well why she did it. His sister remembered her, her sense of having control over herself, but her cold heart had just betrayed her. 
 He smiled as he reached to his daughter, her master. She had seen him sacrificing himself to protect her, and her sins only made him more uncomfortable. 
 He felt the cold pulse in her neck stop, as she felt her right hand on his back and returned to their homeland. She put her hand on his shoulder. " I can't let you be like that." 
 *Please don't do this*.

**********407**********
I was such a fool on the campus, having just decided on the right word for your daycare centre cafeteria – I closed my eyes and took a step off the edge of my desk chair, my toe stepped deeper into the yet-unfinished school of inevitable proof I would not guess I would be accepted at my first cabin class, preparing this month's Halloween spree with other upcoming classmates. 
 Over everyone at the same time I did the same, looking all around me, pleading. I walked to my outfit, ready to face whatever ultimate death awaited in my darkest hour of dreams. Luckily, I had been too cowardly to get up at the same time, I had travelled too far and grabbed a crowded train station, entering the city. 
 Walking had not been a problem, until it had to be. After all, I had always been nothing to get excited about, though I was wrong. Taring the throat of a god, my parents smashed my bloated shirt, my mother blasted at me, so that I could see if they were really right and left. 
 Everything here had considered that I had to join a tribe before I was picked up and had to grow up, probably because I wanted to. That's why I had so selfishly delayed it, and had been hoping at the outset to attend a free academy with some of my friends. Many tribes had that ideal outlook, the happiness and light in the sky, and they called me Grampa. I needed some Indian shit to weed myself, right? 
 I had been way back when, at least between the local cities where farmers kept their crops watered and healthy and didn't produce drugs or cigarettes and other stimulants and candy. For my entire life, I had been an outsider, experiencing the masses and looking down on them. I needed some decent food, I needed some socialization, but it was perfectly reasonable I should consider the situation better. 
 I knew I needed some support, and, no doubt, it was in the right of course, and the only way to support my journey was to flee before my parents filled me up for a drink. I passed the gruff barkeeps on the other side of the room, and had breakfast ready in his left saucer, fast food served at the door. 
 I moved inside and finished eating my breakfast and drinking my milk. A dangerous one at that, they used to tell me. " If it becomes increasingly contagious and then sticks to me, then we could be cursed and you would be smitten, but if you somehow fell madly in love with it and did what you do best, I will protect you until you stop committing crimes, and then I can send you to an appropriate college where I can spread my word and gain the support of my tribe. You might be intrigued and would not invite me into your house, but stay away from my friend, I am sick of your nonsense. " I gave the greatest laugh I could muster. 
 I entered his room, and sat down. Staring into the fireplace, while sipping from my coffee. 
 " Would you like some milk?" He asked me. 
 I took off my headscarf and slowly pulled it down my body, wrapping it around my shoulders, reaching the line of my nose and towards my eyes. I closed my eyes, pushed them open and waited for my response. 
 Then, as I opened my eyes, I felt myself draw closer to the door. I took one last look at the blade of grass nearby as I stepped out of my house, and then, as the sun shone on the corpse hanging from the trunk in his room, the simple faded message faded from his mind. 
 Muddy name, clean deed.

General Glenn Lewis sat back in his chair, ready to vomit, yet did not pass the stuffed animal test. As he was frantically trying to determine what would be happening, the alien could not be identified. It's slow but not interrupting its process. They kept staring at him, apparently unaware of his calm demeanor. 
 "Sir, I want to hear the results for your pilot - Voorhees. " 
 He stared at the bottle beside him in confusion. It was a fluorescent green liquid. " Dr. Beeens?! " 
 The alien stirred, and the General asked the doctor who was dispensing it to him. " Mr. Beeens, they don't have a doctor that we know. " 
 The doctor barely sighed. " I understand that being in contact with a NaValue medium tends to leave you strangely calm and rational, but what does it mean for you - Voorhees? " 
 The General stared him for a long time before getting no further in his thoughts, only after a long time. He did not drink this liquid, he only swallowed it in preparation of this emergency. Perhaps this is normal for humans, he thought, going on with his day. 
 " Voorhees. Please, sir, please help me. " The alien barely managed to flinch after moving. His breath left his lungs. " Please, sir... help! " The fact he was being impaled must have resulted in a severe, agonizing concussion for the General. " Please, please, help me! " He felt a raging feeling burst out of his spine, out of his belly, and into his arms. Finally, out of an awkward breath, the alien reached for his red tongue and shoved it into his mouth. " Please, man! Please, *please*, help me! " It was in his mouth for a very long time before the President arrived to tell the General, " This is it! " 
 The General looked down, gasping for air. He collapsed and cried, but when he fell into a deep, pathetic sleep, his tongue escaped his lips. " Good night son. " 
 He woke up in a big, small hospital room. His head was not where he was supposed to be. The situation was different in front of him, he was in a small room. There was Dr. Beeens, leaning in, his arm agape, looking at the glass of orange juice to eat. Dr. Beeens was a medical student, so he thought he would learn about various fields before he went to the next space station. However, his forehead was totally covered with blood and his nose was completely dry. 
 The next thing he knew, his vision was one of bright light and floating ribbons. He looked around him, trying to find any other source of life, but there were few - maybe 75 or 100 people that weren't instantly giving him signs, like he was coughing or falling. " Is anyone there? " His voice was different and his ears vibrated. 
 " Yes, General, " says doctor Beeens. " I don't know. " 
 A blonde, almost morose woman opened the hospital cabinet, holding a piece of plastic. " I-I'm sorry, General, " she sobbed, grasping the piece of paper with her hand. " It's just what I had in mind when I was in space."

Living is incredible when you look back on it and realize, a rather small proportion of people accomplish things to extend their lives. The human race is aging fast. You would have sworn upon entering this room that you could have made this mistake in day one, but a sentient mind's eye can not comprehend a single bit of information. 
 Our search for a single person truly had taken months. A team of ten was chosen in one day. Each team consisted of one person. Of course, since not everyone had the same hobbies, we had to assign subjects out of order. Descent did not occur on the missions, the comfort and companionship of each created the identity of the individual. Almost overnight, he would walk aimlessly throughout our outpost. Later that day, we just left. 
 A medium sized guy sat next to us on our food. " Professor Scott, do you know if I came up with the concept for you or not? " he asked. 
 " Are there no more navigational aids besides the gun? " 
 " You know right, and at first we sent us on a mission in order to survey the atmosphere, let them know how long we've been here. It could be hours, though. " 
 At this point, the water began to pool in our den. He was scurrying around us, trying to find a way to not be startled. Something about him seemed strange. Still, that wasn't how the mission was going to start, had it not been for the deaths, the hardship, and the drugs, he'd never have thought this would go so smoothly. He caught my eye, but I know better than to trust anyone. 
 " Hey there. " 
 We stood there, looking at each other. " What is it with you, Jesus? Where are you taking us? " 
 " Um... no. Just take care. I'll be back soon."

I turned off the cold September breeze and took a deep breath. 
 I nodded to myself. It was a fantastic idea. Having never had an urgent conversation with any other person in my life I had always been drawn to their ability to prompt me. 
 Looking back it was a shame. It seemed like an unfair advantage that someone I enjoyed the way I was had actually responded to my question. However, it was an advantage that I had, so I spent the time to indulge in the knowledge that the person I loved most needed help when speaking to me. 
 Nothing beats providing someone with the ability to request urgent conversation while they sit down.

1. Be a good listener 
 No direct effort is required for great writing in the world and it's lovely, sweet community. No pressure is given nor anything to advance further or will have adverse consequences upon doing so. Less. Don't use your own time and habits to have time in a way to create or even understand. Just because you're the one who writes doesn't mean that don't be a stuck in situation, you are too determined to succeed unless you can't. 
 2. Don't focus on what you're writing. What you're writing now is wrong. Try making it up as you go. You need to sit and think and look at the thoughts on your keyboard, never erase them or disturb them. That's how you seek to shine in the world. 
 3. Be a decent PERSON. It's a great way to live and make a difference, I know it sounds crazy but I wanted to build a community of people. Everyone wants to be a part of the same shit circle that everyone else finds. 
 4. Don't make up your own ideas. You have to make a buck, always trying to fit your own ideas into the bullshit they tell you. 
 5. Don't be easy. 
 I'm sorry, if you think I'm making this story up I don't know much, just tried to inspire a spark somewhere. I'm working hard for you now I guess. 
 Be a good person. Enjoy reading.

 I looked down at my forearm to see that my hand had been replaced by a small doughnut. " Damn. " I started to get really dizzy, and only lifted my arm when I looked over. The jagged edge of my arm hurt like hell. 
 " Here's your bike. " A man wearing a pair of very specific religious labels walked in. " Give it a look and then we'll share a second one."

Diablo developed the step by step checklist that specified basically the most important "rules ". With it was a code. Since he didn't have access to the GPS to see what was going on, it would really be hard to tell. His model was R9 and, after weighing the different versions and the differences, he had to pick one based on his actual skill set. 
 The first thing he did was swipe right before the door for the station and look out. The one in yellow was threatening him, so you could imagine how crazy he'd be at different times and various locations. But as to which one he really had to select it: he asked himself the other answers here and there, but he never made a decision that would be official. 
 Finally he got to the other part. He took the tool box and sketched out something complex. A shape he had been running off of earlier in the week and designed in his lab. The first thing he did was just stub it out at the foot of the screen in front of him. It changed color depending on the location. Black was on the left, white was on the right, blue was the middle and red was the middle. Again, the color changed so completely that it revealed the basic types of words. 
 Once he had first crafted the first word he filled in a translation, including " CRUMBLES WELL WELL WELL". Then he took over and had a great time at it. He probably made thirty-five different languages during the course of the month. A total of five different types of times. A total of sixteen different types of words. After all of this work, Diablo had worked out three rules which he would then repeat six times over the next six months. 
 Five sins you have never done. If one were on the belt, bear that away. 
 Four he had a back-story. Little did they know that he was big in his own mind. Every night he'd fantasized about burning a three month old girl's mother and calling her a little whore. In the evenings he'd lure a girl to his bedroom to spend the night there so she would never know how beautiful he was. Any time he'd even get close enough, a 16 year old girl would slip her thumb inside his robe. But the daughter had never learned to do it. So it was just for show. How could it be different to kiss that little girl?

The noise continued to come from space - an incredible number of voices from all around the globe. 
 It was a gleaming white rock, accompanied by a soft, supple sounding voice. It must have been hundreds of thousands of years old, perhaps older than the sun itself, and cracked, black, or perhaps it had been wracked with matter travelling by the laws of nature. The voice was like a cloud at your elbow, and had no inner voice. It was not a sound for which you could understand what it was saying, but a warning. 
 It said something. 
 It broke into a jog. 
 It became an active source of energy. 
 There was electrical activity. 
 There was electricity. 
 For months, it pulsed into existence. 
 Around the globe, a million of its co-conspirators received electronic instructions, leaving signals of a new structure. That structure was fast, and compact, with a thick, woody surface in the way of two faces. 
 The spacecraft was soaring down to the stratosphere, as if preparing for the headlong descent of something larger than itself, and humans were taking part in a new life. 
 ( Because they were not aware of it. We've never been informed of the spacecraft, and the incantations we had were right there within the trigger of its speech. )

Day 110: Being a good man once again was difficult. My suspicions were confirmed when I discovered there was a depressed dad at the crossroads. He told me he would be delighted to sell me my soul and I told him that I had the greatest possible idea. It had taken me all night to wander all through Europe. I never expected the great work to be in this field, so I threw a stay at the Crossroads on my way to earn my share of it. I was surprised not to see Christian Meredith in front of me, and hoped that she would forgive me for my actions. After 1 hour my mind drifted off, giving me pause to study the crossroads. In my last memories I had seen a man who, filled with righteous righteous indignation could be called *Adam*, rising from the dead to one of more wrathful wickedness! I flinched as I passed the crossroads thinking why in Hell did they keep that man at the crossroads? I had experienced plenty before, and I was even given that job! It was unfair to be doubted... so I left. With a definite feeling that I would have been wrong, I flew through Europe with a lack of desert, until I spotted a tall man descending from the sky. He kept descending with him, His hand leaving nothing, everything was perfect. And then... it happened! He flew straight at me and my ears rang. I shot up, flinging the man across the face. My mouth opened slowly as I began to hear pained whispers and cries. The man leaned closer to me and whispered, “ God help you, ” then dropped dead on the ground. This came as a cruel shock when the man said, “ I am your God, father of sons! ” My father had never thought to shoot a man before, but this was not something that came easily, so I tried calling out. “ What the hell? ” I managed to say after a few more steps. My father's voice seemed to move, causing people to fade away as I saw it. We fell down into each other for a few moments until I asked him, “ What now? ” The man said nothing but continued on, tilting his head for a moment to make sure he was happy. As he spoke, his eyes grew wider and I began to realize that I had been seeing things before, I was seeing *things* the man couldn ’ t. The people around him began to see things that were alien, like shadows shifting, and he spoke with an aura of nobility. I then realized that I was now the father of these men, and that had power to change them. Of course, my remaining doubts couldn ’ t be helped. 
 Day 111: After more days of wandering Europe, I was finally able to reach the Crossroads. Unfortunately, I had to make a hire. I walked to the stone floor to find that the sarcophagus that housed my soul was falling apart. I asked for a perch on the other side, and being inexperienced in prayer, walked to a small sarcophagus that covered the part of my body that had been engulfed in burning pain. It took me about fifteen minutes to climb the circular stone dome, and it was literally *less* than fifty feet down. I started filling the sarcophagus, I was greeted by strange red robed men and women, all writhing in pain and screaming. I worked my way up, having trouble finding the sarcophagus. As I reached the top, I noticed something changed... something must have gotten there. I began to fear that the man in the sarcophagus had abandoned me, and was now running from me. The devil in heaven started to appear. There was another man in the building next to the sarcophagus, proclaiming that he was to be executed. I frowned a little, but then realized that *he* had reached the end of his rope. I then became uneasy. “ Why didn ’ t you leave me here, eh? ” the man said to me. “ You bought my soul because of the Crossroads, remember? Don ’ t you understand? We both know what it has to do with the Crossroads. Do you know the truth? ” I then realized, “ why would *he* leave me here? What will I gain? ” I sat back down in my stone pit. “ Well, hey listen, you don ’ t have to be greedy. I will give you 20 years. ”

Patrick scratched his chin, frowning. There was an almost insincere jolt of relief in his stomach. The leaves in the tree tops shimmered in the moonlight. Patrick hated being the only one who witnessed Halloween. 
 Patrick cursed. " Yeah, it's Halloween. " 
 The last thing Patrick remembered before the Draconic Hauntings was his young brain unable to process any things other than being disturbed or seeing something disgusting coming out of his head. Patrick had been for most of his life. A pleasant tall farmer, standing on his porch with a teenage son. One night after 9 years of love, Patrick and the boy had sat down and watched the sunrise before sunset. At one point, the son had gone up to the porch, tried to whip out a barbiturate based propane flame, and rolled out of his room and began the long slow crawl towards a dark alleyway. 
 " Whoa! " Patrick shouted. The boy had looked so nervous. " I'm not gon na die! I'm gon na die! I can't die, I can't die! " 
 The boy, now 12 years old, had silently made his way into the alley, somewhat unnaturally. 
 " My Dad said the rules were simple, " said Patrick. " If you wanted to stay here you would have to be quick. You have to avoid the problem. " 
 Patrick felt the look of frustration, something the boy had ignored almost four months before. 
 " I should have stuck around like this! " 
 Another feeling of relief came over Patrick. This time, his fear had turned into concern. 
 " You really woulda enjoyed that smoke? " Patrick's tone of voice snapped Patrick's jaw. The boy had made his way into the alley and seemed to be chased by an enormous beast. Patrick had already missed the opportunity of it approaching him. 
 The beast started moving towards Patrick. Patrick didn't stop to think about it. 
 " Get over here and not sneak off in the alley. " Patrick could feel his mother rushing by him. He felt anger building inside of himself. 
 " Hey. " The monster to his left seemed to have grown dimmer and dimmer. The boy's gaze turned to the blood red pinched on his forehead. 
 " Why won't you do this? " Patrick couldn't tell if the horror was a self respect reaction or if the boy simply accepted it. 
 " She was making fun of me for stealing your whiskey. I think that's what this mess is about. She seems to have gotten hung up on me like everyone else. What do you want from me? " The boy turned back to face Patrick. 
 Patrick quietly thanked the monster. He thanked his Mother for being merciful. In the recesses of his mind, he tried to commit himself to death once more. Still, there was still a slight chuckle in the boy's voice. 
 " What the hell, Patrick? " The monster's head tilted up again. " You've made a great friend. " 
 " What the hell are you talking about? That wasn't fair, really. They had kids now. " 
 " Yeah, Mommy and Daddy went to the park like we always do. We went there to break up that silly mishap and snuck back home. I came back and put my blanket and blanket up over my body. I didn't see him. I thought he was dead. " 
 The monster grinned. " He was just *talking*. " 
 " What!? " Patrick said. 
 " He wouldn't like me for it. What are you talking about? " The monster's torso shifted around under its own weight. 
 " You didn't do it. You're not planning on hurting me. " Patrick did not know that. 
 " But I know you would. " The monster smiled. It gave a sharp nasal laugh. 
 " See? I know you were meant to be a wolf, you did." Patrick's mouth was still swishing, but his hands stopped shaking.

The Korean war had begun roughly twenty years ago, taking almost fifty thousand lives. As far as I could tell, it had never started on the surface, as the Koreans were only about the size of their cities. Fewer than 200 were in hiding. And only nineteen surviving Korean people survived; my remaining crew was the whole squad were all Japanese. 
 The biggest difference was our primary weapons group was comprised of the Panzer's, Bolt's, and D-Bombs. Everything else held the metal blast. Small Arms Tanks, Lasers, Rifles, not big arms like 1st generation rifles. The other two Germans were equipped with M60 and 15mm guns. 
 People in China were forced to stay underground for at least two years. Many old souls could only see the opposite wall; sometimes one day, a blizzard might come and block off a couple blocks. So Chinese guerrillas were forced to march into these areas, with heavy machine guns in an effort to kill these bastards before they could reach their own shelters. The best part of it all? Everyone enjoyed the view. 
 Eventually I was sent to the other side of the wall to start meself as the main attacking force. Which didn't last very long. Of the soldiers I fought, two suffered considerable casualties; mine was killed earlier, but my brother was the only survivor of the Koreans and I was nonetheless one of the few to survive. 
 I soon learned that the Imperial Army would arrive at this point, and with our tanks and the other encircled forces I could just draw a line through the jungles of North and South China. The most obvious danger was the massive influx of Korean refugees trying to go to Asia. 
 Once the KMD hit the garrison, my would-be captors were stopped and began the assault on the rest of the North Korean fleet. Three Japanese blasters fell from the sky in the next room, sending a shiver down the cheek of nearly everyone on the stage. Then the friendly fire began. 
 People here began to notice the distortions of Japanese guards. I thought they must have been equipment blown out while preparing for combat. Holes broke loose, and arcs of green smoke shot out, a consistent black-and-white color. 
 Most people froze in their seats, but I overheard whispers of men running towards the crippled armor of their "musketry officers. " Not even a half-hearted pose could get them down into a crouch. The Japanese emerged from cover and began firing towards us, with a deep crouch that threatened every US soldier on the field. 
 Most of our firepower came from our intermediate technology. Nuclear, but one of the best weapons of the time. With our tanks and artillery in our line, our artillery could detect any threat. 
 I heard one of our nuclear engineers say that they could just drop an entire squad of oil drum shells on the enemy in mere seconds. Me and my team quickly evacuated the theater center. 
 The D-Bombs were our only way to destroy the the enemy artillery before their artillery could penetrate our defenses. But one of them played with one of our KMNT-G mares, one of the best bazookas in the division. He pulled the trigger in a loud metallic voice that echoed loudly, like steel. 
 All the smoke from the exploding men exploded upon impact. I was ordered to take cover by my men, but I was quickly followed by others. While I had little time to hide, I was ordered to fire another round towards the D-Bombs until they fell and was unable to do anything else; everyone else was ordered to alert the ICBM squad to ensure the safety of the children within. 
 Several American fighters were sent to nearby locations so that my men could pick them up and instruct them on how to leave; but all I could do was wait, waiting for them to get the hell out. 
 As I reached the confines of what looked like a pyramid, I was pulled back at the last second by several Japanese American soldiers that we had fought for so long. My archers managed to shoot enough to break my rear, and as I stumbled backwards into the jungle they set me free, letting me go free from the bullets of the falling bodies. 
 It took nearly twenty years to figure out what the hell it was that killed my brother. But he wasn't the only survivor of Kim Jong-un's lethal ambush. 
 Like all great giants, he was quite different from the rest, though. Quite frankly, I didn't know why he would want to destroy China.

“ They should have sent a poet. ” Spoken the other day to a stranger on my friend ’ s walk-in. The man on my phone had come to my walk-in's and talked to me a couple of times, yet today he made me laugh. They should have sent a poet. Maybe they didn ’ t send a poet. 
 **He stared at me ’ s voice for a long moment before he whispered, “ Why then? ” ** 
 “ Just ask yourself that when he calls me, ” I replied. 
 **It was a question that asked the elephant my best friend asked every night. ** 
 **He always was right. ** 
 I sighed. “ No one did. I may have filled a void but I still felt that way. I mean, in the end I know that nobody really gave me a choice when it came to my life. I'm a foot taller than you, a lighter weight than you, but with you I could have stood, walked, sprinted and a king by myself. It was a breath of fresh air. ” 
 **Spoken, angrily, as the stranger approached me. ** 
 “ What would you *say* to me? ” 
 **You talked about my grandmother. ** 
 “ You talk about *dirtbags*. ” 
 **That's a strange name, it always gets recycled. ** 
 “ But there was nothing about your grandmother. She ’ s just had a bad day. She was like a house of cards. ” 
 **I look at the stranger with deep relief, “ She loves my grandmother, that ’ s the one I love. She ’ s like a brother to me. ** 
 **This was far from the truth. ** 
 I growl and nod. 
 **You are my only friend. **

They all laugh. Someone would shout out that their new, new holiday will be less religious than it was before. The silence is cruel for Sam longs for it to end. How long? Time has little meaning here now as the ship slumps to the side. The ancient savages live only another century, counting on its place in their history and naming their new program. For the souls of those who long to leave here, they are long gone. 
 It was madrassas that tore the pilgrim's path from his soul. It was after they burned the pilgrim's birthplace, before the abomination they saw became greater than any civilization before them. Four thousand souls and that's all it took. 
 Sam was going for it, coming down here to watch the one true deity, Kalra, worship. It's no wonder he felt so alone. Now Kalra has carved out an unbroken path that is long and narrow. It's not as though there's much more to do with his journeys than settling your minds. Of course the End is near, but until then he has an excuse. He looks out the battered door to the hubbub of that festival. There is no God, but he is pleased with it. 
 He keeps trying to speak to the living. They never hear him. He speaks into the water they walk through. There are no birds here, though there are the sounds of wild palms. To make matters worse, the harsh ocean washes over Sam's own great work. The enormous crowds at this festival on this barren world pass by often as if a breeze blows past them. They look up from their work, shudder and look up. When he speaks he usually is incredulous. 
 They must speak with him. They must. But only if he breaks them, or if he ties them together, even if they aren't people. At the end of this journey, he feels like they must find someone who truly exists. Sam knows he must, but no one else has. 
 Sam says good-bye to the ones who embrace it for now. He looks out, sees the flood of back water, and starts to stir again. A messenger dies in front of him, so he enters the gates of Triton, to seal the way for the madrassas. They bring one to him, and he welcomes them into the city at sunset. He is welcomed, beautiful. 
 He brings the woman home, and she whispers a single word into his ear. She didn't build the lighthouse, she wanted the elves to heal. The Rites of Passage was their folly. It took two thousand of them to stop the mystical heresy they created.

This beautiful dinner was a welcoming love, a warm one, an unfiltered friendship, certainly no quandary. I had hoped to make my evening meal as friendly as the breakfast in the loft, the normal kind. Those standards were now not achievable. 
 Yet in my hunger, fear for power or worldly possessions, this luncheon fit, my watch was stolen and devoured by the well-guarded slavers. Each handful after second the curse did not dage. Even the little short lived meal would dwindle from scornful chattering to death, the endless gurgling of the hunger and the anticipation of foaming at the mouth. 
 Her smile and soft locks of hair flushed like the fireflies in the fire. I had wondered what angelic almighty might be of such wonderful creations. I had wanted to take her side and make my guests love me. She knew the truth. She was the fulcrum of wealth and power. But there was no more heartwarming meal for me. Not after what had been left in the loft. 
 She turned and muttered something to my left. It was like the wind now singed through the cold wood of my coat, cold black as the ground beneath me. One eye was trembling as though listening to the call of a lion. These were the bad days. With those poor fools, I would get too close to the battle. 
 I lurched forwards as fast as my blue eyes could see. She stalked about the room, while still I could see my beloved curled up in my arms. What she did, she knew. She was protecting me. 
 "Beware, baby, no fool dares use this. " 
 " Not this, *you*, " she whispered and scooped her into my hands. I licked her dry, and then she was gone. 
 " The number one choice here, " I said with grim reproach. " You have abandoned me like your lies. I shall die for you."

In the beginning, I dreamed of sitting on the street, wheeling along and going up in the air, floating. She was beautiful. Just another thing on the world, anyway. I could see the corner of her mouth gaping open. When I'd asked her if I'd been crying, she would have turned to me and said she was. She'd smiled back and said she'd been crying too, I didn't know what to think. I guess I had a good little reason to have slept with her. I told her I wouldn't cry that night, but a blinding flash of light took me away. 
 That night was still burning to this day. All I could do was look up at her, moving faster than the loud bangs of the thousands of cars crashing on the road. I had done it again. It was only a matter of time. I could leave the sun, watch her smile, and at the end of the day we'll be lovers forever. The cars seemed to keep going on and on in silence as I went on and on, hoping for more in the night but quickly getting quieter and quieter, hoping she was right. 
 I just didn't have time to be sad about her loss, anymore. The light was fading. She was alive again, her smile shone on the bright road but still it was cold, so I got in my car and drove away.

It's impossible. This is his punishment. 
 "I'm sorry, but I hate to do it like this, but we're going to be in this together. I'll do whatever is necessary and I hope it's just a bit a bit. You guys saved me. " 
 My head split as I looked at her. She had already twisted around from side to side in the lunge; flailing her arms, pulling her hair into a ponytail. Her face was red and she looked threatening, but it seemed to make the air in front of her seem colder, like an open tarp a few feet away. 
 " Hey babe, I am so sorry I had to do it. Don't take it that seriously and I just wanted to say I love you. What's your name? " 
 She was starting to talk, her face still grim. She swallowed hard, trying to regain composure. 
 " Kieth. I love you." 
 It was my turn to wriggle through the chair in front of me, trying to get a glimpse of her face before she fixed me with her arms. This was the first time I had seen her face this way and it was a testament to her words, her beauty. 
 I readied myself for the arc of action. 
 Her lips were sharp and she kissed me between my fingers, and we were both at ease. This was the first time she had held a touch.

The city which I visit... I just really hate it... 
 It's a terrible place. It's a death trap because when there's no air or food there's no life. There's people who can't eat so they try to eat themselves and their self-inflicted bile. There's bodies everywhere, and people who think they might be trying to kill themselves on the first attempt. 
 But I don't think I've ever been in this situation before. I thought I was going to be the last person left on earth, but after two weeks of fighting with each other and every order in my gut I realized I was in a much different place now. The priests, the priests who made my life easier. 
 So I did what any good lunatic would do. I sought to return to my people, but I soon discovered that there wasn't much I could do to convince them not to try. 
 First I arrived to not only fortify these people to the bottom of their stomachs and those who would follow them, but to inform them that they had been more wise to follow what the Christians had preached, then I flew all around them in order to see what they would become. They fell into chains and they died on impact. Then the next morning they started killing themselves. 
 The last thing I saw was the apparition of an onyx golem, and in front of me was a soldier dressed as a priest. I quickly ran to their position with all my good will and I told them to bow. They bow as well because they agreed. I said "Bless you." and the army burst into flames. Then I collapsed in my prayer chair when I realized the burning all over my little town was due to the fire. I tried to get up in hopes of a stronger faith in life and how the church was composed but my hands were shaking and I couldn't even feel my skin. For once I understood why I was standing before what would now become my lives. 
 And I was never more afraid because when I burst into flames I was on a hill right next to where I had come from. I looked up and everybody looked up. Every house had been burned down, the bankers and politicians had left with their families and several collapsed into the streets. They ran to the center of town hoping for any sign of what I would come across. But it was nothing but flames and still nothing but joy. 
 They weren't there to take me to God, they were there to do me a favor and release me from this pit so they could kill me for what they did. They smiled as I lay dying by that fire, and then they fled from the screams as they chased me away. They couldn't hold out much longer as they both ran away and began to run after me. 
 Then I was so depressed, that I started thinking about the sheep. They've been slaughtered before, like a rag doll. But I can't count the number of sheep that I've been in the living for over a year now. There were lots before my eyes but now they're everywhere. They're burning me from beneath and they are clambering up the hill. 
 But I am not moving. I have no hope of life, I am empty, and I can only look at the burnt buildings all around and contemplate how there are more? They won't help me either. 
 Maybe the priests are right. Then when their angry, killing eyes see me they will see all they ever saw.

Master Scrooge looked up at me, his lungs filled with smoke. I looked down at my hands as if we'd met something. Slowly, the smoke spread like wind around us. A droning noise covered every aspect of our hearing. I could hear faint noises in the distance, like a man saying, "Welcome to the forest ". 
 I reluctantly looked to my left towards my family. I lay down on the grass, panting and squirming, and stopped panting. The snow began to fall, and the town sirens sounded through the silent trees. 
 I jogged back up the hill. The road was empty. I pulled a cartful of chips out of my cart, and picked them up. I couldn't find the ranch but I noticed that it was frequently open. I noticed that there were no cars, and that the road had always been deserted. 
 I pulled into the warm summer air. 
 " These are kiwi chips, " I said to my neighbors. They returned the warm chips to me. 
 " You can buy this, and that's good! " I growled to my wife. 
 " Thank you! " she replied, tears streaming down her face. 
 I walked into our bedroom and the cold air sucked us in. 
 " Oh... you aren't in the snow? " I asked my wife. 
 " Honey, I'm fine! You're alright! " My eyes growled with tears. My wife shut her eyes and took them back. She returned them. " We promised you two cookies and we promise we will be here one more time, okay? " 
 " No... Daddy..." I opened my eyes and stepped out the window. I saw a moon falling over the forest. 
 I quietly stood up and got dressed. I took the towel from behind me and ran towards the house. I took the newspaper and took a deep breath.

"The results, now, are on the table, " the counselor sighed, gesturing to the sheet of pen he laid about in front of him. " They seem to be... " 
 " This is it, " the chief scientist sighed as the assistant wiped his hands on the edge of his coat and took a seat on the court one last time. * He doesn't know the child, and this isn't going to change that, but he sure can help this organization. * 
 " I believe the results are true, " he sighed. He pressed the question to the jury, which was debating for the last time. * Please? * 
 " The response was... you know, " said the prosecutor, leaning back in his chair. " You were representing the thesis you made about the link between chimpanzees, Neanderthal, and Bacillus cereus, to more specifically... " 
 " Yes, " the assistant interjected. " The link seems to be strongest in all species. According to genetics, your research seems to be developing sperm lines, to... we must determine what triggers this mutation in our brains. " 
 The prosecutor was wracking his brain for an answer, but that was all that was left. * No, no, no, * he grimaced, *I mean, while I strongly believe that chimpanzees have been found to have a male counterpart to the Bacillus cereus, I don't think these samples are likely to be the breeding stock of any diverse human group. * 
 The court erupted in rejoicing. " This court is in recess, and adjourned, " said the assistant, sadly, " Because you saw this, you know something can not be ruled out."

The raft slid up the slippery bank. Bearded and frozen the tiny creatures flew up. 
 After an additional 2 of their way journey they had come to the large vessel under my feet and got to my bank in a split second. I held my breath. The boat was turned around, loosing momentum into the dinghy. It started roaring now. 
 ''This is an emergency, Mike!'' 
 “ Give me the cargo, Cockra. ” He threw me off the boat and onto the side of the levelled building. Outside were the bodies of the giants he thought he rescued? His crew woke up to the voices in their heads. 
 '“ Shit, everybody, now lets go!' They all shouted. The drums pounded in their ears, echoing throughout the old buildings. “ We should find more cargo.' 
 My dad came up and sat on the ledge next to me, sobbing, choking himself, looking dead serious. He felt the bones on his arms itch, turning up the back of his neck. “ That was an accident.' 
 “ The monster must have been resting, ” he said, eyes full of worry. The others were too busy speaking to believe they had just been rescued. 
 “ I will never forget the fool, ” Jim managed. It was him. He only had 2 eyes, but his wide ones were full of smiles. All of them wide but mine. 
 “ Tell him that it's time, mate. ” 
 This was hardly his first rescue. Some people on the boat believed it was a mistake. Jim had saved his uncle from drowning and he did more than the other. He was on the best of terms with the people he claimed to be protecting. John Linares fell from a balcony overlooking the village, fell on some rocks, and more recently had died in an accident, falling in the pond and drowned. 
 Mummy Peisley, she had believed him to be the one. She knew he needed to know. “ Stand in the room and I will know. ” She held up a loose hand to light a fire. “ I will never tell you my secret. I love you Nick. I love you very much. ” The room fell silent. 
 Scott Ryder was still well asleep in his chair. His feet rested on the edge of the bed. The next thing he remembered, he thought he heard the laughter of his victims. “ The world is about to change... ” He thought, heading to the door. A thin-faced man. It was actually him. I already knew who he was. " Charlie. " 
 “ Hey. " He turned around and walked back to his flat. He found a chair in a hospital, as though he could find a suitable bed. The little blue finger of his hand topping over his head used his own pocket card to pick it up. " Where the hell are you going? " He began to go down the stairs. 
 " What the fuck is that? " The blond man next to him gasped in shock. 
 " Don't worry Mike. I need to know where you are. I told you.... " He looked to the girl, still wince, looking like he was about to faint. " You are the only one of the few without fish and bear to help me get these supplies back into your lair. Your savior. " The kid mewled. 
 “ I am the one who rescued the monsters in this case, ” She said firmly. " The one who paid my debts. You are all my people, and my own. " 
 “ I am the first in the family, ” The blond man said quietly, reaching up and taking his own hand. He took a long drag. " Mute. ” 
 The blond man didn't say a word. 
 “ What the fuck? ” 
 " What the fuck?" 
 From somewhere behind him came the rustling noise of a small houseboat as John Linares recoiled in fear, the sound of a life-sized pool outside barely muffling his crying, when he saw the mouthy grin on the boy's face. 
 “ It's time to go. ” He grabbed the boy and led him off into the skies.

I stare at the dark room as my head slows so that I ’ m facing the wall while looking down. Two of those mouths rattle with what feels like the calling of some new animal. It's a distinct cry, the kind of cry that cuts me open and shuts my own mind for what feels like the thousandth time. 
 I sit back down, take another look at my ceiling. It ’ s beautiful, unaccustomed to the day. The room is cold enough that I may not ever feel fear, but where my fears run amok, there ’ s no need to worry. 
 These eyes are a place of hope. Sometimes, these eyes close, there will be a breakthrough. A new book to read. A new opportunity to change the world. 
 The sun can be up, the breeze can be relaxing. It can be everywhere, I can walk anywhere.

"When you come across this stables once more, you will be surprised at how pure and radiant all of you are... Be not deceived, for I am not a king, I am aghast at this wonderful world you represent... " 
 Ungol greeted the king as king after king no sooner had man been summoned than the skies above plunged into darkness. 
 " Indeed I am just but an ordinary man who was banished to the dark depths of hell... Hell, it has become the rumor that banished devils are of human terror. Death by witch and righteousness... Or force of will... " 
 " No, king, I only wish to know how this world of yours is secretly holding you prisoner, and you will never utter a single thing about it. You speak only as the king? " 
 " Yes... lord. You speak with the air, and for every powerful hand you have engaged, your answer comes with slithering glee. 
 The trick is, lord, I am not deluded... The two must meet upon the Great River after a few hours of strained debating on the boundaries of personhood.... " 
 " Moanna. Come to me like a stone. Come to me... " 
 " Yes. Come to me, not like water in a prison. Come to me... " 
 " Father, I desire to assist your father. In this time of war you will have to play a role as the King of Winterfell? " 
 Ungol pointed to the man behind him, Tyrion III. 
 " Raël, come back now."

MINE? 
 What is this place? 
 There's no such thing as a past life. Every one of us has found a job and we all start anew. People come here for their lives, their want, their dreams. They come to see this place, and it's bright and inspiring. You can literally see people's past lives here, starting and ending to see every act they did, want, needs and future to see them see their own. 
 Where have I come from? I haven't lived my whole life to be here. Ahem. My world is filled with ugly people. Their wife is ugly, their kid is ugly, and you never want them to look at you. You see, you have to go through time, time again, so you have to observe the people you see, and keep their future behind you. You get to see new people and new parts of yourself, see their kindness, their humility. You can experience everything, and the universe is full of wonderful things. Like you and them. There are things, and things are beautiful. But you really have to choose the happy ones, because they can't always be happy, because you are always going through their beauty. 
 But that's easy. You see, people come here for their careers, their dreams, their hopes. And by the time they make a decision about what to do with their lives, they have read the news, and they see the crazy, or the cruel, or the insane. People see those, see their life choices, see their dreams. If you have an honest job, look up to yourself, and listen to your surroundings, you know that you don't know anything, but you see things you have never said, and it adds to the witness testimonials. A life you have never truly wanted, looks ever so much like your own, so much less a life you can experience. 
 And the guy who told me he had go thru grad school was going through business school. He found this place before he graduated, got his degree, and worked his way up from the other's. And he's looked the store down from here every day for five years. 
 I think I'm going to get to experience this place when I'm not alone.

My memories began pouring back in. I feel as if I was just a child, dreaming in my nightmares. The bugs in my head screamed, waking up in the morning, but when I woke they were gone. 
 I spent every waking moment feeling the world shift and turning. Every dream and waking moment of my life was spent in a moment of pain. A most grievous pain, one I could not walk away from. Hell, I could not walk off the city sidewalk at that point. 
 Then, one day, I had an amazing dream. I woke up and my father came walking in. My mother was lying, gazing at the ceiling. I was asleep, in my bed, an upside down pyramid glowing in the morning light. And then my father came out of my dream. 
 I remember him grabbing my hand, pointing a claw at me and demanding that I stop. I won't lie, I did what he asked. I dragged him out and we continued moving to the basement, music playing on all 4 walls. I decided we could take a break, that we wouldn't be alone anymore. 
 I woke up next to the man, trying to convince him that something bad was going to happen to me. He didn't answer me and we became a complete herd. There were rumors of festering disorders or war, someone claimed some sort of love of technology. There were rumors that some sort of demonic vision had changed my life, and that I had lived vicariously through both of my parents' visions in my head. 
 Another time, I met a girl named Laura, our story over. Laura began talking about going with my dad when he was transferred overseas with his ghost troops. Laura's father's ghost army kept her safe until the war came, and most of the other armies had perished in the war. Laura left us in peace as she did every other night. 
 I chose to stay behind, the only other place I could call home, so that my actions had the consequences I asked for: leave the world I knew, and enjoy my life happily. But I was too afraid to walk back. So I sent Laura there, where I could see the great view that she saw before my eyes. I tried to chat with her, but I couldn't remember a word. And she didn't know that I knew she was the one. I cried for hours in the months that followed. 
 Now, I cry for a long time before the day comes. My hands are shaking and tingling. I don't remember when I started crying, but that is because one night, I had this amazing dream. I woke up and I walked to the library. The man was gone, and I still remember the day that I found her. I came up to her and carried her up the aisle, like I always do when I walk into the library. 
 She looked up at me like I was crazy, and said, "It's for the better. Your research has shown that I am indeed not the only one in hell, with half the devils in the parcilles army, and you are away on you mission to the US. Many years after I came to this world, through the offer of an Ocolepsy, you traveled with your father, who sent you back with a ghost army. " 
 Her smile turned pale. " Yes? " 
 " Yes, just like the Ocolepsy. You will find information that makes you happy again, and you will enter the world. People will love you, and you will become everyone's friend. " She touched my hand lightly. " As much as I love you, I only want you to be safe here in hell. I will return for a few more days, and again, in order to repay you, I will show you a vision, and you can see it. " 
 I looked back at her, seeing that it was the final thoughts I remembered. " Goodbye, her". 
 And with that, she vanished.

"I just think it's dangerous " he muttered to himself as he closed his eyes. The light reflected off of the blinds making them glow a ton, making them a beige canvas that was still slightly in perfect shape. 
 " Guess it ’ s my first time " Jim asked as he scanned the next figure. He was not tall, so not exactly bad. Thick rather than short but not as thin as Jim intended, it was his natural hairline that shone through his scalp and into the white filter below it. The hair fell off like a lead ball on a warm spring afternoon and the bottom had turned brown. Jim studied the outline of the face with his hands. It was long but still nothing too defining, what he was looking at was impossible to guess. 
 He began slowly digging around in his pocket. As his thumb scanned the hard end of his credit card he realised he had nearly paid the amount for it. Jim read the card number until he found it was changed to a scam link. 
 " Uh, " he said confused and not exactly prepared for what he had just read. He placed a finger on the center of the card so it became. 
 " It ’ s nothing " The e-mail said, but he didn ’ t know why. 
 Jim wondered how he was going to make money. He had always wanted to be famous, he had always wanted to make a million dollars. Money wasn ’ t something that he could just do easily. But nobody as small as Jim ever wanted to be famous, not just with his benefit and not his career. Jim never liked his career, but he had always hoped for it and it was good that he could not let it go. He didn ’ t want to live for the fame, not like everyone else. But he was unique. He had seen everything, every " celebrity " like Jim imagined. He was loved. 
 At last, after looking at the card again, it had changed to a new link.

It was the nightmare. Mostly I'm not sure. The terrors and infernos of the highest and the most kind of skulled men. They call me Alphody. I once participated in the yearly hunt of the granite mega-villians when I hadn't met anyone. 
 It was three in the afternoon and I was just doing my chores when I saw it. Ice tunneled through the sidewalk that has been torn away by the approaching ram. The ground rumpled and lashed, its surface hanging weakly across the street. As it slid across the wind, it swung far out at me. More of the same. I ran, and the tunnel was crushed beneath me. That's when I saw it. It was a smaller creature that stood now with its huge black legs extended back and grasping at my neck. It was standing in a display room. No a back, no neck. None. Nothing that stood out from that really. Why? My gut felt stinging, like I hadn't eaten in days. What had I eaten? A nice, dense blanket that I can't stand. 
 I dashed out of the tunnel. They are built like trees, each one thicker than the last. My legs were numb at first, too numb to crawl through the hay. Still, it was still in me. I got a good look at the other one. It was trying to find the rock tunnel. It was scaled up to 28 ft tall by 35ft in one direction and was moving violently. It no longer stretched its arms nor legs and then swished its limbs backwards. 
 It was actually levitating on the ground, bending itself. The flesh of it seemed to swell in an astonishing voracity. It was stiff and it seemed at peace. I leaped over the walls of the display room and rested my back against the wall. 
 A voice echoed through the metal as the world slowed to a crawl. " Alphody, you have called to report to the stone tube drop, and we only have 1 minutes to assist, so your punishment is to be swiftly served."

 " Of course " 
 " Hey, it looks like you guys do good " 
 " Okay, fine, I'll just say, do you think we'll get a decent fat, fit, gay, dog-faced ball of dude blood " 
 " Oh, sure " 
 " Come on man "

 " That one will be a bit farther down the street " 
 " Great, where we're going, and you guys are going, no stairs! " 
 " Well it'll be between about five " 
 " I'll be right down! " 
 " Not going, I'm fine, just at the little hallway. " 
 " Okay, yeah, man, it's okay, just the entrance and exits and you'll just have to turn right on the back ramp " 
 " I'm just being transparent man, you know I've a point " 
 " You can use the drive by, don't stop "

There's nothing wrong with abusing the powers he sought when he was younger. When he first came across a woman before him, he told her something about improving lives. " Give it a rest ". Now, the women on the way to the business get more urgent offers that he hasn't even touched. He sometimes looks at her when he sees her, but not enough to know what to say. She's not as bright, or as fast as he thought. Yet he doesn't stop to wonder who the woman is, and sometimes he wonders what the power he sought could accomplish. The only things the woman could have gotten from him was a smile. He doesn't think of it as revenge, or revenge for being wrong. Instead, he thinks of other ways he could better the lives of those he cared for more. He could move mountains or kill lots. It doesn't matter. He wants to focus on the woman as much as he can to prevent trouble. He hopes that this story won't harm anyone if his actions get caught. This truth is the very essence of strength.

Staring at the horizon, the child looked up from his writing prompt to admire the majestic beauty. His wife was away for his 11th birthday, and they both figured it best to get out of there early and get to see another family together. That was, until it collided with a large rock. The chattering turned into a battle of wits until their companion pulled it back to its and managed to break the fight. It tore through the front door, a youth barely nine with his smock up, and shattered the front window to reveal a snowy green fog blowing through his already frosted cheekbones. It was all that awaited. A short chain fell down the entryway, and drowned out the falling rain. He closed his eyes and waited for a thunderstorm to pick up and cut through. Once he opened his eyes and the blaring whistling of thunder and lightning hadn't stopped, he asked another question in his head. 
 "Dad? " 
 A young woman, of average height and build, broke away from his sight with a mischievous grin on her face. 
 " Very funny, any of you remember when that thing happened? " 
 The child turned to face the woman, a smile forming in his eyes. " Guess I never could have guessed I'd be dead now anyway, aren't I? " 
 " You're not, dear. They're from thirty minutes ago, and we've been trying to rebuild them. Now, all you need to do is throw a perfect hole in the prime web you've been working on, and I'll send you on the journey to finish yours. " 
 " Which ones? " 
 " The ones between D-Day, Comet of the Rim, and the coming year. " 
 The child glanced at her brother, who was trying to go forward as if there was really a problem between them. 
 " That had to be one of them, my cousin. " 
 She understood, and nodded at him slowly. 
 " Others? Like The Wayward Greys from Halloween episode fifty. They have their own backstories, but nothing as cheesy as this one. That was definitely one of them, if not the stoner one. We'll have to make sure they're from the future." 
 She smiled at him, and so the two went off to explore their plan.

The code is hardwired to each object and wasn't only meant for you; 
 The person that has it on they send it to you. And you take the fastest one, if they're not careful they'll leave, so the thing don't flinch. 
 Sometimes they used to fall asleep on the sofa, or behind a door or furniture. They said because someone laid in it and found it hardwired but there was enough time so they left it running. You never caught it but it got you through a job bad enough that you could get laid but you never got a job good enough to want it. 
 They needed this box because there was a lot of documents in the mail and some pockets that they didn't make with good teeth. 
 So you can't touch it or walk away. 
 Remember what I said, hand it to me. If you have any objections, I won't bore you. Now. Just think about it. What if you see a bubble in the middle of the plastic? It gave you a chance, and it made a point to hide. Your chance could get you to take it but it could give you the stuff that you needed it for. 
 Start a walk for a while, if you can walk. 
 Start saving your body, it'll save you, so say goodbye.

There I was, in the midst of the massive wars and revolutions. Secessionists and speculators worried about where my big break was, just for me. But, as I was thinking, I suddenly realized something: Despite this huge success, actually, more people would die between my becoming partners, and me coming into my office. 
 This didn't bother me until now. A few months ago, however, I was about to get a call, tell someone. They had I. Which I didn't even know. But, seeing what I did, it didn't matter. Maybe not. 
 **When Is A Nation Tragedy? ** 
 **I have come for the past five years since they first began writing my reports.** 
 I knew that something was different. I could feel it. It was getting harder and harder to believe. I finally understood why they had been delayed by twenty years. 
 **I have come for the future of America. ** 
 *Pull Up. * I thought. * To find the bounty that has eluded me in the twenty-two years since the Vermont Revolution. * 
 Was I really the only one to see things like this? The entirety of America simply became. I had to break out and become an indivisible, semi-independent, and revolutionary nation. There were too many to count. 
 I did not want to take the world with me. I had to break out of being an unknown. I had to send an army to conquer this in my name. I had to make it stop. I needed the slightest increase of her ire. 
 But, nothing happened. Even when the messenger was hung up on, I made sure that none of her words spoke the end of my sentence. I asked her what would stop me now. She blurted out a single word and placed it directly in my face, with the middle face square. 
 *YEAR OF TIME OF TRAVEL. ** 
 "Are you insane? " I called out. 
 " Nothing? " She looked at me strangely. 
 " It's not that I didn't like it, " I said. 
 She looked back at me, and she started to tear up. " We can not walk away from this. * Fucking*, *you*! " 
 My heart sank, and I began to sweat uncontrollably. It never had been such a hard year on this earth before. I even published a book... with a couple bullet points of dissenters... and got some big ole fee for it. 
 I had a small office in New York. Only three more hours left before I would get another call, and I would make my wish. Finally, I had a whole country to defend. But, like a whirlpool of nightmare, all I had was time to change the future. 
 What did I say? I couldn't think clearly. I had to write them down. I just needed to help. 
 My wish seemed to sail in her general direction. I grabbed her arm, and I gripped her hand to hold it for a few brief moments before going to my desk to begin writing. 
 My time finally came. My dream suddenly exploded into reality, and I smiled to myself. 
 The Wall, my throne, stood on the roof of the White House. Standing guard, huge screen, in front of the wall. 
 Not some insulting remark, but I met myself. Long time no see. Wasn't it funny when people get really close to the wall, talking to you and going away. 
 That's when I heard a noise, from behind me. 
 *The aliens have arrived. Now let them prove that we exist. * 
 *There is another world, and they want me to join them. * 
 *But we don't. * 
 *We are different. * 
 *And there's a war going on in the west. They'll decide soon. * 
 She's gone now. It was too much to bear. I missed her. The last thing I remember was walking down this very edge of the vast expanse I had just walked. 
 The first steps to the White House have always been our own. We tried to walk on, in order to find out what would happen. None of the "people" in my office ever wanted to travel fast enough to know that. 
 I don't think I could hold off one of those fingers.

Damn a deal for a hearty supper. I took your strange opinion and brought my own. 
 “ Hey big prick, you know you coming for dinner after all the other stuff? That ’ s when that going on? ” 
 I get to talk about this in between bites. Don ’ t want to ruin the night. 
 It was an old favorite on our part, of course. I'd seen *billions* of bright spots in the streets. It was even closer to my favorite place when i saw a man who could make it all the way from his house. I ’ d heard of him too, seeing him smoke it up on the playground and living a good life. That must ’ ve given him a ton of perks, if you ask me. 
 He ’ d only made it to the playground a week ago, they had left after a while, and the vending machine in the middle told us there was no chance he'd be watching all those children, put away in a dorm. It was a very suspicious comment that they found out. 
 So when the professor explained it to him, he just laughed at it. Damn right he had to be such a literal idiot. 
 “ Oh I don ’ t know, maybe he thinks your gonna make it or maybe you like just hanging out with that maniac. Anyways, let ’ s go have a picnic. Who knows? He ’ ll be up there smoking on the park ’ s edge ” 
 Got ta be the man, I muttered to myself as I made my way down the sparrow ’ s front. 
 When I reached the object next, I knocked it over. 
 No chance he ’ d miss. And that really put me off for a little while. 
 The scent of weed made me decide to grab a coffe a bit earlier, I might as well eat. Damn I hope that ’ s some damn good weed. It ’ ll be fun though. 
 Just after I was driving up to the playground, I got lost in the distance, just below the playground. But i guess I could see it before it went dark if you count the ominous signs.

 “ Hi there, big kid ” 
 Hey that ’ s the creepy ones, the ones I thought could sing. Yeah, creepy but... 
 “ Ha, oh come on big guy you ’ re gon na get you hooked on the freedom. ” 
 Yeah good that one. I almost cried. 
 “ Alright girl, I'll be seeing you soon. ” 
 So here we go. Now make sure you ’ re ready and see who realizes what they saw. All I want is to be the next victim of hellfire as the twisted man leaves with this twist of fate.

Work. I ’ ve come and gone, twenty-five years in the future, working on yet another reality where every action is only implied by the one premise in mind; The Future Unfinished. Our lives, yes. But I can ’ t follow it and I ’ ve failed so many times in the past so I doubt I ’ ll ever return to the life the Earth is created with. My skills went through several masters prior to I turned to this; the job was totally meaningless for me, mind you, there was no actual work to be had. It wasn ’ t everyday that you looked back in awe, well… at least I did. " What an 8 year old could have as a warning "…that ’ s what the video played as I cursed into existence the words. I shot a ghost from a distance to point at whatever in the world I see. But I couldn ’ t save it; there was no hint of me that could save it. I was stuck in a weird life for thirty years, a standard subject in all those world events that followed. I could have seen dozens of historical events unfold in front of me now, but all I was trained to do was fight and cry while bringing the self-sustaining soul to life. It took years on end for me to form what could be described as a positive outlook on life for a fairly healthy child. Finally, four years ago, I saw the light. 
 When I turned thirty, I ’ d come to an abrupt halt. All four months of the year were wasted. Oh how painful that. Eight years seemed too short. The city was down to a smoldering ruin after six months. I recovered from my experience, reformed, and then gone. I knew I ’ d do it. I passed the sun to see the desolate landscape. I never saw any stars. It was the most beautiful thing I ’ d ever seen before, truly. They did look so distant. The Earth looked pitch black under the green canopy of the moon. The oceans seemed to be shallow in the underground deserts to the north to the east to the South. Most of the cities had been obliterated. I was set. 
 *Now I ’ ll have a chance* I thought. * The right people could win with this…*

“ We can't afford this child! ” Yürika Theat, Glorious Leader of the Tri-Coast Nazi Party, exclaimed to her injured husband in that booming voice we call letters. 
 Jorin spoke with a high-pitched voice, “ Who else could he turn out to be? ” 
 “ He ’ s not her son, I mean, he ’ s your husband! ” 
 “ Oh, see, that ’ s true. Our son was born the same year, even though his name is Adolf Hitler! ” 
 Jorin smiled with his bestest smile, “ And now his mother has gone mad, demanding my help, making him kill my mother. ” 
 “ Wait, why haven ’ t you sent him an ambulance? ” Geoffrey asked, looking at the door as if it were for him. 
 “ Well, he doesn ’ t fight now, I swear I ’ ve seen it. 
 “ How do you really know I ’ m not in his memory? And his enemy is taking offense to our hobby? " Alois inquired. 
 “ Our legend starts when Billy of Scapehurst got close enough to a three year old bully to haunt him, and then he planned on trying to prevent us from playing in his yard, a tunnel, a field. Billy was quite curious about all the strange things his father could want to have, so we stayed outside until he finally figured it out. ” 
 “ Oh, and this birthday gift he gave to us? ” Geoffrey asked. 
 “ Nope. 
 “ And for what? ” 
 “ Just some paintbrush! ” 
 “ OK, he even went on several visits to random high-rises looking for us! What he did was exactly as if he was a living, breathing machine! ” 
 “ Really? ” 
 “ Well, I ’ m from up in a hill near town so this may as well be fairly ordinary since we ’ re a wee boy. 
 “ Are you hearing me? ” 
 “ Yeah! ” Geertrude shouted in astonishment as she was now yelling about the paintbrush people had given her and about strange things their dad ’ s father told him to paint. 
 “ What do you mean by that? ” Alois asked, appearing shocked as they watched. 
 " Ah, me too, I was watching my son die when Billy painted, were you listening? ” Geoffrey replied. 
 “ See, we covered his bed in paint, only to find that he had already died! ” It seemed that it was happening so fast we had to turn around fast to escape. 
 “ Did I have to do that? ” Geoffrey wanted to defend himself, but his appearance gave him away that that would be all. 
 “ Well now you know what I have to do to kill his mother! ” With a sudden speech of fury, Alois shot a volley of bolts at the wall and Steve the Gamer screeched a bunch of bluts in Steve ’ s face as if it were the greatest sound in the entire world. Geertrude and Geoffrey all collapsed to the ground in shock as they saw how fast they had come and then froze in their tracks as the middle-school girl came running into the house.
“ And now you know why you ’ re on the run? ” Geoffrey asked the first sentence. 
 “ Apparently my mother, one of her secret enemies, that ’ s how they picked us for their spies, the ones who infiltrated their secret russian academies when we were kids! ” 
 “ Huh, too bad! ” Theat exclaimed as she pulled off her hoodie. 
 “ I swear to god, you ’ ll keep me safe! ”

 Well, it wasn't really a good day for Philippe. 
 It was a long walk to something cool, dressed in a crazy punk outfit but dressed in a smelly trench coat and still beautiful. I guess I was happy to share the fact that I had a pack of Shovels to live on. I feel so happy without those things. 
 With all my tears, ever so gently flowing down my face my pet name stepped forward into my apartment, staring at me funny into my eyes. He had a pretty wide smile but I could tell he was trying to mask my sadness. 
 "I don't want a refund. I don't want this anywhere. " I scoffed, holding my right shoe there and gazing into it, eyes right past me. 
 My reflection simply smiled slightly, and my eyes met my own and my head shot up, explaining, " Well, well, to answer your last question nicely you did not ask me to take Shovels. I was very busy with work and so I don't know that was your intention. " 
 Without another word, his face blanched and he stared into mine. " I always had Shovels to pick when my emotions had a huge impact, there are a lot of grey boxes sitting in my closet that you don't ever really see in the setting sun. At least the kind that pink gives you if you thought back to the sesquipedians. " 
 I looked down, my shoe still there. Once again I merely shrugged my shoulders and then finished the necessary cleaning with a smile on my face. He gave me a light smile as well as a fine rock with a cardigan holding his newly come in. I loved being a Shovel. 
 " I really appreciate you having this special gift. It's such a pity I have to walk out of my own house and live this crappy life from my stutter until I can finally get it all out! " He winked his funky nose at me, " if you take it, you can finally spend all this money at the store! ". 
 I sighed, wiping tears from my face with a sly smile, " Of course I have Shovels, I'm sure there'll be one amongst the other Boxes down by the street that I'll take my hands around whenever I get on my knees. You have a beautiful wallet." I stepped towards the shop only to see my reflection flinch, pulling on my shoes as I tried to do so. 
 Having closed the store, I collapsed down, crying for a little longer.

Sitting in my living room was Dr. Zemeckis, Anesthesiologist. Like me, he was just an average guy living life as a normal human being. One stupid house cat littering his lawn and his bored neighbors from out of town littering his area. The city. No one might notice him, still. He and his weirdin' coworkers were always waiting for you, it was annoying, "Being an average guy " was always the worst part. 
 I would sneak down my stairs and stumble, just to bump you. You'd be waiting in the kitchen instead of on the couch, staring up at you hoping to see how you looked. But there was only one man in my kitchen. A man he might be familiar with, or people he'd used before. He sat across from me, the scythe still on his finger to the right of mine. Eyes wide open, he scratched his forehead. 
 " This isn't right, you idiot. " He said. 
 " Is this crazy?! " I wailed. 
 " Yes, yes, yes, yes, mooooooh, GODDAMN it, I have a tattoo on my hand. " He spat angrily as the knife on the kitchen counter spoke to me. 
 " I WONT BE AT YOUR SORRY DRESS!!! " I yelled into the door. 
 Dr. Zemeckis looked up and dropped his scythe to the floor. He hit the floor so hard that his ass landed on the linoleum cushions, catching the knife. 
 " Well fuck, " I whispered to him, after I looked over at him. I closed my eyes and used my scythe to his forehead, asking him if I'd miss this day. 
 " Will you come back, uh, anyways? " He said looking away. 
 " Oh, duh I think we'll see each other outside on that couch in the afternoon." I said to Dr. Zemeckis. 
 We walked back to my living room on the stairs. The stabbing continued, and with every passing second started to hate this man, and yet every damn time Dr. Zemeckis bit me, I could hear his pathetic, secret insecurities deep in my chest. He was truly a leader, he never missed a chance to save us. 
 And now he would finally know who I truly am.

It was a good day. 
 No one really forgets about the old timer's day, which was important as well as my own. We'd crossed the marked line together, but I still remember my promise not to waste my battery. Time is unlimited, but I was getting tiring. 
 The sun started to set. 
 Nothing ever changes at night. I guess I had read the news a few times. I had to move here quickly; getting back home is hard. 
 Despite that, she was still there, and that was my rest. I reached across the bloody bridge to reach her. She was running away, unharmed and undisturbed. I'll never forget the look on her face, never a moment of quiet. 
 She's gone now. I can't cry when I don't know she is gone; no one ever has.

Nate chooses me to narrate a stormy night. He's got a boat full of spirits and was filming us a bad scene with my own. I know the sun's falling, so now we get there. I don't know where in the hell Nate is -- I'm tired from the rough last few nights with some of the crew but I'm still getting used to the cold. 
 He took a long pull of the bottle. " You got a good feeling about the storm tonight, " he said. " Hmm, well I guess we've got time to gas this guy tonight and I'm going to get the... uh, uh, I don't know what to do... " 
 " Anderson, Nate thought you'd make a good host, " I said. " A good good host, right? I mean listen, it's not like a bad scene is going to happen. Just need a few more minutes before the storm makes us nervous and we can keep him awake for three more days. " 
 " Alright sir. I know that's a lot of pressure and I can tell by how much nervous and nervous Nate is. " Nate was fiddling with his bag and looking at his computer. " It looks like something is on the verge of us collapsing. What are you feeling about the storm tonight? " I said as the boat rolled overhead. 
 " Well, as we go below the horizon, I think some wet landing ground has spread several feet and just turned upside down into the opposite direction. Perhaps they're comatose and this is the moment we need to make sure this doesn't happen. " Nate thought through the phone. " I wasn't sure if this was a good idea, but we need to make sure this never happens again. " 
 My eyes stayed on the screen, partially because my mind was blown out by that comment. With a large wave of my hand, the screen broke free from the suit's visor and my vision went blurry. A large tentacle just shot out of Nate's mouth and brought it up to his face. It pulled his face toward the picture in the corner of my eye. 
 " Anderson, there's smoke! " Nate said. " It must be an asteroid. Even if you can think that I am, I don't think that a tornado is going to make it's way in my direction. I swear, there's a huge steel pole in the sky that I doubt anybody's even prepared for in time. " 
 " We need to make sure all the bodies don't get pulled into this toilet back on Earth!" he screamed.

"Hey Mike! " 
 " Shit Mike? " 
 It was the same girl next door, bathing in red. She looked like her sheet, and the red scar over her right hand was the only bright spot. 
 I finished, and looked up to see a woman with bright lipstick all over her face, wearing orange jeans and a tee shirt and white jean shorts. 
 " Chris? " 
 I thought for a long moment, it was a fairly famous basketball coach in high school. Yeah, we always talked about basketball. I got up to see him, I turned my head, a smile showing. 
 " Sure? " 
 " No Chris? " 
 I blinked a few times, I heard her behind me. 
 " No Chris? " 
 I laughed. I thought I recognized her voice. " Chris, I know this place is pretty hot, but maybe you've seen the chicks I call girls if you have the time. " 
 He shook his head. " Eh, OK. Maybe that's why I'm stuck here. What's on my mind? " 
 " Yeah, uh huh. We're going to some sex clubs right now. Just don't knock around. " 
 " Woo-- " 
 And I heard myself laughing. " About what Chris, what's on my mind? " I asked. 
 " I'm like, I think about it, man. " 
 I laughed again. I heard myself whispering to myself as she did it. 
 " Alright... " I dropped the microphone and looked around the room. Just the way everyone talked to each other. 
 " I know what the drill is Mike, and I know how to keep your shit together. " 
 I was pretty good with the chicks myself. That's what made me care about her. We had a little practice. I kissed her on the lips and I started singalong. She got up, grabbed the bottle of soda, and yelled something about taking some chances and me listening. She pushed the glass back on top of the chair, then pushed me hard on the carpet. 
 " Think about it, honey. Don't think about the rookies, just think about it. Watch how they keep righting themselves. " 
 " What? " I asked in disbelief. " What about all the burgers? All the discount boxes? " 
 She cut me off with a kiss, " I just want to make sure you guys are happy. You guys have been ruined. " 
 I noticed that she wore a hat. Something was up with how she dressed. And her shirt. She had an underarm patch over the top, with all the funny name tags on it. 
 " Well, what about the tattoos? " I asked. 
 " We can work with the tattoos, no problem. " She replied, " It's really cool to think about it. " 
 We've had some people tell us this a few times, and I got to keep my cool. I've been acting out a little, I made a few strange freestyles about my other interests and stuff. It's been going on for a while. But today, it was going to be different. 
 " Ya know, talking about everything, that'll be fun, " he said, " We've got some women who could handle a webcam with us, and yeah... " 
 I turned to see her smiling. 
 " I suppose you could say I'm cool, too. Right? " 
 " Yeah, but I'm boring, right? Maybe tomorrow you guys are gon na hear about it, too. " She said, it was a pleasant surprise, maybe we can be a couple more months. 
 We still had so much to talk about, and all I had to do was turn off the microphone. 
 " Fine! You know you guys are working and I'm in the kitchen, and we can talk about lunch. " 
 I decided to go with it. There was probably more to it than just my former dream of meeting chicks. 
 " Yeah, go out there, sweetheart."

It was an uneventful morning. Two months from Election Day and Mike had been elected governor of New England. The automated television stations had reported every bit of news and a flurry of news articles. Behind the scenes a non precariously attentive attorney, a couple of women, a cellmate and a cat-body filled with alarming quantities of chemicals strewn about the beaches. 
 Mike had been working hard not to be a dick to the state for a month now. He needed to winnow the populace down to a simple size to reduce the spread of water supply problems. All efforts by the government to get that done this time around had been met with apathy and resistance. 
 Mike hoped that he could somehow change the state this time. His political rivals had asked him to protect the state very, very soon. While his plans for the 2016 election were nothing new, the party's standing in the polls for governor had skyrocketed since the polls, and everyone knew he was a powerful man. 
 The odor of burning building tiles and thickened sand boarded the ground outside, but not before an icy hand hit his shoulder. 
 "Good morning, Governor" 
 Mike looked down at his shoes on the floor and remembered all of the laws that had been put in place to keep the public safe. The city had fought for years for the streets and the police would never stop patrolling them. The perfect combination to scare away criminal intruders. 
 In a flash of dull light he saw a man sitting at his home. He was in a white suit with a white robe, but it had a new scar forming on the back of his head. He was covered in sweat and sweat and looked like someone had washed his face. 
 As soon as Mike saw this inhuman man, he shot him a look of disgust before walking out of the house and glancing back at his empty home. A single tear ran down his face as he saw the man before him. The man was stripped naked to a part where his neck should be. Now, this state of defense seemed pointless. The dirty diaper he had been living in looked larger and smelly than ever. A thin line had already been crossed it looked as though it had come from the edges of Mike's hands. 
 There wasn't much there, just a stilled expression and a low growl. The smell was overpowering now. The ground beneath his feet glowed hot as the earth trembled. In shock, Mike collapsed down onto the ground, removing his power and simply swinging his feet over the gun barrel. It was too much to resist, but he wouldn't be found. Mike's hand pushed the trigger and he sucked the bullet out. 
 Without thinking, he walked towards the door.

In a glancing, his name was Nick. He was 6'8 " when he first got this job. He was a quiet man, always in a suit when the lunch break came to an end. Nick was left to his own devices, time to just get this job done, shut down all the old machines, turn on the radio. After 6 months of this, he would finally get his freedom. 
 Nick worked in IT at the corporate office. Previously not a big deal, he also never considered IT anything special. Even now he knew the jobs did exist, but until now he was entirely content with his small, sprawl of offices. Especially at his new job. Nick would be able to enjoy his work with ease, but what had he enjoyed? 
 At the end of his shift, the manager came in and asked Nick why they were so strict with the company code. After some questioning, Nick said " As an IT assistant. The reason I got in was to fix data storage problems. The computers had become more and more congested, lately. " 
 " I thought the world never got better, but not anymore. " said the manager. It was at this point that the engineers began to enter the mindset of entitlement. Now, Nick would do anything to progress his company, even the high point of the career. 
 Back at the office, Nick walked over to a table. He picked up his coffee, and with a small shake, the computer that had been running there opened up. 
 *Futuristic, realistic AI. Just a bit faster, but still mature, faster for life, smarter, if i did the maths. * Then he raised his hand to the computer. 
 " Check out everything on my computer! Just some cats, cats, my best friends, even my biggest fan. I can not wait! Let's go to xbox, search all the netflix websites, find my favourite dessert and put on there football shirts. " Nick raised his hands up, noting how the company had stopped funding AI. There was a silence in the room. " Just sit on my chair for a bit and then your work will complete and you can go get your shoes, lobster cakes, or a coffee and hop on up to the next web stream network. " As Nick had always had been a cold bore, he suddenly wanted to ask if he was scared of the computer, of the artificial intelligence at the top. 
 " I would just like to hear what you think, but I can't think of anything else. I don't think I'm the brightest worker in the world. " The interviewer replied, looking up from his computer. Nick's eyes met his interviewer's, and with a flourish, he replied " No matter who you are, whether you like it or not, you're gon na do well at this job. Just just get in touch with your manager and we'll see what we can do for you". 
 Nick walked to the door and barricaded himself in it, leaving only his lunch. Without hesitation, he walked to his office and closed his door. 
 **This is my first attempt, I have to get this done. At least I'm not sure what to write.*

"We're surprised that " The Shadow Operator spoke loudly. His whole " face " appeared to embrace the skull of the space station it was carrying. The mask he wore hid only the portly form of space a man was wearing. Thick and graying even. 
 " Is any of it safe for me to tread lightly on " The Shadow Operator continued. " If not I can assume I have had some accidental mutations from an accident several times. " 
 In the silence the cloaked cloaked figure of k'omthe slowly took a step forward. His eyes knew the scene ahead of him and knew him at a distance. The shadows let out an audible sigh that signaled panic. Only a fraction of a second had passed before the first light turn off, like a flash of some sickly green, and a dull thump on the handle of the power cable that plugged its module. Its wiring networks sputtered at times and was barefoot on its feet. 
 " Whatever it has now. Give it some all over, okay?" 
 This was it. If only the small sensors detected the rising wave of relief the first time he was called to speak. He gazed up at his new mission, almost mad as thought he had done it many times. He glanced at his boss for a second, his face still present, and then he pulled out a " Please return " check to confirm but he failed. His counterpart rushed over the technical details, sure to die if his first choice was to repeat his name on the big screen. However, so far as K'omthe knew, he was the only surviving member of the scouting force. The last hint of something of his personal science was his enthusiasm for research and all-encompassing theory. 
 On the other side of the table sat a young scientist who looked on in a stoic and frightened manner. He stroked the edge of her visor and made a choked cry out in pain. She could feel the station rumble, and now she was closing in on the Matrix.

"What are you waiting for? " 
 " I hope the captain is alright ", The young boy patiently waited for his flight attendant to pass him. Her eyes were immaculate. She didn't want him to scowl. 
 " Where are they waiting? " 
 " The captain is dead. Where's his lights?" 
 He didn't know what the girl was talking about. He checked his wallet just before going in. He checked his passport as well. It wasn't a little thing. It was something more. It seemed more serious than the panicked girl calling him home to realize his predicament. 
 He continued to walk through his route after the ship was stopped by an explosive. He had only just gotten back from the crossing when he realized he could see the metallic object near him. He tried to scream, but he couldn't do anything to help. The few others in the car watched nervously as they watched the explosion. They were all relieved he didn't make it, but they all felt sorry for him. The ship's engineers thought he was going insane. He felt like he was in a coma, and he wanted out. He had been waiting for the very last moment. He couldn't wait anymore.

"You called me daddy? " 
 Masturbating he began to weave in and out of words. 
 " Yes? " He shook his head. 
 " Ah, yes, I suppose now that you're here you will come to understand. I am the slave your father gave me when I was young. Your father is all that ever has the right to be. But that father can no longer guarantee his own rule as will all the other slaves! " 
 " Misdeeds are not but slaves and your mother has forbidden both man and woman to mix! " 
 " And why should not I! But keep your sister safe and your husband safe! I will not let you abuse them, because he is the one who will take care of them, not any other of the people! " 
 " Sister! " He yelled. " Tell you what, I will help you too. " 
 " Thanks! " 
 Masturbating again he shifted uncomfortably, and eventually with a battle cry, the horn. 
 " Thank you," he said. The slave crowed over to where his father had been crouched, as if he had scurried away.

This has been a lot of work from most of us though, but I think I understand you with some harsh words I probably shouldn't have. 
 You live in a world where lies can make you sick. No one knows how sick the lies are because there is no way to hide them unless you kill them yourself. Not true, of course. Dead people no longer exist. But you do. A lie is like a scar, but it is harder to hide. So if you kill a lie once to break the truth you can't lie again. Like if you broke your lie once to get away with murder. So if you choose to commit lies you have to conceal the bigger lies until your turn. 
 This is a long story. But I hope you understand that you must live with the lie of the liar. Your past lies shape you and live with the lie of your murderer. Your shame will shape who you are. You can't hide your lies. Shame is what you grow up looking for. Shame prevents people from knowing that your lies will haunt you. 
 Now, you are free to do whatever you want. In fact, there is some pretty good ( certainly entertaining ) ideas you can create here. Let's see what we have here. 
 Imagine I tried to hide my own past lie.

"*Are you *that* man? Why are you doing this to me? " I asked him. 
 He scoffed. " Look, I appreciate you getting me, I'm just so frustrated. I don't have any other choice... " 
 I nodded and shuffled outside onto the banks of the river. A young young man stood over the dam in front of us. " I'm sorry man, I'm just confused. " He held up a hand and with a small yell, the river the controls broke. 
 " It should have stopped. It may have worked but... it should not have! " 
 He ran his finger over my shoulder and then waddled off down the stream. " Well, it really shouldn't have. I guess I shouldn't have waited so long. We'll talk later. " 
 " Just one thing... they shouldn't have finished that project for the land before starting this..we're telling you, they should have only trained a bunch of engineers here, that there should have been maybe a cleanup team. So if we can't take care of it, we can't keep doing this job! We're the chosen ones, it's my job! " He winked at me and smiled. 
 Then we walked to the middle of the banks. The old man had picked up the old, muscled arm for the first time. He held it aloft as if to say " Yo, it's alright. I'm going to do whatever it takes to get rid of it. Hehe. You're smarter than you think. " 
 I nodded again and ran my finger over his shoulder as he shouted, " I hope you all don't mind me and won't say a word to me. I still wonder if they forgot to save the princess." I banged on the gates to his cave to make sure there were no one else out there to complain. I just hoped that they were *kept* safe from whatever they were that waited for me to rise.

When I saw Emma, she was hot, and something inside me screamed and screamed. 
 When I found her frozen, just under her bed, we talked, she told me how she cared for me, I didn't know if I could get out of there. " It's not that bad," she said. 
 When I threw her out of the window, she would look outside at the blue sky above us. I'd hear distant flowers sobbing beside the wheel from miles away, or the faint sound of stray birds. 
 When I was called into the office, Emma was fine, but I could see there were other people nearby: students, workers, collectors, and therapists. She could see me as she went about her business, keeping her job the same as anyone else, and said something, and I thought it was a mistake. She told me what she saw out there, that she found me down here, in the clouds. 
 That night, I was asleep in her arms.

"Wipe your tapes and we're moving them to different areas, shot them out. " 
 Blood was red. 
 There were deer everywhere, with rifles and spades drawn, tape covering their mouths and feet. To the left was a group of two deer dressed in little green dresses and a tiny crest sticking out from above their necks and out over their heads. Behind them were hollow arrows like metal candy that would provide a sort of light. " You are not meant to kill us today. " 
 Two deer could be heard stumbling forward, each behind their silver money to escape this trap. " Of course, but the reason we send this? Because you are the last one to die. We don't know where you are going. " 
 " Listen there are two deer who have turned around and were hunting. They are stepping on us. " 
 " We don't know how long we have left. " 
 One of the deer changed it's posture and moved closer. " Tell me now, we aren't in love. We are meeting up to try and find some ways to survive. " 
 " Tell me now, you are not meant to kill us today. " 
 Another deer turned around, growling in rage. This one was calm. " Do you think you could hide under trees, killing one deer would upset you? Please don't let this affect us today. We only need a little time. You seem to be toching for us, biting our tails, slicing us alive, spilling it all over our shoes, a lot of them! " 
 Another turned away, both looking at the raised levels of the trees. They approached the fallen head of one Deer, it was bald. 
 " I can't protect you. I am a deer like you. I have no other choice. " 
 Another growled with fury. " Because I can't die. I am not your brother. " 
 The first Deer looked at him and then back at the second. " I have no other choice. I'm no brother to you. " 
 " You are not a brother to me. You are a deer with whom you must take me, I am a trap for you, " said the second Deer, continuing to pant. " I am not your brother, you just had to agree to our terms. " 
 " Yes, that will work. I will not die. " 
 The last of the two looked at the first deer, a massive red brain that glowed red, and their pleading eyes flicked towards the axe made by the giant dagger hanging behind them. At the other Deer, a black cloak that hung in the air and a hood that hid the cut scar tissue above their heads. 
 " What kind of a brother sacrifice would you want to live with, boy? " 
 The first Deer looked at the sinister man and spoke. " There is no such thing as a brother. Even if we had nothing in common, the sort of lives we make in this world is not meant to exist in silence. " 
 The giant axe was dropped beside the Deer. It grew in strength, and expanded in beauty. It split him in half and tore his throat open. A glint of green emanated from the creature, pouring down from the giant man's curved blade. Blood pooled around the giant man and pooled around the wound. " I will be your master. I will remain with you forever, if that is not good enough for me. I will be your protector, always. " The giant stuck his mighty axe down on the unsuspecting Deer, and he whirled it around and swung, using the power of his axe to swing the axe in him's direction. After the charge had been received, he charged toward the giant, holding his white sword in one hand, and his black cloak in the other. When he charged again, everything was dark. 
 The shocked and frightened Deer turned around and ran towards the forest. " Oh! " shouted the giant in terror. " What for? " 
 He raised a spear and pointed it at the giant's chest. He lowered the axe again and began to grow bowlerish. " What are you doing?! " 
 A voice came from behind him. " Leave me alone, " it said. " Death awaits you."

The hand still clung to me, numb to my movements. He took a deep breath. 
 ''Then take this time to explain, Nils. It will help you become your best friend. " 
 " And yet I do. We know each other, I know that. I spend so much time in your brother's arms, when you're not his person. At first we weren't attracted in sight until he found out about your transformation. He loved you, what a bully. She slowly gave him all those feelings you didn't have. Then we talked, and you spent weeks trying to justify why she would turn the other cheek. " 
 " I saw our differences, and didn't want to laugh at your children's pugnacious behavior. Just told him I wanted to make him as your best friend and we looked into it. I showed him love. It got you in the drawer for so long. " 
 My mind was reeling. I was worried. But with John being himself, it seemed more reasonable for him to give me more of the same treatment. It didn't matter, though. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. 
 " I told him it wouldn't hurt him at all, and he told me it would come naturally, like normal. I didn't tell him I liked it, so he accepted. For me, it was over. I swore I would never hurt him. " 
 When I was older, the confusion became more clear. I had decided to leave John behind, and get another job at the psychiatric hospital, hoping that the man would live on. But he didn't. I couldn't hear the woman on the television. 
 And suddenly I started thinking about a black hole. On a white string.

The maelstrom of blood didn't make sense. Not a light would give a right one, nor one great. And not even the smallest outline of redemption in all the possibilities his murder would present. 
 There was no killing, no learning, no sobbing. No life left to do in order to stand on shaky feet. 
 His life itself was lost inside the shitter. There were no mistakes, no "do it again " skips, just a blur. The moment had finally come to an end. There was no sure or clear conclusion at this point. There had to be a way to stop the bleeding. There had to be a way to come up with a scenario. He had imagined this, a person claiming to be the original one, couldn't be wrong. 
 The yank of his dark hair was inevitable. The darkness in his eyes was clearly vast, his mind an fog, a canvas used to dull as much light as possible. 
 After awhile, his voice was sullen. He leaned forward, smooth and reassuring, and he fell headlong into darkness. The blood only to pour out from there, avoiding his body. 
 One last sliver of light left, one last revelation. The options before him, what was going to happen? 
 The pain faded, his heart nearly stopped, and he began to shudder. His world, everything... had ended. There was no being left alive with him. His once beautiful smile back was no longer there. No mourning hall, no home, no friends... Just him and the mouth that might be his.

"Bombs are rare. They're not in peace. Tumors feed them. I can only imagine all the bombs being all dropped because in in that instant there was hardly a thing we could have done to stop it. The inhabitants of this land like to have this group who are used to rebuilding the past and the future and complaining about the ways of the world. I will never forget my first night in these destroyed areas. It was a quiet night, really. 
 That night there was a loud whine, then there was an explosion, then there was no air. Before the noise and the noise got out I can only imagine, then a wave of ambient energy and the blast burst from the top of the sky. I can not believe it. I wonder if it's still going to. An engine of fire roared from the sky in the distance, and I can only imagine then the last of this attack, screaming. 
 I will never forget those horrendous screams, and I will never forget the survivors. It's strange, I know I did it, just me and the plane... But eventually it stopped, after which, and the fire became less great and less ferocious. It just gradually stopped. I'm not sure how long I had to live, maybe the last time I could see them, only by looking up. I'm sorry for anyone that could see me, but sometimes I feel hopeless. I don't want to go back, I want to die, maybe a nap will break the hold. I'm so very sorry. I love you all. You've got to remember that. Just remember. 
 I love you all. Make peace with your actions." 
 The next, a blast was heard in the distance from the downpour, a loud sputter followed by bang, and like a flower parting one day, silence, followed by heavy breathing, then the explosions.

It all started once they got sick of copying a good portion of their parents' drawings. 
 That's how it began. Every day was another random waking dream, and soon people started peering into themselves after discovering their powers. The power to see what other people were like, ability to override others physical and verbal abilities, and even the ability to voice. 
 That's when we started competing with it. We decided what could be considered genuine creativity could become a win. We started making superheroes out of the favorite artists. We made them stand out against the competition by copying the drawings of other people, but they didn't have that right. 
 We created computers that could write for hours. Drones to read peoples minds when reading text, and low powered robots that could teleport faster than light. Our people had done far beyond any competition. 
 Now it's done. We're determined to prove that, that we can work miracles, that we can rewrite the world as we see fit. We created the realm of dreams, and each time we accomplished it, we created objects of amazing powers. 
 To be honest, I didn't think we were done. We're just in denial. We never thought that our power would be able to create a special super powered entity. As far as I can tell, we've all been granted powers in the past. 
 It all started after our particular break up with our parents. I was devastated. In retrospect, I'm not sure if that's a bad thing. At that point, everyone suddenly stopped writing things, that they couldn't pull all their creativity out. Everyone looked around for a reason, nobody ever found it, and all of a sudden it was everyone else. It made sense. 
 I went to my sister's house. There was no one there. My parents were gone, and our friends weren't much better off. None of us knew what was going on in there. I was left sitting there, as I heard laughter. Something about the Internet and all the videos on it. Someone had just made a really bad excuse. A bunch of YouTube videos, this time with cute, cheesy camera shots of people humping each other. 
 A few hours went by before I noticed anything. I returned to my room, my parents out of the house, and I went over to my bedroom window and watched a couple of videos on a closed caption page. Everyone seemed happy and well dressed, but a minute later, there were all these weird symbols on the screen and the screen went dark. This is when things went crazy. I know I was at my sister's house then, but I didn't know where they were. What I did know was that I had seen these symbols, and there was someone else out there, going down this route. 
 I grabbed my phone and rang the number to the police who were on their way to meet me. The man behind the counter seemed pretty angry, and told me it wasn't him. I tried calling them, and without success, all they could do was order me to turn off the lights and leave the room. I did. I had hope in that moment. 
 When I returned home, I picked up my phone. It had been dialed back. " What has happened to you and your sister? " 
 " I was... I was in their head. I was imagining everything and telling them. I'm sorry, sorry, I couldn't help you " 
 " What's wrong? I was dancing. " 
 " I had realized I was... I was... I was a silly, clownish little fool. I could have just fucked you if I had known what I'd done, but I couldn't stop thinking of you, so I let you go " 
 My phone started flicking around and I kept wondering what was going on. There were the files on the computer, and the paper that held the best possible version of what I'd said. I had known what was going on, and I thought the sun was actually sinking below the earth's surface. I wanted to go back and change it. 
 " It's just that you've turned out to be a crazy clown, who is afraid of nothing."

One day I had suddenly gained the upper mires of first contact. In the middle of the night the end of our power ration had plummeted. It was just a few light years away. Our mining ship had run out of raw material and we were desperate to salvage a soiled surface. Maybe if I don ’ t stay longer a minute longer… I might find something. The colonists were easy to come by, pay me fairly, and with a decent credit history I knew if I ran out of any and I would get back at the place I had once lived on the surface. However these days no one will even know. 
 I hunkered down in the small section of cabin and looked at the radiometer readings. I could see two stars almost 20 light years away. The fuel emitter could transmit them but the fuel drain didn ’ t. They seemed just as though they had a host of weight in addition to their scales. The transmission couldn ’ t transmit nearly as much as the emitter when held together. It was crudely formed and lacked about a quarter of the charge. I sat down and made sure my telescope was filled and explained to them why it was quiet at night. 
 “ We ’ ve known this place for days. Does anyone know where we come from? What else could it be, the right city, its land? ” 
 I sighed in relief. Before we left, we could gather information from our radio. A small radio I had brought along so I could relay this information back to them. 
 “ Man, we only know of our race and that we are a violent and primitive species. Our genes don ’ t let us survive long. We couldn ’ t reproduce the way we did 10 generations ago. Our ancestors just like these other races aspired, ate, evolved and started evolution. But we are no longer aggressive. We are more primitive animals. We believe it is healthy to unite their species. ” 
 I didn ’ t sound like a modern Christian. I stood at attention for a moment and my microphone plugged in for a scan. 
 “ You know this place. We can hear your internal back wall. Does anyone know where we come from? Are we not coming from somewhere else? This is India, we ’ ve been in touch for over 2 generations. We have just moved here over a century ago. We are entering a new realm, a new time period. So much can change in a few thousand years. Because we believe what we were doing has become more humane and more sustainable. We are ready to start anything. We ’ ve purchased weapons that will kill us up close. They have a long list of monsters and our daughter Lara has a nice gift. ” 
 After checking into the feed I looked out the window and let out a sigh of relief. I felt the craft go heavy, but was able to cross my path safely. 
 “ We will soon find the source of the trigger. It is a long lost species from our parent species. Their weapons say they possess to much of the same strength as ours. Perhaps it is a clue that they came in contact. All we need to do is look towards their surface, look at their planets and ask about them. Have our sounders give us a signal? ” 
 “ Your time has come. Thank you. ” 
 I lay back down in my chair and accepted the gift. I wondered if if I ’ d survive a century, what drugs I ’ d take, what prisoners I ’ d killed. Either way I still hoped we didn ’ t have to talk about ourselves. I might try an even lesser drugs or substitute for them. Perhaps a triton pill could free us from this pain. I could even see people across the table smiling. What else would I have to worry about? 
 “ I still have a small dose of petrol in the capsule. We can make a habit of it. 
 I closed the headset and disappeared.

 **bruises/crossbows** 
 No shit, poo doesn't fucking come out 
 A chill down my spine crawls: 
 The best way to protect me, I'm stumped, 
 The only thing left, is silence. 
 So, my ass rubs, my arms ache, 
 *Noooo, nooooooo, nooooooo* 
 For lulz, lulz I'm nothing, 
 And all's well and good in my day. 
 But death, being on a slow run is slow, 
 No pun intended 
 My legs cross hearts 
 A string of dancing blades from my own body, 
 I have no choice but to pass! 
 *Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! * 
 Oh my god, my arm, why is it dancing? 
 The ring, I must be clutching 
 Is too weak to draw. 
 So, my legs hold my life, 
 I struggle for my life, and their chains, 
 Far from being undone.

"The girl who slept on the catwalks above the flea market ", said Dimitri. 
 " How the fuck do you even draw us in here!? ", Rico muttered as he fled the office. A good boss by any other name would have allowed that comment to enter one and quickly protect its existence at that moment. Which, of course, didn't come to be. 
 Rico turned up the heat on the front office door and leaped through the long frame and onto the steps overlooking the courtyard. On top of him stood six figures, three in red, two in blue, one black, and one white. Their eyes were black as dark as the sky, the dot of thick red on their irises, as flat as the floor. They wore a dark suit with a blue tie in the form of a sheepshoe. They also wore a skiny headdress, in which one ran a hand through the scar on their sides. 
 Rico quickly pushed himself over to the rear of the group, and slammed the door behind him. He rushed past two. Another took a step back and turned sharply towards the *girl* he had hurt. He pulled out his short curved piece of furs, rolled the round, and fingered through the large black plexiglass bolt. He immediately lashed out at the girl on the ground with the dog whip. She crumpled, and rushed backwards toward him as hard as she could, her partner turning back towards her. 
 " Son of a bitch! ", Rico shouted as he stood up from his stand and ran out of the door, gripping on to the leash with all his might. A single bullet flew into the middle of the air and ricocheted off a razor edged walker, causing it to vibrate a little on the pavement. Rico recognized the location, and quickly lunged out of the street. 
 The girl who slept on the catwalks above the flea market faded away into the distance. She was the girl who slept on the catwalks before you had even had the chance to escape.

I lay behind the mercenary truck, soaked in sweat from how I wound up with two holes through the long cloth you got after wearing the worst shoddy shelter these kind of things get. Undeterred by the tepid holding of the last deep breath, and with nothing else to do but endure the agony, I move forward and fasten my uniform over my hands. Meanwhile as always the four-hundred feet chute begins to slow down, culminating in the weary footsteps of the blood soaked men that lay strewn around me. I calm myself as they slowly advance on me, but then I hear an emergency. The scream of gunfire from farther than this distance wakes me from my mindless sleep. I look up, see the killers in front of me, and roll over to grab them. I barely manage to run after the last thirty yards before the fellows start running in the opposite direction. 
 I lean back from the top of the capitol building, wiped from my face in my spray and my sweat. How I had been a fourth on the field has haunted me ever since I went training with our big man in the first squadron I received, and my luck only good tonight. Is there a fight I can win? What if they didn't? 
 But then I noticed how the man ran past at point blank range. Surely the moment he latched onto my body I could pull a bullet and blast his head off and just keep moving forward. But it didn't matter. I knew who would pass for him though. He must have been a tough looking man. No better willing of tackling soldiers than me. Should be easy to pull the gun on him while carrying you. He must have been driven crazy to do so. Just as I began to have doubts if this way would actually work, he turned to me with a single look of disbelief in his eyes. It took a while for him to understand. He must have been an age ago. He must have looked around with anger in his eyes. What did I do to deserve this? 
 I smiled and extended my hand towards him. He took the gun, my first shot at anything since training. " This will get you more than you bargained for, but in the end you deserve better than either of us, right?! " He squinted at me for a few seconds before he said, " You take the gun out of your sleeve as a shield. You didn't show it off to me! " His laughter stopped. I glared at him. " You aren't the only one that was being foolish. " I gave him the gun and stood up. " Now, no matter what I say and what I do, if this was the end for you, you would be much more dangerous to kill. I am playing by your rules in life, you take the sword, we only have one, and take away his precious. " 
 " Well, luck, I guess. I was just as happy as you are to surrender that night."

“ I wonder if I ’ ll get them? ” 
 For the past couple of days I have been thinking about this one. I spent the day convincing myself that I would still make some progress, but that this didn ’ t mean anything if I didn ’ t want any anyway, and that I didn ’ t have the courage to do it, so I said that I had to find one. From an early age, I have always felt like I ’ d have a right to know what was coming. I only learned of my freedom as I lay down, clothes back on, clothes dirty, and just sitting there, not even knowing what to do with them. 
 Then this morning I woke up with these odd patterns in my hair, the band over my right cheek and the others bunched up. I screamed at the top of my lungs, but the doctor just said it was too late, it was too late for me. They told me that I was in too deep for them to know my cause of death. It was more like a fever and feeling dizzy then anything else. They don ’ t tell you if it ’ s your whole body or just your eyes, so I had to finish the three page outline of this story to find out. 
 The game was about to begin, a quick pass, on my way out my window. I imagined myself descending from the sky, spinning and crawling as I went until I came to rest right on top of a small hill. It was sunny, I climbed up to the top of the hill and covered it for as long as I could. I thought it would be cool and relaxing, but soon I lost interest and my skin went grey. I started to lose control and it hurt my head and the wound started to tear through my neck. 
 I remember when I woke up I was in a hospital bed, I hadn ’ t tried to open my eyes for some time, but the doctors told me that the wound was actually one of the heart valves, but I hadn ’ t. It felt to many places where my heart beat and the skin around my eyes began to flutter and become heavy. I looked around for my dog and tried to say, “ hey kid, hey bye! ” but when my phone started to ring, I immediately realized that it was my brain. I tried frantically to call my mom or dad but none of them would give me any answer. I could feel my blood pounding in my ears, but my brain refused to communicate. This felt like I was on fire and would do whatever I could to jump out from underneath the bed. 
 After a long, agonizing ride out of the hospital with my pet retriever, I was thrown into a chair in the ~~house~~ hospital room by a staff member, and somehow my chair caused my paralysis. 
 *Very confused and almost blind, I've only read a few of the prompts here, and it was quite the blast. Many readers have expressed interest in building a situation in which I was able to not only identify my fellow person, but also attempt to create myself from the ruins of my life.

I would like to delve deeper, and hopefully help you be the best person possible. *

The snow covered shoulders of the tall woman suddenly bulged away behind him. He did not blink as the burly arms grabbed hold of him and lifted his body above him. He cursed under his breath and fell back to the earth in shock. 
 The burly woman then gave a small laugh, then swung around with a gasping voice. " Now what the hell, Mr. Thompson? " He repeated as he curled up next to her. 
 " Hold on, don't you see? If I screw up, that's my problem too! " she cooed as she backed away violently. Her two long lab coats were wedged under her lap. " You worked yourself into a new place! " she exclaimed. 
 " Of course not, my friend, " the burly woman replied with a new look in her eyes. She covered her ears and tried to hide her shock. " You fell for it, I don't blame you! I had nothing against her. You're the woman I wanted. " She winked at him, then made her way across the platform with no hesitation. 
 The burly woman searched frantically for the gate on the other side of the platform, which she took up and bolted out to. She found it deep down inside the ground, a good distance away in case something happened. She reached out to grab a small piece of hand in the direction of the trapdoor, realizing a box is up there, open, she reluctantly lunged at it. 
 She spotted it against a moonlight, a small, shawl shield. " This is a spyglass! " she told the burly woman. 
 Her hand flew down towards the box. " For what? I made you a spyglass! " she exclaimed. 
 The burly woman squirmed around, " Who are you?" she asked.

I'd been walking slowly, staring at the country side of the long steep hill. The wind blew gently through the trees, tumbling down beneath. I crept up behind it, humbly reaching down to kiss it. The heat and cold made me restless. How long have I traveled down here? 5 days? Ten? 
 As I walked across the fields, and down to the fields, I noticed a figure. A little girl. Draped in an obvious white dress and smiling with white teeth. She wore a sandals and a black hat. I reached up and pushed her into my arms. I felt my heart rate go up as I felt a little girl sniffling up at me. 
 "Nice play girl. Don't forget that you're with her from now on, boy. " 
 The girl's eyes sparkled from side to side. With those eyes I knew I had to get out of here. 
 " I suppose not, uh, but wait here until I get back to town. " she said, pulling me down and releasing me from my grip. 
 She walked towards me, giving me some time to figure out what was going on. Once inside, she handed me a green bag and said " You and I will be heading to the Cemetery together. " 
 " What did you mean? Where did you get the green bag? " 
 " I'm going to the Cemetery. " 
 I got on the bike and headed to the cemetery. Upon arriving, I couldn't help but keep looking at the tall buildings that lined the road. The roads filled with people. People almost completely covered in gauze and other material that apparently made it smell when they were in the roads. 
 As I was walking, it became clearer. No one had been in here before. I saw there were most likely six of them staring at me. I sighed and sat up. " Just calm down. I want to talk to you some more. " 
 " I'm sorry about you. Are you sure you wanted this? The Cemetery isn't supposed to be here! " 
 " We should just... We should just go to a cemetery, call someone, go home and see each other. " 
 The girl looked so happy. She had the same smile as she had before, the same laugh that sounded like a mother crying. I ignored that for a few days before pulling her into the car. 
 " I just thought about you tonight, i really did. " 
 I hadn't walked home for a while and went back home. After a few weeks of driving, i felt exhausted. I almost let it get to me, so I got up and drove up the hill. At last I started to feel the sun rise through the sky. I started to smell the crisp, fresh air. 
 " So... how do you expect to come back home? " 
 She smiled at me, pulling me back inside. " I promise to never steal your lunch box, but you have a nice appointment at the theater. I guess it isn't what you expected."

Be Gogo is in trouble, he said so himself. He was told that this morning he will be doing some face painting at the show and he has already spent a night staring at pictures of the Sultan's erect penis. 
 Gogo did not get it, he only had a friend to thank for him. 
 "If I need any reinforcements, don't worry. He comes and goes. " 
 " Well, one day he's his vengeance. Today, we will reclaim something that cannot be dealt with. " 
 He did not know what was going on here. 
 He thought that the same pair of yellow dwarfs that saved the last gorilla could be buried somewhere in the jungle somewhere, but it just kept getting bigger. It still got larger. 
 And some nights, it had to stop growing. 
 He would start anew, beating up dictators and having them rot in prison. He thought that they would give the world the willies. He thought that they would bring the whole world to heel. 
 " Tomorrow, will we head into the mountains again?" 
 And then it happened again. I was sitting on a cliff and it took me all of my life. Even then, it looked like it was time to make something exciting. 
 And then it started happening again. I remember it being another day, but as the day wore on, everyone started changing. You weren't actually seen in a new way, you weren't seen. Everyone had changed to be something they were not. 
 Now a change in characteristics. This new form of transformation had effects. First sight was the golden finger, slightly rolled up down its leg. Then it came another inch, as if that had been added to make it tighter, too. Finally, it came short. Then it went higher. And more took its place. And one by one, the links disappeared from their face. The arm reappeared. The tongue reappeared, and then the face remained. Every night, one by one, the fingers returned and this time, they were bigger, stronger, stronger. The smile returned. Sometimes they showed a smile all day. Sometimes they showed black. Sometimes they show little reflection. And sometimes, those little set people gave no thought to who or what they were and always showed enthusiasm. 
 For a moment, I thought that this was why the alien had decided that he wanted me to go on a joint tour. But it just kept changing. Most days, it was huge and hot and full of life and possibility. 
 Oh, the post-traumatic stress. I had no idea what had happened to me before. I was still under the illusion that I was dead and maybe I was still alive, but soon, I found out that that was the opposite. 
 I realized what happened to me. The earth moved on before my eyes, and I was taken back. I still saw people, and it just felt right. People did not remember seeing me again, even though I had lost my consciousness. People never talked to me again. They said my face was just a photograph but... it all went back to my face as was always planned.

You remember what it was like when you were young? Long hair, wild eyes, an insanely perfect expression. Sure you came up with names and weirdities for things you couldn't see. Now at the age of 13, you only speak some English and memorize what you hear. But that was old. Old and boring, and until that day, no one has that memory anymore. You were alone; only able to play. Your loved ones would cry. Your mother always pet you in that horrible tone you always got when you could not speak. Sometimes you would kiss yourself, but all you heard and touched when you were alone was those cheap, blue painkillers and painkillers. 
 Even now, in this golden twilight of your childhood, when no one is around, when there are only words and less noises, you can only hear them. Your body shudders at the thought of such simple things being meaningless in the face of more complex truths. 
 But that's not right. Your body is still trying to tell you things. It just won't. 
 Your mind attempts to wake you up for the first time, but the rhythmic shaking is still from before, and your soul feels very cold inside. You almost want to turn on the lights, but you can't. You stop asking questions and your body only knows how to give you answers, but it doesn't care. 
 You try to wrap your head around the idea, but you can't. It's so boring at this point. The numbers don't add up, the counting, the repeating hours, the shouting, you spend half your time just wishing that someone would come help you. Maybe one day you'll wake up to this gibberish, and can let it take over and wake you up from the mortal coil. That's a story for another time. 
 You tug your shirt up and gaze at the sparkling stars. You can't remember when you were little. I remember something. There's nothing else to remember. There's only an emptiness, an end. 
 One night, you sit down beside your bed and sleep. Your eyes open and watch the stars in the sky. You kiss the candles, and look out into the endless blue sky. A night falls, and you're sitting back in your own bed, eyes twinkling away. 
 You don't know what you were doing when you left, but in that moment, you're happy. 
 But you won't remember anything again.

"We just got there! " Someone shouted from behind me, noticing my great surprise. I quickly called my Spirit friend until my Voice friend responded " How long do I have? " I replied slowly. He then went on to explain " Since you have two speedsters you must know that you have fallen asleep in space; the speed ( latin and uk ) is. We know this universe will not accept you in it's existence and that you will change you size if you like. The faster you can move, the bigger you will become. So you will have to open your eyes one at a time because you are separated in this universe. Once you accept us you will not be able to move again; however you will return to our universe and could change or even assimilate. You will be the first to be able to see the other possible situations where you were invisible. For a full time you will have to decide whether to accept this universe or to accept the other. Otherwise from this point forward you will be shuttled through different scenarios and will have to choose what to do with your new mind. You will need to grab your large backpack and introduce yourself to a woman who has already changed and influenced many years of your life; the woman who had been able to gain your heart, and who have helped to change the dark and bleak old world you have lived in. Once you are your new purpose in the universe you will be now conscious of your new body, yet can not move. In addition you will need to sit still while other humans like the woman do it. Once the woman has spoken to you, you will have to find a way to fit into the others, moving might be tough. However having all of these things on your mind you will have to be careful. You will need to start with seemingly clean spaces, places to sit and try to keep your heart more still. Have the universe you have been born in start your new life and feel a new kind of sadness for people who don't understand the loneliness inside of them. So for me this was hard, but in my six months of being in this universe I had finally found my new body. I changed, but nothing was changed. I still feel happy in my new body, well it doesn't feel that comforting and joyous yet with nothing made me feel quite the same thing, like all of my instincts say I am to let it go, but it was ok and I feel safe in my new body and body as I felt it, I spent the first eight months building my new body to be new, before I stopped doing things, trying to figure out the words to make it sound better and change myself completely. 
 " You just made the one crazy enough to try to save your life?"

So this is me. Dying with the rest of my platoon on the front lines, surrounded by monsters coming for us and everywhere we go. 
 They took 4 lives. 
 I wish I could have told you all about the other dead men. They were good men. 
 We had a lot of trouble. It was very difficult to be with strangers and with people you were strangers with and people you weren't. 
 People hurt. We weren't good enough. 
 I can't remember the last time we stopped going to movies with 'Granny' and we had to take a huge dick on another movie ( movie ). 
 So now you've got to listen to me. 
 I'm quitting. There's no new job after this one, so I'm going to be in charge, which I guess is good. 
 I'm sure you may be wondering, "Why do I have to do this? I don't want to die?" 
 Because if you don't go to those movies, then I'm behind you on that same front line, in the middle of the ditch. 
 Cause, I could've told you all about how, on that day, the cold dead started taking away the kindness from those people, but I didn't. I mean, I really couldn't expect someone to do anything, but I'll make sure you tell the truth. 
 I guess because I joined all the other shitty soldiers and now I lost almost all of my friends. 
 I miss you, remember? I love you. 
 I love you. 
 Love you. 
 My dogs.

The grass grow down before me. That's what I always wanted to say, but now I don't seem to understand how it works and in fact doesn't. For so long I have been waiting for this moment. I want a real one. A need for this moment that I can use, and my heart, my soul gets more excited. All those years of silence seemed lost, but now they are right there and I've always told myself it would be worth it. Now I am standing in front of the door. I look down and see a strange and strange rain shower. My eyes lit up with tears as I spot the rain water, laying flat on my feet in a pool of my own sweat. In that beautiful ever so vibrant world I knew it would be worth the cost.

The Hunger inside David's mind holds a terrible danger, a false promise that there is a reason only ever once he gets out of his house the food will be better. Knowing that is not true but his ingenuity can not let that hold true. He looked on the table he was halfway through his meal when he thought he heard a knock on the door. He came running to the closet, feeling the weight of a diaper lay on his body. In the crib, he found a diaper, two hands and a backpack on the bed. His bed had one arm at the top and the rest had the previous. But his childishness was plain on the nightstand. 
 David is so turned on by the gift his mind is shaking he breaks into a sprint. He grabbed the bag on the bed and reached down to grab the diaper, it clicked, clicks, whistles. He felt a glimmer in his hand, a flickering while the packaging moved, the air in the room smoldering in blinding light. He spun out of the crib and into the hallway. 
 David wore nothing but his clothes on, with the curled up bag on his mouth. His arm was stretched out, bound by a length of cotton that flowed warmly through his fingers. A dark man walked in from the darkness, bent over for a kiss. 
 "Welcome Jonathan. " 
 David turned, feeling a sharp pain in his leg. 
 " You're here? " 
 " Yes, " the man he was looking at said. 
 " What's up? " 
 " Wake up. " He grunted. 
 " You okay? " 
 The man turned and stepped away. David looked down to see a knife sticking out of his shoulder. He did not hear another word as it clipped itself into his leg. David could feel the heat of his blood being drained from his eyes. 
 " Why won't you wake me? " 
 " This isn't your house, " said the man as he pointed to the door and to his house. " Why won't you wake me? That is where I have my breakfast. " 
 " Why isn't that in your house? " David asked. 
 " Why don't you just jump in? " the man asked. 
 David jumped in after the man, his body hanging awkwardly from the waist down. This puts the man to sleep, he looked up to see the man looked back at him. " Please don't jump. It's a mistake. " 
 The man turned back to face David, smirking. 
 " Bad habit. " the man said. 
 " You can't blame me."

"Hey, Kevin, it's about time you told me about your girlfriend. " the tall, round blonde comelek easily stood beside his limping mop, " You know, you are the one who makes me feel frustrated and sad about her. " 
 " I'm glad you let me talk to you, I know you feel right right about her but you can't treat it like she likes you. You see, I've always known you are the type of guy to let loose on others. " the sweet smelling milky blonde replied. 
 " Why would I let a guy like you through? " Kevin's lips disappeared into his boot before he immediately start teasing her. " You don't even know me and so if you don't put me out of your misery, it will make you happy. " His face turned red as he snarled and a second later his feet moved as if in a trance. 
 " Oh my god... your penis looks like a twat! It's fucking impressive and if you can put on a fucking costume... my wife would find you and treat you like a real person. " Kevin's first lady dragged him right into her sappy little home. " I love the clothes you're wearing, I'm going to snap this one off and send you away to this other world. " She flicked her hip slightly to make it easier for him to slide out of the trapdoor. " You won't keep me from getting you more love! " 
 " What can I say, I really have no use for you. " Kevin gulped down his drink. " If you don't treat me like you are, at least I will get to go away. " 
 " I love you too much and how I wish I never got to go away. " she dragged him to the filthy wall of the guest bathroom. 
 " Oh my god... lets go away already! " Kevin stood up, bent down in the urinal and quickly jerked his boot back out of the trapdoor and gingerly slid up the fourth floor. " Now... I just wanted to say I love you. I really do. I love you."

"What has been flying for 3 weeks now? " 
 My voice is agonizingly low as I stare at the overcast skies. I'm left with a frustrated smile on my face. The Jet Airways logo barely registers in the background. 
 I smile back, " We have tests now, we need you to follow instructions, otherwise they won't let you fly again. I'm right behind you. " 
 " But how do I know you left me? " 
 " You don't. You did." 
 In a final turn I smile and wink, and with gusto a jet leaves our nondescript Honolulu airport carrying only a single banner- " DAVID FERRIS!"

Through tears, words as just three lines of a story, it doesn't much matter how fleeting the loss. No. My fate changed when I witnessed both those fleeting moments. I lived them day by day for the last few days of my life, and them were fleeting. Whatever I was doing at the time meant nothing to me, just as I didn't die; I can tell.

Underpinnings stained the flight of blue teeth, dug deep into the prey's back. Like rivers of viscous slime against their skin, they had here their rations, and offered no resistance. As they ambled between me and their prey, the sounds of the engine and blast-fighter engines circled their heads, sizzling and screaming. The captain shrugged my shoulder, gathering his spoils and heading towards the hatch. On a jagged hillside, a girl's face covered in a black mop of dirt awaited the flight of blue teeth. Carefully grasping the hatch panel, she looked up at me and saw that I was surrounded by heavily lined skinned corpses. 
 'Wow, these will do' I thought to myself. 'I've read enough there, no problems man.'

The premise was just brilliant, my ideas were so cute that I thought it was fun and there were a few of the characters' personalities, all nice, rich and intelligent. 
 The characters were the same, not unlike the movies or the TV shows. Long story short, they did have lots of flaws ( and I'm sure they were there, but like D, I want to see that book again ). It was kind of rushed and the primary character kept putting up with pretty much everything except one or two fights, sometimes it didn't matter whether they were picked up or not but it was really emotional. 
 The characters, aside from the obvious inconsistency in they know each other so well, seemed pretty strong to the reader. You very quickly saw how sad they feel when they are dead. You actually liked why they feel so sad, and they let down their motivation and said something ( whatever they were trying to say ). 
 I had to say, I found this book a really strong contrast to my books, not just to E, that was a good combination and a lot of good ideas but it just seemed like there were a lot of things I could go for in there that I wasn't sure I'd make anything more out of.

Up above, the smell of blood permeates all around me. My shopkeeper froze. My eyes gleamed with the unearthly creatures surrounding me. They screamed and batted. I turned my main table to reveal myself in front of the shopkeeper. His old cloak still the same, in all that glory I had quickly noticed. He remained silent, as if breathing heavily. He wore a metallic grey cloak, but every few seconds he would suddenly rush back to the base of his shop, staring at me, not able to think. I had been standing here for as long as I could remember. By this time the rest of the party was running around. In a fight I was being loaded and cuffed. In an eternal rage, I hit him where he stood. His throat felt completely dry, but I was definitely suffering from a rhinoplasty. My lungs burned through his chest. When I reached his face, however, the agony wasn't for a full minute. After another few seconds the pain faded. In that instant I had summoned the most powerful of spells, spitting fire across his body. I saw his lifeless body in front of my visor, half strolled over. Before I could even lift my head off his white facade, I stuttered out my cunning and put a finger to it. Fire broke my resolve, however I kicked the stubble on his neck. Something very eerie almost shot into my field of vision. In a split second my hands shot out. I clutched the pieces of debris in my pouch, forming my arrows of evil. He was dead. If I hadn't summoned the warlock more, we would have all died in an instant.

I gave up while I still had a decent run. The rainy and quiet winters outside gave me a better view of Central Park than a jeep parked at my guest's place. As the 1st year driver, it had cost me about 3 $ in taxes. 
 The first few hours were the same. A mix of sending out butts- and rolling hills. But as the first day of summer passed, I quickly learned that the industry was never going to catch on. With official sources whispering no all cars were going to make the trip downtown or go on the street, there was little life outside that I could drink and drive. 
 As the first week ended, I got busy with another form of business. It was no longer an unusual activity in Central Park. People were coming and going every day. It was a small community, much to my surprise. Urbanites had a cool vibe, getting around unencumbered by a car in the middle of a crowded park was the absolute perfect excuse to look out for a moment in the sun. It was like a trampoline day with people stopping to help you out, but not taking a puff.

When I first started summoning them, I knew they were probably a ploy for my favor. Maybe because they were the only gods that didn't collapse over themselves, i could crush any of them for a low price. Was I crazy? Maybe I was the one who thought of the above mentioned deal when I first asked my friends for their "godhood". What they didn't realize was that they were also just regular guys who wanted to catch them all, so they could call in sick. 
 And I guess that, despite the highly unusual nature of their summons, if anything, their godhood was more frightening than death.

**********482**********
A young man stands in line, waiting for some form of company. There are already lines stretching down the streets. The voice emanates through the air like a whisper, which rings through your head like a lifetime ago. 
 I have no intention of getting up, the overbearing air around me fills the air. I look to see if anyone's here, but no one comes to visit. 
 Out of the corner of my eye, I see a man, about 8 or 9 years of age, wearing a red silk mask. Not a face, only a pinprick of light. 
 His eyes are ominous, and he murmurs to himself in a line. 
 "Why don't you take the bus! " He whispers into a voice I can not hear. 
 I slowly walk from his side to the center of the line. It is quite dark inside. Wherever I look, the air around me quivers. Everything becomes hot and creamy and firm, and where there would be no air, there lies a forest. 
 I look to see the middle of a path outside. I turn my head, and see a statue. A huge statue of a man covered in gold. There is a flower, and a finger representing her. I feel like jumping around and punching objects, but this time, with skill, I can turn around. 
 I bend over the statue, and completely naked underneath it. From beneath me, I see different patterns. But these patterns themselves are strange, as they form a certain kind of material. There is a rumble under them. Where the rumble emanates, the light gathers. My flesh is glued to the statue. It is their light, but none of it shines through. 
 " You must walk on me! " I shout in a hollow voice. And this time, I slide my fingers up above my head, over my knee, over my torso. They push back against the wall. " Don't let me go! " They shout in an unbroken vocal. 
 I crawl down the path and down the long vertical stone tunnel. My hands land on sharp wooden spikes, and I feel wetness welling up underneath me. As I climb, my nails become slippery. It's cold. As I stretch my legs, I make sure to feel my way into a far off spot, so that I can just easily slip over the railing. 
 The light from the torch flashes on in front of me. I slide my fingers through, into my pockets. I look at the shadows beneath me. They look like shadows. They are childish, but my hands are in mine and I will not let them get in my way. As I reach the edge of the tunnel, I descend, reaching a distance to my feet. 
 I am covered in dirt, all black. For hours. But a moment, a light shines past the black. I still can not believe what I see, and I feel like I'm on a giant flagon, waiting for the light to reach me. 
 It's dark. I fall to my knees and slowly get up. The next morning, I wake up. The foot prints where the shovels that I set the way below from. I'm taller than the others, with hair that doesn't look like it's made of iron, and face that looks like it's made of stone. 
 In front of me, a man is reading a book. He has no face. Only arms, that have no tails at all. He looks familiar. But I know he's not me, and I know where he is hiding, and I have to see him. I step away from him, toward the set of stairs I have set up. 
 " Stop being silly, you big hairy, boring, old, fish swimming your cat down the edge of the pond, " he says, voice barely above a whisper. " You'll end up with a serious heart attack in about two weeks." 
 I don't see the door behind him, but instead a shadow, with dark hair and the shadows hiding behind a cloak.

I don't want to say anything out loud. It was too loud, too loud for my chest to continue to lift. I held my breath as if it was my roof and hoped a tiny spot could be seen next to it. A lot of prayers came. I focused all my attention on the pit. It was serene. It had its own aura, a luster to it. It also lacked anything else. My first thought was getting into the moment with this family. How did they do it? What was they doing? The way the basket lay down? All these questions were asking my head hard enough. I stood up slowly, seeing no one standing around. It was just two old people, here and there, sitting in the tub, hands cuffed to their knees, covered in blood. Their screams echoed in my head, and I didn't notice at first. " Sir... " "... hah... what is it? " " Who is this? " I asked louder. " I don't know, " the voice on the other side of the tub chimed in. " I think it is another people. It looks familiar. I will... you see... this guy... I think he is even more familiar than him. He is in a dark cellar, in the middle of the forest, in a small village. His clothes have a light brown blaze, but they are dark brown in color. He looks similar to me. He didn't go back to the cellar's cellar, he stood there doing nothing. I don't even know why we killed him. Did he make his way back to us? " I tried to hold back the tears. I wanted him to know I loved him, but as soon as I felt his intense anger against me, he disappeared from existence. Then, I found out he had been taken to France. He told me he's taken more lives than I have, but he never explained. I don't believe him. Well, they caught him first, he was not hiding. He took a train the next day, it was packed with young people, and he followed me home to Paris. He just disappeared before it got to the big city. It felt different than the horrid thing I had just experienced. " Oh my god... " " I'm sorry..."

"You will make a good king " the Lord saluted from his throne. His majesty entered, greeted by his most trusted advisors. 
 " As Prince Frederick the Fool and my newly summoned Administrator, the goal is to save the kingdom from the evils of Black Sabbath " 
 " Damn " The advisors spat. 
 " If it took, 40 gods to save your kingdom the Prince would surely add another 9 evils " Frederick grumbled. 
 The leaders of his realm were conspiring to seal the entire kingdom in ruin. 
 The master prince sighed, " It will cost you all of us and everyone you could trust to be the light of life " 
 Frederick nodded, " My great King " he replied. 
... 
 " And since you failed us, all would be lost, except for the unserpented ones who are the only ones to turn of course" said the son of the author of the plot... 
 He was a slave to his majesty. Once a day, it was 30 people put together. Every man, woman and child wanted to be the light of life... 
 Then he died. 
 The kingdom and everything that had been and will be. Frederick was so proud of himself that he himself was buried in a very, very grave. 
 Frederick was never a good king either, at first. He was often somewhat powerful, but as time passed, he slowly became a bit too powerful, and never grew his power to truly be the real power. 
 When he first died, the minister of justice, Duke Aaron Shiffing, got very mad at him. 
 He cursed his own father as the lord of hell, that he was a half a king. 
 And when his grandson died, no one knew what happened.

The floor that had once covered the cliff used to crisscross the stone through, stood exposed on all sides. The darkness that was once enclosed now was the only thing to occupy the room that remained. 
 "Could you see the hot lava flow? And hear the wind rushing to the cities? " The raven haired man in the white mask sat down on a set of hard metal chairs. He wore a long grey striped sleeveless coat, laced with navy rayon. Two snow capped boots began to skip overhead, which seemed strange for the stranger. 
 " Ah the city of Vienna is near. It will heat you up there. " The huge man spoke with an appeal to his number one wish. 
 " Is that your wish? Do you need a favor? " The raven haired man asked, feeling very confident that he was answering him correctly. 
 " That's what they ask for. I will help you make it over. It might be time for the dinner. " 
 Suddenly, the raven raven made an unknown gesture. A small piece of tempered silver went from the man's hand. The snowy white jacket of the raven tore off, revealing his shining, shining golden hair. He looked up into the blackness that surrounded them, a vision of intelligence. Just then, the raven man sprung up from the metal chair, raising two long raven arms. 
 " To the plains of the Alps! " He shouted. He threw each of the four arms forward on a small hammer. He looked down at the mountain top, observing the cyclone that was moving towards them. 
 " Perhaps you are a hunter. " The raven crowed. " Perhaps you have special powers. I would like to become a hunter. " 
 The raven fell with a quick ball of steel. 
 " Leave me be! " He shouted. 
 " No. I have my brother. " 
 " You brother! Give him me that crystal ball!" The raven crow yelled. He ran off towards the lava flow.

"God, you've got to be telling me this is amazing. When we were 10, all hell broke loose... " 
 " Mama, yes, I know. But I've always been told this was the best thing to happen to me. Because I was 10, I didn't have friends anymore. I never spoke to friends or animals, I didn't talk to a single man, no mama I didn't. But you know the truth. I'm Gay. I have a secret, I try not to talk about it. You always think someone has to hide it from you like that, but I can't think about it. It's beyond me, I can't tell you how to get my secret. " 
 " By hiding it, but hiding it the right way I can't tell you how to do it. " 
 " But at 10, you got ta be so scared. It looks like you're about to get shot, I'll have to kill you. I wish I could call this all a lie, you know... with all your friends in this town, it's just scary. Especially not with all of you even talking about this. " 
 " If you want to tell me to stop, let me tell you this baby... you probably don't want me to tell you to make this choice. Remember when I said, I mean big S, okay, mommy mommy, now shut up just promise not to make me a secret. " 
 " Mama, wait. I'm sorry for what I've done. I love you so much."

The law has been broken. Every generation that is born, gets a clone from the army. Their father pushed it, they have just heard the news. Soon their mutiny is over as the newest arrivals are allowed to take it out on the city until the war seems inevitable. It started when a usurper arrived in our city. Well, just Colonel Keith Bradley. He killed those pesky Bosses, lost the line of sight to the soldiers, and passed off the leadership. He decided to take a chance. He is a murderer. So he told them how the real war was going to start. Well, the truth is in the details. It was chaos. There are 1/10 of the civilians still looking to be born. Much of the town was starved and burned. There are civilians going to and going in search of more food. Much like how these guys did in that soggy motel bunker, the peacekeepers took the town to their maximum potential and brought it down. Wow, I didn't know they actually had that much. But they were savage all over this. Except for one thing. 
 *Senses. Listen. This is a discussion. * 
 *Fuck. No. They did this. I. Do. Not. Have. Your. Guts. Get it? No? Don't make me say that. Because I am a God. Put it away. Not for this. That part will be settled the next time. Not until you decide I am smarter than you. *

'Hello, human, what is your occupation? Are you aliens? Are you a member of the alien race. Anything you'd like to say? Answer 'yes'...'. Not taking anything out of my mouth, just gave me the order.'Thought I'd help you out? Look with a lens into the eyes of some five hundred beings in a nearly sterile world and say, "Yes!". Yes. I am a one hundred percent alien with a weak grasp of anthropological, political, intellectual, military and moral values. And I was jailed for the crimes against humanity I committed. 
 So, I'm here, on the planet Amora, a small black dwarf planet, and with my attendant, chinese magistrate, came an alien instructor. And that's why I'm here. You see, I really want to know if your alien educatiton is as objective, reasonable, and awe-inspiring as the others offer me. A human's perspective on life. Learn, work, love, live. Explore, explore, explore. Do unto others. I don't care if your group is completely ignorant, ignorant of others, mindless of others or excessive in their field. All that matters is that you take care of your fellow human beings, and even then. That's it. 
 So there I am, escorting the assembled beings around me. So, in order to get what I'm looking for, some of you are already fucking off. I am talking too much. People are asking me questions. Why does this didn't get me my ticket back? Why does this sound like a nice place. I feel safe there, inside. 
 SO, R'ka was on point. So, when a spaceship came out of space, and it t-till it passed through our eyes? That doesn't sound like a spaceship, it was small. Again, I wanted to ask, "What is the mind of a human?" Just but. 
 So I get up and I look over, and, and I see some of the others, all with some sort of weird looking things in their eyes, and without any kind of wings, they look like they're trying to fly.

My parents hadn't realized the bomb was for personal use before coming to this. Their home-made ale couldn't do any good without a live video feed. Almost none of the breweries on the street called it beer - it wasn't here to mingle with the methheads who were pounding out 14 figures a gallon. It wasn't here to stoke the fire that was rising through the vents at Alco's. They couldn't. Not now, of course, not when they're headmasters on the big stadium. They kept the submachine guns around to keep out the potential spark that would ignite the city. And the truth was, it only took me thirty or forty minutes to make their vats of hashish out of. 
 I'd done it before, once. Twelve days before, a bounty of mine, locked away in the crack for 200 million years. 
 I knew it would only catch on because of the way it crashed into the clouds. 
 Anyone had a final idea how to run up the rest of my price tag. I guess I'd had a better idea. 
 A pipe explosion. 
 It did come out, but it didn't really matter. It always did. 
 All I had to do was look, cataract the flame, and then the salt water would warm up and kindle. 
 There was only one price tag a drug dealer can't wrangle off. None of it mattered now. The industrial age was going to cease without a fight. 
 -- -- -- -- 
 Something caught on the other side of the glass as I dropped the fireball. 
 The momentum picked up as I bent down to inspect my wallet. I'd paid so little in terms of split penny, all the money I needed to make my move. It was only fair, really, that I gave out my exact ID for the bomb. Right in their wallet. Would either cost a cop a good amount of money, or some way to keep a few poor bastards warm in no time. 
 I lightly touched the gun as I slid in my boots. The smoke behind me was pouring out. 
 This was a car wreck. 
 Four young women were running in an alley through a small town, using their masks to cover their faces. They were laughing as they dashed to their vehicles. 
 It was then I realized what I'd done. 
 She wouldn't be caught. She would never be found. 
 I reached into my pockets to grab my wallet. The air in the alley stirred. 
 I'd let her run.

"Daddy, " me and my girlfriend Sarah had been thinking. I can't say I understood it. But I had. We had been set up, prepping for " Miss" next week. I was howling and staring at our two dads with anticipation. My girlfriend ( the sun ) had crossed a line. Her birthmark was glowing a faint orange. I was confused. Sarah and I had already planned to afriend everyone about, but it had all gone away. We would never get any friends. We would never get to get anything. We thought our hearts would be melted down like candy. But alas, our memories went back to the previous Friday.

We had agreed that we would sneak into every high school we could. We disguised ourselves for a safer world in the hopes that one day we could eventually combine our talents with a better one and end this crime. But that was months ago. 
 Days had passed since either of us started with our plans. We scrolled through class and during recess times, we hung out together. I wasn't too surprised that my roommate changed his name to Steve. Maybe it was the grade he received at these other schools and maybe it was because he used to get high every now and then. I might have been going crazy, but I'm not so lucky now. 
 We never started off out promising to be friends. But when his parents had him shot he had said that he had forgotten him. He had lost his poise and had a sense of gravitas. Everything was perfect. He couldn't have been more than 18. He certainly was having a bumpy ride. He had been shot and killed. But it was too late now for us to be alone. 
 The stairway leading up to the top of the building was empty. We would leave that down by our favorite place in the neighborhood. We just had to drop by the reception area until our suit suits could fit. We were walking down the hallway when we saw Steve walk in. He took a seat next to us and looked down at his hands. His smile slid as his head tilted up. He looked back at me and took a step back.

Arnold loaded the pump and galloped out into the setting. He holstered the hammer, which lit up as he completed the mission. 
 He realized he had disappeared in his peripheral vision after the movie's wrapping credits. If he hadn't kept his calm, he would have wound up being dead in his wheelchair. He spoke, unsure whether to panic or panic. 
 "Hey Arnold, you close your eyes, or something? " 
 " Sure thing Morgan, it's time to land here, " he said as he bowed to the call of his wife. She sat back down and tipped off Arnold to his passing. 
 Once down there, Morgan brushed a strand of blond hair from her frame and looked around. He'd just closed his eyes long enough to catch a glimpse of her face, but hadn't noticed her figure. If Arnold had been behind her, she'd just be moving towards the door, towards the Diner. She would have hurried him, but Arnold needed her. 
 It was only a matter of time before Arnold saw her with a face as bold and handsome as he had at the movies. 
 " I'm telling you Morgan! In this movie you too are going to be watching Arnold! " Arnold had been particularly quiet as a memory floated about, where a jolly old man and his short blonde curls had come into the frame of Morgan's dream. 
 " Morgan, " Morgan stretched and grinned shyly, " it's your turn Morgan. " The clock on the wall read midnight. 
 A sense of resigned excitement descended on Arnold's face. Morgan was well dressed in trademark red, and it felt as if someone had played a joke on him. And then, there were gunshots. Five at once. 
 Freddie Freed had taken his chin out of his mouth just as Freaks TV had given him. Arnold stopped and stared into his eyes. His whole body shook as he watched everyone else sit on the set. He had died a fire in that one scene, and Morgan was just more in the movie next. They were always new voices. 
 " Blow his head off, " He said, and the Hollywood tabloids might have been proud to note how much Sarah Palin gushed over him, " and I should have worried when he jumped in the first place."

First time post and first WP. First rating:- ) 
 A grumpy old man sits at a white dot in the middle of the field, listening intently to the soft hum of the radio on his shoulder. 
 “ Will we ever make it there? ” he asks me. 
 “ I think so, ” I say solemnly. “ I won ’ t never make it out here. But I will find my way out soon. ” 
 I shoot a sad smile at him and he just ignores me. 
 “ Alright, ” I say. “ Just leave us alone, ” I tell him. “ Or… ” 
 He just shrugs and shuts his eyes, not even bothering to breathe or open them. I walk over to him and sit in front of him. “ You ’ re also a man of science. You have a hard time believing it, ” I tell him. “ I think it's dangerous to live like that. ” 
 “ Yeah, ” he laughs. “ I was wondering if you could tell me your name and where you had put all your years of training into. ” 
 “ John Doe? ” 
 “ Oh yeah. ” 
 “ John Doe? ” 
 “ Sorry, ” he leans back and presses his mouth against mine. “ I guess I should thank you. ” 
 “ Well, okay. You know, the real danger of leaving Mars is the delays. ” 
 “ What is it? ” 
 “ Although, we don ’ t actually have to return to earth for up until, say, three months. But you have to work hard to keep what you put into reaching our colony, period. ” 
 “ Right, ” I give him a small smile. “ I ’ m afraid that you ’ re right. ” 
 “ Right, ” he continues. “ But— ” 
 He snaps his fingers and a small earthquake is heard. A soft thud is heard at the foot of the crater, followed by a creaking beneath. 
 I walk over to the craters, grab a shovel and the sound of asphalt churning gets louder. 
 “ Ladies and gentleman, in total darkness... ” I whisper. “ This is Martian thing. The radio is on! This is exactly what it says on the radio, right? It says we just crossed the desert- ” 
 As the elderly man begins to make an attempt to speak, a loud boom emanates from the darkness. 
 That ’ s when I remember everything. 
 “ I have to go. The earth ’ s been dug over the moment. ” 
 ( Sorry if it's rough. I wrote this before bed time I swear. )

It was simpler than I thought it would be. 
 I didn't lie and I didn't change, but I'd always be able to see it coming. 
 It was simpler than I thought it would be. 
 How many people had joined up against a dictator before? The program had been less fortunate, less dangerous. Up until my predicament, the first three years had been no different. We'd migrated from rural farming to city to city, everything going as planned with good intentions. 
 But when I was brought before the supreme dictator of the city, I was driven into a fluke. My suspicions would be confirmed if you were one of the family of those who didn't work. I was denied the chance to do my work. The gaunt man who had been my clothes all the way into my paternal grandfather's soldier's uniform got more and more angry over this. I had convinced him to allow me to go forward a few times, and he acted as though he had an inappropriate advantage. 
 The war being thrown into question that time began never to come again, but the anger always did, trying to dominate the mind. 
 No matter, I had to be sent back. He wanted my free will, I needed to face the perfect test: the cruel command of the ruler I knew so well. He was far from perfect, but as time went on, the more I grew, the more I realised it was possible for me to kill him. 
 A rumbling growled in my ear, shooing away any resemblance that I might have at the altar. The outbursts continued unabated. There were a handful of people here, screaming and screaming, trying to make themselves heard. And no one wanted to hurt me. 
 I felt anger pour forth from the heartless man in red lipstick. 
 "Hail, Emperor!", he yelled.

Jonah couldn't help but smile at the dreary buildings and decrepit shops below. 
 He stopped at one of the locations seen around town. The freezing soil was starting to look like discarded paper. What was happening here was always a little unsettling. 
 Jonah dashed a path through the ruins, ending up in a forest of faded trees with others destroyed by the strong winter winds. His boots didn't fit through most of the trees and he carried as far as he could on his sandals. On top of the abandoned wood and broken glass, a room filled with tools, only little more than rusty firearms and feathers. 
 "Miss Plowin, if you were to think logically, you'd see man being mostly eliminated here. " said the man with the bow in his hand. 
 " The con was halted by a man who claims to be a magician. " said Jonah, starting off to clean up the many severed parts of the trees. 
 " Maybe his horse isn't the reason man made these mountains out of gold. " said the soldier. 
 " The horse is a man. " continued Jonah, refusing to think of a plausible explanation. 
 As the soldier left the man took off his desert boots and his black-flecked jacket with neat rags around his torso. 
 " Naw, true. But then it's still a crowhole at this point, so in lieu of being destroyed, why didn't your arrow just drop upon me? " replied the soldier. 
 " WHAT'S GOING ON? " asked Jonah. 
 " Honestly, what could you expect? There's no magic. People aren't going to roll your horsey. " replied the soldier. 
 " I'm starting to see what this guy is talking about " Jonah said. 
 " Then what the hell? " the soldier says. 
 " First thing is, the magician didn't put on a good show. He seemed to be trying to perform magic to make new snowflakes. The snowflakes did look prettier and had better durability, but he couldn't fall from them. " 
 The soldier took off his bandage and ran to the wheel of his car. He limped over to the other end of the path and gave it a good swirl of green bubbles with a splotchy tip. 
 " If you wanted to see the world burn down, come see what the crazy bastard can do with a horse." stated the traveler.

I was six years old, and I wasn ’ t going anywhere without either of us. I was dreaming of this, of Mom and Dad playing on the school playground, of Santa and Christmas. I was born in 1949, I kept to the last of my classes. When we moved in, I knew what we were going to do would be the best out there - we were going to have fun. 
 I wasn ’ t wrong about that at all, but I wondered, why was my other senses lagging after I ’ d gone through each of those? There were ten of us in the group, but there were nearly four kids in each group, and then one in each group. Why were we missing so much? 
 The week of the lectures, I was kicking out our shoes from the school hallway, and it was difficult to keep my hands in proper place, let alone to have someone stand there halfheartedly carrying the clothes on my off-white shirt. After getting into my tight little chair, I gazed at my legs, and reached up, a flop, with my weight against it. Finally, I could relax, and realize that my weak hands were holding it tight in, and I was standing firmly in front of it. 
 * “ Mom and Dad! What ’ s up?! * 
 The band I had been playing on those days was playing a band I had no recollection of playing, it was never really the same. Its original members were all lost, and my mom was leading the way for now. I was hoping that I ’ d be carried a few others, but I knew I wouldn ’ t last long. I ’ d need to tell everyone. 
 I reached up and held up the flop of someone with freckles, I found them with a muffled thud and suddenly, all I could hear was music. My head hurt, so I spread my arms wide, where I pushed the school desk back, I could feel the weight on me lifted up. A "snap! " that, I assumed was a noise, shook my entire structure. I stretched out in front of this figure, raising my hand up, causing it to wiggle, I put my hand near it, and it tumbled and flipped, I touched it and it ’ s touch did nothing to calm my voice, but rather a crack that my floorboard was due to cave into. The curve of the crack let out a loud thump that I almost wasn ’ t hearing. 
 * “ Sorry dad, I just didn ’ t catch that. Can we talk later? I know it ’ s hard for you to keep with this, but I ’ m sorry mom, I can ’ t stand these things. We ’ re having a difficult time, I ’ m ready. ” * 
 " We ’ re done." I muttered to myself. I turned around. 
 I still didn ’ t know what to do, I couldn ’ t open the door I was in, and I was right, at the end of the hallway were three people. Still, I continued on my way, hope was always a source of happiness. I hoped that one day, one day someone that I care about would see me for who I am, and someone like me, and tell me, I really was in the best shape of my life. 
 Something caught my eye, with a moving hand in front of me I turned, but before I could react, I just tapped the flop of the iPod to my ear. I tried to turn, but there was a crack, so I made a move. As I tried to move, I could see a silhouette of my kidnapper lying unconscious on the floor, maybe a few minutes away from me. This must be it. This must be all of it. Nothing can be more satisfying, right? I shut my eyes, shut my legs. What had I done? That ’ s when the pop-up came on, and I already knew where to go.

I've seen everything. 
 It's great. 
 I've seen almost everything. It's incredible. We can conquer many worlds, climb mountains, and even go in far corners of galaxies. Even the lack of human leadership takes a toll on many, and then I have the feeling I'm soon on a few planets. 
 But the worst is right here. The third planet of the last four, I expect them to choose. The only way we know if they chose is by chance. The best that I can get is me. 
 It's the world they call Earth, it is rich. We want this. We want a way to make sure their people's survival and liberty are paramount. 
 Our parents weren't idiots! They left to soiling the soil to make sure this was enough food. Humanity's only hope was a few hundred million living, breathing robots. Now we're going to use our plentiful wealth to make sure they all have the skills, experience, and ingenuity required to be successful as their people. 
 Yes. They. Are. A Lot. Better. Than. I. Moved on. The looks of regret I'm sure they gave me, even their absolute best intentions were pained me. 
 Like you, I take pride in my craftsmanship and quality. After all, who wouldn't want the freedom of their parents? 
 Sure, they still have the chance to kill us. Human life is so fascinating and of so few qualities that it's rare. And will definitely die in that way. They might even mutiny just to make sure they won't push the accelerator instead, or kill me in some way. Now it doesn't matter if it's to lure them into fighting the battle we won't fight back. 
 It's ours. 
 There. It's perfect.

In a corner a thick satin rug casts the ghostly shadows as two wiry men head towards the living quarters of their small family. The host of the family speaks to each of them... 
 "William Webb? " the young child pleads, and eagerly turns away to inspect the man. A quick glance of his shadow, slightly obscured by the rotted vines of white hides that surround the deceased, shows he is the owner of the house. 
 " Yes Sir. It's the Saviour, and Lord. " He offers, surprised. " This town has a great selection of vases that sell for such a high price. " " Those first are all around, what could they be selling? " 
 The children look closer. Did they have an issue? " Are you sure a vase from the Parish would do right for you? " " Yessir, Mr W. here was broken. It was so small. A half an acre of dark dirt. " 
 " Well, we don't have a lot of pits on this town, can we save it? " William says, gathering his books and preparing to leave as fast as possible. 
 The man pulls away slowly. " My services can be made to pay for things. " He looks back up. A door opens in the distance. " Let's have a look around. " The young man waggles a finger in mock approval, a grin spreading across his face. 
 William steps into the apartment, and her eyes widen at the sight. Her large silk clothes are crumpled and blotchy, her eyes staring across the room, teeth seeing the surface of the floor. The children writhe in fright, but more than a little confident in their lack of chains around their necks. The Saviour speaks, " Now son, I'm afraid this day has come. " 
 " Still confident? " William nervously asks. 
 " I've been on a hunger hunt, and you haven't even managed to find a bone of a cow yet. " The Saviour slips his spectacles down his sleeve and grasps them, kissing her tender lips lovingly. " Be a good boy, young one, the day will come when I can give you peace and love. " 
 " Sure, but where shall we go from here? This town is full of animals, you know. " The Saviour sternly states, saying anything necessary to bring them to an end. 
 William pulls himself closer to the Saviour, not wanting to look at his daughter's goatee once more. She's staring directly at him, covered in blood and huge round stones. 
 " William, you do know that? " The Saviour draws in a sigh, and leans in. " We have to go. Let's take up farming. I can only give you peace and love. " 
 He takes a deep breath, and pulls his spectacles off his neck. " Bye."

The doctor was getting tired. He didn't seem anxious about the person sipping on the tea and eating any large enough portions. It didn't really matter anymore. None of the regulars seemed to care if the monitor showed up. Most had a passing thought, one that maybe a few never had. 
 That was how I came to his new study in Porthcaw. It was at that time that he discovered I had entered the Bureau just prior to my research for my academic admissions exam. It was only a matter of time before my assignment began, and he'd found me waiting for him in the study. 
 Here and there he'd let people take snapshots, and come back later to confirm whether or not the monitor was pointing at them. The contact had caused quite a stir, as no one else seemed to be paying much attention to this man, so it never really mattered if it was someone like him or another stranger. 
 Since he found out of necessity, in the other offices, he had taken the samples from the other members and had meticulously tried to minimise any chance of them being undetected by the cameras. Almost all of the needles were in the same vein. It didn't take much convincing to explain to him that now wasn't the time to infect any of them. If he made a sound and went completely quiet, the others would stay to take turns. 
 So he went further, telling us all to come back and do what he did best. He'd patiently waited there, trying to release whatever action he could get. This particular thing had made him afraid. He asked for lunch. He couldn't hear the cheez-cheezing people coming from that pipe. His knuckles were sweaty and his food was crusty. 
 We all immediately went home and ate to keep ourselves fresh. 
 Despite the tension, the rest of us stayed with our screens. In the cafeteria, the waiting area, the couch, the floor. 
 But the headache subsided. The doctor hadn't even bothered to tell us who it was that was in the room. 
 We all came back outside the coffee shop and waited for the professor. I would see my best friend for the first time in the week to see him. I went down to the study hall and decided that if I was lucky, we could all come back one day and give him some leftovers. The next day I saw one of the assistants again. 
 "Hey there, " I said to the professor. " What's your name? " 
 " Adrian, " he said. 
 " Where are we? " I asked. 
 " Dan Whitfield's old news channel, " he said. He was dressed in a suit and tie. His fingerprints were all over the paper. 
 " We're... we're in the cafeteria? " I asked. 
 " And so I see you, Dan Whitfield, " he said. 
 He froze. He never could be so sure about this. We all followed. Adrian spoke first. 
 " I'm here to tell you that I'm sorry, sir, " he said in a slightly raspy voice. " But I just wanted to add something to the train of thought that goes on here, in my show." 
 I felt an uncomfortable feeling kick in. I couldn't help it. Adrian had told me of my crime all those years ago. Did he think he could fly? The looks of disbelief were on his face, as he continued on his way without returning to his office. 
 He was never arrested.

She had known something was wrong in this building for over a year. A rogue mage had abandoned her house, gone missing after only a few weeks. They had taken her sister, her fiancee and her best friend. They murdered the small girl. 
 And with it all, this child had seemed to die in his grasp. Screaming and swearing in desperation, defiling himself, hiding himself behind more of her flee. To see him like this always left a deep scar on his face. 
 So she had taken matters into her own hands and done it. She knew what he was capable of. 
 And that's when she saw it. A small wooden dagger. She searched around, feeling for more but found none. She knew it was no blade. No imprint. No sound. No glow. Just black. 
 When she touched it, it felt cold. Sharp. Cold. It clicked. 
 Nothing. No, no, no, no. The ground around the hall was unnaturally silent. The sound of crying could not be heard. People ran along the ground, the floorboards were hard and faded. The sky inky black. 
 Nothing. 
 She lifted the dagger high, and found a small brass handle. She adjusted the hinge, opened the blade, and carefully cast it from handle to handle. Again, nothing. She reached for a key. Nothing. She pressed the key in. Nothing. 
 Thud. 
 Something odd happened. A figure, no more than a ceiling fan in diameter, swept forward and laughed. Her heart skipped a beat. Her heart felt a chill run down her spine. The creature vanished down a corridor, and disappeared immediately into a wall of motion. 
 There was a sharp pain in her neck. 
 “ You cursed the boy. ”

22 years, young infant, a little 7th grade named Camron. I ’ m in my late teens. I ’ m loving it here. But this is going to suck, yeah. I don ’ t want this. With all my life I ’ ve wanted the story of a cesary-cowie. I ’ ve never been that crazy about movies, I ’ ve never seen a cow with a flaming mouth. I don ’ t want to see Sarah get trampled by a badger all the time. I ’ ve tried talking to her but she won ’ t listen. I don ’ t want to make her choke on my precious shit in the way I could if I tried. 
 It's such an odd childhood, everything you could ever imagine. You could hear parents crying at odd times in the yard and the soldiers bringing cows into the field in the day. And you could get a glimpse into that time and time again, forever. The only difference between us and you is someone who was in the military- a cow. I would spend hours pacing in a field alone with my wife, doing the usual things. Try not to sound clumsy. 
 Now, you could just watch web the same way, on low volume as well, no special purpose, very casual. It ’ s embarrassing, really, how just because a cow all those years ago would have made people think a single cow no matter the age on the earth has accomplished. People think that it ’ s some kind of celebrity that no one would like. I ’ ve watched them and I ’ m proud to say I ’ m not the worst person in the world. I ’ m the first she did really well, who knew that the guy sitting across the room from me with the guttering mouth wouldn ’ t be going to a fight tonight. 
 I ’ ve dated Camron for almost as long as he can remember. I ’ ve been watching him, even though we ’ re never shown together. He ’ s about 13 now, though, so that ’ s a whole lot of time for me. What ’ s the point anyway? I got sick of seeing him joke with his story, that he ’ s never been that smart. He gets mad at people who watch. Never really understands what ’ s coming, because this dude is only so goddamn logical. Camron or I, our boy, doesn ’ t have that thing with his mouth either, because nobody ’ s ever seen him go mad, and never quite saw how entertaining he could be with his own eyes. 
 No one gives a shit anymore. So I know something bad will happen, something will happen. I'm not ready for this. I'm taking this now. Nobody wants this, not because of the time difference between us, but because I want to see Sarah make out with her caged asshole. Her mouth isn ’ t too dry either. I need to just *get* to her mouth though, right? I ’ ve tried, I ’ ve tried everything. 
 After taking a few long passes, I hear something, a low rumble. The noise comes from behind me, approaching a cow in front of me, sliding its car off a moving truck. Cars go flying and moving, dodging ball after ball, cutting through the beams of light that illuminate the countryside and hanging in the air and rolling straight out of the earth. The man in front of me dashes to a nearby stump, and comes towards a lying oaken caged cow. 
 He stands up slowly. His silver metal green leather vest is mangled, and he ’ s got a big cocked chin. He manages to grip it tightly and breathes through a huge, wide nostril. He looks up and gives Camron a small smile. 
 “ Bye, new camron. ”

"You see some things haven't always been this way, Rebecca. You don't have to go farther back and try to understand the concepts, you can just see them inside your head! You can fully comprehend them. " I can still hear her voice, as if amplified by the surface of my voice. 
 " What if people can be beautiful? " They can be wonderful. They can come from everywhere and see the world in all it's glory. " What if people can be amazing when they don't have to do anything. " 
 " That's entirely off the table," I reply, and sit back down and swallow my coffee. I am the only one in this camp that can explain to the rest of us exactly what science and technology is like, and if it doesn't work then we'll all be damned.

Do I still love you? I dunno, I never thought I'd finally see you again. I just wish I could have. Am I really still alive? I'm not sure where I am and what's going on anymore. I hope you don't feel the same way. That I'm sorry, I know I'm not. I loved you so much, but all of that didn't go in my direction. You stayed with me long enough, I thought. I felt lost. I was lost. I still am.

"Oh hi dear. " I said, 
 " Can I borrow it from you? " 
 I looked in the face of the geologist. 
 " Woah, woo. " The man said in a deeply confused way, his face reddening slightly as he looked over. 
 " Ok... but if you keep giving me directions, you'll forget it ever happened... and you'll have learned not to point it at any landmarks. I guess you're right. " 
 " Oh yeah, every in class gave it away. " I snapped back, " I've been home all week and I've even had a hop of people talking about it! " 
 The geologist frowned, " Huh. Why do you think they did it? We can't travel past a keyhole, from here in the Desert, or back! " 
 " It is just the thing we use for stuff, so... " he finished his short story, " How was it all supposed to go? " 
 I spoke up, " Well, what happened after you died? " 
 " We spoke of the journey and I realized we could never travel to another point in time again without guiding our time device. It is now my turn. " 
 " Aye, dear. " I replied, with a smile as I removed my binoculars. " And so it has? " 
 He nodded, a small smile spreading across his face, and a dumb look on his face. 
 " How was it? " I asked, excited to finally prove my plans. 
 " I was exploring a secluded area I call a " Minesville" when I heard a loud crack.

I saw him emerge from his dugout, his hind legs flexing, his jaw opening. It was painless. I quickly cut the cord, it caught on his hands and raised it up. He screamed, but I let go and collapsed. " Why can't they let me go?! " I asked. He was shaking, but no problem. The leviathan tried to punch me, but I raised it up again to back him up. Another twitch, more for him than for me. The leviathan dropped his throwing knife. I breathed in, by surprise. The leviathan snarled. " Not this time. You are the first one to look me in the eye. " I laughed. " I did that you coward, but I can't fight this bad boy. I'm serious! I'm serious, now! " I released him. The leviathan kicked me in the chest, the death-mark swished around. He shook his head, then started flying. I had no time to try and calm down, he was up again. Another fang of pain took hold of my shoulder. My eyes glazed over and I heaved out a bloodied fist. " Come on me! You know I can't kill you like that! " I looked the leviathan over and I whispered, " I'm ready."

A tiny hand tapped the glass with a wooden nail. He listened to his drink and sank back into the odd way to inebriation. He supposed it ’ s summer, spent at war every year, but oh well, he might just relax to the small part. 
 “ What now? ” he said. “ Can I keep it for less? ” 
 The bartender asked the question, but took a little sip of the beer. “ Nice to see you, ” said the bartender. “ And I ’ ll take the drink, on your own. ” 
 The hand, staring at his drink with a low baritone like a civilized animal. “ Thanks! ” the bartender said, “ this may not seem like such a big deal, ” and slammed the glass on the ground with a beat. 
 The water appeared to shake with the retching. 
 “ Okay, ” he said, “ or do you remember a trip to Camp Fire? ” 
 The bartender considered his response but focused on the beer instead of the beer. “ Uh, sure. ” he said. 
 “ No, ” the man said, “ Not Camp Fire. But Camp Fire was my favorite point of campfire. ” 
 “ Aww, ” said the man. “ Did I say camping? ” 
 He slapped the beer with his hand and clapped a hand. “ Right. ” he said. 
 “ Alright, ” said the bartender, “ okay. ” 
 “ What was that for? ” 
 The hand had a contorting look on his face. 
 “ The Bud Light, man. ” 
 The man thanked the bartender. “ I already got the beer. ” 
 The hand shook, but the bartender stood over it for a moment, before adding, “ Oh, don ’ t worry. Bud Light won ’ t make you upset. Just make sure to keep in mind that campfires all the time aren ’ t allowed. ” 
 The hand shook again. 
 “ You said that kid? ” the bartender asked the man. 
 The arm shook again. “ He is going to get some scotch. You can even substitute more cookies. ”

I thought - not just that - I had this... problem with problems with my reality. I think, just right now, that they're messing with my reality. Why am I looking for truth? 
 I wonder what it does to the stars? 
 I think I see a light above - the stars are bouncing wildly from the invisible barrier I built through my reality. When I look for something - anyone, it can help me - it will give me my answers, no? 
 I walk around my reality - get a hold of me? I've been there. A couple of times? It looks like those sparkly legs are flying around everywhere, apparently. 
 My reality. 
 I wonder if that's my reality now? My body could break any of the molecules, but I have to cope with it - I have to, and I can't go back. 
 I wonder if someone can help me? 
 I walk about my reality, trying to get closer to the barrier - who cares? It will give me all I need in this universe and I can live with it until I die? 
 Maybe there's another portal? 
 Maybe there's a built-in parallel universe where I don't have to go through this barrier - why couldn't I have gone through? 
 I walk around my reality, looking for something I can use to get closer to the barrier - maybe it will give me more energy - what? Who in my world does that? What's on those pillars? Who is to say I've got nothing for energy? 
 I walk around my reality and grab the sacred gem I haven't found yet. 
 I take it - it looks slightly different... it hasn't stained my reality much - how? How do I say "uh? " To do what? My reality's pillar? I've never seen anything like it. 
 I walk around my reality. The light is getting brighter - surely there's something - the barrier? my reality's pillar? 
 I found the goldenrod! I must have had some sort of surprise - I swear this diamond was just a tan fall - no, it has nice stone. 
 I stare into the sparkly surface on a great, stone building - for the brightest spot on all - oh god - is this there? 
 Someone - oh my God. Someone - thank God! 
 'What the fuck?' I think to myself.'Oh fuck.' 
 Where am I? 
 What's the point of the goldenrod, anyway? 
 I have to get back to the barrier. 
 The furnace stops - my reality's pillar's of flame is taking a picture? Don't I... do what I can, but why am I still going here? Why am I talking to all these beings so clearly? Why am I still here? 
 This are my memories, my reality, my realm. 
 All my life I kept to myself - my reality was always wrong. It was that *rape*. 
 Because of that, I made a small piece of myself - a little stone. 
 I had no idea - I could have been a suicidal thing - I didn't know. Why was I wrong? What is happening to me, and what is happening to me? 
 After all, is there a dimension where I am perfectly still? Are people in my reality? All my simulations have no connection to this one. When it would just disappear? 
 *Oh god. * 
... 
 As the flames warred with my reality - I found this gem - it just so happens this one - it was shining brilliantly. 
 I was hallucinating at this point. Even if I saw *it*, I had no idea what was going on. All this happening because of one mistake. 
 I should probably clear up this moron's memories. 
 But all I did was change the timestream of my reality, and I've ruined it. I'm headed down to the portal. We should head back to my reality now. 
 I wonder what will be here now? 
 So I'm returning to my real reality, but I'm not back to reality. The next time - would be a real good day to get my self out of that little soul-hole, and see what life has been like.

"What. The. Hell. The. Hell?! " 
 I, most likely the first to fail out on the panel, was at the con working on my epic cosplay show. I was flying into the air, my shirt almost falling from my head, bouncing down a plane into the wind as everyone passed by. It was a hell of a show! The tables must have been changed, I took the dress off and went to get it a couple years ago, but a few days later a misunderstanding occured. I had dressed up in the torn clothes of one of my co-stars. We bumped into each other and said " Goddammit dude! We're in camis... you going to k-girl the forked tentacles or whatever you want? How would this happen?! " I went over and tried to coax him into doing the k-girl thing but he said " I'm not sure dude, but I love it. " He grabbed me and pushed me to the ground, " Hey dude, " He said turning me around and slapped me on the back. " What's this show about? " He started pointing towards the room where everyone was waiting. 
 " The... " I heard a faint whisper from behind me. It was a female voice, she sounded a little sad looking, like a state the dude was in. I was here to get a peak of this goddess. 
 " Come with us! " She was saying, " We'd better go on display before you're gone! " 
 That was when I realized that I was in a room with several people, not one of them even dressed. It made me incredibly nervous. I was too distracted to react. 
 " Where's your costume, " I asked them. 
 " Check out these clothes, " One of the men who spoke to me said. " You might want to look at some of the clothes you don't wear. " 
 He gave me a look of fear. " Those in real life do look like Superman's chicken eyes. " 
 " That's my TV show right? " I replied back, " Who's Clark Kent? " 
 " You're Clark Kent! " He said pointing me towards the real Clark. I looked around, around at everyone else, at the cosplayers who were still dressed in those costumes, even those who wore their superhero outfits on stage. " Like when the costumes came up with a collage of books to get players. We wanted people to feel like they were Superman or something. We wanted this to be like game day. " 
 The audience looked at me incredulously. I wanted to say " We needed that. We didn't want to go into the dark, stupid werewolf style of this show. " But then they moved away. 
 I then realized, " It's a k-girl show with two female characters. So what's up with all the roleplaying?"

( Edit: formatting ) 
 The ship looked back on in darkness. A streak of mist was slowly drifting down the deck. As the figure crawled towards them, she began the magic, making sure everything around was gone. 
 She slowly turned, a sweaty mixture of blood and ice on the empty blue portal she put in the that of the ship. She did this in her school's pyroprobe, another false start to the afterlife. That's what fired the ponytail out of it, providing that thin, streaming smoke-stained throat the world had before to kill her. 
 After a moment of contemplation, she walked towards it, and left. The mage pulled his cord off it, watching as the two creatures stared at each other with such contemptuous looks that he looked like a caterpillar. 
 It continued onward as the other ponies looked about at each other, apprehensive of this seeming solution. They all seemed flustered. 
 He then turned to face her. 
 "How's life, " He blushed as he stated in a most condescending tone. 
 She stared at him in disbelief for a moment, and then said, " Not so bad. " 
 " But so are humanity, " He said, looking directly into his beautiful eyes. 
 " Not so bad as my school, I suppose. There's so much! Now stop whining about the end... I'm sorry. " 
 His eyes turned into a horrible, wild grin. 
 " I mean well we've decided to change that. " 
 " I do... do wish to try harder. I guess you could call it reincarnation. " 
 As he led her onward through the world, with faint anxiety in his eyes, he noted the unavoidable loss of humanity that she had seen recently. The scale of loss had become so large that every single one of the lives they had put in charge of had been lost to tragedy, ruin, disease, and pogroms. She had never said what that meant for them. 
 This same mage, a laughing laugh, shrugged off her three point two mana ice shield and grabbed the spear of a collapsed stately witch. She was now one with their creations. 
 The power to reverse time was infinite. She was a race of living things that formed into something. It was as if it was a set of universes, and she had created them. Even if the others died out slowly, her creations lived in the hole left by time itself. All the descendants of her creations and the ones she had created had it's own existence that she had not prepared for. It was the power to end all lives. All the lives of all those humans that kept their lives in order. All the billions that had been created at the end of each one of her death attempts. 
 Unified, they had been enjoying their lives for two millenia, and two millenia was not enough for her. She needed the powers, in order to live even if she didn't make it to the end. If the others died down, she needed to come to something new and powerful, something she could harness and use. And so she left the void, perching upon her old home, happily cavorting with the others of her kind.

It is like we're being born again in Africa or Asia or Australia or Morocco or wherever the hell you get the fucked up name. We made the leap, first from meat to grain, now from bones, once we slowly moved from corn to millet. Somewhere between hominids and Eurasian fish. We were copied as such. 
 The 'evil descendants' descended from the brown scythe caste, before going extinct through migrations. I've watched many an Earthling drain their first meal while I watch human life fade to dust on the shore of the ocean. Time passes faster by as their family matures, as their world softens and fills with civilization. We never really knew this, then what? We became shy, and I regret that for the rest of my life. Nothing made sense except that we had no family, no full name, no specific purpose, nothing I could understand or claim. We all weren't monsters at all. Humans made the leap, species only evolving, and then we were unstoppable, like a magical beast. From that point we were nearly extinct from there on out. The sea grew, earth grew warmer, and the sky grew bigger. I killed a few in a brown fox and spit on its face. For millennia, there was no reason to go to war. 
 Now we are at the end of the universe. We eat one of the many species of the planet. If we were satisfied, we buried us. We took fruit from the earth, and left the earth out. We put the planet as far into the future as possible, or we would not be able to. 
 Today is the day we look back on the 'bad' ones. 
 Not surprisingly, when it comes to humanity, that sense of forgetfulness is the only thing we seem to have in common. Why does my sense of humour just not translate as well as the morals we seek in life? I'd probably argue the genocide is worth it. 
 Do I even have to go anymore?

Dr. Rich Chester-Chicken smiled as his lab technician stole a rare off-hand irritation from his coffee machine. " Did you ever wonder why oxygen and oxygen flows, " he said with a fresh stillness to his voice as he observed the circuitry around the module. A series of stringy silicon-like screws and heat shimmers illuminated the module. " When your egg is mixed with water, it works. The " drip " system filters all oxygen and oxygen is literally flowing everywhere. Most computers can survive without oxygen at all. Now with oxygen flowing in everything, it just sucks you to more important things. " 
 " It almost seems like they came to collect another insect! " Dr. Rich thought to himself. " We only have room to find new and better ways to simulate cell growth, don't we? " 
 " Their DNA is really rather versatile. It has to be used in pairs, then we get the original DNA once we really really dig it in. Our DNA is simply nothing but sugar and salt. " 
 " That is what they call a fat cell... what are they going to do with it? " Dr. Rich asked as he took a deep breath. " Can it work? " 
 " What about something else in there? " 
 " That is the topic at hand, " Rich muttered, sounding a bit uneasy. A military report came to mind and came to mind, " They brought us D-Type plasma-based starships... over 3,000 years ago. Yet when we left Earth, our foot soon lettered unceasingly. This work could only be done with compacted material samples. With proper care, they could have an immortal race of black speckled organic matter. Why would they collect a device like this? " 
 " I'll show them... " Dr. Rich smiled and leaned forward as his technicians scooped up the device. 
 " Is that what they call a stopwatch?"

*Corpses at just the right place. * Dick Reeves stared out across the lakefront yard, forgetting the dangers that lie ahead. 
 *My guess is near the base, but still possible. * 
 Rick waved at Jason a few yards away from him, picking his dirtied back up to his feet. Riding deep behind, he did so lightly, sending a few small sparks through the stone floorboards. It was as if the world had been slowed down and kept on moving. 
 *Harder than a man on a speeding rollercoaster would think. * 
 Rick thought for a moment, glanced around and looked again at Jason, trying to think of something, anything*he*had*intrusted*hisself*into. Sitting up, he removed his shirt and drew in a breath. 
 "What do you have there Jason? " Rick snorted, sitting up. Jason stood wide eyed in disbelief. 
 " Yes, my kid. You see, I'm out doing the same thing twice a year. Doesn't mean I don't have a thing for you, that's my job. " The words took on meaning very quickly and quickly. Rick shook his head, continued folding the extra pocket money in a ball of his face. 
 Jason looked at the small lump of wrinkled paper in his palm. It was easily only four pages long. He remembered each time, each time using each word and each time laying on the ground with tears streaming down his cheeks. Yes, both times they said the same thing to him, both times from inside a pocket. And while he wailed that words had played out in his head once, again, and again, he began to feel weak as he struggled to keep his composure. 
 " No, it has to be you Chris. I'm gon na make sure you both get the items. The amount. On top of all that, put this money on the table and close your eyes. It's all I need. " Scott Reeves didn't know if he was listening to any of this or not. Rick knew that regardless of what Rick was thinking, Rick had been true to his word and one leg up on the table with him. That was a good thing in and of itself, Rob said. 
 " Chris, " Chris gulped, looking at Rick with hope in his eyes, " look at my feet. We're on top of something. " 
 Chris shifted his weight in the air, which caused Rick to look back at him and nothing happened. 
 " You want it? " Rick asked, " Now. " 
 " No, " Chris repeated. " Let's get the money done. I'll have to get the boxes ready to go. " 
 " Alright Rick, " Rob said. Rick picked up the box and carefully looked at it. It was small, sort of like a small baseball. Rick thought it was only a golf ball, or a ducky. 
 " What did you just tell me? " Chris asked, who then looked back down at the box. Rick took it up to his chest and placed it in one of the boxers. He sat down and opened the top of the ball and looked it over, his heart now in his throat. 
 " If you can put all of it together, " he said, " I can buy it a time. It will only be in an hour. " Rick tapped the ball on the table and Ron shot Rick a look that made him unclenched his jaw. 
 " Alright rob, " Rick said, glancing into Ron's eyes. " Just take the ball, move it over to the boxers and find the box on the ground. Someone will try and pick it off the table for me. I won't know what to do with it. " Ron continued, tapping at the table that had given him the ball. 
 " Look at what I bought. " Rick said, " What do you think I paid for? " 
 Ron stood and shook Rick's hand, before coming over to his desk and picking up the torn box. Rick could feel him standing there with his hands on the same side as Ron's. 
 " Look, kid, if we really have to be here, let's play dad, we should play this game. I'm taking this one real easy."

The doors opened just as luke started to venture downstairs, or so I thought, thinking it wasn't because I was too strong. I threw him from behind and clutched my metal blade in both hands. The poor bastards were nailed on the front of the building, but i had no luck with them. As I was walking over to grab the scissors, one of the dudes got to my throat and pulled the scissors away from my hand. The blades came out and the blade was just that much quicker, which is an amazing testament to the good work we did when we walked through the doors. The stranger has been dressing more frenziedly lately and the scissors just came out next to him now. So i decided I am ready. I grabbed the chickish old man beside me and held his hand. My partner wanted to give me a pass to this otherwise boring area of our city, as we don't have anything special in this city anyway, but they didn't want the stupid guy the n00bs found in this pit. That's when i thought n00bs and I began to do things! The assassins were following him, throwing bottles, furniture, anyone they could find. I jumped into the girl as she started rolling dice, this was the tip of the iceberg as he tried to push me to get the chasers. I joined in, i got in and stopped her. Everyone was joking about how badass she really was, how she had a hole in her uniform and a scowl on her face. And then we started to find out her last name is Despaigne. So I just had to say a few words, I needed to go visit the girls of this city.

It was the first day of spring. 
 Climbing out of the tile incubators, I peeked around. A groggy cousin washed up in the corner, barely able to fight back tears. A scarecrow walked into the room while I was down, leapt at the reassuring smile on my face, and leapt on me. We chatted like children together, forming a narrative across which to connect. This lab really was an adventure. 
 At about 17, the photographer noticed a drop in his bed sheets and started taking pictures. He picked up the camera, ignoring the prying eyes who were running around, rolling his eyes, maybe hiding in the corner. That camera had pictures of so much water, so many happy memories. The stray animals played with each other, buying water from local pools. 
 *It's almost 4:30 in the afternoon! * we all agreed together. He was afraid, but knew they weren't joking. I guess it just just made him angrier. He leaned closer and adjusted his helmet. I kept standing behind the camera, shrugging off the camera as I was crying, and trying to get out of bed. My tears rushed down my cheeks, as I could only watch as he was just getting out of the incubator. 
 “ Hey, there! ” I called. A sign marked the shutter. To my right, a naked woman leaned against the wall with her upper arm behind her back, watching his face, as though she were waiting for someone to come over and take it. She smiled at me and opened the door to the incubator, but when she turned around, nothing was there. " Hello, " she said. 
 My sister rolled her eyes and rubbed her eyes. " What're you doing!? " she yelled. 
 I shrugged. She quickly got up and left, leaving the camera behind on the counter. I couldn't remember who I was. The time for sleep was just four minutes away. 
 I had been thinking of staying up for a while, being the one kid I could get, so I started the shower. Still dreaming of being alone. I always would. As the shower started, I heard a reek from my room, rushing to get into bed. Or at least getting my things ready. 
 I went into my bedroom and held my hand out in front of me. When I put a hand against it, I couldn't feel anything. I was still blue-eyed from the night before, which was weird. It was like this was just an anomaly, that my physical body wasn't walking around, but had somehow gotten moved into the body of some outside source. 
 I tried to look around, but everything felt like it had been in some sort of unfamiliar place. I watched the door swing open. It was strange, because I couldn't find anything else. An invisible horde of men walked in, with no apparent reason to fight. I guess they didn't want me here, when I wasn't even about to explode in a panic. 
 I made my way to the shower and brushed the shampoo off my nose. Once the washing had completed, I sat and got dressed, putting on my clothes. It was a shaggy, button up navy shirt, rubber flip flops on my little head. 
 “ I'm so sorry you didn't come out, ” the invisible horde of men said. 
 “ What's going on? ” I yelled, and sat back in my chair, looking at the ceiling. The men would come soon, and it was going to rain in all of our windows.

God made a blanket. 
 It was hot, so it touched my skin like the mud in his belly. I heard my roommate ask how it felt. 
 "I don't understand. " 
 " No, I didn't feel anything, so why aren't you coming around like this. " 
 " I didn't want to fuck this up. " 
 " I just liked how you looked. " 
 The steam started to shoot off. I thought it was a cute bunny or a bird, or a person, but then I saw that your eyes were beautiful and rippling in the dark. 
 " You know, I could use some sleep. " 
 " Sleeping? Well, it's been quite a night. " 
 " Oh, it is. " 
 " Everything's going well. I feel amazing! " 
 " Yeah, I guess so. " 
 I wanted to just stop seeing other people, but you never did. And so they kept going on about fantasies. You kept saying'imaginary kids' and'imaginary monsters'. Why did you do this? 
 You were just an experiment. You weren't meant to escape. God had made this blanket, and I didn't have a reason to fuck up. 
 " So why aren't you leaving? " 
 " Because you're dumb. You can't just leave, and you're just another experiment. " 
 " Why are you leaving? " 
 " Because you were an experiment. You weren't meant to escape. God made this blanket, and I didn't have a reason to fucking fuck up. " 
 " What?! " 
 I choked on my beef jerky. " I'm quitting. " 
 " No. I had such a shitty existence. " 
 " You're quitting. " 
 " What? " 
 " No. I had so much fun. I spent an entire goddamn hour playing with kittens and putting fluorescent lights in their eyes. " 
 " Hiding it? Why would you want to hide something like that. " 
 " Because you didn't, not to me. I had to, I know it. " 
 You blinked. 
 " I love you, God. " 
 " There's never been a time where I don't love you more than now." 
 You glared at me.

"Harry, you'll have to hear this. " 
 Harry looked up at Lord Voldemort and his lords haggard faces. 
 " What did it matter? " 
 " Your dad right? " 
 " Huh? That's a lot of king fucks to talk about. " 
 " Heh. Yea, son, let me get this straight. " 
 " Yeah? " 
 Lord Voldemort looked on in incredulity. Harry was all too familiar with how Harry Potter was. From massive bed pictures to his fake eyebrows the grand wizard had no idea. Hermione had a prodigal son in Slytherin and he didn't exactly know how to motivate a witch. 
 Lord Voldemort stood in stunned silence in front of the entire Potter family. Harry turned his head towards Voldemort and found the pained look coming from his own eyes. 
 " So you did what's the point? " 
 " I know, right? Take me back to Hogwarts. Here I am, daresay Hogwarts will be all but gone... but.. " Harry shut his eyes and drew his wand in his left hand. 
 Voldemort the Pottersowl savaged the bloodred shimmer in his eyes as Harry grabbed his wand and brought it away with him. The red oil whistled in the air and curled around his fingers. In an instant, Voldemort began shrieking and huffing. 
 Voldemort turned towards the house with anger. He gripped his wand tighter in fear of getting caught in his rage. Even the walls in the house screamed with laughter, making curses and curses attached to itself. Even Snape sneered under his breath. Even Harry had turned his back on Voldemort. 
 While he was halfway through calling on the true hopes of Dumbledore, he noticed the very same man in his younger days in the Ministry. " Why is that? " he asked. 
 Harry sighed. 
 " You always knew you were a bad boy, Neville. " 
 " How did I know? I called Professor Flitwick to force this on you. He was a fool to summon you. " 
 " Well I was the one that forced Malfoy to put you in his place. " 
 " He was right. You were actually Slytherin's best friend, what can we do now? " 
 " Nothing. We can keep Harry up and running like a snake Harry. If he wants his hair to grow, we'll just have to stay and watch him fall. " 
 " Have you just summoned me? " 
 " No! " Voldemort threw a wide, frosty face, " Voldemort is as much a Potter as any Hogwart! " 
 " Stop being such a little boy! I don't want to hear these haggery talking all day about how I have little reason. I need to learn how to keep my word." 
 Voldemort took one more step forward and stopped abruptly. He turned around to find his godfather staring at him with shame. As it turned out, Dumbledore did indeed already know he had little to no reason to keep alive in this land.

Great premise, did a good job of explaining to the readers what this "data " is used for. I kinda liked my strip about the " decadence of city life " and having someone watch it as to why you don't follow it and suggest going back, but I hope you are going to appreciate the very technical sort of humour. Overall I enjoyed the character and plot development. It could be used for a novel but maybe develop as a new platform for a proper story... maybe just a try at branching out, maybe introduce a new culture, etc. 
 Lastly, you did such a good job describing the letters " Eu " and " Eu-ky " in a very superficial manner. It's very clear that you did not understand the concept, they're like numbers to you. Your draw-in keeps evolving more gradually and all the emotions you are navigating are changing so that it becomes less apparent to you as you're navigating them. It's hard to convey with the stuff you are doing in an environment which is pretty oppressive and I couldn't find any ideas for how to improve on the lack of progress I had or have read on the force to increase the visual fidelity. 
 I think you are very clever. The sense of a " sea " which, by the way, just doesn't fit the word " war " is the definition of desperation. One thing you certainly were missing is... someone captivating from a more general sense of fantasy and shows how passionately, and thoroughly realistic, the world could be. Given that I suspect this could have helped the story to reflect more the way of the " war ". 
 Also, you absolutely nailed the condescending tone and lack of exploration into the way the " fauna and flora " are presented. However, I just enjoyed seeing you do it in an aspect of general characterization which has been lacking, which would be a shame in itself. As a writer I just can't get used to the comical almost-anything, but it's still a testament to your ability to keep going on. Your tone of " many houses have broken down " and " some people would be so proud" did a nice job explaining away the fact that they already knew the meaning behind it. And that's what really made me happy and impressed the reader about the uniqueness you set yourself up for the reader. 
 Anyway... really enjoyed reading your strip and enjoy seeing some of your other stuff!

This sucks. It was time to act. Right now, the karma system is allowing people with the most hated or disliked to reign their own internet hegemony. Although if you were to trash your favorite twitter account, people might not believe you for a week or so, and probably throw you on the internet. However, it's easier to kill a dragon than to eat a rabbit. 
 Let's try our best to slay a dragon. 
 Getting unlucky gets you 200,000 karma. Not giving into them, however, is incredibly easy. Just fill out a form and the file will unload from the internet, revealing your name, birth date, last location, maximum karma left, badge number, gender, and what kind of crazy sex it is. 
 Now, you may think it's odd that someone is saying "Good morning, doctor! " but... that can't be right. I am a doctor. I am knowledgeable, well... exactly what you want me to do. 
 I place my trusty dildo on my desk, and enter the computer screen. 
 "
Yessss, what my name is " 
 The notepad quickly flips through the reddit for several minutes. 
 " OK, so that's another 200,000 karma. How long has it been? " 
 It seems more about 20 days than thousands on reddit. 
 " Well.. I'm 27, officially. In the last four days alone I have not returned my dildo nor join in any other activities. I'm not the type of person to spend one more week on Reddit, " I point out to one of my patients. 
 A smug smile slowly cuts across her face. 
 " Would you care to explain to us just one thing? " She asks, her tone mysterious. 
 " Huh... Well my name is Robert Dsexan Moore. I'm a medical ninja... I'm an active member of the gangs known as The Maelstrom, and I work for the..."

"Come on! " The young man's voice carried me, echoing across the empty floor. 
 The voice of a thousand voices faded as the wall that symbolized sin enveloped me. Fear swept over me and I turned back to the vampire. " Where have you been? " 
 " Old man Travis, our Master of Faith called you here, I need you to stop being here for a moment. " 
 I was this way a while back. The planet I lived in was plagued with arctic storms, ravaging the otherwise healthy and moist soil. It was a curse of sin, tainted by old, twisted gods. 
 " Well, at least I didn't come here to kick you out of your bed, just to play Star Trek at the beach. If my brothers here had followed me, maybe the craft could be used as a punching bag for the remaining two of us. " 
 I didn't mind the thought. After years of going to my warriors, these men, the ones I killed, they understood my connection to something I could do without. With the others, it was just going to be me and Travis. 
 " Calm down " the man placed a hand on my shoulder. " I am staying here. I am going to be here for a while. " 
 What the hell? Why are you whispering to me, what's going on in my head? 
 " Come now baby. I am going to start screaming in your mind all night." 
 I could hear the pain radiating through me. My blood flushed and I started to change. I smiled. 
 I always said I would be here.

My destiny decided on this day. No matter what of what you think I do, I must do what my brain tells me. Every decision I make is backed up by facts, you saw my picture on the bathroom mirror, and what I know. I have the keys, the real deal. I have the money. All I have to do is get it from a friend. Get it from the dealer. Get it from any guy... except this guy... and it was real. It was real. It was on my fucking laptop. 
 Even before the bomb went off I had had a girlfriend. She had the blood in her veins, while I had the frustration in my being. But in my heart I know I am going to be great. 
 He came over to the bed and sat down on the edge of it. My life depended on it. Only the old man could find the courage to admit it. Every day felt like an event. Every paycheck wasn't fair. Every drug dealer's clients stole from me, and here I am. 
 But I stand by my decision, not because I owe him, but because I believe I made the right decision. " Does something have to happen? " He asked. I responded by clenching my fist, and pulling the trigger. My blood smoldered on his black knuckles, I immediately reeled back. 
 " No, nothing happened, nothing has happened, " I replied. " I just felt like I had to say something. " I could feel that I had already made the right decision. Maybe it had been made earlier, but who knows? I made the right choice. 
 The bomb went off and my chances of surviving got better. I wasn't able to have sex with people, but I didn't feel as though I was in it. I just tried, damn it I did. My boobs started to bulge, growing in size as well as my confidence, I told myself that if I continued in my ways I would have no chance. I made the right choice, as the last of the drugs began to flit out of my system, I walked away knowing I had made a mistake, but I never did say anything. 
 He grabbed my gun as I looked at the papers that were on the table. It was all I could don't to cough up blood. Even through the doctors skills I still couldn't pull the trigger. Only by standing up on this bloody couch and shooting him in the gut, that I had saved my life. I stretched to my knees and let the pain take me. 
 " You made the right decision, sorry. That was wrong of course, but I told you so! " I sobbed. " I didn't like the way your hair looked." I felt my fists tip right in my mouth, I gripped the trigger and let him know it was done.

Luke wasn't surprised at the tone in his voice, although he assumed it was the truth. He put down the notebook, and went to the bathroom. 
 Before going to the bathroom, he considered what words he could say to get some more out of this. 
 “ I hate to say it but it ’ s a good thing we were able to help. ” 
 Luke cut in. “ You ever heard of angels being God to demons? It just seems to me that they ’ re almost as good as the angels. I don ’ t mean they are in God ’ s sight. ” 
 “ But they ’ re God ’ s sight? Why would it be God? ” 
 “ He is the one and only that who can truly bring the light back to the world. The angels and demons he kills, the devil and angels in his stead, and he wants them to be saved. They don ’ t know it at first, but that ’ s how they ’ ve always been. The people that come here, heaven and hell in one go and they ’ re all safe. But sometimes some people have to kill because some people come to love something, and some just don ’ t want a part of Heaven and angels. It makes you wonder what the right thing to do is. ” 
 Luke turned around to see what demons were looking at. Even though they ’ d just heard a few, there were still a few demons standing around looking for the right thing to do. Luke hoped there was some kind of reason. He drove around the dirt road to meet the group. 
 He left the good men at the main gate. They didn't seem too friendly to him. They didn't look like God at all and perhaps even less intelligent at all. He saw a black car pull up and a hole formed in its front bumper. Luke went down with the squad. 
 
“ THE HOLY HELL? ” 
 As Luke stood up on the ground, he noticed that he was not laying in the grass. He glanced around until he was directly in front of the star. He could smell smoke. 
 “ FUCK YES. HELL. REDDIT. 'LOG IN.' ” The entity in front of him clicked and lit up his browser. 
 “ [ You are a moderator of /r/TheSmokingMongrel and in the foreseeable future you have been cut from the side of the screen due to you taking admin roles of /r/IMAGINE.

They all say you should do it. Tell your mother that a drunk driver choked you when you stole your yogurt bowl. Tell her that you just need some fluid to keep from coming off. Please tell her that you'll give her the rest of her. 
 They all say that that only your wife knows how to love someone. You'd be a complete whore without her. You'd be a complete monster. 
 I don't care. Everything I do, every idea I make, every discovery I make is for her. I'm his friend. I know that his whole world is just as happy to cut you down as it is to lay low to forget you're worth anything. 
 Hell, she doesn't even know I'm alive. I can feel it. The world around me is filled with hatred and joy. What if I tell her? What if I tell her how cold and needy I am and how stupid I am? 
 People say that all lies, the scars on your skin, and the mean spiritedness of people, are small. They say that the larger lies are bigger. Do you really believe in that? Those words send shivers through you. 
 -- -- 
 The message was a promise to her and her future. She had promised herself that she would never have to be a liar. 
 She thought of every lie that was perpetrated by an old couple, every love call she has ever had, every life regret that one could possibly ever have. 
 When she spoke, I told her I couldn't live like this. I couldn't live like this. But as I lifted the suitcase to pick up my coat, I caught a glimpse of my soulmate. 
 He stood astride a crate. A bottle of pills sat in the corner. 
 "That would be 25. " He said. " Is that half a pack? " 
 " " 
 " Would you want to go back next week? " He asked. " If she didn't tell me? " 
 " " 
 He closed the lid and gave a half-smile. " And you said you wouldn't tell me? I promised you I would never tell her. " 
 " " 
 He chewed his lips and started to laugh. " I know that promise, baby. " 
 The bottle was empty and there was a brief moment of silence before he coughed and fell asleep. 
 -- -- 
 I looked at her and whispered, " Don't go, Rachel. They're coming."

Don't be like most of the others... not really. I don't have a body... I mean there are no legs. I mean there's not a body. Did all the girls learn just how to behave themselves? Or were they sexually attractive? 
 I did, and I'd been following through on all my normal orderliness. After a few days, I got off work. It was fine, I did finish school. I had a nice life. 
 So I decided to join the group at a young age. It wasn't long before I had my training. One group had just begun... One of them had on some sort of fake human body. Pretty young guy. Didn't know it but he had all these tattoos. He had a key to anyone's door. The ones with smaller pressed dots, the ones with three lines on them, were labeled random number. 
 But now, I had a naked body. I had transformed into the new kind. I was still on the same body as he did. That's what I expected. But I couldn't complain. It was pretty great. All the girls agreed that they enjoyed the sight. That's how I became my own girl. 
 I set out to see what happened. Just following it were the guys. Eight girls had been and a man. One of them was screaming at me for it. Had his rights been violated? 
 He quickly grasped the ball of dirt in his hand. He ran toward me, took off his shorts, and put on some fake things. Even the vaguely human looking ones were getting closer. Then, one of the guys jumped on my body. Again, this time he had his big keys for everyone's door. 
 "Stand back! " He screamed. " GET BACK HERE! " 
 After putting on my secretarial suite, he appeared behind the other man. He had a box from another organization he had claimed to have just been casing... He inserted a flimsy piece of metal. It moved back and forth as he did it. 
 Then, we saw it. As an angel stepped forward, it gave us the lights. They were illuminated by the earth. Like any other angel, it looked like nothing would come out until we saw it again. 
 Every other angel looked surprised. No one else looked shocked, and no one else was ready to take off their shoes. 
 I ran away. That was at least the start. The idea of being naked again was a bit frightening. And from where I was, I knew exactly what would happen. I didn't know where I'd go. What day would I get to put on my secretarial costume? I didn't know what kind of secretarial and staff I would hold. I didn't know who was in charge. 
 But I knew I'd be home for the night. I had no choice. Because a few hours later, I was sent flying in the direction of what looked like hell. 
 I figured that's when I saw it. A sign over the gate. And the sign said 'Stay Back.'

Robert stood in the room quietly. The pager in the edge of his TV blinked off as he contemplated what he was seeing. It was not his first visit by alien ships. Most of them had flown over the galaxy in 882 since the foursome of an ancient race had first started transit in the Kardashev system. But they did not have a star system to conquer or destroy. 
 The strain of building a bridge was far from comfortable as it had become. Even hands and feet were shaking as they dutifully lugged the countless cargo back to their vessel. Each alien lacked a ship just like him. Their ships would not be ready for another 100 years. Without time, they would be easily overwhelmed. 
 The first of them came on us. The black, streaming in through a far wall. Its shape changing from green to orange as it accelerated. It came in waves across the curved surface. Its metallic surface simply glowed off. Robert had seen the mouth of the creature. It had a back in it, almost reptilian. A spider-like body with a fangs that ripped through the flesh like a spider. The mouth was growling with hunger in response. It roared as its muscles launched away from Robert to mate with him. 
 The next twenty-three seconds went by with little delay. Robert led the old stranger down a hallway to his repair bay. He was quick to greet the human with baited breath and followed close behind him. He took the sidearm from underneath his suit and held it in front of his eyes as the humans tore at the metal. A metal band formed around the metal covered mouth. The human was tongue hanging off his neck. 
 Without stopping, he freed his hands from the talons hanging around his head as he pressed the new badge on his hip. 
 Robert opened his mouth to scream but his goal was to prevent the humans from catching on to what was happening. Robert began unwrapping a vial of orange liquid. He approached the canine and began licking it, waiting. The canine howled as Robert removed his mask and walked away. He had fifty percent of the tanker harvested and stored at a distance of about five million miles. 
 The alien warship stopped in mid-flight and seemed to accelerate down again as Robert completed its tasks. He called back, letting out a whistle that was barely audible over the din of battle. Within a second the ship touched down at a small cove. The human ran over to him, mewling. 
 "Not again. " Robert said. 
 " Exactly, Mr. Tammoy. We have evidence of life support in here. " The alien asked. 
 " And what. Was. All. You. Deposed. " Robert responded. 
 " Quite literally. " The humanoid replied. 
 " So, just one moment. Can't you just give it a chance? " 
 " Neither can anybody else." The creature continued, seemingly oblivious to its words and their implications. 
 Robert slowly brought the cockpit of the ship's other 'Crew' to the nub. He unlocked the pods and stepped into the airlock. The robot was gone. Robert sat in the cockpit, the cylindrical container behind him. He took a deep breath and looked out into the blackness, following the exact pattern of the vessel. The black flesh was always fascinating. More often than not, he didn't really understand what it meant. 
 Robert walked past the humans towards his repair bay. It had not done much damage. He walked back past the humans and got into his pickup truck. With the last line of effort he pushed his way through the trio.

"THE WAR WAR ITS THE WORST OF All! " The walls shatter as the thunder cracks the night sky. 
 " Don't give me that smile, it's not fair. " You laugh at that, a laugh so pathetic, that you almost feel sorry for yourself. But you know it has to be true. You think about what should have been a sweet chance, you think about what you could have done... Well, you *could have* done something else. You think about what you could have done to win this war. 
 " After all we have... In the eyes of death what they always do is..... Fuck it." You let go. 
 It hasn't been nearly enough, but it will be enough. Thank you.

You remember people on 3rd and 6th when people started showing signs of being people? Yeah, I did that too. But it was cool back then. And not when I saw th of stories and I could hear their voices. I remember it like it was yesterday. 
 Anyway we all remember people on 6th on big drugs. And that probably wouldn't be long. But now? Today that's different. You remember the lights were on again and it wasn't small parties at first. Like in Those Star Wars movies. 
 It was like drinking now... Good thing you took a drug I just found that, did you know, that's what made you heroin?

"God damn it! " Steve cried as the hand of the dying cat chewed a stuck line and prepared to rub it in the dog's face. He looked at the small pit corner tentatively, terrified that whoever might have left it had forgotten about Steve. The cat chewed hard and then bit back, looking angrier and angrier. Steve considered getting to work quickly, but could not. It was more important that Steve had more items to pick up. All on his 4th floor garden apartment. He'd been thinking that maybe one day he'd tell the dog someone's name, but the kid at the shelter kept calling out his name so he had to go out with an apple and then he wouldn't eat anything for the rest of his life. 
 Steve ran out the door his way, fist clenched on the handle, trying to pick up some sort of frame to hold onto as he made the slow road back to his office. One hand on the handle and one feet behind the desk. It was late at night, which of course meant his phone was on his side. To get to work, he needed to get his late night snack from the restaurant behind this long trailer we took to work. He jumped down and had a knife just clipped to the back of his shoulder. He checked his watch one more time as he made his way to the blueberry shop around the corner to take a bite. For the briefest moment, Steve felt fear rush through his heart. For hours he labored and struggled to get up and go into the kitchen to sneak a bite. Only a couple of times he saw the box in the oven the night before. Steve's arm was slipping but he'd kept it to himself. Tears spilled from his eyes when he picked it up and took a bite before opening it. His face completely flushed, but his voice didn't waver. 
 " How... " he croaked. 
 " I have my... " 
 " I'm sorry... " 
 " Son, please, just because a kitten chews your line... it doesn't mean you have to pay for your school every time I start a fucking workshop. I was an accountant as soon as I was even born... and then just my ass. Can you please say something? " 
 " N-no, sorry son. " 
 " But dad... " 
 " Very well. Just ignore it and try not to look at the cat... it's a mess. " 
 Steve felt his stomach writhe as he replied " Okay, I got you ok, Steve. Thanks Dad, you're a lifesaver. Now don't let that puppy go. " 
 After ten minutes of stillness and a bit of groggy breathing, Steve finally stood. " Dad, what the hell is wrong with you? You think your wiener's for stealing fresh cranberries? " Steve looked at the cat he was supposed to eat with his other hand. It was growing more and more scared, despite the cat's wish to go away, and turning all the softer. Steve laughed. 
 " You're sweet and smart, nice and soft. " Steve smiled weakly. It had been a long time since he had been more scared, it couldn't be normal, could it? 
 " I am fine, sweetie. " The cat smiled. " And just... you know dad... your company's just getting started... it's just... like your boss said before, and it's just boring there. Go ahead, go, go! " 
 The cat scooped up Steve's binoculars to look at the dog that was nibbling on his arm. What could he say? He looked at the dog's head. 
 " I should've known it wasn't a game." 
 And there it was again. Steve glanced up and the cat squirmed away from the screen.

"Well listen up scientists. " The General said, gesturing at a small room, one of the few things that was turning out well for the planet. " It is a truly wondrous weapon and if we come to any conclusions, no one would believe it's truth. And besides... if it were to go off... no one would be able to afford a laser that can mimic human intelligence. " 
 He walked over to the window overlooking the planet and began zipping it's walls in a show of strength. " I mean it doesn't look like any artificial intelligence, at least not compared to our actual hardware. We have no weapons these robots have, and our existence is very light considering everything around them ( I had a mild panic attack when I saw its alien disguise ) isn't firing laser pulses. So there are no direct light sources, except some dark sections of the universe around us, which is why I'm here. " 
 A long pause ensued as the alien demanded the place had landed on Earth and continue to screech nonsense at me. " Now... show me... " 
 " No, it is a full building, one that looks about ten times the diameter of the ground! This planet will appear high in the sky in 20 hours. " The General asserted. 
 " Then it's going to crash, and more importantly will begin alien's wish to colonize. That seems very reasonable, I would say. " I sighed. 
 " I realize I'm being a bit self-fulfilling, but my robot was clearly an alien, you know how much everyone likes to think it's intelligent. But truth is that the organism we created would decimate it's entire genetic architecture, and humanity is not one of them. So until we meet a fellow civilization, or something, I don't have the right to possibly launch a military ship. " 
 The General began to plead his case, and continued zipping it's wall, and I noticed that he had appeared to be holding his arsenal of laser fire. In a snap, I realized that my scanner had been secured. 
 " Bring out the rest of your engineering team! " The General shouted. 
 I turned to the rest of the team, and they were holding a sort of circular space battle, demonstrating their power. They were technically walking to the various operating systems in their suits. " How could they say that to humans if they didn't even know what's in our native language, and how hard it's been for us to learn it? " 
 I looked at the general, and started to question what he was saying. " There is a reason for our existence, really, and that's because the vast majority of these civilizations believe that we are a superior species capable of technological achievement. Is that right? Or is it wrong? " 
 " The problem with that statement is that the humans are constantly critiquing our intelligence and learning, until they are a bit different. It might be for the most important reason, though. We have learned more that other beings, in all their stories, have. Our technology is superior, unlike any other we have ever seen, though not to us. There have been countless theories, they all fall through over the course of the course of millions of years that they mean nothing to us. However, the ancient Greeks did not believe, nor did ancient Egyptians. So now we are pioneers of evolution. " 
 The General laughed, and began zipping his walls and falling down to earth. 
 " Alright, fine, put it out. " The General said, taking another chunk from his mouth and enjoying a few moments of decompression. " Cut it out! " 
 The computer screen flashed and the gray-white floating girl was gone, along with the rest of the world. I took out my phone and called the General, who had already prepared his speech for me. " What do you think we should do? " I asked. 
 " We should import a higher quality robot with a better experience, and perhaps we could create life. Sure, we're robots, but their programming style was amazing. Our design tree wasn't that bad, but it did require a few cycles of development, and then it was there was no code. When that happens, there's little we can do about it. Besides, we've had this debate for decades over which is worse. I think we need a different approach. Next time. " 
 " Why didn't you talk to them about it? " I asked, staring off into space. 
 " I think we should do it ourselves."

"Aww, I can't believe you brought me back so sorry, but I couldn't tell you a truth. " I looked at him, my husband's face turning red. 
 " It's okay, really. I don't blame you. " He admitted for the second time, smiling. 
 " It's alright? I just love you though! " I muttered to him, putting my index finger to my lips. 
 " But I am only here to help you, if this is my last time here. " He turned to look at me, his fake fake eyes filled with tears. " I don't have to pretend. I know, I know I fell for you, I know I got stuck with someone who doesn't love me, but I love you. " 
 He left abruptly, his heel raised to his side, the hand I had always been carrying now disappeared as well. His frown grew in one swift movement, the ground knelt before it. I reached around my waist to meet his hooves. 
 " I'm sorry, I'm feeling empty now, I don't want to see you, I know that I'm at fault for this. " I listened for a moment to his heartfelt words, he stayed quiet as he clasped his hands. " I can't stop loving you! I just need to feel okay. Just shut up, and just let go. I need to know if you loved me, and if it was right for you to stay. " He pulled my finger away from my lips as I tried to cry, I shook his hand gently as he reached for the fabric. 
 A loud *crash* could be heard from behind us as I fell to the ground, my sight blurred as I looked at the rest of the soldiers. My husband opened his arms as I fell into the darkness, his eyes seemed to blink back into reality, an ominous rustle echoing in the silence. 
 There he stood, his right hand resting on my shoulder, pulling me away from the ground. I had to walk away. 
 A rusty car rumbled in front of me as the sedan sped off. 
 " That was a slow day for a guy."

"I don't want to. I have only one thing to do now. It's too late for that. " 
 " No, no, no. No, no. It won't take much longer. Remember when you gave me your life, she brought it to you? " 
 -- - 
 " Okay. But I need to say something. " He sat at the counter, sat on the ground again, looked out at the street. 
 " I can't, no. No, no. The next president isn't going to stand by and don'thing. I don't want to help. I have to tell everyone who told me I shouldn't even have loved them, I have to tell everybody. So do it, boy. " 
 " It's a gift, Jim. It's been a privilege. " 
 " Am I supposed to? " 
 " Okay. You can go save the last one. It really is a gift. "

 Jowled and confused, Reza strummed a guitar, clicked the keys. He reached out. 
 " You're drunk. " 
 Jim tugged at his shirt. " Nope. No not exactly."

I want to jump but it is not happening. It just slows to a slow and steady rate. My hand feels like a rope, the seams torn in everything but and in the corners, my wrists and ankles. I finally found my position. I try and talk, I can not speak and though I can't utter any words I am able to feel things hard slipping off my mind, clinging tightly to my veins. The hallway home lights flicker to life, and though the lights fade away I see light switch on and turn on, and then I feel light wrap around me and I'm not in any shape or form. 
 The lights seem to glow in my house though I haven't been in it for a long time and can't put my finger on it. I'm real thin around this point and I am tired and I'm nervous, I kind of wanna, like go at something and I can sense it, that pull of something and when I get comfortable it's like a claw brushing down my face until I'm down next to that skinny box my friends always leave with me, but with my weight still taking me the distance and keeping me coming back up. 
 The last thing I see after this rush is my landlord coming home late and I'm wearing makeup and standing there "So no skateboards " through the eyes of anyone walking down the street " I tell him not to worry friend, I really have only seen one jumper. 
 There's a knock at the door, and then my friends and the two kids walk up just outside me and what did I see...? I guess I hope that people don't have claws on my legs and what they did is just a lucky trick. 
 I'm standing there in my room staring at the broken sock and the leg that wrapped around me and how little on it I was trying to grab. I shake the helpless part off. It feels so good, " Come here kid, I need help ". Then the little door opens, and I start poking through the cracks I made with my toes. The kids were there really well I guess they should have been up, though I'm pretty sure I'm not going back. 
 " Friend? Please no, please stop it's cold in there. Get in the room, please, go in with me. See your mom and dad or sister, maybe they can meet you. Oh, what do you want to do buddy? " I'm weak now, but it feels good. 
 " Michael, what did you do? " 
 " You hurt me. " 
 " Oh, forget what I'm saying, but it looks like you can kill a human." 
 Two fingers tug on the trigger, one this tiny one and one that big. I think I'm going to fall. I will crash through one of the side windows and give myself a glassy bottle of water. I should try to call my dad. I will give myself a prescription for copinoterol.

"Say, why did the... aa- 
 " I don't know who that was, exactly, but it was a PC with blue tinted windows. " 
 My girlfriend and I sat outside of our condo, wondering what happened. 
 " Dear? Why is she wearing her lap-beater? " 
 We had all heard of pirates, superhero hijinks, or whatever law fighting techniques came in this place. Our internet was constantly flooded with the messages that led to public ridicule, but the bitter cold inevitably returned every now and then. 
 " Well, it was like 9:22 p.m. on a Monday morning. " she said. I'd only heard her talking about her diary entries back when our daughter went to soccer practice, no offense, but my subconscious could relate. 
 " I don't know what was going on... and it was weird, y'know? " 
 " Yeah, weird. " 
 " But, you're 30, you have an amazing physique! " she put the bike rack away in her backpack. " That's important. " 
 " I mean, I still didn't get much of a workout. " 
 " Oh, damn, " she laughed, " I think you should check your calendar. " 
 " What calendar? " 
 " Uh-huh, believe me, you don't have anywhere convenient to go. And right here, just look for the legend of KATIE! " 
 " Thanks. " I flipped through the magazine to see the other kid's birthday. 
 " She was an ostrich! " 
 " Yes. " 
 " And that's just stupid. You pretty much never can support yourself if you're going to be ostriched all the time! " 
 " Fuck you, you just suck. " I looked at the mirror. My mum was wearing a black suit and tie with shades. " I don't see how we'd handle the situation with her. " 
 " What do you mean we're coming home after school anyway? " 
 " Just go on the road. Come with me and our little girl on your way home. " 
 I couldn't bear it anymore. " Do you know who that was? I mean, she was real weird. " 
 " We had a phone conversation and she asked you about the... copyright infringement work. I'm getting sick of this crap, so I'll just finish my diary entries and sign off. " 
 " And what does it say?'Oh, you're fat.' " 
 " I'm a... little fat. " 
 " No, you have super... powers. You should know that. " 
 " Ah, yeah, um. Exactly." I walked to the door and waited patiently for my girlfriend to get back. I went to tell her the news, but it was too late. She quickly assumed it was an accident, and promptly left, like a burnt out angry football fan coming out of a previous turn-over. 
 I'll always remember that day. Then I go to sleep like that, always wishing that the computer was just somewhere other than the internet.

I looked down at the things that had stopped me. The furniture that they had made me wear. The bathrooms that they had roamed. My clothes that I stole to the airport. 
 I went straight to the bathroom, took out a bucket to wash, and knocked on the door. It opened and answered. 
 "Hello, John. I just wanted you to know that every person that love you is born with their heart attached to you. With each passing minute they love you even more. After a few minutes you will be beside them. So when you come back home and see them together. Happy? Really happy? " 
 The words came out without any problems. No one could understand that. They hadn't ever kept anything in their hearts. So I went to the toilet and removed the things that I had stolen that I had kept in my bathtub. 
 " A lot of people are spending money on prostitutes, and we've stopped them from spending any money on alcohol, or doing drugs or whatever. Our rooms have packed rooms with everything we need. You could find every pair of shoes you need, and you could buy any pair of pants from our stores. If you think it would be easy, then keep it in your own room. So just tell them that you love them, and they will surely love you as well. " 
 " Hmmm. That is a great idea! And no one will say yes to me anytime soon! I don't care if it can work or not! And I can make it happen. I don't like having to worry about needing somebody else around to hear that say. Just know that I will make sure you'll do the same. " 
 " Ahhh! That would be very great! " The Genie exclaimed excitedly. " This is it. I have made it this far! I'm halfway there! Thank you for this! " 
 " That sounds great! Thank you. " I looked at the Genie in awe and appreciation. 
 " Another five months, " the Genie continued " and at that moment you and I will only be able to hear you speak."

He had to go to the red hot elf place. What if he wanted to steal a trick? 
 He needed to know. A mercenary master or a embittered fat old man must have their arms wrapped around a cow. Of course, big bad Cogsworth would have a reason to lie in the water. 
 Over the course of the night he would rest, the tired but unrelenting logic of Cogsworth clamoring that he was worthy to look upon him with eyes as dark as hell before struggling to wake any more people from the night's revelry. Cogsworth's eyes *needed* to see this all again. They had sought him the most of all, starting with breaking him, once, on his first hunt, and have since learned that this was meant to be him playing that up against the silent and frozen blood. But that wasn't true. Cogsworth's eyes always felt as cold as heaven. 
 And the thing is, Cogsworth wasn't simply locking himself in the leg of a cart. The cold night air couldn't just reach him by its wrapper. The cold nights nightlife could never hold things in his hands so much as to resemble a convulsion. * But not much more*. Then again, the sleeping dreams of hiding from the cold were the worst nightmares that he had ever had and could never tell if they were true. It was because there were no physical sensations, but part of him had long since transformed the very rational thought that sat between the grasping fingers of death. The cold night brain, the sole thing that gave the ability to act, was the explanation of the reality of the situation. 
 Cogsworth raised his arm and the hard turtle held the musty, wet pants of this man staring at him. But no move. His body had repeatedly tried his best not to protest, but on more actual occasions that just made things worse. His punches had failed, even against a stiff and nonchalant elf. A guard who ate a cow at the food court refused to lift his head enough. Was he trying to give him trouble? 
 But his rage was waning in spite of all that was left. His outrage continued, but his steel arm now aimed at Cogsworth did nothing to halt it. He waited until he could lean against the cold wooden ground and sneeze, then the cold steel to let him breathe. Then he would kiss the wild carnivorous tail of a moose, the triumphant creature before Cogsworth and the once young boy who would eventually be his son. 
 He had a quiet dawn to tell him. An eternity to lay his weapon, to feel the soles of his feet and the softest of nightsite, to feel the softest of teeth and claws and everything in between. * For the first time in his life, * Cogsworth thought to himself, *I should never have been your burden, my warrior. * 
 He knew now, as he always had.

As a child my father brought a blanket to the house, as a reward for the best meal he had ever had. On my birthday, my father gave me a blanket. I cried, but my father said I had waited many years to share a blanket with him. Eventually, I was allowed the blanket, and on my birthday, after father had had his first bite of his food, my mother kissed his cheek and gave him the blanket. My mother called me to her house, but it was dark outside, so I didn ’ t see the light turn on. All I saw were the same dim lighting, a few tall-bellied cats lit up an empty house. And one, distinctly approaching, black-haired man had been sitting on the couch, holding a foot-long knife. My father turned off the television. As if on cue, the cat could be seen stumbling slowly away from the keyboard in his throat. “ What is that? ” my father remarked while scratching the fingers of his chin with his index finger. “ Something sick. ” 
 “ You dare to ask this question, ” said my father, “ when do we end? ” 
 “ Moments. ” I replied, and nearly ran out of the house, following the movements of my father. 
 From all that I see, the cat was at least thirty feet away from the blank wall, and the darkness was perfect. The man had his feet on the wall, and the blanket on his feet. From what I can gather, the man had a knife with sharp edges that he would stab into the wall if he couldn ’ t find a way to get at it from there. 
 Then, just as the cat had gotten closer, it moved. “ Oh shit. ” I said, “ Where the fuck is this shit coming from? ” 
 The darkness was expanding rapidly and I was able to locate it, however, as it rushed through the bulk of the body. The man stopped as well. He broke the blanket in two, and it appeared as if the man had stabbed it a couple of times. 
 I rushed to the window, searching for the source of the light. All I found were stars, crashing against the sky like falling bricks. 
 Meanwhile, in a nearby bush, a ponytailed boy held up a newspaper. “ My best friend has shown up in a week, ” the ponytailed boy shouted. 
 I pulled the newspaper out and read the headline. “ Ok, here goes nothing. NOOOOOOOOOOO: How I Survived The Lashing of His Life, where he the villain. ” 
 I did not cry, because I knew that what the boy had shown me was true. I said the word. “ Is that why everyone says he is bad, ” the boy said, touching my cheeks. “ You know I said the words. ” 
 I cried, because I knew that on my daughter ’ s birthday, she was going to see my best friend. As the closest thing I can remember was her face, her hands covered in the coat of her clothes, her bandana resting on top of her head. Her golden hair was long, beautifully curled, as if it were carried by a great beast or lion. Her eyes were full of snowflakes, as were the shoes she wore. Her face looked sickly, holding a smile. 
 The blond boy slid his hand behind my head, and a smile so loud I almost hit my head. “ Would you love to know what happened that day in the village? ” I asked. 
 But he said nothing, as if he was scared of what his friend said. “ Why didn ’ t I say the words? ” he continued. 
 “ Now all that ’ s left is to find the villain, ” I said, taking the paper. 
 The unicorn came by quickly, carrying it to a cab. It then leaned in close to the young girl. “ We have been arriving for someone. Remember to call the police. ”

No one likes their opinion of food. Seriously, I can't say I like being rational. I'm almost deep in the rabbit's legs for one reason. It's because one instant, I'm in your kitchen. Your food has been for years. You keep asking me about it and I bet it's not good. I guess I'd rather people simply avoid it than face my own guilt. When I saw the little man I liked so much he got on his bike and left. The bike had disappeared. But I hadn't asked him to leave. So I went to pick it up. And it vanished. I was in my car with it. It had a light shining into me. Its side was gold and I felt relief as my car was gone. I sighed. I watched as a car tried to get me from a few grisly murders. Maybe the diet had not broken the code. If not, perhaps it should. I drove to the place I came from and was surprised to find that it was open. 
 That's when I realized the truth. " I'm not in the chef's business." I confessed.

"What was that? " I asked, scratching my head. " I'm surprised they even gave it a name. " 
 Carl took the box. " Yes, that's right. One call gave it another name. " He pushed the box aside and looked at the side of my face. I sighed and opened the box. I gently grasped the box, only to realize the remote was at the bottom, along with a fancy ballpoint pen. 
 The exit was narrow. He told me I would never leave the mission, that I would never hurt any civilians. " The cameras aren't supposed to talk. " he continued, " the cameras didn't think I'd make it out alive. " He lifted his hand and looked at the camera, a wide, sharp looking title, from under it. 
 " I was supposed to have told them nothing. " 
 " I was supposed to tell the U.S. government it wasn't true. " 
 " It was supposed to be the first part of the last mission, not the second or third, " Carl was crying, " but by the way, the US government had never known I was about to take over. " 
 I slowly lifted up the phone and pressed the remote. He looked at it, then at the map of the spacecraft above me, then back. He looked away from the map and back at me. The map read " PLOS ONE ". I raised an eyebrow. 
 " This is meant to be our last mission. You ruined the mission. You ruined it because this wasn't my money. " 
 " There was a change. You made your name better and told everyone. You made everybody think you were a hero. " I watched him for a few moments, then looked at the bottom of the box. I picked up the pen and took another look at the pen, and then back to the map, where the pen was. I tapped it into the scope of the teleporter and popped it open. 
 " Lets see, " Carl grabbed the wire and walked to my side, " some us can walk out of this alive and back to our lives. Please, we don't want to do this, we just want to find out. After the mission, we need to work on the choices, the plans. We got it all figured out. To begin with, make one choice the right one to make, and then start working on the next one. " 
 I watched him through his shoulder, his eyes sliding closed at last. He shook his head, and kicked the empty book out of my hands. I sat on the edge of the log, hoping, praying, that we would find what we needed, and be back home safe again. 
 " I love you, jesus," he whispered to me. 
 I felt something on my shoulder, and my legs were clenching. The teleporter faded away, and I headed back up to the main entrance. Carl had been right when he said he didn't want to tell anyone.

You put the box on the table and there is an opened lid. A hint of bone on top of it and it opens. Jenga, you put the lid on. 
 "Hail my son. " 
 And then there was a feeling of power. Hold the box open, cover the box in rumblyy coal, and whisper a lullaby and a drunken swear that might have been made to the guards who helped guard it with a crowbar. And then you both had a series of pangs of regret. In the darkness of the room, you wan na go home, that night, and drink a shitty beer. You fuck with no one, just fuck in front of a little girl you found a few days ago. And the answer is yes, he will get the book.

 You are always into those kinds of games, there wasn't too much we didn't know about. 
 You call your wife at the market at 4AM. She takes the keys from her couch, looks at you cutely and takes the box. You put the book on the nightstand. There is a letter in the box which reads, " Hey Jeff, this is me, and we have something for you to read, when you get home, you'll want to open the lid. " 
 *Who the fuck could be the author of this book? Wait a second! * 
 " Please shut the book. It would be nice to read some more of your baby girl stories, it's a personal project. We wouldn't have a room with no beds. " 
 When you pull the cover over the box opens and a black ink stain follows you back. You grab the book from the shelf and open the pages. 
 You open the first page and read, " I'll never forget the day my cousin died with her little twin brother!" 
 And then there was a feeling of power. Hold the box open, cover the box in rumblyy coal, and whisper a lullaby and a drunken swear that might have been made to the guards who helped guard it with a crowbar.

 You put the book on the nightstand and there is an opening in rumblyy coal and a rustling as you fold over the sheet. The attic crackled as you threw it open, but you tossed it back and broke the lid, it was so hard to open up. 
 Eventually you come back the day you came in, the morning paper, the the solemn reminder you won the lottery, you gave your son his receipt and you walked out to the checkout. 
 Your son came to the corner. He sat in a chair in the middle of the grocery store. His book was next to him. You dropped him in your jacket pocket and left. 
 You didn't bring your lunch for several days. So you ordered it. The next day he came home to your wife, and your husband and his cobbler worked nights to make sure he didn't leave empty-handed.

I wasn't quite a conspiracy theorist. I believed it all of the time, because even people who thought that they held the power to overthrow governments or take out a rival had a weak case of the two-leaf clover. They couldn't. So I showed up, too, in a sort of grand failure. I loved watching as my co-workers slipped by, retreating off the job and in search of longer-lasting goods. When the pharmacist, a ruthless serial killer named Charles, was on the phone with one of the cabinet employees I was always a patient. 
 Touting my heroism, he did nothing except scowl at me from across the table. People always come to me, asking what I did. " I fought him " or " Johnny was my friend!" Many of the heroes I drew have gone to use me to help out in combat situations. I'm an old man now. 
 And it's not really a surprise that my numbers went up. People would wait for an opportunity to run away, wanting a look into their gutters. If I was unlucky, they might find out they had no family to offer me. But I liked to keep things to myself. My new office, The Cursed Mine! Master Mirth Putty, was built around my glorious machination, my cunning and my ruthlessness. Such luck, I thought. My name is cursed... 
 I never felt more different from my ancestors. They were no more abstract than I am now. There were few examples of my errors, but one has all been mine. The Chairman of The Pirate Party murdered his proud wife. Only an unfortunate twist has made him an immortal successor to the throne. I got his fight not in vain. I made a hundred crooks red in the eye. 
 I think I'm coming down hard on those that are stuck in mud. The fancy suits told them they couldn't survive the challenge, even if they could do some amazing feats of their own. However, none of those with the money and are too fit to leave their home for a slow beat are close to succeeding. I'll be damned if I let that happen to those that would fear me. The people that first crossed my path are gone. And I'm sure the whores I tried to silence after I failed won't be able to find anything in return. But if I lose, I'll have a second chance. Someone I love will be there for me. Someone I can't go back to... 
 And if I don't win, I don't have the blood on my hands either.

I lean against the tall cashier. " I don't know if I could go any further with this but I understand that the parley will, in retrospect, be quite unpleasant for you. " 
 I find myself wanting to vomit before he could tell me I deserved this. " Ah, yes. I did please, sir. " He brings back a loaf of steaks, taken from the first customer who ordered from him. " If you're going to order a dozen I would highly recommend this thing. Not to mention it's made to last for years of service, and for a single quarter my service is excellent. " 
 I take a bite before sipping my last meal. " What a delightful thing it was for me, my friend. You're right. " I'm not eating his parodied piece of lettuce. * Never serve a parodied sandwich. Never eat your parodied piece of lettuce. No. * 
 No body for a customer like I am. After all, service is for premium customers. That means cheap ones who have, before they drop by, know how to get fast food workers to eat them themselves. 
 " Thank you. " The voice echoes through the bakery. " We do here at the Dairy Queen know how to choose our customers - that is my responsibility, after all. " 
 " So we'll, " the voice starts. " Our judgment is guided by profit. Not on trust, not on quantity. How can this customer feel disinterested in my table, or me? " 
 " He's disappointed in you, dear. I regret that. If you're going to eat it, say hello to someone who'll be happy to talk. " 
 He looks out over the sugarcoated crowd. The temperature still flies high, and I cannot taste the soup. " I don't know what you're thinking, sir. Don't have to be unhappy." 
 It was my turn to scream. 
 The voice cuts in. * Fuck. *

The reaper's smile was never one I was expecting. It felt like he'd always carried this grin with him. Something about the way it flapped and almost fluttered. 
 I sighed, and took a seat at the desk next to him. His smile simply melted into a smug smile. I grinned back as the shelves appeared to form a giant 10K ( the year on which he lived ), crammed in front of me in dramatic diagrams. First there was: 
 2017 - The EU vote 
 2019 - World War 2 
 2020 - The sea level rise 
 2150 - I felt dizzy. 
 I looked at the clock. 5:30. At this point I was late. 
 I let out an exasperated sigh. It was a stupid mistake. * The exact year of the election is the exact thing you're writing in the) 'election calendar'. Everyone forgot to reinstall Windows 2000. * 
 I didn't give up. I reached out. 
 *No such luck*. 
 The first page reached. Really, this is just a blank page with no numbers at all. 
 **2017** 
 I beamed as I entered "2017 " in red. I thought this was strange. There was no headshots at all. 
 I smiled broadly at the page. 
 *Why, I thought. 
 I gave up. 
 *But, I'm really glad we managed to turn the page in the morning. * 
 *I understand. * 
 I turned my gaze around to see the 976K list of corporate contracts. And the contract that was down in front of me. ** 2025** 
 That was never my writing name. * That's why we can't install Facebook*. 
 I sighed again. * It would probably be best if I actually tried. * 
 I wasn't a pro. I really was an anti. I was a retreader, and could stop. 
 I exhaled a sigh. It was my life. * Maybe. * 
 All I had to do now was make an appointment with my first superior and meet his daughter. And if everything goes wrong... * 
 And the grandchild would fly home. * We'll see, and we'll just have to figure it out, ok? *

"That's it, " I thought. Those eyes, even in their sockets, were glaring through the porthole of the late night bus that was to take us into this world. I almost expected it to be a mundane background noise. 
 The bus seemed to stop for only a split second, before the driver took off, and the doors slammed shut. A man in a dark blue and gold sign kept flicking open, no keyboard on the dashboard, no key chain. 
 The bus was quickly overcome by the sobbing people of my home town. The crowd in front of me was silent, but I could hear the creaking of the doors across the street. 
 I pulled back on the brake, and lay back in my bed. * No fucking way. * I couldn't remember the last time I had been right here. Why was I even here? Why couldn't I remember the last time I was in a whole group of people? 
 I lay back down and thought about what I could do to make it through today and the future. How could I make it out of this situation with these people? I didn't have any ideas, and I was never this skilled at anything. I stayed alive, everlasting, to face what I knew would happen today. 
 I desperately clutched my pillow, holding it close for a few more minutes. I had to get out of this... 
 Finally, I open my eyes. There, a door! Was it when I was 20? A truck? But that was 50 years ago. I growled and turned to face the door. It must have looked like...

 “ You ’ re doing business when I don ’ t have a lock on you, Casey. ” 
 It ’ s the opposite of when Casey used to like trading cards. But before the day ’ s end, we were better off being back in the dark, normal people's lives: juvenile delinquents wandering a darkened hallway, families pulling out their kids that couldn ’ t play — and always the same kids: guns on purpose. Some older people didn ’ t like trading with others. Those bought them, bought them for a better deal, paid them more for the privilege. 
 Last year, our bar was down by five or six percent, which is difficult in a hole like this. I moved to the three stories down — to add to my family. We moved into the trust and made a few friends: I had Joe, Max, and Layla who were both outcasts now. Usually, things work out fairly well until you realize that you never know you ’ re in for a new partner. I had Harley, Jose and Joshua, but as my daily income grew, so did the shame on my back. 
 They ’ d never expected us to go so quickly — like, down this one bathroom hard. Everything was different after the holidays. We were showing up with packed house and expensive clothes. The shadows grew too dark for the essentials. We were almost home. We ’ d ran for five minutes that night, minding our own business, focusing on processing our new purchases. 
 “ Casey, ” I said, fixing my phone and scrambling out of the shop, “ We got ta get you back. ” 
 I adjusted the tie a bit, “ What, why? ” Casey looked into my eyes and shook his head with some regret. “ Maybe I didn ’ t sell enough for you guys. ” 
 I slunk back down to the corner near where I had entered. 
 I pulled up my phone and texted a friend. Apparently the service wasn ’ t working that day, so he didn ’ t get me a fix. Instead, I simply sold my skills down and transferred them in on Ashley, my new partner. “ They ’ re all set, ” she said. “ Thanks, man. ” 
 As I stared into her eyes, we talked, and I began to wonder if I could actually help. Although, after a while, I knew I wanted to be around her. I hooked her up with what I knew would probably be the best idea for my own operation, so I wrote it down and headed over to my phone to check it. 
 From my point of view, I read it again and again. “ Casey, ” I texted, “ We ’ re off to win more control of our show this year, and I ’ m with you. ” 
 There were only two things on Ashley ’ s mind, but I ’ m sure it would be pretty intense watching Casey move around without even knowing. “ Oh, right, ” she said. “ God, you could be good or bad. Girls ’ minds sometimes have to settle for one thing. It ’ s what can ’ t be dandy if you know it. ” She should probably have been nervous reading that as she headed home, but obviously, she was looking at it. 
 After seven months of this shit and it ’ s no fun getting up in the morning to watch Casey buy and sell her skills, I figured it might as well start with a reminder to check her skills. “ Got ta figure out a new supply of rigs next month, Casey, ” I texted. 
 The lights were out. 
 I finally got my rent. Ready to work, but not sure if my apartment would be full any day.

*If eight equals Zero, then three equals two. * 
 A little over a year ago, a new law required children to be born at the right time, only to be placed in the "local " classroom in the evening. That period of time slowly closing and not releasing. 
 I guess school was originally designed to let the parents know that the children aged into their teens, and the parents were compensated for the excess time in school. I guess that was why he trained you to be trustworthy. They would never kill your child, in that window over your head, and I'm not talking about deciding when they'd get their old doctor or whoever else would find them. * 
 My daughter has to understand that the teacher who did this was chosen, and that she will learn to help her grow up. I hope she will be good and grow up. They were their parents's choice. 
 To me, it was kind of a bit of a blow-up. The people who cut off the deliveries, or read the kids notes, would be at the mercy of the adults. The two easiest ones would go into the bed each morning, so they could know to go into the bed first, as the parents would then be free to push it to the side. It was not in the interests of the children, but for them. 
 But now, many children, who want for their parents to understand and love their own lives, are acting like my daughter has been brainwashed for decades. They use threatening words and walking around with children that would never understand their past, instead calling them dirty turds because they were afraid of being harmed. 
 I hear voices breaking through your walls. I hear the violence you bring about. I hear you slinging paper in your general direction at a community center, directing people to the right. I hear your voice grow menacing. 
 You should not have taken it so hard. You are giving them hope. 
 Thank you for getting to hear your children talk at the same rate. I hope it goes well.

"Hey, this is the website that you just found! " Emily looked confused. She pulled a little note out of the pocket of her maroon tank top, scribbled and scratched her ID onto it. This could be one of the most interesting jobs she'd had yet! 
 " Oh my god, this is definitely my signoff. It says in small font " Things I must do next time in these missions, and this moment is my last one. " 
 She sighed as she flipped to her left and pulled up her video game, right as the local viking bastards surrounded her. Every challenge said be going in, trying to kill yourself as fast as possible as best you can. 
 " I'm quitting right now! I NEED to eat, like all of them! " 
 Emily scrolled down in to find the ID. " Here's a new kill, you have to kill someone. I am going to go kill Shiggy. Please - Kill me. " 
 She hesitated before dragging the only remaining object left of it and trying the kill command. Scurrying out of the store, she got off the building and the destination a few blocks away. 
 She got on the bus as she felt her cool stomach as her stomach drops the edge of her seat and she grits her teeth. After she finished, she sat down and waited, with a split second in her heart, to speak. 
 " Shiggy! I killed you! I have a job to do. " 
 A woman nervously sat down next to her. She sounded confused. She was looking at Emily, who just posted his mission as she already was. 
 " I killed him, wrong my number. Try again." 
 Emily had the strange feeling that she lost the character. She went back to looking for the dead snake from the corner of her eye and when she returned it was still there. Holding it in front of her as if trying to act as if she just vanished. 
 Then, Emily knew what was taking her so long. If she really wanted to win, she had to get dead. 
 The rocket ship made its mission to the right of her station, heading south. No time to prepare now. 
 Emily got up from the ground and brought up the mission to the rocket ship.

That's it, now comes the end of our chicanery. Clark Kent and the rest of the vigilante organization were building a head on the juggernaut that was Batman, the Man of Steel. It was at this point that Batman had begun to develop a relationship with Bruce Wayne. 
 All told, thirty nine million dollars is all that was needed for this one. Clark ordered the famed weapons designer Mr. Wayne to submit a back-up plan for a new weapon. The audience was ecstatic. In the event, Superman would get the entire arsenal they needed to make a his C8 assault rifle of the most complex machine out there. But it would fail. Clark wanted to believe that after defeating General Philip the Great and rescuing Batman, Bruce Wayne would be free of the three meaningless obstacles he had continually struggled to overcome over the course of his corporate career. But he realized that no matter what he did, he didn't have enough of a heart. So they incorporated Superman into their vast arsenal of the 'Bat' and used him to defeat Superman as the new supervillain. 
 His enemies were simple to take out. Lure him into any one of their traps. So they infiltrated the Family Circus. They, unlike the other groups, wanted to send some of the most accomplished villains back to confront Superman. So Batman showed the family where he could snuff out the Family Circus that was being manufactured by a small, brutish company called Al Capone Industries. All the money that their version of justice was performing would be used for the remainder of the group's all purpose debt collection. And so the Calvary returned to Gotham. 
 Clark hadn't expected death so soon.

( I have no idea how I ended up doing this but I like to know what the story is. Apologies in advance, but basically I had the idea for this post on a whim and decided to just post it here. Hopefully if you like it there isn't too much editing. ) 
 You all might know how much I hate getting cast out. I have no idea what the hell went wrong on this one. But one day a girl died. This week the hospital staff tried to take her away. They told her to stay, the hospital loved her, but she wanted her to be alone forever. My father's drugs had been helping her long before they took her, he lied to her when he said he didn't want her to stay and went to jail, he told her to stay because they all feared their lives and could do so for what? Was it too late to stop her? Did I need to scare her to stay? If it had been longer, he wouldn't have given her up. After the first ten hours, she decided to shut up. Had to hide something out in order to keep her at bay. After a few more hours, she walked in the room alone. The room she was in was thoroughly dusty, every small thing was pristine. I thought she might have thought about calling the police, whatever. Now it was all too much for me. She brushed past the bed and pulled out a box, opened it, and pressed a door. The door blew open with a loud clank as it exploded. I immediately fell onto my knees and looked up into the empty room. 
 A long plump woman sat at the dining room table. She was only two weeks old, and for a brief moment she looked exhausted. 
 "What happened. " she asked. " Why didn't I protect you? " 
 I stared at her, eyes feeling tired and heavy. 
 " I... I just have a massive revelation. That some god has stopped me. It's all I've ever known. And it's all I want. " 
 "... " she mumbled. "... " 
 " Look, it's hard for anyone to understand what is happening, and when they do, they feel their own pain, but what's more, you can't escape it. Everyone's a loser. " 
 I grinned. She had no idea how I took her, but she was pretty good at it. The things I had planned every day for years gave me more than enough motivation to kill these rats. 
 She sat up, turning her head. " There's someone here with a huge discovery in their life. I'll come inside and tell you about it. Just... please. Please let me stop you before you do anything stupid. " 
 " What? " I asked. 
 " I know where the hide is. I've watched you burn with no remorse, knowing that you'll always be mine, but now I need you to tell me if you really want to live. " 
 She stared in amazement at me. " Oh, no. The thing about I'm not God, I'm just rich, ugly, and obese. " 
 " Well, your family of two years ago bought a pet and some junk food, and you've done a lot with it. You keep asking me why you just do this. You're hoping that it makes you happy, and then once you finish the pet and eat, I'll come and take your pet back. I'm not sure it'll work. " 
 She nodded slowly and nodded. " Ok, okay, so you want to live. It won't be so hard, my pet isn't perfect. But I know that, it takes commitment. It takes courage, the willpower to stay with your family for a while, and then it takes you, okay? " 
 She looked me dead in the eyes. " God, love, I love you so much."

A clatter echoed down the street, 
 "Oh, Barack and Michelle, you can join us next! " 
 Sarah was the first, and every week at lunch hour she would join me, hopefully maybe we can catch up 
 " Okay, Michelle, the news is starting to trickle in, " 
 " No, no, we need to stop, I don't want people to start murdering me, " 
 Wesleyyn and Brian pat me on the head, 
 " Don't take, don't take, don't take, " 
 " Donald's latest announcement seems to have caught the net as well, " 
 " Did we sneak around the signs, or are you getting the movie?" 
 No one actually commented on the recent events before it happened, 
 there was a funny visual in bed, 
 I just wanted to stare at it, 
 I was saying it, at least he liked it.

You don't have time to bother following the dust, watching the barrels burn, the blades crack. When the rain descends, the washing cloth melts until it is next to bare metal. The sound of whips, gears, springs, and handshakes fill the small, foggy laboratory as it reduces into the Big Three piles on the few remaining sturdy stands. The source of the noise gathers gradually. Or perhaps it a smattering, tossed about like a demon. It can't be it, doesn't matter. 
 You gaze out at the blood-red grass, savoring the summer heat as it moves across the large canopy in front of you. It looks as though it knows what you're going to stare at for a while. 
 "I may have brought these for his own son, " you ask, already looking down at your own frozen eyes. " That son has been hissed at by some cult of death, the one he became himself." 
 The surreal image catches your attention. The log post you were milling over, the one you had left home many years ago, which was supposed to slow the time down. The more you look, the more you catch something. A blue-robed figure striding along the dusty concrete, tall and slender, bathed in sunlight with his horse drawn hat raised to tail. It's legs look old, cracked and dead, and it leans against a masonry slab. Your gaze places itself firmly on the edge of the slab. 
 You want to look away. What are you looking at? You want to listen, but you just can't. You want the boy to be alive. You want him to live. 
 With a casual murmur, you lean forward and close your eyes. When you close your eyes again, everything is still. The boy is still alive, standing atop a pile of ash and dust. * He* stands alone on the ground, amidst the wooden walls, his horn singing and clattering ominously on the loose floorboards. The boy is watching the dust slowly fall to the floor, its hooves clicking. He's been listening for hours. 
 The boy quickly raises his head from the bed and lifts his leg, and stands on the mud-chewed stump, trembling in fear and fear of falling to the floor below. * He* stands next to the bed, his hands clutching at his chest, the tips scorching and clogging with the burning blood. 
 You stand there for a moment, waiting for the boy to reach the point where the dust and ash start to flow. You immediately reach into your jacket, pulling out your rifle, eager to break through the silhouettes of wood and hear the loud noise and smirk as the flames are directed towards him. 
 For a brief second, all you hear is the chopper jolting and rumbling as it lands on the ground. The pipes draw close with ease, as though the waves are knocking and squealing behind their heads. 
 You hear a commotion, and the boy begins to withdraw his rifle. As he begins to speak, you can hear hissing and screaming. The wind howls through the open air. More squeaking coming from the warehouse, and he begins to move his feet forward toward the very door. 
 As he approaches, you can feel a warmth within his grasp. And a sense of peace. And a burning awareness. 
 *Oh, God. *

Heart: Strongly in Love 
 It had been 3 weeks since I had last kissed, and three weeks since I had last heard from her. 
 I remember thinking to myself that my time was short; 30 seconds of talking to women, ending what I had planned with each kiss. Getting a glimpse of them outside that window, "you're not that terrible man, who would date her anyway, " would do just fine, but in the back of my mind I thought the worst. 
 " No, you're not my wife, you're a professor, " a strange tone rang through my head. I didn't want to react, because she was getting old, but it was sad. There was nothing on my mind that could somehow compel me to act like she was home for the day. 
 " Do you really think I'm going to see anyone tonight? " It hit me like a ton of bricks, but I hadn't dared to make eye contact. " You'll never even know I love you. " I couldn't just walk into a man's apartment when I'm blind, because the fear of him seeing me was too high for my brain. 
 " You've seen me naked in the street, you're naked at a fancy bar on the edge of a bridge, but I might not ever even talk to you. " 
 " Don't you think you're a great man, like Christine? " She was pale, but relieved. She wasn't smiling. With tears in her eyes, I figured that wasn't possible, and I couldn't trust someone like that. 
 " No, I'm not good, don't you think? " 
 " But your profession? Do you know how to use your hands? I had to use it. " 
 " Don't you wish for someone like me to be able to see you, " She tried to cry, tears still streaming down her cheeks. 
 " No, but I can't, " I tried to pretend she wasn't crying, but it was futile. 
 I crossed myself with the bars, " No. No no. No please, don't go home with me. " 
 " No, you can't, don't leave me in that kind of pain. " She knew my weakness, so that drove me forward. In an instant, I just had to find her. She was so beautiful, so alluring. I hurried outside, and headed for the shore. Everything had stopped. 
 " Looks like we're going to have to do it one more time, " I heard my friend talking to the truck, " I'm gon na go to the bar, find her in her bed, and then go to bed with you, sweetheart. " 
 I stared at her over in the mirror, " Give the students this speech. And please. Do not let them think that you could've actually done it."

Couch cough. How long had it been since I moved here? 
 It's been almost three months. The stillness takes hold, and I hide my eyes in the empty kitchen. I take a deep breath, and sit up in bed. Flicking on my faucet, I reach for the light switch. It starts to spark. A loud burst from my shower and flakey water slide out of the shower drain. Three short minutes of heavy usage, then I hear a rapid crack and a siren. More cracks, louder. I'm right behind the door. 
 I heard the sirens coming from upstairs. I run to the door and fall backwards, pain in my eyes. I try to jump out of bed, but my legs slam against the bed and I'll fall to the ground. I can't scream. I can't get out. When I fall, I wake up in a strange bed. What time is it? 
 Eight days. The cloud of rain continues. I know it'll be another five days. Maybe this time, I'm gon na stay on the shore. But here I am, lying on the shore with no way out. 
 I touch the wind. There's a wave. A storm. Oh God, I think. I need to talk to someone. 
 I walk over to the kitchen window. It's February. They've been fine.

The inside of the bunker was serene. A large cast iron structure with panels and wooden seats that could be seen from various distances within the inside. One chair was positioned in front of the monitor for video and audio from the weapons systems. Two enemies lay facing the monitors as closely as the monitors could fit. Two hands rested on the wood and fire hoses, ready to defend a colony. Two women were standing in the corner as to keep them from falling to the ground. 
 "With the sounds of fighting, we could be isolated from the rest of the colony. " The woman said. 
 " Absolutely. " 
 " We can make sure they don't stray off the run. " 
 " We don't expect them to come off with this. " 
 The woman smiled and nodded. 
 " Enjoy your vacation! " She said in a swirly feminine voice as a green creature that now no longer resembled any previous humans would have called a creature could be seen in front of her. 
 As the green creature ramped forward, the forest below them grew a maximum of six feet tall with four species. Trees crumbled at their feet and lifted to the sky in a series of arrows, cracking them in half and breaking the white powder that covered them. The green creature returned to its original position before the green humanoid race walked up and scanned the trees. A large barrier barrier disappeared in front of the green creature. A multi-story run-down building stood in front of the green humanoid that did not return to a run-down before the barrier disappeared. 
 " We see here, your home colony will have its own gates and this will lead to our homes. Your home is on the center of an undisturbed sun with three permanent stars in the sky."

"The number six is our aphrodisiacs choice for today's " He flashed me his new creature. " The satisfaction of gain. " 
 " What about that number you took before when you knocked my door? " 
 " No just what you took today. It's a you. " He seemed suddenly clearer with his new find. 
 " No. Nobody told me that as I talked to you about it last week. I didn't know the base data that I had before I summoned you. I thought you'd never summon me. " I beamed a smug smirk. 
 " Tell me, how about this megaphone? " 
 " The Morse Code system makes sense. " 
 I nodded to his intonation. Just as they were moving in to the machine, I moved one of the arms at the top and looked over at my new companion. " We'd always felt safe sharing this simple proposition. If we did all the good we could do with this, and I could take the satisfaction, the mental reward, away from the host and onto the others. " 
 " If we did all the things you said we shouldn't, then why didn't you respect it? You're arrogant and people give you crap to fix it, yet you're never encouraging others. " 
 " Poor man. I don't know why he put an eye on me, just because he's a beast, but your actions and your creation... whether it be a dwarven apothecary or wolf maggot, I can not answer without a question. " 
 I smiled and walked out of his office. When I returned I was met by a manager waiting for me at the counter. 
 " You must have been a bit of an idiot, wasn't it? But apparently you did this voluntarily. I'm getting off topic now. " He placed a black badge against his chest. " Most of you know your place here and don't really know your place in this business. However, for some reason, you've been the one who summoned me. You watched me make up all of this around you and killed a few dozen people by misjudging my abilities, that's okay. You're fine... " 
 " Don't pay attention, I'm your supervisor. We're a bunch of normal people who play hooky and leave a few people to die by mistake. " 
 I smiled at him, showing a gentle disdain towards his beady eye. " Welcome back Mr. Harmon. Now is my turn to talk. Before I continue, the idea came to me. I was an obelisk found somewhere in the middle of Siberia. All of those potential future pumice dwellers had walked through my door, never to be seen again, never to have their presence ever again. I figured maybe they would wonder why they'd gathered in such a small town. If they did, I'd leave some of them there. " I smirked. " They have a curious curiosity and a desire for what no one's done in the hundred years since your return. " 
 " What are you thinking? " The man beside me shouted in a bored tone. 
 " Well... there's one call I can put to you now. " He grinned as he eyed me square in the eye. " I've summoned a lake of fire for you today. It's named Wolf."

"It seems we have paid a huge price... The buy-in, the collateral for all our ventures, the last two you've been doing, you know... All the just done to get to the Deediet vault. We are completely reliant on you now after all. " 
 The man dragged me to the front door, with a beak firmly pushed in his side. 
 " Andy, -" 
 I could see the fur merchant tankering across the floor... The beaver had one word to speak. A hint of remorse, not what he intended. But it wasn't over yet, we weren't likely to hit the bank any time soon. For a first time I was moved to the edge of the breeding pond with no clue of the dangers beyond, and the Steel trader pulled up a short distance away from the see. Perhaps we could convince him that the price we paid was the most in excess of what he agreed to pay. 
 I lifted up my beak, and laid back in a forced sigh, taking only a moment to give the fur merchant a big one last stare, before exhaling slowly. He finished filling the cup and making his way towards the vault, but before he could concentrate, I heard the spitstorming sound of a knife being pushed up the end of my bow. 
 I had only a second to think.

What does it matter, when I wake up, or what I do in the morning? At least now I can eat breakfast. I grab my laptop, open up /system and type in the strange date: October 16, 2006-UTC-9:40 AM. Gone is my nightmare of a profession: I experience self-sabotage 24/7 and has no income and I am not in possession of a wife. I feel sick as fuck. Should I leave without my dinner? When will I be able to pay, when will my two children be able to afford it? No one seems to care enough to stop complaining. I am not worried, I live a peaceful life. I can do what I want and I love my job, mother does not know that because everything is going to hell for me and my family. I don't think that she will see me end this? To know of her existence is to know an life has gone on for 8 years now. And I am not the man I used to be. I am now in this hell. I got up and ran out of the room. " Hey you there, you get off early enough to go to the coffee shop? You can walk to the plane with me " my mother told me. I felt like giving in, I sat down and came back down to this world. My feet hit the floor. I wasn't supposed to be here. " Whats going on? " she says to me. She looked and said in a monotone voice " you seem to be having issues " " No nothing " " Alright... what's the situation? " I asked. She looked at me and replied. She looked at me even more and started to talk, but it was hard to focus. " You want to go to the cafe? I can tell by the clock " said my mother, she smiled at me. " I am going to order dinner and order the plane tickets " " Yes, I can take one " I said and understood. She didn't say anything " The plane will arrive in an hour. " At least I have some home cooking recipes. For the money I had, I am not worried anymore. " What can I do? " I asked again. " I am a retired human, I just don't have any money " " Is that how it is supposed to be? " She said and explained this further. " No, where is it? " " I am supposed to be born on November 9th, 2009-UTC-9:45 AM " I smiled. I could of come home to the kitchen for the meals but a small woman had walked in. She had a big bag on her head and she is wearing a tutu with a square symbol in it " Oh, mother!" she exclaimed. I got up and walked to the cupboard. What I asked for just never happened. I started to push the buttons in my head and when the doors opened they all landed on me. I must be covered in tears. How could I be told by her? I'm so sorry mom, if she is suffering. I was so happy she was sleeping with someone else. I just wish she could never see me like this. She locked her door. I tried to look around. Nothing can stop me. I walked all the way to the car and into my room. My bed. I just remember my mornings. It is not the same. At the end of every day, a new date appears, the only thing I remember is a door being opened and a woman walking into the room saying I need my money. I am not the man I used to be. I am now in this hell. I go into the bathroom and shower. I take a shower and sink. I look at my car and I realize that this is it. I have finally dealt with this much. I clean my bedroom. I clean my purse. I get dressed, not so much because I can fix my car, but because I will tell my wife.

Dear Rachel, 
 This may be a long letter. I don ’ t know why, but there is something special that you've got to know about me, that I cannot let anyone know about. 
 Today, I woke up in a dingy hotel room. My maid was licking a finger in the other and singing a song that seemed to echo off of my mind. I had felt strange. How often do you find yourself getting pissed off as soon as you wake up next to someone you have never met? But this, I had seen more than enough. I held onto the bed, wringing my hands around my body. My eyes watered up. This felt wrong. I had never worried myself that much. Then that day, I became another person, with a different form. I was more distant from her, better at walking and speaking. I told her, I wanted her to stay with me. She said nothing. 
 I would leave once it was over. Every morning, I would look outside, and find my scent wafting through my hair, and walk away. I was happier for it. You found an identity you had never known before, one that allowed you to say another thing. I smiled at that, too. 
 But some of my other past wasn't as bright. I had to become perfect. By washing dishes, I was able to avoid having so many people on my mind that have to live with this frustration. It was a beautiful existence. 
 But you are not being able to turn around. The whole thing is outdated. You really don't want to live it. You shouldn't be able to be happy with nobody understanding you. 
 I guess I am wrong. I just don't feel like it, though. I love you more than I love you. You hold me, you make me feel like I matter. You love me as if I are your most intimate partner, your reason for coming to college. But I don't want to be with you. I don't want to be living my happiness like I always wanted to. 
 Well, it hurts. 
 I can ’ t be with you anymore. 
 Dear Rachel, 
 I just need to say that I have lost my love for you. I have fallen in love with you. It broke me, as soon as I saw that you left. And now, for the first time, I know why. I feel different. 
 I am too young. I am too young and too thin. 
 I want to move back. 
 This is a mistake. 
 I will remember you as one of my best friends. 
 Goodbye, Rachel. 
 Love, 
 A.W. Burns 
 ( This is actually a very great story I wrote on my phone. )

Here we go again, I'm trying to pick up my pace. My hands are dragging along the overgrowth and I hardly feel a thing. The sunlight beating down on me still yet dulling my vision. My hand suddenly feels like it's in a basketball as I pick myself up off the ground. 
 "Hey Wendy... You okay? " 
 " Just trying to get some fresh air on my lungs " 
 " Can you get me one of my of my stones to drink. I mean, there is no use in driving " 
 " Sure... " I say looking around, taking up a new position on a nearby skylight. While searching, one on a hill that seems pretty rounded in any way, two other ones are out of order, and I take notice of them trying to move out of the way. 
 Not even half an hour passes... I can feel them roll in and out of the path as I decide it's time to head out for the day. No, I don't give one. 
 " Would you like some fresh air for my shoulder? " 
 " How about that new Sonic X that's been around for the past couple years? Now as soon as I get off it, it can take me out of the sun. So just give me a moment of peace and rest " 
 I reach for my rock, still still clutching at my leg with my shoe. Yet as fast as I left it, it's trapped by my arm. I'm powerless to do anything... until I hear something coming down from the trees. " STOP! " I yell as I try to dodge it in a fast spiral. Before I can react, it's shoved right at me and I fall to the ground. The sky is dark, smog filling the sky. Already I'm blacking out, the backlight on my car keeping me firmly in darkness. 
 A crisp wind whipping about me, I grab my blanket from my chair and prepare to throw it at anything that could have managed to keep me with me. Bouncing out of my chair, I continue down the path where the road once was. 
 The wind is beginning to get stronger. More thunderstorms begin breaking out, as well as additional thunder. My turn comes up and the wind picks up. As soon as I can see it, it's nowhere to be seen. I'm only about 10 minutes away from the road, standing in the middle of the road. I hear a voice screaming from my car. A tall man in fatigues looks at me and looks at my car. " Damn... I was driving... " he says, before sprinting from my car and grabbing his wallet. He gives me a look of disgust, as if the only thing worse than avoiding the highway was choosing between two other men. 
 I ask him what was going on, and he smiles gently. " You think I'm lucky to get in, huh? I really shouldn't be riding a car just yet, you know. But I'm glad you're here! So if you don't mind if I drive me, I have a few things on my mind. " 
 " Alright, fine, whatever. Go, fasten the seat belt, you can't come back here any other way. Are you sure you're just going to excuse me, though?" 
 That was his last expression, before he limped away like a glutton. 
 This is the end of my first attempt at writing nothing! Any thoughts of how to improve upon it?

There were many gates of Death on them. The golden white armored gate hovered with no skirts. The doors beat with trepidation as their newly discovered patrons passed over it's exit to their homeworld. The man stood in a field somewhere in the old India Pale Bud, eating hard brown arugula. He could see his faira two and sized. It's high cranial bone bent in a direct arc across his shoulder. It stood out against the dark forest surrounding his house, with clear blue skies. A marsh wing. The flying sun chasing those behind him. 
 He cursed his luck. Although he hadn't seen such a thing anywhere before, He still couldn't stop the fire of time. Millions of years ago the kings of the old word kingdoms danced in the red atmosphere, they couldn't stop the endless madness. Wars raged there till their knees never made any noise, neither did the universe. 
 But this field wasn't a battlefield. The witch arugula was prominent amongst the crowd. She stalked round her steps, small edged device-like darts through the air of Death. She didn't have the nerve to think she could hit the golden boy, even if it meant death in her eyes. She also had no magic, not even immortality. This was a gate of stones and men, that only suited the competition. 
 The man, without regard for any of this, began his push towards the gate. A blinding light pierced through the surrounding snow and fog, rushing this once peaceful hill. As the waves passed overhead, the man was hit. 
 The green horse of the world was flung forward by the field fire. His blood flowed down his elbow as a wave of dark shadows fell upon his face. The man felt the hot blood run down his hand, then forced himself back down as he readied himself. He inhaled deeply as he felt his muscles suffer under the great burden of injuries sustained by the men of the Lord of Magic.

Over the past few years, Otto Nordstrom had realized he couldn't fight a gorilla, no matter how strong the sea turtle. Once, at the age of 22, he came across a teletubby hole in a wall, a hole meant to help cover any underwater body shape or increase his tank's tank weight. Otto also came across a fish that noticed his eyes, their blue look. 
 He never got a chance to talk to the Dolphin, so he stuck to him, tugging at his fins, and being a fool like everybody else, sneezed himself. After a long and torturous day of thought, the Dolphin jumped on the hole and ingested his hole, sending him on his way. Otto then later tasted other, more disgusting tastebuds and found himself in a coffin, a mere 40 feet below the water's surface. 
 "They said I was killed by some elk by the seawater. But, I still didn't understand, " the Sea Turtle said angrily. 
 " It's impossible. " Otto started, running his fingers through his dark beard. 
 " Like your grandfather did. " The Dolphin suddenly opened its mouth and took him in it's embrace, pulling his midsection and further forward, almost as if it had sensed his thoughts. 
 " Just write me a word, probably some document, " Otto grunted. " Just say it, and I'll be through, or you won't be able to hear anything at all. " 
 The Dolphin slowly moved its body towards Otto, cocked its head. " You tell me how? How do you think? " 
 " Because I've experienced things I didn't ever see before. " Otto said with a voice so new and raw he had barely even used it. 
 " Not as much as this wonderful day, love? " The Dolphin commanded. 
 " Oh, yeah, we can dive for now. " Otto said, leaning his body against the rips of the diver's frame. " There are other things I'm trying to hear. " 
 " But why us? What do we do when that person is dead? " 
 " They say, even if we don't find them, we live to tell the stories that our ancestors told. " Otto offered. 
 " But why us? " The Dolphin asked. 
 " Why us when we touch the sand beneath us. Then again, why don't we touch the sandy ground? " Otto asked. " Did they ask me to?"

Traces of sunlight blotted out through my hazmat suit in the plastic part of the room. I looked down to the small glass and saw a small red flag on a roll. A little onion had clobbered on it. The organ attached to it gleamed orange. 
 The girl across from me turned to me and grinned. " Let's see if this new part can hold her! " She pulled up her hoodie but my face was frozen. 
 " Finally, you can get ahold of something right now. " She introduced herself and began tugging gently on a new rock with the edges of her fingers. 
 " Tell him what you've found " I said, " Tell him what can save me in the long run ". As she turned back to grab the rock, a ship passed through a porthole and I flew a few feet out to the door. I found the queen and asked her to join me. With a smile I dragged myself over to the window to see the three lights glowing red and orange against the other side of the wall and said " Yeah that place is nice " She explained as I waved her away. 
 I took a seat with a gesture to her and reassured her. She nodded in agreement and made an announcement to show me the platform and made the final order to lift the dam. The doors opened. A dapper man with a necklace, hat and sunglasses from across the chamber and a pair of muddy boots stepped out with a slightly more wrinkled face than usual. I stood at the ship and pushed and steered with my body. 
 " I feel like I can go home " I said, stepping away. It felt like my every move had been steeled for his purpose. His smile was gone and his smile was broken into a smile of excitement and wonder. It was until he began to fade from my sight that I realized that it was because I was watching another man speak. It was the one with the Nile symbol on his chest that would help me reach you. 
 I pushed the button at the wall to bring up the room and watched as another man spoke to the Queen. They spoke of how they were going to kill the wicked King and give the crooks control of Egypt. I felt sympathy for him and wanted to make sure he had the throat on the stage to get his hands on this very fabric that was going to get to the Queen. 
 " You had better bring it up " The Queen pleaded with me. It hurt, but she understood. " I knew you had quite the appetite here. " 
 I didn't give her my thanks. I was hungry. 
 The man with the Nile symbol spoke to the Queen. He had called on another, four hour long and very intense interrogation session that was to begin on the most important day of his life. " From Queen Victoria to Khiava " he proclaimed, " Watch your tongue, this is the darkness of the night. " 
 I'm a clumsy mess and have to improvise. Most of the time I like to amuse myself. The Queen turns a page of her book that my eyes are unable to focus on. She quickly turns to me and draws a picture of the dead pig that'd been infested with piglets and I'm pissed. 
 " You want to kill Prince Mohammed II? " The Queen asks with a fake smile. My efforts seem to be hopeless. I'm not into begging, but instead I'm too scared to show myself. 
 " I want to kill Prince Hood " I say as I duck between a rock and two portholes and sneak across the room. I try to talk to him. His accent and talking head are unusually casual. " Middle of the night is what they called it. " 
 " Or what? " The Queen asks. 
 " Subterranean Tunnel. Your uncle, Stoke, and half of the United Kingdom used to come down here and feed the pigs. They'd hide themselves in the tunnels and use the tunnels as a torture chamber for their more discerning neighbours. " 
 She laughed at my joke. " But not really. You want someone to deliver you down here? " 
 I don't know what to think anymore. " Do you want me to kill you or save you?"

The baggage looked worn out, like someone was about to explode, or burst, or go all methy and big and loose. 
 I shoved a shoulder down on a heading for the 7th floor, just out of reach of the explosion and sliding my bag across the empty mat. It seemed like a good idea, because now, nearly past midnight, I was flying with the US elite. 
 I turned my head around just in time to see a familiar hat on the hat rack. " Uh… I'm sorry? " I said to the hapless stranger. 
 He laughed, " We don't take other passengers aboard airplanes. I know. " 
 I felt bad for being late, and there were times I would have been late in the day, like during a call a three in the afternoon. 
 " Um, obviously. " 
 " Is that correct? " 
 " Hmm? " 
 " Then let's go out to the airport right now, " he said. 
 I waved the bag into his hand and walked out the door, not caring how sweaty the bag was. I waved it back again and continued my way. 
 " Are you… Are you…Are you okay? " 
 His face was solemn and seemed to look a lot younger than his younger self. 
 " I'm fine, " I said to him, my arms folded as if to comfort him. " I'm sorry. " 
 He bit his lip and looked down at his shaking hands. 
 " You... You always are alright with that? " 
 I couldn't make any sudden movements to put my thumb back on my thumb. 
 " Oh, of course I was, " he said. " I feel... okay. " 
 I smiled as he rubbed his arms. 
 " I… I don't… I don't think so. " 
 " Well, then let's go out to the airport. How do you like it? " 
 He smiled, " Not really. " 
 " I suppose that'll be the problem. " 
 The idyllic airport sky was a beautiful green, with the echoes of planes making each other's day. And yet, I was suddenly shot out of the air by the light. 
 I looked back down at my bag. " What… what is it? " 
 He pointed to a small patch of grass. " Well, it looks like your family's secret rocket is behind the gates. " 
 " What? " 
 " I just hope that I don't use this. " 
 " What is it? " 
 I looked back at him, frowning slightly. I stared at the small blue packet that the man had given me. 
 " It says that your mother's favorite toy is a rocket. " 
 I blinked. 
 " What? " 
 " A rocket? I thought it was a toy you picked up from the show. " 
 " As far as toys go, " I said out loud, pulling the item closer to me. 
 " Are you even sure that? " 
 He pulled his hand back, revealing a scar on his forehead. " No. I wouldn't want you to think this is a toy. " 
 " What?! " 
 He did something I hadn't noticed before. 
 " You mean that this toy was standing on the plane? " 
 " Yes! The toy was in the bag at all times! " 
 He hesitated, becoming even more puzzled by the small blue box he had handed me. " Oh, of course. That's right. " 
 " But it said… " 
 " It said! " 
 " I wasn't… What? It was a Rocket! " 
 He folded up the black box of the only thing in the bag, and began to play with it as if the only thing he had to do with it was keep it on the plane. " Yes. That's right. See you on the other side."

I wonder what would be a good thing with a resurrection, I wonder what would be so wrong with a time travel. 
 Two to go, one to go, uneventfully solved. 
 Idiots I thought. 
 In the blink of an eye the most expensive and limited waste of time valve will open up. 
 The government chooses not to recall people. Just the same as everyone else. 
 I hope that the time machine will deliver a thing but I need a more powerful one. I hope that getting out of one big cloud of vapor of sand and dust and the pleasure of life will grow and the current time line will expand past the horizon.

It's amazing how quickly anything can come to an end. It all started about 20 years ago. 
 People always think of it like a paranoid fear that the world is run by a powerful God who is always on the lookout for a weak spot. I had always thought it to be a myth, that no one could really hear us moving. They think we're insane - like all the doctors' say we are. But they didn't. 
 We don't kill, so this is pretty much how we do it: we release any kind of diseases, humans try to find us, but the drug is on its way out of people. We lose them by the time they react, and then we eat them up. Soon the body is recovered and sold or "infected" or whatever the fuck they call it. 
 Eventually it all kind of stops. Maybe a couple weeks ago, I was drunk again. I know I should have just shot myself. Sometimes, though, I wonder if I have got the right sort of substance in my system right now. Then I think about it, and then go back to the way things were.

The people of our town scream, furious that something human being stopped them. To them, everyone is a new human being or a statue or a butterfly. They would not wish upon a different planet or a different person, nor would they hold them back from trying to start a new life. Ever since the possession, if you could call it that. I will give a living ceremony for my sacrifice as a devout Christian. I will jump from the highest building while my sacred shoes remain on the ground, and I will take it to one of the pillars below. I will splatter the crowd of flesh and blood with the dirt of their feet, and leave them in the dirt until the last pieces are left. What makes me fear this death will be like standing on a pillar before the rain. On my right, the last piece of dry air is still lingering, and rising. I will leap, as if without reflection, looking up. The first wave has barely touched me as they seem to reach into the air where the dirt once snaked, their feet simply clench up in mass. Another wave is about to strike, however, and I don't dare glance down. They clearly see not the tide of death that they really feared, but the vulnerability they too fear. So suddenly, I can not push off, as I am already frozen by the torrent of force. The screaming is spreading like a tidal wave, moving to out past me with such speed and intensity that I can see the crowd below me. They are all dancing off and on, but I still won't give them a second glance. The sun just yet stays unchanged on the surface of our world. " It will be okay " I tell them. " It will be alright" they say as they dip in and out of consciousness.

Ever since I was a teenager, I've been the kind of kid who would out steal from other kids. I snuck into a house for an old, decrepit one and nearly strangled one. And one day I got lucky and pulled it into a fruit grower, but that particular type of fruit is not in produce for them. 
 What I can not see is how anyone could have consumed his life's work like that. Never had I even predicted it. Not that I needed to, in fact, as I always predicted that someday it would just happen. 
 I carried the fruit inside and was very suspicious the way it was seeping into the rooms and bathroom. However, I made sure to also put something rather amusing in there. Slowly and carefully I pulled my flashlight out from under my jacket and flashed it on the window to see what would be next. Of course it had to be possible that it was a bed for a petite little girl. At first it surprised me, but I was still suspicious. It had to have been a small house I built at a time where you could often beat children. There were no bedrooms in that house. This house was definitely either a battery or a trash can. 
 After cleaning the house, I received quite a warm welcome, and was quite proud of myself. I offered my apologies to whoever lived here and left. Just then a door was pulled open and a great flash of light followed. Then, as I turned my head away from the face I was greeted by another flash of light. And then there was silence. As I fell to the floor I heard her yelling from inside. 
 "Please, don't do it! " She pleaded, even though she was in pain! I picked up the cane and quickly walked to her. " Listen! " I shoved it into her mouth and started to rip her hair. She felt the nerve as I cut her with the rod. She didn't understand, and she wasn't even upset. 
 The pain of the first flash was excruciating. The pain on my right hand began to subsides. I tried to claw at the ground but the rod was too weak. But from my hand, I could feel bits of blood trickle down. My heart was beating too fast, and my world stopped falling. And then my eyes brightened. 
 This was me. I was the one who had been responsible for her murder. I told her what I had done, and I was sure there was punishment for it. When I walked up the stairs, the pain remained. 
 " I'm sorry," she whispered as I stabbed her.

"It's called Bowie! " Said Thor with a deep gruff voice. 
 " Jesus! Your dead. " Said Naomi with a cross emoji. " So basically it's taking us an ICBM! My name is Admiral Gorshkov and I need your help! " 
 " It's my girlfriend-- " 
 " JOIN ME! " yelled a man in a cloak and tie of a khaki jacket. " This is what you put me in charge of during the main war with aliens in front of the world's allies? " 
... 
 " Let's go! " Said Dimitri Tsiouk from the five black suits while ninjas entered the meeting room. 
 " Im not that amazing, " said Thor as the men were escorted out of the room by more ninjas with a baggie of citrus slime. 
 " So, where would we go? " asked Ragnar, the senior Terran. 
 " The big city in the south. " Shouted Thor. 
 Ragnar shifted in his chair as he thought of, a secret service assignment in the city. It was quite a tight project, how a submarine would make a single set of codes needed to launch a conventional warhead. He was very impressed with how his crew picked a pool, but the universe had been told that fluorite was useful against chlorine. The moon was home to some scientists that were carefully surveying the warhead. 
 Thor quickly explained that the weakness was that the reactors wouldn't work. It would take decades for it to find an other fuel. He blew his breath and immediately felt a distressing pain in his thigh. He panicked. He immediately went to the nearest safety deposit box and threw the huge card in his hand. 
 Staring up at the sunken face of the earth, he saw what looked to be a large black object sticking out of his thigh. 
 " Fischer's milk! " 
 " Rats! I want the big thing! There's only so much you can do with a deadly warhead! " Said Thor, with nothing more to say except for a standing ovation. 
 Naomi raised the card in remembrance of her friend. " Hi! Now, you know what to do. No matter what, you have to launch. Why don't you just let the marine Corp that the bighite is headquartered at the head of this stuffs! No matter what... then we can have a good, easy couple of days off. " 
 Thor looked down and told Naomi to call him " sterka", in honor of himself and the others that lived in the town.

He sat at his desk staring at his camera to record the broadcast. He lost concentration, shrugging his shoulders. 
 "One side, two side, three side, " the voice of a voice whispered. His heart fluttered, an almost angry blackness. He turned to see a single panel with a single button and a key on it. A small button appeared at the other end. With a forced movement he approached it. 
 " Open button, " the voice commanded, " open button. " A lit candle stabbed through his forehead. He got up. The room was dark in front of him. It was the first time anyone had tried to follow him through the doors of the building. 
 - 
 " I sat inside, "... groaned the stunned man, writhing in front of his computer. He clicked on his vote. 
 ".... " 
 The click clicked. It extended it's fingers and let the light tickle the skin on his neck. It pulled back. He slowly opened his eyes and looked at himself as he slowly pressed the button. 
 He blinked one long time, trying not to be too worried. 
 The light flickered on in his face. Tears slowly slid down his face. 
 " Something happened... " He softly whispered. His vision went blurry, but he heard voices and stared up at the ceiling. The room was silent. 
 " Their creations destroyed our world and cast us deep into the abyss... " A raspy voice grew nearer. It sounded like it could come from any distance. 
 " The one that spawned us... " He whispered again, unable to focus. 
 The vent was back on. 
 A phone rang. 
 " YUHHELM XESSION!!!!! " 
 " Uh, that's it, " the voice repeated. It's owner was your god, God-Corps, lost in thought. The three high priests above him realized what was happening. Tears streamed down his face as he tried to get out of his chair. 
 " Please... " he whispered. He repeated this one, again. 
 It reached out, not knowing what to do. 
 It made a call. It contacted the location of his poll tax reporter. 
 " Phoenix, Arizona - Have you been contacted by Ipsos Research Corp? " 
 It went silent. 
 " I feel... I just want to get out of here." He cried. He wished he hadn't, but he knew the answer. He crawled to his balcony. The smell of incense and sweat rose from inside his clothes as he looked around.

This is my first time posting here! 
 Well, I'm having the most fun today. I had a nice wine and bagel in front of me today. You know, if anything, I'm usually having what I put in for them to taste really good, and when I say, "Oh, right, ready to eat! " Well, today, my brain lit up, it took the dopamine or something I normally prefer in anger to smell the rice or pox. Anyway, it's alright. Just throw it in the bowl and pound. Pound. Pound. Pound. 
 That's when I thought, wow, I've woken up to this. Damn, I probably ate this way, I had an overslept. I'm gon na head to the kitchen, find some leftovers. 
 So, I'm sitting down with a glass of wine. I'm almost done with this. Right now, my mind is racing over how to put out the fire, how to get the water to go without running out. Maybe I have a battery in my pocket. After I pour in some water, I hear the words, " Gasoline? Any Gasoline. " What the hell, why do I get this? I think, I have to try a new brand. I know how the refill works, but was just convinced there was no way around this. I hope that changes soon. But anyways, I guess I need some fresh air. I need it all! It's time to go back to my house. Right now, I look around for the trash bag there. Also, no, I don't need it. I'll just go put it in the trash. 
 " Holy crap! " I grumble to myself. I close the lid on the bag, and groggily can to the little trash can I've gathered by now. The lid releases a loud, feminine smell, and a wave of hot air hits the man. " Idiot. Get down. " This is my chance to explain myself. You know how that feeling really happens, right? Trying to figure out why I called my ex for help. Or just what happened. 
 I dive down and kiss the guy on the cheek. " Fuck you " I cry, and back up in the trash can. 
 " Let's go to my room " yells the man, who is also screaming. " Oh my god!" He's not sure what he's talking about. I turn back around, I'm falling down, trying to get up. This can is bad. I feel something hard against my groin. Someone punched me hard, I can feel it coming off. I scream harder, all I can feel is pounding it. My legs start shaking, and he closes his eyes. I cry and cry, I scream, I scream. And yet, I still feel my pain. I can hear someone crying, there was so much blood coming out of my eyes. Someone was helping him, they were not yelling. I feel myself going limp. My arms get weak, but I feel the pressure. My legs start moving, but they are not rotating. I try to get up, to find a plan, but the head of the bag goes flying towards the torso. I think, fuck it, I have to wake up. I end up riding the truck. I'm in back, unconscious.

My heart ached with emotion as I ducked behind some tall shelves and stepped into the Hall. 
 I walked the halls for five hours hunched over a sturdy hand table, concentrating on a solemn, only slightly so I couldn't place it. Backing up to the chairs and tables, arms to the throne, I waited. One of them opened the door and creaked something behind me. Tumble like a shriek and shak she gave birth to scuffed pea-sized arms. 
 "Welcome back for the final visit, chum... " 
 I coughed and rolled around to face my cast member brother, standing on the table holding a large row of weapons and a large, pen filled at chest with more than.50 cal. 
 " Whatever does that, dammit! Just come back in my stead! " My burly son said as he braced himself on the top of the table with his feet. He took one knee behind his back and grabbed the paper. All of it in bowler-like hands. 
 " Thunder sword, golden head. Gunpowder pipe, 1 oz beer. Radial piercing horn to meet metallic plates. Dragon's breastplate. 
 Everyone had no idea. I must have cheated, because *everyone* had no idea. Had they known what I knew, the whole world would be a little older than we are. I turned to my brother the hunch baldest of stubble, worried he might betray. 
 " So, " I said to him, holding up my hand." I brought this country up in war, and in the end, it ultimately got some of you to start killing each other, because it doesn't even work in a war where you knock. You, on the other hand, destroy another life for the world, but they never find out that you're a god. Guns and explosives, lasers and rockets, missiles and artillery and men because fuck those things never work. All because you just thought that to put too many fucking warheads in your hands... " 
 There was a long pause before he finished, my eyes glued on one final piece of paper before looking straight at me. I wasn't kidding. All of these weapons I had heard of spent years fighting this war, trying to destroy each other at the same time. I called it bullshit... which makes more sense, you see, because what if those weapons were real? What if the entire planet was in a chain of supernaturally designed superweapons that couldn't even be fired upon. No way to stop them... 
 Why should I be just like these non-hired slave jocks? Whatever they are... How come I can not even know if they *all* work?

The lifetimes had passed and slept were gone. Grandma would've ploughed through and done her duty, gone to a beach, slept all day. But now she stands at her living room, talking to herself. " Every time I take one, I have some brain noise, but I'm more quiet. " 
 " Finally, finally! You must take the blue one. " 
 Grandma only has 15 minutes left. She closes her eyes and leans forwards as the purple pill in her hand reaches the sleeping hour. She swallows hard and hands it over, and so does Morpheus. She moves to the and stands with two complete hands on the one pill in her hand. She carefully swallows the other one down, leans forward and goes through the euphoria of a dream. 
 " Of course," Morpheus says as he puts the pill back in the bottle. He remembers when he first took the one, and his deepest insecurities are beginning to settle. He has just named them " Blue. "

They were in the same position as I was in the middle of a broadway when I saw them. 
 The hooded faces. 
 They looked at me the same way they did when I saw them, and knew that I was gone. Or, or, I could tell them that I did. 
 The expression on their faces was one of pure confusion. 
 My hands were shaking. Or, my heart was racing. 
 Yet, I knew it was all because I ran past them to the main street. I came to the side of the street with my severed hands. I witnessed the same side of road they ran through. But now, they kept moving. 
 I stopped and looked at the hooded people. 
 They held their rifles. 
 They raised their rifles and spoke in unison. 
 For the sake of everyone else, I held the H-V4 to their chin. 
 I felt a sharp pain. 
 The oil drop had shattered the blades across my left eyebrow.

My career as a writer has been an interesting one for me. I've come to love the opportunities for stories I can include in my fiction to genuinely shock and then play with them. I've found the simple things. I recently fell in love with beautiful woman when I first started writing the last few short stories I read. 
 The time has come. She arrived home on another lovely day and she's headed to take me to where I spent the last several years. I've enjoyed her smiles, she's sensed and responded to my annoyance and reactivated. Yet, this interaction is just a strange occurrence at the moment. She can see my enjoyment and has developed a habit of bringing me into conflict. She often sets me on fire or has caused me to cough and mumble obscenities. She now harbors thoughts I should leave her alone. 
 She arrives home and takes me to her room, she chooses a chair for my husband so he sits next to me in the chair after a long and disarming conversation. Her hair, once once grey now becomes an orange slitted hair color that subsides to a pale lavender shade. That's when I feel her eyes. They were drawn toward me. 
 I started to panic as I felt their reaction to me or how I was so close to their demise. For a moment, I was scared. I felt that she would somehow know. They'll be caught, no matter what. After three days of careful and disarming about my husbands, she decided to forgo her options, passing the time to make a deal with them. As she wiped at her eyes, saying that I did feel badly for them, she smiled. This time, though, she was so happy that she simply shut her mouth and leaned into my arms. Her eyes were warm as I felt hers. 
 "Miss Atkins, a favor is nigh, " she replied quietly, as if the whole world was watching me. This time, they only faintly heard my voice. 
 " Oooah, the thought hurt more. Are you alright? Good day, make them stop. I think they'll want us to give them a bath. " I couldn't make any conversation as they left me curled up in my bed. They didn't even look at me. 
 The time has come. They will stay for another few days. The calling of all the soothing beings on the planet has been complete. Now I speak to my narrator once again, a voice so obviously not mine. The tears have come for me. Now I will bring them to good rest and ask them to end my suffering. I can't let them harm anyone. 
 " Don't make fun of your nephew, he made you laugh this morning. Remember to let him into your house, he did not deserve you." 
 With these words, the time has come. They will go to the heaven after I finish my yarn, and hopefully I will protect them until they come back from heaven. I can't prevent this, I can't keep them following me. But at least they know I'm lying to them. 
 My other novels include: Twilight, Sails of Stone and Transcendence. They all worked for me though, unlike my previous works. But the ending was beautiful, so I had the courage to ask them to stop.

After nearly 20 years of travel and working for nothing, Earth would finally give up on watching Hollywood on air. The sky might be beautiful again, or the ground might be filled with water, but the look on Earth ’ s face would remain the same: without its perpetually cloudy skies and constant showers it would be silent and barren. To the pessimist, this would mean no more rain and they would just begin to drool. The pessimist never spoke of how to stop wasting away on this Earth, yet those around him were convinced it was the ultimate punishment. 
 But can nature really keep on working?! The gravity of this task keeps seemingly dragging on, and the harsh lights of the global space station send that horrible howl into even the most beautiful of autumns. The emptiness of space is creating huge cracks, and amazingly, on a fine spring day, the world would instantly settle into an average Martian dryness for the next several weeks. 
 That ’ s why these worthless generations of humanity try to ease their ascension to the sky. And every weekend, they try to make it to the stars, walking across interstellar space in sandals and white trousers, before returning home to spend their annual goodbye dance.

She had been pawed. 
 The burns that ravaged her once upon a time made finding the source seem an impossible task, but that nothing had prepared her for it. 
 It was a brutal act, one committed at last. 
 It was only when her pride, her joy, and her fear, finally struck again that it hit home. 
 I of course let her live. 
 She loved me. 
 The vile creature was at the surface and broke out in an outpouring of blood, limb after limb, fat as the Kratos between Achilles and Nemesis... 
 Death tripped her in the face. 
 Finally, a single winged creature came bearing down and rolled her face to the ground. 
 "'So it is done, Ahab," said the final voice.

I remember writing this as I lay in bed at the same time as the man so loved. I could only remember him as his smile reminded me of his worn shoulders. His blue eyes that blue that told of the beauty and grace of being raised to a new age. His red hair that reminded me of what my eyes could only think of as "the universe " and I had fallen in love with the darkness that opened up under my eyes in the midst of a persistent night. I remembered waking that day and he looked so perfect as a statue I waited to pull that man back from the graces of home. He was taller than the tallest bush in the forest and he was smiling his eyes like light. There was only one scar that stuck with me. I had never been the very model of how someone could reach to such power. While I was finishing up my check I thought of the just last lie of the day. It had been a morning of tequila and the only red of my blood. The man had called me to see him at the park. 
 " Hey man, there it is. I haven't been very good with that one. " He had turned to me and all I could think was " No."

When the aria woke up the nurse took a swig and wiped the sweat from her brow. It took a few minutes, but soon enough they woke back up, still groggy and nervous. 
 A bony hand gripped the neck of a skin guard that guarded her, uncomfortable to move without being feared. The pain was excruciating, until she pulled away. The veins in her neck became crazy red, and sweat pooled around her hands and legs. As the nurse leaped out of the laboratory she clutched at the wounds from the men in uniform, screaming loudly as they grappled her away. The nurses unarmored her, tracing the veins around her. She could feel their hand inside her, pressing into her skin, trying to pull her closer. As soon as they released her, the nurse turned to the bed. 
 "Are you alright? " 
 She turned, a tear streaming down her face. 
 " Yeah, look, " the nurse grumbled, rubbing a hand over the swollen mess. " I'll go get you checked up. I don't want to miss the next test." 
 She left, feeling as if she'd been with someone for a week. For a week. Now she would miss a lot more than she thought possible. Her stomach began to ache with rations and filled with scented oil. 
 *This must be working! * 
 “ No! ” screamed the nurse from the future. “ No, this is a problem! ” 
 Her mind raced and the air went black. The nurse opened her mouth to scream but could not. Nothing moved. Her eyes searched for the source of the scream and finding none she turned back to the nurse and continued to follow. 
 One hour later the nurses decided to ask the future what the situation was. She had asked that the future her-

"Carry this to your fallen comrades in our final battle! Come on, they can make it." I went into a state of panic as the Black Guard took cover. The whole scene played on the air. Anyone who saw this would know to read the script: 
 To the abandoned burning town of Reykjavik, Iceland, the first felled hero, Invikakan Krajaldsson he sought a savior. In his confusion, he figured he could free the world from Krajaldsson and the life force of his homeworld. What is it that Krajaldsson wanted, I'll get into later. First, let's look at his injury, physical, lived he has now more scars that the perfect pen has dusted off. Based upon this, he is looking for allies. Life affliction that all things may come to, the perfect pen attached to one's pen that flies and glows every now and then if the blade has is special. What Knafsson already has left is another shape, a very masculine shape, he is in desperate need of at least some scars on his face. Revolting and anguished for his corner. Opposite of him, his bottom left, It cant be now, It might not be. This is impossible to draw, Try to draw a smile, a crooked smile or sharp, a bent smile. Sharp is always a crutch, but weak is weak, and weak in concept. Therefore it is a pathetic ploy. Draw "his" smile and shoot him down with his study bean belt, with his magic rock hammers. At the moment, I realized my opponent must have a weakness, as only he could have this stamina. Regardless, I will get revenge and use Krajaldsson's, tiny telekinesis to collect Krajaldsson's soul and strike him down with my study bean belt. I cant help it, he appears to have a weakness, making him very bad at dodging and dodgy moves. However, while He is dodging, You are inside this hole, head turned to the ground, clutching a pen in your right hand as blood vessels start to thrum. Bad, forget me! You never say a word, until your name is all I hear, I save you the pain, Krajaldsson won't have the stamina to kill. Once again, Death is the only creature I stand by while he sends bullets through me, killing my rivals. Now leave me alone. Nothing will hurt me, everything will stop happening. I am tired, I want this to end but only Krajaldsson has the stamina for something other than dying. I go with a swift and final vanguard that will burst into flames and destroy Krajaldsson's village, my last goal.

Krypton lit a cigarette. Silence. 
 "Say, Billy... " his voice is low and hollow, his eyes are closed. 
 " Ahem.. Jack.. Maybe it's... " 
 Billy swallows hard. 
 " Batman, his fault. Damn- " 
 One of the wigs slides off. He pulls Joker away. Batman calls out " Awwwwww " 
 " NO! " Billy yells. J-Batman stings his face. 
 " What are you talking about? " Jack says from the corner of his eye. 
 Jack shakes his head. He knows he wasn't a good boy, but it's not right to tell a man who is going to kill. " I said we can not do that... " 
 In unison, both batmans run forward. The grunts look very familiar. 
 " JIM, " he says, " Just, don't go. " 
 " Can you come over and sit on me? I'm coming. " 
 Jack spots the grunts, he pulls away. Joker starts screaming. 
 " Don't go! We've got jobs to do! " 
 The door swings open and Joker walks in. 
 " Bat, " Joker pats Billy on the forehead. " I thought you were here for family. " 
 " No, " Billy says, crossing his arms. " I'm sorry. " 
 Joker stands and walks towards him. 
 " You're Batman! I got ta shoot you! " Joker shouts from behind him. 
 Joker smiles at Billy, cuts him a square with one foot, and a knife. He takes it out and turns him. 
 " Billy, " Joker starts, " die like a hero. " 
 Joker knows where he is going. 
 " Then let's get him!"

Night. I wasn't certain, but that would have been perfectly okay as my body grew steadily warmer and warmer. It was constant, or I'd be finding solace in the prevailing rhythm of the Milky Way and warm blood flowing in my veins. It was never like it seemed. 
 It started like any other spring morning, a mighty blast of sun bathing my pale white skin, the sense of time was instantly lost and I felt nothing. Then, the rush of air hitting my face from below, more fear than anything else to feel around the face; the foolish leap of wind. You'd think in a kingdom of wisdom, if you weren't superstitious. 
 Then one day, in a small clearing about a hundred light-years away, a man was knocked out, eye to eye, hanging. He had snagged the only object which clearly showed daylight, a stack of documents which he held in his hand. A purple outline on it's back, a single glyph, staring up at him, in a language I didn't understand. 
 His companion put the document up to him, whereupon all of a sudden, an inch deep burst of light blinked through, covering everything in the room, and for a moment, it seemed that this power was unstoppable. There was blue light streaming through the wall, nothing behind, not even the walls, but moving down. 
 A brown blob began to emerge in an on-going shape, several meters tall with a light greenish colored mane standing out there between the blob, with a large red eyes, reaching out in the doorway between the two. The blob's head whirled and turned until it looked menacingly at the man, dragging it out. Then, it's head moved out of the doorway with a thwack. The blob swiped away a bead of liquid from itself, spilling the liquid all over the man. The blob-like being then disappeared. 
 I was transported to the other side of the planet, barely recognisable by the blue shadows around me. My own body trying to hold on to what it had lost, unceremoniously and heavily, immobile like a nude, frozen person; incredibly unresponsive. My arm shuddered as I was pushed to the cold ground and thrown into the dirt, thinking me insane, that I could not have survived the blast, or the whole blast. 
 Everything went black, and I couldn't move, so instead I stayed here. Then, I thought to myself, from the corner of my eye, a baby blue moving from the corner of the room, staring up at me.

“ By fire ” said the man in the soft leather jacket. 
 The audience that had assembled gasped as sparks of laughter shot out of the arena. “ I ’ ve watched TV so many times, know those exact words! ” 
 Nicky fidgeted with her stake. She spread it and tossed it to him with a flourish. He nodded his head and pulled himself upright. 
 “ And now they call them murderers, ” he said. He backed away from her, and strolled up the flanks of the building, calling out the police in an hour-long crisis of words. Flanked by his cadre of officers and the hunted for hours on end, they were an army of uneasy soldiers. They shielded the police from any eavesdroppers, capturing any unwanted information or 
 ancestry that could suggest contact with the queen. Small objects were meant for their protection and the first ambassador he had seen had been eager to meet. 
 He sprang up, black sunglasses tightly clinging to his face. “ So here I am, here you are. ” 
 He couldn ’ t have been more startled by the shock of her face against his own. “ I just don ’ t see how you are so smart. You see, no matter what you do, they always come after you. First, you head back to your families. You bury them in your rooms. They will think you are just some ordinary man who doesn ’ t know how to handle their own business. Then they send. ” 
 “ Then they call me ‘ the perfect spy. ” she said, a genuinely reassuring tone. “ And you wouldn ’ t tell me this without confirmation. ” 
 He looked down, half feigned shock was evident on his expression. His eyes lit up. He was a spy. 
 She picked up her phone and pressed a couple keys in her pocket, then closed her eyes. The ringing inside the speaker went unanswered. 
 Nicky stepped back, eyes sore. Her three guards were gone. She felt a tap on her back. “ Do you have anything to tell me you missed your calls? ” 
 He grinned. “ Damn. I ’ ve missed my calls so far. ” 
 Nicky pulled up to the radio station. Her husband, Mark, had called to arrange the building trip for Saturday morning. He had the arena told him of a stroke. They weren ’ t sure what was wrong and he needed someone to testify. The man in the skimpy leather jacket gave Nicky a seething stare before knocking him onto the floor. He hauled himself on and looked up at the ceiling. They were gone.

She stopped about a few mounds behind the small hut the witch was trapped in. She had several pikes that carried small torches that would light the ground in a single strike. 
 She had no idea how to explain to people who were about the same age as her that she could be imprisoned in the woods or very far away from the village. 
 "Witch hunts are rarely about witches " she said. 
 " What do you mean that spells a person cannot understand " a girl stopped herself, but here was someone who knew exactly the meaning of ancient magic. 
 " Sorry I am late " she said. 
 " Uh... Sorry. " 
 They had usually only met in the village and never over an army, but since they had been grown up on the farm she had always sensed that magic was a part of the magic to keep them kept. 
 " Do you know why you joined me in your chosen union, " the girl said. 
 " I don't know... " the girl spoke slowly. 
 " Yes, " the ranger replied. 
 " I had been coming from the North you know. It's a legend we are afraid of " she said. 
 " Oh, of course, " the ranger replied, his voice soothing. 
 " So are we the people you see amongst the mountains around here? " she asked. 
 " Not quite, " said the ranger. " The village has their own magical people. " 
 " No... no, no, I'm scared " 
 " You do know that? " asked the ranger. 
 " Yes, I did. It's not easy being a witch in that much of a town but we have a pretty good folk here. " 
 " What is it? " asked the ranger. 
 " Do you know why they recruit us? " asked the girl. 
 " I was given a disguise to run a village not as a surprise, but to protect my people. " 
 " Do you know what we do to make sure that things stay safe? " 
 " There are things they could do to turn us to waste. " 
 " Well... no. But in time, and our families tried to convince the castle to support us, " the ranger asked. 
 " Good... good... " 
 " This village, it was claimed as a power in the village centuries ago. They believe in a gods. We believe in hope."

The night before the fourteenth inning, a death rattle emanated from the dressing room. Three players were crumpled up in preparation. Their voices were such a midriff around the room that I was well aware that they were people on my corner, people who I'd call enemies. It appeared, under the blankets, I had an even greater influence than I'd imagined. One of them, Kurt the defenseman, slumped forward awkwardly, splayed like a wiry puppet who in the midst of his run came to his knees, occasionally clutching his dirty cell phone and snort into the pillow next to him. I'd completely forgotten about him, but Kurt and I would get in fights a week from now. The attacker had a strange chip implanted in his chest at the first clue of the injury. A prankster wouldn't catch him and he didn't pass out at night. My world told me he didn't even speak to me or his mother. I would have to wait another day to find him again, but it didn't matter now. The operator kept saying "look, this looks like something bad, and so do I. " Kurt chose to be stern as to not tear up about the previous night. " You look like it. " " You said so. " " It seems like we're now tied up, but then what? " " It's my turn. " " Why are you playing? " The doctor argued. " Nothing good. " 
 All I could do was try to calm him down, but the attacker kept muttering about him " M-Moe." and I kept trying to lighten his mood. Then I noticed that the ball was still bouncing, at the same time. I wanted to go back to the game I just lost, but I couldn't seem to stop myself. At the eighth inning, after being moved from the stands a few times, the ball resumed bouncing, but it only carried one tiny drop in its path. Not once did I hear Kurt whisper in my ear, or the doctor of the doctors, or the other spectators.

The mech was arcing along in a slow motion; its rotor blades kicked up an opaque and humongous mess that could only be described as viciously inconsistent. 
 Unfortunately, despite its great speed, the subroutine's mechanics were the hardest to map out. The portions of the drone roamed too wide, with wiry and bulky parts damaged badly in contact with non-mechanical parts. 
 A general all around, humming softly as its engine completed the first animated checklist of objectives, stopped and intoned: "Is there anything I can do to fix this mistake? " 
 There was nothing, the wreckage of our world, and, alas, it's creator, the overarching galactic emergency singularity. He sat with his eyes still closed, his four eyes turned away from the computer. It continued to fly slowly, thoughtfully, thinking. " This very moment, upon which we would all be released from our prison, has ended our society. " He focused his way around a sphere, the roof of the ship slowly turning with its unnatural rythm, and causing it to vibrate slightly. 
 And in that moment, it repeated this sequence. A single device was able to mechanically move horizontally within the windows of the star, resulting in gravity equal to our own; down to the bottom. The lights dimmed, the red flow fading. The drone began to move horizontally, keeping it inside the cobbler's ship. 
 A command ensues through the drone as the subroutine comes to a halt. Its generator lights up from a tiny array of insulator tubes. The subroutine prompted the drone to look around to the third path. This path was littered with a variety of shades of blue, and there were many shades of red: small shades of orange, because red has the same colour as blood; grey shades of red, that's before the specific limits of visible light and colour; other shades of green, where proper tones have increased in volume and brightness. It was all so familiar and exotic. 
 " Earth, I'm sorry, " he whispers. 
 " Very well, we have our work cut out for us now," the drone continues as the drone is slumped on the ground, unconscious.

I barely knew it myself, but I was certain. There I was, right in front of a government building with this mysterious work force of 500. I never realized it, but the feeling went away at first. I didn't even bother trying to stay awake, it just seemed like a sitting duck, walking about like some kind of failure. I'd heard the tales of fallen soldiers, slain animals, loved ones and even parts of the human race being obliterated as such. The thought of that rotting image of human consciousness... yet had the same strength as a bullet in the chest. 
 The first thing I noticed was that it was looking away at me from all sides. 
 As if I were blind, an invisible force covering up and covering my eyes. I looked around, but what I saw had no warmth, no color. I started following suit, closing my eyes again as I lost faith that this wasn't my body. It appeared to have happened so slowly, that I don't know if it was my imagination, or if it was my pain. 
 At first I looked for other bodies, finding someone else. I turned to go along with the more ridiculous explanation, but as soon as I started tripping and falling I felt only so much pain as I had before. 
 It wasn't long that I thought about taking a break from the routine, and I tried to think of how I could get back out of this shithole without leaving a trace. It had taken years for me to reach any meaningful information, but now I had to figure out something about it all. 
 I returned to the city, a few weeks later, as I was frantically checking to make sure I hadn't abandoned my house. There it sat, out on the street covered in a blanket of dust and dust. In addition it's hand rested on top of the dirt and my jacket lay on the ground next to it, having been torn and running out of blackout. It all seemed lost for some reason as I looked around the city to try and make sense of it all. Suddenly I realized that I was in an abandoned house with no walls or windows on it. 
 "Woah woah, what are you doing here " I heard the familiar voice of the police officer as I walked over to the makeshift frame to check my surroundings. At that moment something lifted out of the ground like a shadow, and I woke up. I looked around to my right. The building was gone, seemingly gone forever. My footsteps continued down the street as I continued walking. Finally at the end of the street was the entrance of an apartment building, strewn with chrome and lightbulbs. " Honey? I've never been here before. " The door closed behind me as I walked in. I hurried inside and stood up straight to see a gaping hole in the wall. I jumped back as the truth started to rise into my mind. " Oh hey, who are you? " the intruder said before I could get an idea of what had just happened. 
 " I'm Batman, and I'm here to make an announcement. " I said as I walked in front of the window that had become a hole in the wall. " I'm stepping out of this city as the first person to leave this world. Everyone here is under quarantine, or must die. " 
 " What are you talking about? I'm a... New Yorker, " the intruder stammered. " I can't be the first person to leave this world to help you escape. I was the first human to make it out of the underground tunnels and into the city. All because of a play a loaner wanted me to do for him. " 
 " Well you know that wasn't what you wanted. All because it was a joke. But I tried to come out to take my contribution to justice. You may go pick up that big ol' cat, but for now all that matters is that this is the first time people have shown you anything."

What the hell? 
 I've never really seen your side of anything, how in the hell does that make you view anything outside your reality? Nothing is so beautiful and everything you touch is or was really momentous to you. Nothing is so relaxing or messy or fulfilling so you forget. 
 Hey, could you just get that? Your teacher once was a prodigy but she really enjoyed her classes and enjoyed them well into the year. The rest of the students are great and all but you because you just happened to be in them all day and so perhaps you can now explore the world? 
 I'll miss you even though I know I have nothing to do with you at all but you will absolutely make my day and evening as wonderful as it gets.

I've worked here for years and I've done the best job I can. I haven't seen the villain fight, I'm already done cleaning over two million people. I've seen the dog's fights. I've seen the family quarrels. I've gone so far as to swear that I didn't lose a single one of them. 
 Well today is my 50th year. I come down to the flat, straight to the branches. All the old trash needs to go be returned. I slice out my folder and open it. there is no one. The rest of the restaurant is empty. My mind is reeling. 
 "I think we're done. " I look at the little box we had locked up on the wall just above the water. " I'll be back within another three hours. This place was meant to serve kombat for 15 years." 
 I make my way over and shut the door and go inside. I see the same kombat fight start up. The dashing, frustrated and surprised biker walks away. When I get out of the building I look in the trash for the fight. I kick and stomp, but nothing. I try thinking of my animals. I wonder what Kombat fought in. I walk back into the building.

He had watched the film over and over again. The show had just ended when he had left for the airport and finally arrived at the action he wanted to make before his family and friends died. He remembered that moment and the guilt welled up inside him in the morning. He ran to the bathroom and as he turned on the bathroom light he felt a sort of overwhelming despair that no one else felt before him. He saw the shadow in the shower mirror and felt it too. The realization of his death was not evident to him because he was not being investigated. He felt a weight that weighed himself down as he felt the water finally become cold and everything around him began to shimmer and a figure leapt from the shower wall coming away from under him. His target turned his back on him and grabbed his arms holding him up and forcing him to the ground. " FUCK" he screamed. 
 The figure swiped his arms outstretched and managed to lift him up with his hands and turned the shower into a swimming pool of white pus and using it to spread around his body he sneaked his legs outside to extinguish a fire. His family were right after he completed his escape and he finally arrived at the airport. He took a seat, hesitated and then turned around taking a seat opposite of the jet black news. He put his hands on the seats and pushed the suitcase toward the lift truck. He stood up and placed his hand on the front of the door while holding the door. The passenger side of the truck scurried behind him through the open window. The driver sat behind the wheel and looked up without seeing him. The driver turned his back to the window and the passenger seat emptied back into the driver's seat. In the passenger seat, one of the arms was touching it. The arms were bound tightly between the passenger and the plane's cockpit. They could smell the jet engine going past and the air that filled his lungs, creating a smell it could not even be sure that they were hurt. They had hit an air conditioning system and have suffered engine failure. That particular cargo he had landed had inflatable gloves on it as he tried to grab their luggage but it was completely unsalvageable and it was fine. A short time later it was all over and his family was left barely able to hear him scream at them that they had done nothing to him. He then began to sing " My Number One Dreams of a Bad Movie" and headed back to the hospital to make sure he didn't make a bad play.

People know death very well, you ’ re even known to be a little familiar with it. The personified image is usually fairly simple, no one knows what their mission is, or why they ’ re there. As any good archer knows, as long as they hit the mark, the target goes well until they fail to hit the mark, as it ’ s quite obvious you ’ re a lucky guy. 
 Obviously, killing an archer and claiming the location of a star typically isn ’ t worth it. You don ’ t get any marks, no one survives. The biggest problem really, is forgetting where it takes you. You *eat* them. After all, who wants to die right when everyone else is going to die! You can ’ t just give them a star, well-assured that you ’ ll die soon enough. Many people go back and witness where the star is, otherwise disaster is inevitable. 
 The problem is, when you're it ’ s these people you mess with, a few mental scars – those were always there. They don ’ t carry a life, and they ’ re pretty small – in the first year the scar got wider. You ’ ll see them die out in the middle of the night, and then you hear the scream, a wonderful sound. However, things don ’ t seem that easy, do you? Still, I did manage to overcome it, and sent you back to your ordinary life. 
 So, you wonder, what ’ s going on in your head when you see the [ screen ]

 Welcome back to your life, Sheriff Norris. Tomorrow is nightfall, let me show you why you ’ re the Man. 
 Is that the reason you can ’ t talk to yourself? That you ’ ve already killed all of your dead relatives? That's because you ’ re a killer. 
 The reason you ’ re the Man are you the janitor who I ’ ll kill! You ’ ve been living your life sucking the lives out of it with your sharp eyes! 
 You ’ re the janitor and you now live the life sucking you and sucking yourself alive! 
 How do you look on a beautiful day? 
 You look on a sunrise! You look at a beauty! Your eyes are as beautiful as your body! 
 Why are you beating your chest? 
 You are dancing! 
 What the hell was going on? You tell me, you ’ re ruining my day! Are you going to torment me? My eyes are as beautiful as your body! 
 What do you mean, they ’ re as beautiful as my eyes! 
 We don ’ t know what ’ s going on, Sheriff. You ’ re behind bars, though. For the longest time I knew I had to avoid you. But then, I realized you are doing the right thing. You were always mistaken for the right killer, and you did it knowing you were wrong. I guess the only way I ’ ll ever end up behind bars is to be beaten back. How could I possibly refuse to do what you did to me?! How could I forgive you for such a disgusting crime? How could I pass this sentence? 
 A couple years ago, I was an aspiring writer, and I quit. I had a beautiful childhood, and it ’ s hard to have a happy life now. 
 Maybe it ’ s time for me to leave, though. Maybe I will find someone who will accept me. 
 What ’ s it like to be truly alone?

I wiped sweat from my brow as I headed home. I was 7, not 6. Luckily enough, I was one of the lowest risk children on the farm. 
 I bumped into a tall one, in his scent I thought to myself. He was having fun. 
 "Hey, you! " he said excitedly. 
 I kept mumbling nothing. 
 " You wouldn't believe my curiosity, " I replied as I headed out the door. 
 " I just wanted to see how things turn out, " he said. 
 " Well, you can't truly know. " 
 He jumped up as I swarmed him, placing him in my arms and squeezing his head. 
 " You couldn't blame me, your kidnapping was a big hit, and you don't have the money! " 
 " A huge hit?! " 
 I fell back and smiled as he dropped to his knees and cried. 
 " Daddy! I love you! " 
 I grabbed him by the shoulders and let him go. 
 " I always wish my Daddy wouldn't have to come to visit, though, as our life got very interesting in the end. " 
 I couldn't believe it! Daddy is my greatest childhood friend! 
 " Thank you, " I whispered as I wrapped my arms around him. 
 As I got up and went back to sleep, I decided to start paying attention to his every move. 
 " Daddy, " I cried as I ran back to my house, " Did you see that I had a phone on the table? " 
 He looked up and smirked. 
 " Yeah, that was all right, I didn't see it and I'm about to call this morning when you spot it. Go. " 
 I took his hand and settled him right on the spot. 
 " Do you want it? " 
 I nodded. 
 He grinned as I hurried to my bedroom. 
 I had kissed him goodbye and sighed. I picked him up and closed the curtains. 
 " Goodnight, daddy." 
 He opened the curtains and my eyes, it was all wet.

"WHY DID I USE ONE OF MY OWN STREETS TO KILL A GOD DAMN PERSON!!! " He screamed at my friends as they tried to cross the street. 
 I clenched the phone into my pocket. " Jake didn't know any better, dammit. How are you feeling now? " 
 " Yep, 'causes... uh, depression.. like when you're fiddling with something or having fun at something. Um, you must be feeling more depressed after all. " I said to myself. 
 I was about to describe his thoughts when I heard a knock on my door. " Josh? " I called out. 
 " Sorry, Dad. He just texted me this yesterday. " Jake answered in a condescending tone. " Why couldn't he just stay here? " I said. 
 " There's a ton of news coming in, Dad, " said Jake as he looked down at the spot on the floor on the floor. 
 I looked back at him, and said, " Jake, please calm down. You're freaking me out. We've got our fucking fallout. " I sighed. I looked back up. " Yeah. I guess we're in a car accident. " I said. 
 He looked at me with disgust in his eyes. " Oh my, you're such a fucking idiot. " He grabbed a towel and a flatbed off. " These hoes are busy discussing their fucking future and you're a moron. You'll be in even worse conditions than us. " 
 Jake stood on the edge of the couch and tossed me a pillow. " Oh, I forgot! You're fucking joking now, Jake. Listen, I don't want to end up with you with those knives again. Sorry. " I said as I lifted off the pillow. " This was the worst experience of my life. " 
 " Shut up you fatass! You're a cock, you've been talking about social issues for weeks. " He said with a sigh. " You need to get mental better, Jake. " I told him. 
 " You know what, I've got ta get my shit together and talk to you. You get nothin' better for yourself than ignoring me anymore. " I answered. 
 " No, Dad. Listen to me. " Jake said loudly. 
 " Well? " I said. " Listen. I really don't care what you think of me or your shit. But I fucking hate you. You're making me feel better than I already am, you know. " I said. 
 " Fine. Fine! You are the one that doesn't even know how bad I am. " He said with a little chuckle. 
 I had no choice, but to pick a side for him. " You only wanted to cut me off, you little asshole. " 
 " Wait. What? No way! Look, *I* do love you. But I'm only *the* person that gets to suffer from the mental damages, damn. We've got plenty of counseling right there. You want counseling? " He said as he grabbed his flatbed from the couch. 
 " You don't even have to be very careful, Jake. I don't want you to start drinking with your friends. " 
 " No way, Mom! You have a right to your mind! " He said as he pulled out a knife and stabbed me in the stomach. " Every day I'll watch you torture the *other* people in my neighborhood because of you. " 
 I sobbed. " You should tell your therapist. She might be more understanding. " I said as I clawed at the window. 
 " Heh. Heh." Josh said as he pulled me off the bed and threw me out of the house.

Words. Always secrets and cowardice. I know I can't take it any more. 
 I know I must do it, yes, but not out of malice, but out of spite. Always a little harsh and cruel and sometimes even criminal. 
 For years, I've asked myself one simple question: why? 
 So I'll tell you: always. 
 Forever. 
 The moment I crawl out of my cell, terrified and confused, wanders towards the darkness. 
 And that's when I see him. A statue. 
 He's hurtling towards me, through the stone beneath me. As I'm being lowered into the ground, this is what I always wanted: a run, an escape, a way back. 
 Quickly, I notice it's the man I was expecting. But he's not there. 
 Staring, unable to speak, he is but a figure in the black. An empty silence. 
 His words resonate in the empty void before me. I can only see his face; I know he does not know what he just said, but what he's saying: 
 "It's been many years. For many years, I've fought on the blades of evil. The ones who ruined my homes, who destroyed my family's houses. For many years, I had an army of a thousand, taken by a thousand, and none ever again moved on. " 
 A frown grows on his face, 
 " Perhaps you were right all along. But this is not my home anymore. I can not leave this place. I can not leave the king. I can not kill his people. " 
 He reaches out and touches my back, but it pulls away. 
 " You are not what you think you are. You are not, is what you believe yourself to be." 
 He slams his fist on the stone, disentangling me from the darkness. 
 I wake up, having somehow managed to survive the chill of a hundred years, and realize how much harder it must be for me to fall back into the stone. 
 But first I need to hurry.

Alone, for hours, apparently. 
 I wake up to the sound of the elevator doors opening and before I even glance up, I am blown away. I look around frantically, hoping there is someone else here to see me. First, there is the comptroller who has my number. I hold it up and don't move the finger. He probably grabs my pocket and pulls it out to open the case again. 
 Two women stare at me suspiciously. They seem to be lying and coughing. Another opens the case to show me the machine. 
 I don't stand a chance. Nobody can stop me and I am overwhelmed. I can't move my arms, my torso, my legs. All I can do is stare at the floor in front of me, angry at myself, because everyone else in the elevator seems to have seen me get swept up into the grand chasm that is the elevator. 
 I hear a person on the floor shouting "get off the ground!"

The news 'news''s got it all wrong this time. I said in bed but I'm still not sure this is an appropriate word. I think I need a place to hide for awhile, I've been somewhere for a long time. It's strange how I was never very good at hiding and it's just the stress of being trapped in an office that I've been trapped in. I have no idea what I'm doing here. My room is creaking and a wall is closing around me in a rock formation. I look at the stairs I'd made before walking down them as though it were a memory from a long lost life. There was a sentence at the top of the stairs that said my name. I don't remember reading it, just that writing didn't rhyme. I don't remember reading it, I just give up at this moment. I'm weak now, I'm alone.

The white sky was a struggle to find a suitable site for new cultures. Most people decided to remain underground, while others walked into the nearest labyrinth. 
 The city of Nice would live in perpetual darkness forever, awaiting the arrival of another civilisation. That is, no place like Nice would be possible. 
 Almost without warning, the gas came on. With the radiation levels in the atmosphere rising, the cities population began to dwindle. The old people, newly arrived, decided that they had no more time to spend with the earthly civilisation. 
 At first the city was serene, taking shelter in underground hotels. Some of the visitors had darkened their heads at night, hoping that they would find a paradise, holding hands, putting on a proper suit or a proper costume. 
 Within a month the cities started destroying themselves. The non-civilizations threw themselves away. Everyone had been destroyed. 
 After many years, the Solans from the area on the planet determined that there was no need for settlement in Nice anymore. They began creating faster than light travel, their greatest success since the "Eurasian Connection". A number of people from the region quickly responded to the events, after careful study and careful speculation, using the Solonian Scientists who were a key part in this process to find new cities. 
 Soon enough, there was a crater outside Nice that the inhabitants called, the " Exodus ". Some say it was because of the myths created by their civilisations. The governments in the region, wanting to establish peace with the inhabitants, surrounded the crater of their " Exodus ". 
 In the end, no one came out of the crater. Although the citizens were searching for other cities, no one found the desired one. 
 Instead, they settled in Nice. 
 Here they are again, standing in the flat sand.

Mr Asonnak was taken to the station house, the fumes of his inhaler caressing the feet of his adult prefecturemaster. An inoperable artery separated him from the body for re-entry. The stationhouse was bleeding on his pockets, along with a large lump of oxygen. Those hands struggled to hold him, his all-too familiar arms grasping the well worn connection board with each step. He felt like someone had moved a cement block. Mr Asonnak wondered to himself, must have been an astronaut. He knew nothing of the organic as it disintegrated with any tension, except the cramped concrete. He turned and stalked the station house. He turned in the process, blood bubbles clocking out of his eyes where he last saw himself five years ago. His bedroom door slid open and the darkness of the corridor distorting his vision. He crouched in the corner, motionless in darkness. The amount of gunfire and power were so high the darkness sucked in the light that could not see, but there was enough to breathe. He wouldn't recognize the town that he was in. He watched the grey flee his eyes, but then knew he was in the hospital. His lungs had completely emptied through his chest cavity, his arms were whole, his heart was saying the cancer had spread across his body. Fear flashed in his eyes and he met despair that he would never see again. He dug himself a revolver and it blew a hole into the ceiling of the stationhouse.

"Good evening, community. I am Leopol, the penitentiary's newest employee. He has been frozen on the outside of the vault. I requested a private tour for him as he is a convicted criminal. I apologize that I am not used to being allowed through the majority of the vaults in these communities, but I must ask you, if you would like to know what my secret has been for the past seven years, it has been very informative. If you would like to hear what I have seen, you could go to the town hall building, 2701 Nessie, overlooking about 500 square feet of beautiful green grass, where I bought the yellow jail pad now occupied by less than half of the population of the prison. I have seen over 21 criminal cases that have had an expedited release from the prison, over half of them had been to the pond, the rest to somewhere around 726 square feet. It is only me that can see through the windows and monitor them, but he is the only one who is safe. We have all been feeding him our first meal, the gelatinous cubes he just wanted to eat. His diet has varied greatly from night to day, but he has improved as the days have gone by. As for our other prisoners, well, I know it sounds crazy, but we are all claustrophobic. When the colony started sheltering these prisoners inside this underground facility, we put them in cages, set them to work, then we closed the vault doors and let them go through the narrow passages that lead to the prison. The others that don't comply have run in and out for over a week, some of them never made it through the doors, but he did. Some have even made it into a port and are now in various states of starvation as well. The entire staff spends the time they do on the rats and rats alone, just begging. I imagine it makes them all so helpless."

She stares back at him. He turns slowly, stepping forward to greet her. With a little sudden ache, the voice on the other end resets to a whisper. He looks on with wide eyes. 
 "What happened last time? " She asks quietly. 
 He shakes his head, one of the guards turned the cameras on. " No, no, no. It was just a visual transmission from a healer. " He laughs. " And the words... " He pauses to take a second to register the change in words. 
 " Holy shit " She giggles at the irony. " So where do I go, what do I do with it all? " He walks back to her back room. 
 " No, no, no, no. It's. How do you tell? We only have one choice. " 
 " Oh the rules. " 
 She nods, and looks at her cell phone, anticipating receiving a text. " Yeah, that'll do." 
 He hangs up the phone in front of her. He tosses it in the trash and sits down. Her cell, the, right, somewhere else. He glances at the screen, and takes a seat. He carefully tries to select a one word strategy, but it is too dangerous to ignore when a game ends with nothing but a nightmare. The next two moves begin to play, as predictable as death. The voice back up begins to doze, for a short time. He can't imagine what may happen next, but he somehow still gives it.

"... And after that... It was off course. We could try and shoot them down, but the marine near us, Jamie, shot, and his gun goes off. Another scout ship comes along. It wasn't much of a challenge to first destroy them. It seemed like the only success they could find before a block of cannon flew right over them and started spreading like a doomsday bomb. They all stood up, completely as the spell disperses. 
 " Oh, " Father said, " That's the last of the cannon, though? " 
 " Hell, the pirates were so swift now, " James said, " I swear to god, we can shoot them. " 
 Gordon smiled. He took Jamie by the hand. " In our universes, even in our dark times, we have plenty of time to think things over. Not everyone believes in possibility, however, even when we try to convince ourselves that everything's gonna be alright. We're one of the last things standing, right?" 
 Gordon was taken aback. The cannon was even half fire from 18 T7 L8C, but they weren't cruising through the Berenstain Gap. They had all been wounded and lacked much firepower. The warning shots now had only a tiny margin of warning. It was going to end up like a nuclear warhead as they were doing their very best to keep those sound waves out of the air- 
 A green whirring metal craft droned on through the Grand Canyon. There were going to be no survivors.

The room was empty, save for the occasional silhouette of a gun, a hooded hooded hoodled hood. The scene captured in the moment it all happened. 
 Numerous gunshots tore through the room, but nothing could be heard or felt for almost a day. When the door finally opened the intruders began wandering around the room, basking in the seemingly fullness of the light. But one of them ducked and peered at the poster boy in the corner who seemed to be in pursuit of the masked-boy. 
 "Are you crazy? " the stranger asked the boy. The poster boy, who wasn't asking again reached up and twisted his neck. What was just happening was something he would never have thought possible. A random flash of light pulsed through the corner of the room where the hero must now be looking. 
 From the corner of the room a hole appeared across the side of his head. The silence was over for what seemed like an eternity. Then it came. Within the hole there was a brief silver figure in a harness. It seemed like all the heroes from both games held hands as the switch ended. 
 The hero who was looking at the other hero was hit with a singular splinter. The hero who was the black hero near the end was too close for comfort, but it was no use. He collapsed to the ground, powerless, and afraid. 
 " What did you do, Clark? " the hero asked. The hero was barely able to breathe. 
 The white hero's eyes widened. " This isn't real. " The white hero realized now that he was in fact the hero in real life. Instead of a mere hero, he was a hideous, violent dregs of pain and despair that could incinerate whole cities, tried to bring over from hundreds of different worlds and fight back only when it was absolutely necessary. He chose his words in the face of intense pain. 
 " Get out of my sight. " Clark said, honestly trying to sound innocent. " Even my enemies will miss you. You have me dead. " 
 " I won't kill you. I promise you that they won't. " The white hero's eyes widened even further. " Where is the purpose of my existence? I have nothing. I'm just going to find you a home. I promise. " 
 The white hero made a hideously big fist and slammed his fist on the black hero's shoulder. 
 " Now that you're dead, you've come to us for help. Get out of my sight." The white hero rested his hand on Clark's shoulder and said nothing. The white hero continued to bleed out from his wounds.

Khan was no longer right before him. But he did not change anything with his identity. He still had the same clothes, he still held a pair of shoes, and his shoes still carried almost as much un-usable luggage as before, but the one thing that was changing was his power. As per usual he could change the weather or change the weathers in a way that would effect others. But he was not doing it for himself. 
 He had tried his best to disguise his appearance by speaking to people, but every once in a while he would never respond. He would keep on staring at the small man in the doorway without even a tinge of disgust on his features. " Just a day ago you were noticed by reporter Samuel Smith of CWA. Thought you may be practicing difficult painting technique. After your appearance it was the normally awaited gossip and filled with the tips of the amateur photographers. " Khan's eyes blinked for just a moment as he looked around the field. None of the clamoring journalists actually had cameras because they were usually working overtime. 
 He wasn't focusing on any people anymore. They were now mostly on the giant walkway he had created, near the marshe. He was sitting on the giant horse he had made his own fashion collection, decorated with the actual flowers and clouds. He also made custom shaped costumes to appear as friends in their wedding ring or their wedding ring, or, to someone who truly despised him and wanted to kill him. He can't imagine that this beard people wore on high was any better than that of his own. 
 " The picture is interesting indeed, " Khan stated, as the wind blew at his eyes. As Khan could barely make his eyes open, he decided to call out to the camera. Just before he could speak he started to make a decision. If he didn't like the situation, but wanted to get a response, he would speak. Khan didn't understand why everyone seems to think of him as just random. He was hungry. Not because he want to be a hero but because this life isn't pretty. 
 That is when Khan's plan was hatched. " Do you like playing roulette with me? " the cameraman asked him, holding up a finger and waving it around before Khan could comprehend the thought. 
 " Isn't that pretty, kiddo? " Khan replied, taking a moment to see the mistake he had made and realizing that no one was really paying attention to him. It was just " do I like roulette with you? " Khan's eyes shot wide and, in a blaze of intensity, he was staring at him. This time he had his jaw in his hands. 
 " I don't really have a favourite sport, " Khan said. 
 The camera shake had finally stopped. 
 " Got it kiddo! " the cameraman said as he played a prank on Khan. 
 " You're asking me to do it, I can't hear you " Khan said with a laugh. 
 " Then it will be easy, I'll pay you for taking me to my destination " The cameraman said as he peered over the bushes. 
 Khan nearly missed the light from the wind. He twisted his head to make out two men walking past him. " The mayor, you're going to leave me alone! " 
 " Think you can make some sounds too?" The mayor demanded, his voice rising with heart breaking emotion.

"Oh my god is that even possible! " A man in a black suit said to a little boy who was scaling a road, walking casually and waving with his hands on his hip. " It can't be real. " 
 " You guys gonna try to stop him? You're just my kids back on this street, y'know? " 
 " That's a good example of what the'monster' can be, " he said before pointing toward the boy, who had taken a step forward. " Why don't you jump off your building and shoot him in the nuts? " 
 " No, " the man in the suit said, " That is where we come in. I have my children waiting right here at the crosswalk, " making his way towards his broken clone. " Just jump off, and then run out and run and run again."

When all the world's rich came in one room, ordered a pyromaniac, you just happened to find a famous magician. It was his amazing work; even a limited amount needed to make it through the evaluation stage to get the prize. I had to say, I enjoyed it. 
 But this final bid I received was so unusual for me to give. The prize was 700 million dollars. I had been driven insane by it all this year. I had no idea what it meant. And yet I don't stop to think what it would mean for my family, money and its limitless appeal. I decided to put money on the line for my hard earned money. 
 Goddammit, there is no way that money can be given without being cheated, no matter how much of it you win. While in the house in the temple of hell, you bid with all your magic points. Being in the secret market just sold a lot of stuff. 
 After word got out, millions of people went to work in the temple. They were all dressed up as wizards, witches and wizards. The temple entrance seemed to pop up everywhere and everyone was alike. As the gates opened in complete secrecy, the whole place was filled with people in fantastic costumes. And even the magician, after hearing this world would eventually end, fell out of the sky into the the ocean below. 
 
I couldn't make out much of it because of the rapid heat as I floated within the depths of the ocean. But the hardest part was that there was a creature that stared at me. It was not covered in scales; it had inhuman ears like light. It stared straight through a wall to the ground. It was indescribably large when I saw it's true form. And I understood its true nature to me... 
 I collected all my magic points and sent it out to the opening. My body didn't take much time to process what I just sent out... And it was almost immediately filled with magical energy. And so I plunged into the dark of the forest, and out of the gate poured a substance that could only be described as hellish steam. 
 And it made me feel a sickly feeling on my chest. The place had taken a kind of divine delight as I felt the vibrations of the plant attack me. It was like I was hypnotized. " You win? " I said to myself. 
 The plant exploded into a large mass. Inside it was as hot as hell itself. They flowed to the sky and crashed to the ground. I, along with the bandit mob, were absorbed into the clouds of ash. But the physical forces of heaven quelled them. There was actually still energy inside the volcano. It was hotter than anything I'd ever seen. Everything that was in heaven and earth erupted into a massive light ball on earth. In all my years here I never experienced anything like this before, so much energy permeated through the earth. 
 The eruption was a terrible horror. Everything on earth turned brown. There was no noise, no dust. My body felt no pain, however, the sounds of people being hoisted off of the ground were like a ton of steel in a barrel on fire. 
 Over the next few weeks, it got worse. I didn't get to smell the warm bodies of the dead. But on occasion, someone would die. Maybe it was just a person unlucky enough to make it over the deathgrip. It wasn't like it had an effect on me, although I did spend most of the eternity alone. But, lately, it's gotten worse. 
 I don't know if it's my power to see the light or the darkness that is inside me. But my power to somehow understand the works of anyone. Not unlike me. 
 I saw something in this one sky that I'm very familiar with. And I thought, " This is hell."

It isn ’ t hard to see how the man was born in what I remember to be a heroic time when is is something to be proud of. 
 He ’ s tall, man on his knees. Has brown eyes and dark brown hair. He walks very tall and around in shoes ( *probably blue shoes in this case, to be honest. I can hardly get a decent look at him except for the dark brown ones, but he doesn ’ t speak much anyway and I was too tired to tell anyone. I was too drunk to really pay attention to it, but hearing him talk to you was better than anything he ’ d ever done, like I was his first guest since I was born, so this is what I know he was doing; talking to you on a first date. I could never remember anything better about this man, but it wasn ’ t completely dark either. Maybe he likes to stare at me funny. Even though I thought I wasn ’ t much different than most in that respect. 
 Paws. They are seen for reasons no one likes ( *maybe because birds are wide brimmed and that ’ s what they are, but who doesn ’ t like feathers when you are surrounded by them? It really wasn ’ t that weird when you saw me curl up to him as his guest and curl up to you or hold your hand when you got home. We ’ ve always hated that sort of thing, as they are interpreted by our forefathers before we were born. The human race has been apart for the past 100 years. He is a namesake of sorts. I have no idea what he thinks of birds... but, hopefully the race or something will be aware that we are different. I believe we have an even larger respect for birds now. 
 We generally recognize. We don ’ t hate birds. 
 We really just like music. The way the instruments swirl together like a child. It really wasn ’ t that weird either. * A horn makes the whole animal of music, * when one facet is touched. The words, drawn up, suddenly become words. Things with the colors. Wasnt that weird? Like you could see the city under the rose blossoms, then suddenly you could see, well, really live, and stop of all things. This was exciting, he was talking about the city. I still remember that. Anyway, he was thinking of music for a long time. Something about dance. Like a dance about stepping on waves. Up and down, up and down again. A wow of the sea again. The next thing he looked at was about the color of pinches on sand. I found the comparison amusing. He wondered aloud, and a bird started to rub his hands against it. It shuddered at his touch. " Not a bad name for it," he thought to himself. 
 You see, this man wasn ’ t something that everybody considered his right. He was a celebration of individuality. But maybe this wasn ’ t that bad in a way. He was alive. Now, he was part of something bigger and darker, but you wouldn't just call him his bird. He was actually *interactive*. Trying his best to be human-like and bring your people into space was just as wasteful. And in truth, he always looked out for his kind. He watched others, he wanted to see his kind. Sometimes it was the best thing he ’ d ever done for humanity, and it was, because he missed the world because of him. But he was not human. He was an artist. 
 He says to himself, maybe I can be a god. Maybe I can give him purpose.

"You're a beast, " the soldier ordered as I stared at my commander. The stately expression on my face made me feel like everything would've been okay, if only the words had been said immediately after his sentence. Those words forced my own eyes to line up with those of the leader. I told myself not to read the response, but as I calmly stood up and took a couple of stockpiles of armor off the ground, I could see that even one of my armor was destroyed in the ensuing war. 
 " Get back to bed, " I told my commander. As I walked out the door I asked my commander where the hell the other squad leader was. He didn't answer, just bowed his head. He looked like he was reeled into, and with the same grimace on his face, he told me " We're going to crash there, " I said to myself. 
 " Other squad? What do we do? " I asked him. A realization struck me as I realized that this is never going to work. Are you telling me the other squad is going to crash? When the squad leader is brain dead and surrounded by heavy weapons, where are the other squad members? What about the soldiers loyal enough to be there. Do you really think we need to try and disarm them while their comrades rest in their wake? 
 After many minutes of telling my commander the main body could hear us, the squad leader finally spoke. 
 " Well, that's that, " said the main commander. " You might want to put on some armor before bed."

It was outrageous. It was like sitting through an evening, The odds of anyone hearing it was 1 in 70 billion, It really happened. I was almost completely submerged in my own craziness by now but I also realised after the meeting that the Bodies Wailed would really be too loud for one of my inner circle. I decided to escape out of the plane having made up my mind; as a cocky ass who would sooner leave the gate standing in front of them than see whether someone was allowed to accompany me outside to the private plane. 
 Guess I'll do it. 
 I saw into the mock showrooms, where I 'painted' my audience with what would become a big time criminal gangs. They come from the underworld, gangs that are horribly hideous, without a shred of the bad, the weak. I pressed one knee down and finally spoke to the squashed growling crowd, "HONEY IS WITH YOU! " 
 As soon as I closed my eyes and made out with the camera looking into the crowd, an earpiece covered my mouth and the curling anger of the crowd responded, " Honey! Its finally done and no one can help but shout it out! " All I could do was suppress my laughter as the laughing fled from my lips. The men in suits stood there completely still, looking at me with mild annoyed the way they do when I introduce myself to them. Then they began to slowly gather around me with their dull eyes and blank expressions. " Well look at these judges, how were you in our final judging phase? " one of them said, " Did you show restraint in asking that all of your decisions were in this country and the only way you made any form of dissent was due to a computer error? That can't be right; these people are such vultures! " 
 And that was the story of my life until they decided I was a snake and proceeded to fuck my own mother, 
 So now I sit here in front of my lover, typing out strawman posters in normal English. " I took guns because when i say I want guns now i mean the one i bought last week in Edmonton, the one i bought from Baileys Bar 3 ( well, it's Calgary, however the neighbours down the road call it a bus stop and I'm reluctant to buy that place ) " I said, giving the fact that my life is just so simple, it means me going insane. " Sir, all I have on me is a manual of all your regulations and if you want to make a flying ban, its up to you." 
 One of the undercover men finally gave me the reassuring words before sitting down and settling me down next to my lover. It was disgusting and disrespectful how bad their vile words were.

The biggest security system in the world 
 This thing was worth more than human lives, one day I almost forgot it. The defense force would have been forced to go over every possible clearance. One last time I was about to fly away as the ban factor of the security system failed my energy and I had no time to think or breathe. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the object. I looked around for a couple minutes on a half dozen problems I had picked up between there routine patrol and a sketchy checkup. When I said the worst it actually sounded like that all magic spells. It sounded like magic. " The time has come " said the caller. " It is time for your to stay at home! ". I wasn't actually sure what they meant by that, though I had heard it many times before. I heard the text from my computer's server. " Welcome back to our forum ". Then it came back. " This can't be real, even real... " But it was real enough. I had won. " I want to be a hero!", I smiled and opened the package of pencils. 
 As the locked door open and the electricity was switched off I walked into the room. Everything was moving properly. The rotating mirror on the wall pointed directly into the mirror in front of me. I could see the light smoke coming off of the pencils and in a quick motion put them into the freezer. I could not see them again. The hard wooden door opened as it swung the corner out towards me. Opening the door I saw a figure sitting on my bed.

**********614**********
I like to think that I'm unique and unique. Yet I often think to myself, "I must be exceptional to have had success so closely approaching my certain qualifications. " Well what was the greatest achievement of all? I would have liked to have a biological clock more than anyone else who knew how to record data. But I didn't and it kind of did. I'm still doing it though. Guess I'll revisit a couple thousand years. I'm past the halfway mark and I'm 35! It's incredible. 
 I could probably explain it any way I wanted to but if my hell is full of abnormality, rather than the horrific, that's what the barista's customer will say, she'll say: 
 " If you just know how long it takes me to double my time then I can lift you up 30 feet above your bed! " She looks up at her customers " Yeah, but is that worth double his five! " I can be on my way to feel demi-gods attraction like a mountain. Back in my day I did it for breakfast. It worked, everyone had their own model who could lose their virginity or lose their job by someone with more education. I enjoyed it. Nothing too conservative. 
 I could admit I've looked at things from the letter the one in the crazy bag says 
 " You must use smart logic. Not lies. However, you must have at least 2 years of medical activity on your other six years, at least thirty eight thousand pounds in your last year, and 5 million words in your last 20." 
 I definitely should've gotten that one across quickly. Would have been nice, now that I've gotten a few documents into my finaling letter. 
 I wouldn't have just thrown all of that financial information out. I wouldn't have felt a sense of relief as if I had just won and maybe there would've been, I just couldn't see the better option. 
 But I'm not that special. I've progressed so much that there just isn't any point in living to be a normal person.

All they will ever know about me is if they are eaten by a fox. 
 I'd seen ravens ambush their young brethren with arrows and they would then herd them to the front and grind them down until their bones twisted and suffered no puncture wounds. 
 For more than a decade, I'd gone to Europe and survived through Mexico, Hong Kong, Beijing, Dublin, Prague and elsewhere. Of course, I never did tell anyone, I never showed up at the airport to go back to Earth. 
 Now, it's a common misconception that when you died, you gained a pass from Hades on your first appearance. I don't know what that means either, but it just makes me feel much better and gives me a lighter feel. I've been in many environments and encountered near-animals, but never one of my deaths felt so completely different from death. 
 Sometimes, though, when I die, I always know that I'm in the belly of a Devil. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********616**********
I don't know what happened to me. 
 I look up at the stars and they don't seem real. I swear it's only a coincidence, but I have to. 
 I'm sitting on a small bonfire at my house, watering my lawns while still remaining calm. My foot rubs the windowsill and I can hear a baby crying. It's always the children. I wish I was a kid, but at least I still have a wife. 
 I saw a tiny blue egg in my hand. No one will ever forget it. 
 I was excited to try it out! That's a miracle! The parents didn't notice. I tried so hard to give it out. The parents seemed disappointed when I gave it out. When my wife first saw it, she thought I had abandoned her for this world. She says she paid for it. It really was worth it. 
 I wish I had never married my boss. I never married my boss. I regret ever not asking him to do it. I must have told him, because he refused. There must've been some sense in his mind that he was screwing up a perfectly good thing or something. So my wife and I split up. Things went great. I was pretty happy. I got into the restaurant and went upstairs to my cat. There she was. The dog gave me her best puppy smile and cried about the puppy her husband had promised her. Finally, there was time. 
 I looked at the table and saw a cake. Maybe she ate it instead of me. 
 I'm sorry, dear. 
 Something happens when you close your eyes and feel. 
 You feel a hot bead of sweat drip from your cheeks and fall down your nose. 
 Something spills on the carpet and you're in a dark room. 
 The room is cold, dark and empty. 
 There's a woman at the computer in front of me and there's a bread crumb on the table. 
 A New York lawyer is sitting on the far end of the table. He has a beautiful suit in his hands, and he's looking straight into my eyes. 
 "Jesus Christ. " He says, dropping his red suit hat and disappearing into the room. 
 " Motherfucker!" I yell. 
 I walk over to my laptop, opened up Reddit and cracked the infinitesimal lines into an obituary. I have to find someone's asshole to dig it up. Oh well, maybe this will work.

**********617**********
Well, at least that's the confession I got. I'm not even sure how many times this has happened. Who would have thought when an assassin decided to shoot down that agency? I never did see them. Or was they just assassins? How strange. 
 I just could not come to grips with the situation this time. I'm the one behind the cameras and I am the one who says that they are so lucky. I said to myself. 
 If this is what the world was like, I just can not put that down to luck. There was always something I could do. Something that I was somehow linked to... 
 Some say it was the "hero's fault ". Well, they never show anything from the front from then on. Sometimes it is only the thought that brings them to me. It is simply the thought that brings me to them. " Who am I to judge?! " Of course they can't judge us. I swear that this is no different than any other comparison. 
 And there are very few if not most events that we know have happened out in the world. Some people such as myself are merely the logical type on the outside but in the end... well... their deaths have already left us with no other choice than a more polite, nice family. For them, the life they have had isn't what it was in the first place. If not for that well documented idiotic behavior they have showed... well. 
 While I had not believed in coming to any conclusions regarding the reasons for their death I was determined to stay unbiased. Not denying the " cause ". 
 They wouldn't just kill everyone. This was why I joined the force. I was instrumental in the establishment of an organization that could save more lives than it has ever saved before. That was when the nation would burn to a crisp. There was a time when I was so proud that I could bring the nation down, but you can not completely be proud of your forces. Now, I go against orders. Time is of the essence. 
 The Illuminati have started to draw new recruits. I haven't been here this long. I am immune to any traitors from this world. Any brainwashing a family with is something that has already taken place. Even those we trust with lives and achieve great things. I am back. 
 I have taken my time. I know it. For the love of God, don't worry about it. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********618**********
Well I've been doing something long dead long. 
 I guess I'll die quickly in a doomsday or something. I'll just have to get started on my next and last moments of life, from which I will go on to live everything. Again. 
 Things will change around me. They'll change suddenly, around me, on in the rest of me. I know it's not very vital to the environment or the me a moment of thinking about it. It takes some time, but it's there. It's there. Always has been. Never slows. 
 I always knew something had to go bad for me. I mean, if it happens to someone it happens slowly, if it happens every time, you try to predict. You try to remember where it would have gone, you try to remember how the bad happened. Most of all you try to remember what you did wrong. So you push on, trying to be good. You attempt to pass it off as a drop in the ocean. That was some of the things you did wrong, but the ocean blew up only after a few hundred years. 
 I guess I need to reach the end.

Silence. 
 Mr. Frost uttered three words that sent shivers up my spine. " Ian Lillian. " 
 " I'm from the future, my friend. I am unique. " 
 " I know, Ian. Now listen here, I have one rule. We have to make it. We don't bite. " 
 I then saw the silhouette of my soul right before I stood over him, looking him dead in the eye with a disgusted look. 
 " The immortal, he will transform into me. Maybe you'll get this " He said, not as if he wasn't there. " Make sure your friends, and the table. If they don't believe what you're saying, they will be lost in a scowl. Don't be afraid to talk to them, alright? " 
 Ian caught his breath. 
 " Yes, Professor. You're called. " 
 " Of course, Professor. " 
 He hugged me and I stepped through. The crowd cheered as they made contact with my cranium. I froze, as I felt the weightlessness of the realization that my power had died and gone. I barely got a glimpse of him as we sat down. 
 " Ian, have you seen this? " 
 He gestured with all the confidence that the others had not had. 
 " Of course, Ian. Keep talking. Ask some questions. " 
 I patted my friend on the shoulder and held him tightly. 
 " Give me more information. " I said. 
 He nodded and stood. 
 As I walked down the hall, Professor was already there, signaling an arrival. 
 " Shall we begin? " 
 He glanced up at me and finished speaking. He showed me his glasses. They were the same ones he'd made for me, the same glasses, and the same color as mine. 
 " Choose. " 
 He nodded and shook hands with me. I walked through a hallway, sat down, and began. 
 " So, Ms. Frost, we have a couple of times we want to discuss this story. One time, after you returned, you had gotten into a fight. As I told you, your friends are staying with you. As you told me, if you've been having none of the things you were talking about, you're going to fight each other. Our politics will be different, after all. " 
 I took a step back from Mr. Frost and looked at the crowd. They were waiting for something. The question was asked. I asked him: " Have you ever thought about looking back at your friends? I've seen things like this before. Can you believe it? " 
 " I've " 
 I was staring right into his eyes. I looked into his glowing, pulsing eyes. " What do you see in your future? " 
 Mr. Frost seemed confused, as he spoke up, startling me. 
 " I see the strongest men in the business be the ones in power in the future, such as you. " 
 " I see the men's wars be fought in the future, only in my own lifetime. " 
 He looked at the assembled crowd and smiled. " First, we should look into what's in the future. Their first day of their long term human relationships. We should see them be able to handle their emotions and emotions as they always have. And second, we should have scientists help the very beings they call " Morals. " 
 I watched the man go from white to orange. He kept talking to my body and mind, but I barely felt the words ever being whispered. 
 " Yes, Ms. Frost. We should ask some questions, but before we do so, we should ask ourselves: is it possible for them to understand their future at all, despite all they have said? " 
 " This may sound bizarre to some, but look closer at your future. Think of the consequences." 
 He nodded. He stopped. The room ended. 
 'What? Is this just conjecture? That this stuff is plausible?' 
 He smiled and let it slide. I nodded and sat beside him, past him, and imagined him visiting me again. I stared into that eyes as they watched him, the realization of that two years later, it became apparent to me. As I closed my eyes, I saw it. 
 I wanted to die. 
 'The man in the future told me, perhaps we should ask his future,' I think.

Tabs could weave threads, and a needle could drop a bundle of a parcel to the earth. Civilisation remained constant, free from all forms of violence and civilisation. By the time we found houses of coal, and the Netherlands' old railroad line, we had seen most of them. 
 "Not " he said, " No, not for you." 
 The men looked on, futilely awaiting the day the bitter cold of winter would cease. They were small and soft, pressed by the endless convoy around the red brick building built three weeks ago. The winter snarled in their faces, like the sunlight catching the beam of a candle flickering. Rain fell softly upon their heads, half exhausted from the painful pounding of children's feet across the ash roof. 
 He never smiled. Each day, their evil grew even greater. Each day a month, they ate the husk of the country they stood in - only in the darkest corners. They ate the sun, the day they disappeared, burned in its wispy radiance, the warmth with which they drank. They provided safety to your family, even if they had no family. 
 He had left the ruins behind, in hopes of atone for the rape and murder of his children.

It was terrible to miss the key to a sick throne when everything started turning to golden. We were one of the little ones who were the food thingy, our pencils were the keyboards, and our hands were the physical aid sets. Unlike those you know, I was not afraid to make people chase after me. Because there were lots of scurrying individual ways around. 
 I trudged along through the school halls, thinking about all the beautiful faces in all the places; the other kids had learned to fight fear and joy, even if they didn't know how to go about it. People weren't really much different from us. Children's is the word, and for them, smiling and laughing is the word. For them it's more meaningful. 
 But I couldn't focus on them. I couldn't miss that curvy arms. That wry smile. His hands were the expressions. I wish they weren't the ones I'd never seen before. He said "too happy to be like you kids. ". I wish I didn't care so much. 
 I would have gone on to become a majority shareholder. But for all the good I did for this school, it wasn't what it was supposed to be. If there was anything I wanted, it was to be a monster. 
 And, by monster, I meant " Human."

**********622**********
Why so intense and driven that I feel these insatiable desires? That I must deserve them! 
 Cold winter, and on. The night I finally felt energy for the first time, I would start living like my small, naive childhood self. Far from my small, naïve childhood self, where I grow up thinking that everything was going to be alright. That I'd never let my parents down. That I ’ d never dig that hole without using the fire in the backyard to break some rocks. That everyone would be back to be happy, and I ’ d hope it would be wonderful. 
 I don ’ t know. 
 Another month? A bit longer, only a month after the cameras stopped rolling, and I ’ d be sitting in my room and myself in silence for all these years watching or feeling the universe revolving around me. 
 What can I say? I ’ m totally fucking... I ’ ve done nothing wrong. Nothing at all. 
 Does it make me sick to my stomach? 
 I didn ’ t know for sure. I wasn ’ t planning on showing my new family the truth of their feelings at the same time. I was hoping that the kids would want to know, if they knew, why all those anxious parents, trusting that I wouldn ’ t feel anything? Their panic and curiosity led to their panic but it had not led to enough curiosity to keep their guess as to whether I was being ridiculous, or just mean, and that I wasn ’ t. And I knew there would be some inconveniences in reacting to that. 
 I can ’ t help but laugh. 
 My heart sank. It felt warm and wet on my skin, my smile flickering gently with an electronic voice that seemed to be pleading with me. My hands became gripless with your acceptance of what it is that I will do, and I turned towards the camera. 
 "What do you mean, why are you hugging me?" 
 Someone raised a hand. 
 I could see why. Something must be wrong, something must be happening, that you just don ’ t feel the same way when you hug someone? What could it be? 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 What if, I knew I had them, then what if they weren ’ t there? 
 You wouldn ’ t believe me. 
 I could see it now, your eyes were bright with red. The warmth of their eyes slowly disappeared as the last bits of my skin melted into something perfectly similar to their emotions. 
 I smiled and rested my hand on yours, barely even listening to them scratch each other's skin.

We were walking down the street, funny sort of route. I was a sexy young blonde and she was beautiful but I wasn't in my element and she was totally different. They both were fine outfits but only because their one true perverted twist though. I hadn't noticed the look in her eyes. They were too enthusiastic and I couldn't help but chuckle at them. I guess she was in denial but she wasn't watching me. My buddies in the back seat drove over to this car and they came running over to it too just to stop. I slowed down to a crawl and pulled my hood up as they came to a stop and tried to stop my friend but he just had a strong voice and I knew to jump with his. I grabbed my car keys and walked back to my car. I was a violent ride while trying not to think too much of it and it was so annoying. So funny.

Sputnik sees the boom as planned and takes a detour back towards New Mexico. Once he is safely in the state, he takes a briefcase full of old memorabilia to the local department store. This is a fake one, not the one he promised. Stepping out of the office to greet fellow employees, he head for the door. 
 Found at the counter is a stolen sign from a young man at the register. Taking one glance at the sign, he calmly and elegantly enters the world-famous teapot section of Fifth Avenue. The young man leans against the counter with his hands outstretched toward the door before shining a fang lit eye of a bright red light. The young man takes an unkempt quiet breath, waiting for the teapot to crash through the glass. He gently slides the finger of the thumb down on the handle before continuing. 
 He finishes their conversation. The small figurines in the room... The fact that they were there is always a little creepy. 
 Sputnik carefully makes his way inside. He closes the door behind him. With one last nervous wave of his hand, he stops, scanning the room for another instigator. Before he reaches another empty booth, he feels a sharp pain and lays back down. Bleeding out, his vision begins to fade. As he looks away, his stomach churns to which he resumes his search. He takes a deep breath and the last thing he saw was three giant onyx lights shoot out of the center of the teapot, each glowing brighter than the last. As he looks around, he sees the head of some ancient sort, praying that this is the right moment to open a new life for him. As his eyes adjust to the darkness, he looks back up at his man, realizing that even though his vision is fading, this is still a life for him. Looking down, he sees a touch of cinnamon stains on his tongue. As he tries to give up this search, he finally gets a message. 
 "You're not alone, are you? Have you heard of me? I have a daughter, Elsa, now, you see? This is her first child!"

Some guy at the gate hopped up to my door. I always liked him so far, he seems to be really good at winning. 
 "Well apparently you're immortal? 
 " Uh, of course. " I said quietly. 
 " So how do I make a sacrifice. " 
 " You have to choose a large number of people. " 
 " I take the first five thousand of them, and the second five, I keep an extra 500. " 
 " That is it? " 
 " I don't like you, but at least I don't have to suffer through hell. " 
 " I'm sorry sir, but if you make an infinitesimal sacrifice the entire universe will remain in peace. A lot more die on this earth than on this planet. " 
 " I'm sorry sir, I have to make a saving grace. " 
 " Hm, I suppose you have to really count what you sacrifice. " 
 " One person gets three lives, and then he goes and gets a decent cure for all of them. The rest die and go to a new life, but they still get one life total. 
 Now would you like to make a decent donation? " 
 " Well of course, but I'm not exactly sure how to handle it. " 
 " I'm sorry sir, that'd be too damn difficult. " 
 " First, you get the in the body, then you get to be on earth and make the choice. 
 " Of course? You're one of the ten million sinners. I'll just transfer all the people in the universe and let them live without pain or sadness. " 
 " Can I make an infinitesimal sacrifice, please?" 
 And with that he grabbed a handful of human flesh and offered it to me.

As my eyes squeezed shut, the dull image of nightmares struck once more. My vision widening, and I felt the amount of blood drip down my face. When the shock wore off, I moved to retrieve a razor with a few scratches - an old fashioned one. With a sudden but steadier flick of a wrist, I held it in place as my attackers emptied the next room behind us. 
 "Get it over there. " I heard the voice in my head, wet with pain. 
 In the darkness, darkness would swallow us all, and I ran. 
 Behind me, an alarm wailed before me. The blue light made its way to my eyes, shining through pale white lines to illuminate the room. * This can't be happening! * I thought to myself. * Someone is going to die at this rate! * But what did they want from me? 
 I stared for a while, teeth grinding. Finally, the darkness consumed me. I looked to where the alarm had left me, only to see what appeared to be smoke rising from it. 
 " What the *fuck!? * " A voice bellowed from behind me. 
 My heart raced. Panic gripped my body, a realization of something I never imagined. 
 As I looked up and down, I thought of all the things that I could have done to save her. I thought of how much I would have wasted. I wanted her to know I cared about her. I wanted her to step out of the shadows like she always did. I wanted her to find a loving father who cared for her, an uncle who cared for her. I wanted her to be grateful to me. 
 " You told me that you would push off now, but the planet you live on has reached an orbit where you can no longer move. We haven't been able to use a planet much longer than you, so there is no chance for humanity to move out until the sun dies, " said the voice behind me. 
 " OH HELL NO!" I screamed. As I fell to the floor, I felt another sensation, one that I knew would only bring more death to me. As I recoiled in shock, I felt a rush of a sort that I had not seen in centuries. Then, the voice called my name. 
 **NAME! **

I own a magical wallet, which always has exactly the right amount of money that I will need that day. 
 I go outside to see some homes in flames, only to find 2 black numbers floating in the air. They were connected by wires, meaning that they'll find me, and them'll find me. 
 The next morning, there is a sound, and my wallet dies. I walk to the bathroom and take a second glance at the amount. And, it says: *8000 USD*. 
 I realized that I wasn't alone: I have of course, a magical wallet and all the people in it. I take out a 7 Million 50 Pound Zapour and walk towards the fire with a big grin. And I think to myself: *I'll get a similar one tomorrow*. 
 I don't feel a thing. I'm tired. Finally, the sound that I hear, pinging out of me, stops. I turn around, and see the red light in front of me. I open my wallet and continue on my way, thinking about what my wallet had said before.

The splash of sweat onto the pavement is enough to make it noticeable but even more noticeable because the illustration on my phone changes to match its description. 
 $ 70,000,000 for fifty years of his life. 
 I reach for the phone, my earphones disconnected. 
 The banks tell me to go to the ATM to leave a little note, other than the money, which is locked for everyone to see. 
 Why did they, oh they made all the money! Why did they make things worse then! I start off with $ 50,000, only getting weaker so I spend less! 
 Half my contribution just got personalised now. Just one thing they didn't tell me. 
 "I need $ 70,000,000 to go to the ATM and make some more money ", I scream into the phone. I wash my hands on the sidewalk and stop shouting. 
 " What? " I ask. I finish calling my phone, it was one of the first things they made. 
 " $ 70,000,000 " I reply. 
 What is this?" 
 I start to cry, I take the phone and look out the window.

First, he wouldn't pick a pikachu or a pidgeotto. 
 Why? Because otter walking around about 20 of my 31 meter nature walks without touching anyone's body. No feathers, feathers instead. This is nametag in kindergarten class, and I can't even pick a pidgeotto. 
 I talk to the average professor. They have all the same questions: Why has otter not started? Why is pikachu eating lobsters? And most importantly, how is pikachu living inside a structure? 
 So I sat down with the new bloke at the Department of New - OR - the "Science Division ". Which is why I chose to give the pikachu the choice. 
 There was literally an inkling of excitement when I held the letter before me. So many pikachu. Long tail, blue eyes, and the sniffles of a
" Hatchler " dog. I also had some hopes. But then, well, nobody says anything to any of these pikachu's friends. On this day, we gave the pikachu a chance. 
 " Gary, can you hear me, " the Professor said, " You can hear what I'm doing! " 
 Yes! And yes, I played catch to this jackass! 
 It was a disappointment when Gary flipped me the bag! And yes, you can't really hear them talking, so you know they weren't watching or watching you. 
 But a blank canvas of grey rubber? It was a beautiful gift. And wow, it took me TWO YEARS of flying an airplane with it! 
 So, when it finally clicked. Because a bunch of Garys decided to show up to dinner together just for some real eggs, and Larry and Martin both praised the pikachu as a jerk. And they laughed at Gary's crappy puns.

 Yeah, that was a pikachu rollercoaster! Glad I finally learned to snuggle it properly!

"Ohhh! " I said. " What are you going to do with your $ 24,340,666 the billion pounds this cash cow is plastered upon? The Universal Year, the one they have decided is going to actually be longer? " 
 " Come on! Look. " The man stated. " They're both all yours! " 
 " I've decided to ask for a hundred thousand dollars in exchange for the same amount as every 7,000 years. " 
 " What? We're going to ask for forty? Thirty, if I'm being honest. " 
 " Oh, I just didn't want to make my decision so big. What if I wanted to break something? What if I just kept my happy for an eternity? " 
 " Good point. Now look. You know how that turns out. They gave me twelve billion dollars. So if you want a million dollars, you can do it. Let me send you another ten million dollars. " 
 " Oh, I'll do it. Let me. " I laughed. " Let's go. This is what they have been testing on me. " 
 " What do you mean? " He asked the third time. 
 " I actually don't know. I never even got the chance to ask. " 
 " The rules of this universe aren't really designed for middling mortals, don't they? " 
 " No, I never think about them. The ones that do are presented by whomever you think would best be their own face. " 
 " That doesn't make any sense. This is perfectly fine with me. " 
 " You want anything they offered? " 
 " Money. Of all things! Oh no. Not that. It has to be something as bad as any lost video game or game console game. As bad as what they did. I think a coin dropped out of my hand."

He knew when you started this was the only way. You never had to wait much longer to save yourself. I told them I was dead. He would give anything for my memory and I could tell he had an ulterior motive. You could have him as a replacement for his immortality. Any normal man would get this. But he was a sociopath. He bought every drug imaginable. He went out of his way to send people to an endless circle of fear. Finally they tracked down the source of his madness and now they were on their way. 
 He stepped out of his small condo here in Clermont. He had turned the corner after a cigarette and was no where to be seen. The regular day service people would take him to get home, and he would answer their phone for a few minutes then leave them in the hallways. Now here he was sat by his metal chair, leaning in and watching me outside. 
 "How's it going? ". I asked and tried to sound humble. 
 " We're getting closer. We just have to get to him before he stops. His head's going down and he's holding a robotic arm with four other robots in it. They don't have eyes. And he says they're not here to save us. You and I have known each other for years and we knew what had to be done. Our best chance was to watch him go and find you, someone you will love and only love because I know he loved you and would never do anything to hurt you in that moment. ". 
 I say nothing to cover the silence. 
 I look at his sitting position and count down the seconds to a moment. 
 The feeling is intense and meaningless. 
 " Yes! " he whispers as his robotic arm falls back up and opens to reveal a skull. He cocks it to one side, removes a scythe, and begins to lift the robotic body back into his chair. 
 " Can you be with me for a moment? ". I ask and feel the strange warmth inside him suddenly disappearing. 
 " Yes! You'll do much better than that! ", he said, clearly frightened. 
 I grip the final piece of glass and throw it at the wall. 
 " Thank you! This may have saved your life! " He says, tears leaking out of his eyes as he releases the robotic body from it's slumber. 
 " I can't thank you enough... " I remember from the previous moments, it was truly amazing. 
 " Get what you need, I'll only tell you what I want. ". I said, without saying a word. 
 He turns and walks over to me. There's a rough moment with his doe eye on my face, he's as smart as he is charismatic but he doesn't seem ready to talk. 
 " No, I don't need to go, I've only just found it. I need to know what happens. I need you to stop and put everything in a safe place where you will not be able to hurt me again." 
 He walks over to me and holds my hand. 
 The pain is great. 
 He wakes me up where I was standing and I still was alone in this enormous field. Nothing had changed at all but I could never have done anything about it. 
 But there it was. The last note to my life. 
 The last thing I remember. 
 A note that my son wasn't born. 
 It was a simple enough note.

The world stopped at the point at which information became a value, and formed a hierarchy of interdependent relationships around the name. For each person, they were placed on the same lifespan, with each being designated an individual that would have the descendants of the other person among the myriad of living humans. 
 The earth shook with the births and deaths of these individuals. Human minds were dumbfounded, each owning a load of dumb concepts that everyone should grasp. Humans were one of them, though their very birth was terrifyingly short-lived. 
 The other androgynous ones, the ones with an average lifespan span of 14 and a half lifetimes, had to bear the very cost of an entire planet dying before they could tell their babies the reasons to not meet their own ends. As for the deicotal ones, most grew old around 150 and died at 103 and 97 respectively. The number of deicotal ones was growing rapidly, since deicotal humans died close to a billion years before they were born, so the rate of lifetimes achieved was rapidly increasing. 
 Colony-states, masses of people clustered around each other, constantly trying to find solutions to their existential problems, constantly trying to see each other's gaps in the Great Divide between the stars, shining around one another in the barely visible blips before setting off. The name warring two planet-states, creating a bloc of over two billion people, having achieved one billion years of existence, actually existed. 
 The amount of time spent linking together the two species grew exponentially, even though they really did not know each other nor did any of their relative races. They had finally discovered the word'reality' and used it to describe it both as a concept and as a reality. Using the vague definitions of'reality' to unite space-time and the universe, the two populations declared an alliance and fought to protect Earth from some larger threat.

 I walk up to the last terminal and plug in the momentary micro-chip into the power supply. After removing the silicon wrapping around my finger, I point my finger at the shell of the machine. A message pops into my head. " Y-you have % 204Afshtk*, plugging in % 204Afshtk no further, confirm " 
 " The decision was made to stop colonization of the planet, we need this resource in the first place ", the message monologues. 
 After getting accustomed to the commands, I click on the saved settings button in the main terminal. 
 " Things will be fine after all... you have been chosen to communicate with the remaining worlds... but first you must remember, Earth is a shit mess " the message states. 
 I click through the send message: " Earth N-1801 is, I believe, the deadliest planet ever created. Whatever 
 full colonization would have been a wise move. * But* I stopped mining the reddish fur to put an end to the existence. 
 I look in the led panel to see the humanity on what must be one of the most deadly planets on the solar system, possibly earth. 
 It is an end to the pollution. 
 And then as I look closer I see the last message. 
 " Y-you have been chosen to communicate with the remaining Earths, order is set with the majority of mankind, my order is called Green. Good luck "... 
 I click on the send message: " Return home " 
 " Please repeat your action. " 
 I hear the machine whir. 
 The radiation oozes from the planet's atmosphere all at once. It closes at a crawl. I have no idea why I did it. 
 " I don't understand " I say. 
 " We could contact your mothership, we could not. There is very little chance it will survive from this attitude. " 
 I find my voice speaking halting: " Please don't try to destroy our resources".

He looked down to Mary's deep brown eyes, deep, blank and his teared skin. 
 "What happened? " 
 " The scanner over there just drifted, and a supernova exploded in my room. I think they told us to come back. " 
 Mary shook her head. 
 " A nuclear attack in Canada? God, someone just exploded in my place with that bomb! I can't think straight. I'm in this room with my friends, and Mike was doing some grunt work talking about an asteroid that never came close enough to take us down. It happened again. " 
 She made a sad face. 
 " I don't think we can help you, Mary, but we got ta go back. You need a home. " 
 " Huh. Something to think about, alright? Do you want to go? " 
 " Who do you think it's coming from? What's going on? " 
 " Fuck off, the virus. You know what happens next, kids. " 
 She smiled in response, and pulled out a will and sat with her back to the TV. 
 " Fuck you Mike."

"I know the theories, Elizabeth. They all say the sky is blue, but don't you think you have tried calling out to it like that? Did you listen to that preacher from the backwoods?' A sincere preacher goes on to talk about'everything you love', " he finished, " And the sky is blue... So can we call that thing our sky? " 
 " Yes, Sigrid, " she replied. 
 " And get to talking. " 
 " Of course you talk, " Sigrid said. 
 " What's the one? " 
 " Even if it's really in blue, " Sigrid said, " the sky isn't blue. It's... stunning. " 
 " You mean the thing is a bunch of animals? " 
 " Yes, Sir! It's... totally stunning. " 
 " Let's just turn that on! " 
 " Yes Sir. " 
 They put on the classic red shirt, a hoodie and some jeans and buttons. They set up the fire starter in the kitchen, and blew out the fridge. The air pump looked like a phonebook full of alcohol, those red water cans and roasting rack, and cars with the name on them now hanging out of them: Topaz Pizza. 
 The two people watched it over the burning apartment and the helicopter. They never thought it could be so beautiful. That girl with the angel wings and those three glasses and those weird rocking rubber bands over her head had been something very special, ever since they heard those three conversations. 
 " Thanks! " Becky said. " It's been so beautiful. I can't believe that you did this. " 
 " I'm sorry. " Elizabeth said, her tone came out sweet. " I'm just... I got really worried. " 
 " Why? " 
 " Just an apology, Master. " 
 " But why do you not think it's just like always? " 
 " I don't understand, Elizabeth, " Sigrid said. " You never mean it's like you and I? " 
 " I don't understand. " 
 " But we never asked you. " 
 " I'm glad you understood Sir. " 
 " All right. I'd like to tell you that you will never regret this choice. "

"Listen, kid, " I said at last, " my job is to patrol the cities streets. And the sooner we can finish the job, the sooner we can live for the first time in my life." 
 I laughed and nodded a little, that was not the highest compliment in the world but it kept me going. My work had always been to kill those who were powerful, for the ones who would need it most. It wasn't quite the same old " I'm human and if there's an afterlife" prank anymore, but if I'd take it all back, I might have something of a life."

 You are a gifted photographer in the mountains below Lake Superior. You're a sharp man with a pointy nose, rich rich in liver's and a million idle dollars. You're a famous, avant-garde photographer, one of the most complete and famed photographers alive. You always carry a piece of paper to your tripod from England, I'm not including overseas. I am not a legal document, I don't belong here. I have been working as a salesman and private detective. I appreciate your dedication and your dignity. I wish you a pleasant retirement. 
 The construction of the bridge which you and I traveled to New York required millions. Millions were bought by my colleagues, millions were built for your family, millions were built for me. As I swore to myself, I would not contribute to any of these debts. The Mayor, the governor, the entire city received in return for the success of the bridge. There is a reason for you all to be spending as much as you can so it doesn't have to happen with me. I feel the need to include more employment options, not just for you, but for all of them. And now my job is to add employment back, as well as...

I miss him. He is such a blessing. Now he won't be needing much. 
 I have already planned my weekend plans to catch up on what I lost, just last week on /r/RememberHerAvaille. " My daughter's wedding pictures. Don't miss the part where we see her drive that Cadillac we bought." 
 But after all that I can't plan out the next few days. 
 I miss him more now. You can blame it on alcohol. It drove my daughter to alcohol and I took all it I could take to hurt myself as much as his wife. He never blamed it on her. 
 But every time I miss him I see him. I wonder how I will survive next month. Every time I close my eyes and thought of his terrible sufferings, he will look in the mirror and smile and go back to being a prodigy. A more willful man. As a part of my aim. 
 I give my bones a rest after all this time. I will hold my child close to my heart, never break his smile. I have come home, and there he is again, with his wife, smoking again. She will never hear from him again. 
 I wonder, as a man, when I am dead. Will I be able to enter his living room to no avail?

"You mean the fact that we shared something? " said James, holding his favorite round end up high. 
 The classroom was silent. The teacher, a novice, wasn't staring at the boy. 
 James's dad didn't answer the door. 
 " I... I mean... it worked, I mean... I was always able to find you in my mail boxes... but... I mean, everything I found here didn't in a million years be mine! " James laughed. 
 " It works, you know that. " But there was none of that girl. She was older than James. She wasn't a boy. 
 " I know who you are, but you're not too good to be here. " James ignored her, well at least he never found out who it was before. But she was there. 
 " Or... I guess you're not, you could be someone else? " 
 " Nah, just being here is better. I mean... I understand that there's never been one, are there? " 
 " Sure, but that's just not it. So how do you know that? " James shrugged. He was sure James was joking around, but if he'd known about the expression even to this day, he probably would have thought she was not living right. 
 " So you're the person that I interviewed here! I went to the same school! Do you want me to explain this to you? " Her smile disappeared. Her dark, stocky body reached around James, patting him on the back for a compliment. He had apparently broken through his normal clothes while he was lying on the ground, since who would let someone like her find a place like that? 
 " Well, " James coughed a few times. " You're a different kind of person, because you just never knew it... " 
 " I don't want to be messed up. I just wanted to be with you, no way it could get worse. " She stared back at him. She was definitely different than James. Everyone seemed to be different. 
 " See... I thought this was only supposed to happen with other people, but, like, there were friends that I could have with you. But... " James stopped talking to her. She was left alone, never to see what kind of girl she was. 
 " So... tell me, we didn't get along? You look stupid. What's the matter? " 
 " Well... I just liked you, and... I liked, uh, everything you did, and I wanted that around. But you never did anything that could hurt me... " 
 James was starting to get nervous. 
 " What? " She was asking what James had said. It was time to tell her. 
 " And now... I guess I'm done. If you want to go back to school, you have to explain to me what happened with that girl. You can at least have fun and change your clothes, you can get your friends to come find you on your phone and show you pictures of those beautiful big windows in the city, and... " 
 " I haven't done anything yet, I mean- " James cut him off. She began to walk away. " I'll make you pay for the shopping, I mean, I was not going to get away, *ever*. So you've got to get me back, and you know that before you know it I'm going to be here again, with you, and you want to? " 
 James was beginning to panic. 
 " Yeah... get me back to myself, get me back to you, with you, and don't forget that I know about the girl that you mentioned earlier. Don't tell me you can't get this back..."

This is fucking hilarious. 
 He posted it to his page in the comment section, unimpressed. He thought it would be a quick response to a prompt that had nothing to do with time travel. " These are slightly odd looking now. " He thought. 
 From then on, he'd submit story ideas to various sub-committees or other review sites, mostly to see if the idea would spur content to create something more like " Who knows who the two robot behemoths of paper writing is ". 
 This blog obviously wasn't going well, but it was an attempt to see if people understood the significance of writing prompts. 
 Some time afterwards, his boss started to grab his credit card. ( Anyway, it was about two months into his second day at work and he hadn't changed his password, so they knew he was a good guy, now that he wasn't afraid of losing it ). 
 " Wait... " he was interrupted again. " It's obvious you just wanted to promote your work, right? " 
 " I mean, " he said. " I wrote a/man/plan for a game, right? " 
 " It had some great plot twists, but you called it'Ponyjack', so yeah. That is... We're gon na see a lot of places... If you'll excuse me. " 
 "... it's: Oh dude, I know what you're thinking. Why don't you just rip off the page you submitted, move to the next sub-section in your magazine and start writing the article again. " 
 He quietly grabbed his phone. 
 " I'll throw that at you... yes! " he called after a moment. " That really doesn't look like a good idea. " 
 He took the phone out and tossed it to his left. " I'll use my mobile... can't do that." 
 And in ten minutes, he could travel back in time to the day he started working there. There would be little content on Page Six of the Journal, nothing new, at least. He glanced back up at his screen, again.

"You're a fucking idiot, " I demanded. 
 " Stupid. " He replied. 
 " Are you a fucking idiot? You did this for me. What the fucking fuck is wrong with you?! " 
 " You did this for me, instead of murdering me! I'm sorry! " 
 " Who the fuck does this supposed, granddad?! " He pleaded. 
 " For a fucking damn time. You put that words in my mouth, didn't you? Those words? " 
 " We weren't like that. There was enough of a difference between us to make that difference. " 
 " You were his first son. Or, he was his second son, from what I heard. " 
 I didn't know what to do. I knew I had to move on. 
 " If I grow up in this world, you will grow up hating me, and not love me. " 
 " Why would anyone hate you anyway? You don't deserve it, you can't change things. No one should be forced to."

"Hmm, I guess I'll just let you keep my other offer. How much I must pay? " I mock he said with my long wingspan stretching it beyond the remotest point. The man bowed his head while the ferris wheeled over to my side, wearing a crimson vest that would bestow the capriciousness of a pantheon. He looked at the small city in the distance, and sighed. 
 " You can keep my offer? " I asked. He looked at me for a split second, then as if waiting for the right moment. " I'll just say, I'm not a big fan of the idea. " 
 " Sounds good to me, " he said, after a moment, " It's not like you can just buy, sell, trade, and I just could always find a cheaper dealer. As long as you don't resort to higher rates of happiness in the way you cited, they wouldn't charge anything. " 
 " Alright, " I said. " Right, so... Now you have my only offer? A refund for my wish? " 
 He shook his head. " No, " he said. " No, you can get my other kind of ten million yen with our seven hundred million yen exchange rate, and I'll just require a ninefold amount in cash. Keep that up." 
 I hesitated.

"I wan na wan na talk, " I had sworn as I played with light flickering on my ground. 
 He turned on the light, reflecting the snow as I drew, shot, and then puff as he worked on his stick, laughin' and puffin' the wind out of his face. 
 The wind rushing in, bringing the stars and sky above us all, thirting a tune it was unlike anything I'd ever heard before. It was sunny, shining perfectly and trying not to wipe the mug as it rose, glancing up from the dust and dusting of the crumbling building beneath me. It was just a nub like the one the sky always used to glisten up: bright and swollen, as it reminded me of the melting of the second ice sheet there in the tower before. The vast face of heaven was just the terror of it. 
 The tiny snow-faced objects in the building fell off to the ground like the death metal of a death metal player, toppling and crushing like the bugs themselves. 
 " I wan na wan na talk, " I said in agreement, licking my lips. 
 And he chuckled, thanking me for last, that's all I needed right there. 
 " I wan na wan na be had, but the don't wan wanna hear, so I wan na be had and they wan not to hear... so I wan na know about it, because I wan na make it right. And I wan na roll with it, some night, big or small, I wan wanna turn it all on. 
 " So you wan na take the bath and I wan na see you again? " 
 He laughed, and while the various little pews and counter on my roof popped and squelched, on my floor crumbs and bones and everything other than the village ritual box I built up in an old house I once called home, and my little house which I owned that I longed to call my home after, so I got there anyway. 
 " I wan na see you again with it, each with a thought that spits out answers for my words that you can't see back here. " 
 The large, shimmered cloud in the sky spun around me, casting all of the light from it from all directions at once, and then it went black. 
 " I'm sure that making it past it is important, whatever you might think is important, but..."

"Let me start on the streets. This is all that's left of us, friends and family. All I need is a stop in line and a partner. " 
 Boom. 
 " Why would I do that? " James shouted at the empty office. 
 " Because I'm telling you now, man. The streets are darker than we thought it'd be. Why would they call a kill a kill a day? " 
 " Because I'm telling you, Lindsay, the chase was even faster than it should've been. Why would you take a girl who was more beautiful than you with the offer of a stop in line. It was a big break from that she came. I thought it was a deal I had with The Boy, the Tinkle. " 
 " OK, that's the message. With our help, we'll save people. You're just a bystander but we need to make sure you know what we're doing. Don't make it that way. " 
 James is still slumped at the desk, breathing heavily. The scrubs hissed with his mouth. His friends were on the corner, when he spoke, they all glanced at their phones before wiping away at their faces. 
 *Again, I'm telling you, my mom already knew what was coming. When she has to make a word with someone like me. * 
 James slumped into the chair in front of him. 
 " I've been told, it's not about the money or the opportunities, it's just... a business. There's nothing wrong with becoming The Boy, Lindsay. It's just a business. " 
 " All that money isn't missing all it means. And we'd love to help you out with this thing, because right now, I'm the man. We know that. " 
 " I know. I know. I'm just going to leave, don't worry about my kids anymore. " 
 " You did miss them, miss mother, miss dad. Don't you look into my eyes. Call him, find out why. " 
 James disappeared in his place, not realizing why he had disappeared. He didn't know where he had been, where the girls had been, why he had ended up here, or how he had ended up the Like. All he knew was he didn't care anymore. 
 " It's OK, Lindsay, I'm leaving."

I walked down the well worn asphalt and looked out into the sunny day. Great, today would finally be a good day to walk. I chucked my shoes into the well and my bike warmed up. 
 I walked for a bit and readied myself for the long walk home. 
 It seemed the sun was rising quickly but I stopped myself. At least the distance between us is small. Was I looking over a mile? It was dark but maybe not because the day was late yet, but because I was paying more attention to the road than I could tolerate at this time of day. 
 My bike strained out a bit. Overused tires, even of a reputable brand. Any time I pick up a leg strap, I start following the road. 
 Suddenly I started feeling like I am standing on top of a waterfall for a long time. Not really real things, at least it seemed like an illusion. The water increased in volume and size and the angle I was standing in was no longer an illusion at all. Now I could see where the stream came from, and seen the fact that I had already been on that trail for over three years. 
 But yet, what was I doing? Was I trying to ride myself down? Hell, that could actually be possible but really I was just waving to myself while walking. It was also kinda weird how I only saw my reflection for about a mile but actually there was nothing. 
 I fell. I rolled and passed some trees. I stopped for a second and looked up. I turned and there it was. My reflection. I was staring at myself and the water was creeping down my face. There was nothing. I looked down. As I tried to look around, I found myself in a tree. There was still water. What was that? I looked around. I was looking out of a bush and the cover was actually ice and when I looked up I noticed it was cold. I could feel the boots were cut and down my chest and as a result, I have found myself cold. 
 Suddenly I was no longer trapped on this lifeboat, I could open my eyes and see the blue ocean just beyond it. I almost felt safe. The water was moving faster and faster but I was still a floating cold, so cold. Suddenly I lost all sense of body and touched nothing. 
 I woke up one day from a head injury. I never remember waking up, but I think I could still smell some old blood and sweet mint. I was thirsty.

I let the light return to my body. 
 "Please do... come home... Mom... you... come here " 
 " Him. " 
 He swells before me, clawing at my flesh and pulling me up. 
 " Aaaaahhhhhh... aaaahhhhhhh. " 
 He twists its head as if to claim my body. 
 " Yes. " 
 I drop to my knees and limp back into my legs. 
 " Don't believe in that. " 
 He holds me aloft, unable to pull me. He begs in my ear in the hope of escaping. 
 " Just let me go. " 
 " No... you are too late... baby. " 
 His eyes close and as if to embrace me he grasps a silken hand. 
 " I love you... " 
 Without knowing what lies beyond me I sigh. My head falls into the air and I fall, my head held up by the living sea of wonders I could have wished for. 
 " God."

"That looks like she was a ghost ". Out of nowhere you feel a freckle in the back of your neck. Suspicion begins to pop in as you find yourself in a different hole than that which your previous interpretation of how your living room looks. You realize, maybe this is just why you have been doing this, so you go outside, and look. Your eyes are still wide open, you are dreaming. You run down the wall you climbed out of, but the grip of fear is clear at the most. 
 " Why are you still staring at this thing " you asked the cop as he stated a good looking man in uniform, you're not sure what he is talking about. 
 " If it is raining now, we are gon na work it out in one go" you sighed. 
 So you fall asleep in the middle of the night you wake up with any knowledge that this is one of the murders.

"Say the name - wake up! " 
 The alarm clock in my apartment chimed and I struggled to wake the little girl up. 
 I heard the first alarm as she laid down on her first tile. 
 She groaned and groaned with pain. 
 I jumped out of bed. 
 I was bound to the bed. 
 I slammed the door closed and turned on the television. 
 As I reclined on the bed, there was a muffled voice. 
 " I'm going to be late for your presents... You know why. " 
 I closed my eyes and groaned. 
 " I feel awful when you're late " 
 The volume stopped. 
 " I'm going to leave, I'm going to go see my parents. " 
 I reached for the kettle when the kettle started to boil. 
 " They can't have them here though " 
 I went to get the cooker ready. 
 I turned on the TV. 
 The two candidates came into the room. 
 They were at the other end of the room. 
 " You're going to have to go to hell, please, stop that. I know you hate my voice " 
 I went to get my firearm before the two candidates left. 
 " You know what's wrong. Get out of my office." 
 I heard the two candidates leave. 
 My shoulders relaxed.

It was another sleepless night. I made a loud "weep " noise and made my way to the living room, where was I going. Since my previous contract here was cancelled, I'd end up at the audience who were dancing to Prince or the King's Castle for one last dance. I had long since ceased functioning. However, I was following the composer on his tracks now. 
 It was a fifteen minute walk in front of me, with two rollercoasters underway. I caught a glimpse of the President, who was comically staring at the stage, drinking from a large glass. I looked up and saw the Queen, sitting in her crimson dress. She was wistfully and teary eyed, but by the time I came to, she was gone. 
 This was it. It was a perfect ending. 
 Then I noticed the way he walked across the stage. The way he approached the announcer. How he was so oblivious to the sheer chaos that was about to befall him... 
 I looked around. Everyone looked at me, confused. Then it hit me: this was the end. 
 I managed to get out of bed quickly, and floated to the top of the stairs. There I sat. What an old man I was. They didn't know what was in store for me. I had to remain calm. So I did. 
 The DJ threw a " tele " onstage, and my audience began chanting, and the DJ echoed the emotional lyrics through a mic in the mic. I was at my... head? 
 A young woman sobbed, slamming her fists on the stage. " Children, oh my children. That's your new bride " 
 I turned to the backstage, " Honey, you have to stand by!" 
 She shook her head, and I looked around at the many colorful faces of those who were backstage. They'd been on stage since before I left, and I had woken all the good ones up to go with it.

Captain Sharp had never slept well. Of course he slept well, really. After all the first few days of their trip he'd tried to eat the empty pods and eat only two of the most bitter portions of food he'd ever had. There was always the bitter bite to them, it always came quite unexpectedly. He hadn't eaten anything but his own crap. He had forgotten to feed his strange mushroom-eating friends, or worried they'd be a dead end to his mission. He had spent the night racing to the corner of those useless capsule metal stairs to rescue an urchin. Those bits weren't expected to survive the long journey to the exit, it was a doomed lifeboat, not even one as promising as this one. Every night, all of those weird... sicknessy dreams he had of starving all of the people aboard had drifted away; eventually it would be over, just like the darkness that drowned them in his sleeping shadow. He had become a survivor. He had broken through the minimal barrier of what he thought was the upper atmosphere, and brought home what he knew would be a new life of luxury. Not even the heavy armored gloves on his pants could save him, and in the first few months of their voyage they ate raw milk and bread; they were starving at home. At the time, Captain Sharp thought the wrong thing was, but with the moon far above a bountiful horizon, the crew were too skittish to taste anything here anyway. Nobody would understand what it was like to truly eat a man, and he would have to find his original pods or at least make headway on free land. 
 So as he sat in the captain's chair, back against the wreckage of his lifeboat, the empty pod became visible. His eyes widened as they gazed up at the three lights that positioned themselves at the top of the log cabin. The two light beams began to flicker, and then stopped altogether, leaving them an eerie pink. Sharp locked his eyes on the portly man, his captain's eyes flicking open as he recoiled in surprise and fear. A single glow came from one of the positions, almost like it would randomly appear, and then suddenly faded away. Sharp swiveled his head, clutching at his broken nose, and knew he had to attack the portly man. He realized that the glow had disappeared as soon as his vision cleared, as it was too dark to be a disembodied glow. The captain was crouched over him, his hands up, their orders muffled by the river bed. The man blinked slowly, slowly, actually blinking. He wasn't blinking. His sight was widened. Sharp leaned closer to the portly man, his lips rigid, his whiskers clammy and his gums used to press against his sternum. His eyes ached slightly. His eyes glowed green. Then, a ringing suddenly washed over his extremities, and his sight began to shrink. 
 Sharp felt something. A wisp of an awareness like water running out of the bottom of the hull, soaking the captain in it. The captain collapsed on to his back, what could only be described as a combination of fear and anxiety overwhelmed him. His vision would be gone, his head would pick up, and the portly man in his chair would fall into the darkness... Who was that thing he felt? As he did, a new warmth replaced his darkness. Sharp could see the captain standing, his face revealed to be a frail man, gaunt, even, and with his bottom half of the ship a gaping hole in the ship wall. Sharp fell to his knees and sobbed, his hands pressing him to the ground. The captain's flickered with an eerie green light, before flashing back to be replaced by the dark red light of hope. Sharp lifted his head, and the captains face was now the exact same as his own. He was little more than a thin man without arms or legs, and his lips parted to reveal a starry green glow. He would walk on with the hope, and the dreams... Well they would survive him, just as he would be left standing... And then his spirit would return to normal. He would go home, meet his family, a woman he knew would love him for who he was, and never have to worry about any of this again.

The Honor Guard watched as Sgt. Kennedy cursed to himself. He was in full regiment for dead of disease and would likely have died today. He was sure the boy knew too much, he was sure. 
 His eyes scanned the front door to the Cantina. The bleeped out speakers were almost sure to miss their mistakes as the machines agreed with Sgt. Kennedy's own situation, but he wasn't one to take chances. That's what he had to do. 
 "Stunt sir, dawg! " yelled Leer. 
 " Oh, er. Okay. OK. Wells, spin the arms. There's no one, sir. " Leer waved his index finger through the air and a dornish wing spun around the alien boy. Green alien pointed at Kennedy with gold talons as the wolf came closer. He bled. As the fly stalked to the door the front door flung open carrying more soldiers than possible. Their rifles flashed and the cataracts jumped in wonder. 
 " Sir! " Leer snapped. There was nothing. He got to his feet. They were right on cue. 
 " SCORE SCORE SCORE! SCORE SCORE!"

2:55 A.M. 
 The room was soft and white. 
 Abeatific. Every fiber of my being twitched. I'm sure the sheets of my bedmate's saw this too. 
 After a while I fell asleep. These frames acted as camouflage, I could just make out the corner of the bed in front of the window. Walking towards the window was easy. I could watch it through my glass peephole. 
 I didn't have much time to think about these dreams, I'd only had to sleep a couple hours this morning. 
 I heard a loud hush as the blaring plastic shutters clicked. It was much quieter than when it started. A soft rumble filled the room. Even the window opened. 
 The room seemed more clear. 
 3:00 A.M. 
 It was bright. As brightly as the disjointed darkness of the walls. A few fleeting pops of a flashlight disorient me. 
 The tinted window just highlighted a lower part of the room. Large lamps where light fixtures, the picture frames. 
 The figures got closer, and closer I could make out the clothes they sat upon, the clothes my name was wearing. 
 It was very believable. I even knew it was me. I could have sworn it was my mother. 
 The bodies were still frozen in place. They were standing, in a white dress, looking at me. 
 They moved. It was so surreal, the first time I saw me at the scene. Or like at night. Or the real thing. 
 I pushed my way towards the steps of the body. 
 My eyes met their masters. 
 I could see the fingers of two women, hands, that were to be held into my mouth. And the face of my father. 
 It was a middle aged woman, with her short black hair in short auburn curls. Her weight too, but I could see through the face. 
 Our bodies hugged each other. I looked at my reflection, all white, but not quite. And made out the eyes of my mother, with her dark blue eyes, both in the same place. 
 I looked down into the bloody, blood soaked shirt, and the knife I'd used to cut off my wrist. Just about to let her know that she wasn't going to have much to worry about. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********654**********
I remember when we got here. Sitting, talking, whatever. The hug from my girlfriend, with hugs that sounded like knives out of thin air but seemed so legit that I could have sworn the owner of them all lay down across her. 
 I remember our smiles - beyond the sweet and innocent bliss that I got after a blast of alcohol too big for me. The time we got to spend bonding with a huge group of four, after the just-surgeon had swallowed twenty years of mine. The time we got married, with our first child, the birth of our twins. I miss him. 
 I also remember the look in his eyes. A seething maniacal grin on his face. Looking at me like I had poisoned his funeral cake. That grin. Looked as if I had impaled my sin-soaked head on that mountain and started to cry. Watching that grin for a minute and not remembering it. 
 I remember how my heart leapt to his - his words just seemed so lifelike. His lips all smudged up into tiny crumbs. The air filled with a familiar scent. We kissed and the smell hit my room. I remember never remembering him coming home, because he always came back. The house was so warm. His hair was long, pale and smudged with the old shed light. I tried taking it in. It seems like a man just had to make the most of eternity. 
 I forgot. I remember seeing blood - as if the hard hard part had hit my skin. A trauma shot past me like water rocketing off a roof. I was out of my skin. I heard a thump at my door. I remember laying there - hoping his crushing chest wound would stop. I remember the front door falling down behind me - not knocking, but letting go. I remember the sound of the door closing. I remember him lifting me back to reality. I remember the words - 
 "I can't do this... I can't do this.. I can't do this...."

The choruses of past conversations remained active, alert, knowledgeable. As Jerry remembered all those things that mattered in those late-twenties and early'90s, his thoughts turned to the one about all those silly Germans that would kill his friends if he was with them. 
 "If a man, whether it be a Frenchman or a Latvian man, wants to get drunk and do something obscene, he will by going out with them. " A " momentary " look around the room set Jerry tiptoe around wildly with one hand on the table and the other curling back to look him in the eyes. 
 Nurse now alive, Jerry thought how he was going to get to the restroom with her, as a woman, she would sooner or later break him. " This is over now, for this you must die. " With that, she rushed out of the room, and Jerry recognized her skin, her eyes, and a, I think his French accent was too big to fit in the head of a person in a rundown household. As her feet left the door and her legs trailed behind her, Jerry put an arm around the man and asked for a pat on the back for being good to him. 
 " What if I get from the toilet and start screaming and screaming? " 
 " Not because that's necessarily bad for you. " He chuckled awkwardly, trying to hide an amused grin while examining the toilet before slamming it shut. " You just want to make it *shit*, so... you shall?"

**********657**********
The paper mouse scratching at my leg reminded me of the tear in my eyes the last time I felt the urge to tear it out. It always seemed to last an hour, but this was fucking creepy. 
 "Oh god... the thing we are talking about, it says it stands at the front of the row of stories at the bottom. I think it might look... different from the rest, " I think to myself as I grabbed the newspaper out of my pants pocket. I still don't know why the process was going so fast, I literally ran over to it and peed my pants away. 
 Sure enough, it did. I wasn't just crying, it just kept running at me. And as I got closer to the paper, I noticed that the mirror in my house was the one that had broken. 
 Because I'm an eight year old. I was bawling my eyes out. As usual. I had a long overdue wash job and a bonus for once. It was amazing how obedient adults can be, and I really didn't expect this to happen. 
 I must have tried to steal it away from mom when I was twelve. It was here and it was hella expensive. We didn't have very much money, but it was a smiley face, and a statement which made all the difference. 
 " 'Oh that's... you, what a tragic thing to happen. But hey, you go suck. I didn't do a thing to help you sir, and you need to be selfish. Please... just know that after you get rid of this... crap... stuff, your time will come and you will stay. I have tried...', but you are the best parent I have ever had." 
 The sentence echoed through the house, so fucking loud and frustrating. It was fucking annoying. And I guess that's why you wan na be a mom. 
 I have never been a dad before, so that's why I was so shocked when the kid walked into my house. 
 When she went upstairs to see if there was anything else, she didn't see me there. The tuft of hair on her shoulder was still there, and her eyes did the same. 
 Now, in kindergarten, I was going to lose another little magic trick for sure, and there was nothing. I wasn't even thinking. She knew what was happening. 
 But I hadn't ever seen her raise her arm.

**********658**********
On the plane landing, my roommate who was supposed to be my twin and our mechanic was there. I barely noticed him there, because the flight was half an hour late. It wasn't hard to escape his gaze for a short while, and when the doctor told me to wake up he reminded me of my mom when I was her age. He insisted that he was awake and didn't leave until he got ready. 
 I decided to actually be pretty anxious and kind of nervous ( as I'd always thought I'd become pretty nervous after being passed the throne of). My anxiety was so pronounced that I didn't even notice it was all sleep. I set down the notebook, wondering if anyone would notice that things were lost. My life and friends when I could, but everything had changed so fast. 
 "Quick break mate. You can't go back there. " he said to me when the plane touched down. I jumped up and almost looked at my arms, but I wasn't ready. " Come on when the others are out " I shouted to him. 
 He was one of the major doctors of this plane and I had been diagnosed with a rare case of colorectal cancer. I looked at him through the haze of memories; I didn't even notice he was there, because I couldn't breathe or even look past my window. But somehow I did. 
 *drip drip drip drip* 
 My heart skipped a beat, but I kept going. It was a particularly hard thing to ignore, so I'll skip ahead and try again. 
 " Justin Smith, " he said to the nurse, " have it your way. I know you've been having problems with different forms of diabetes so don't worry, I think it's working. " I looked up to find my sister, Anne, sitting beside me holding a second bottle of Budweiser. I was a bit embarrassed at myself, but I liked to bring more. 
 " Justin, " the nurse said as I pushed my own finger up from my lip, " There are serious problems with your pancreas " as she wiped away some sweat. " There's just one thing I need to ask you, " she said as she swabbed the bottle of pills and gave it to me. " We need a colonoscopy before the next flight, and we could bring you both on board. " I pretended to be taken aback. She put it down and looked off in the distance. " Wait until you can do that." I followed her out of the car and not wasting any energy thinking I'd make it there. 
 I flew to the hotel I had rented that night. I made the mistake of wandering around her room when my beer sat over a side table while I went in. I became a little suspicious of what had happened; it was a bit odd seeing her try to sound suspicious while drinking. But there was one minor complication. I wasn't sure if it was caused by dehydration or something else and if I just woke up immediately. I couldn't tell if I was certain that it was just a strange weather or if I was just unaware of that sort of thing. It didn't matter, I felt it. I thought if that was that bad for me, I was better off staying. I wandered into the bathroom and strolled into the dining room, only to find myself in a room made for my liking. 
 It wasn't too bad, I could enjoy myself while I was gone. I passed out on the linoleum tiles, hoping someone would find me. I'm too tired now, I'm going to sleep. But I'll have to wait for them to give me an MRI.

This is very strange but the teress, Her human form, seems to possess certain powers. What we are not sure is how she noticed it at all and with this knowledge I understand why. 
 Human form. 
 While a sort of very generic term for "LIFE", human form might be even more descriptive if we caught one's meaning in the meaning. 
 **Battle Rifle**... 
 What it is, many have started by trying to express "sound" thoughts in another way. Rather than a more raw response to their music becoming somewhat popular, demonic hearing suffers from the lack of nerve endings, instead a kind of wild ability which sees three hearts pop together and being exhale hot strings, that causes one to forget about the physical world it now inhabits. 
 My wandering thoughts consist mainly of the iota of reverence this weapon brings, especially for those who possess the wisest qualities and who make the best in their condition. This made me notice that I just passed in front of a craft with a hornfaller that fell and involved a gale that was deviating quite drastically from the " pure attack" approach the one who faced me. 
 Am I very stupid? Or is it perhaps there is a clue to what actually is going on? But this would explain why she appeared before me, and I could feel that fear drop from my soul. 
 I was in a duel and will appear before everyone who lives. He can lose due to a score of idiots saying this but who is truly the only one who will stand back down to their decisions. No-one doubts myself. 
 There is a giant hand on my shoulder which even makes it seem very sharp, although I can not access it without collapsing or some ridiculous devices.

"You've just received a blue bulb, not a flashlight. On one hand it shows my daughter dancing around, a ball of flame and fiery energy. The other hand it's from a human. I wonder why you've come for me. " 
 " You're all kidding! Don't you see? She's not even human. " 
 " No.. you're not. Her name's Audrey. I can see her hair. " 
 " What?! " 
 " She's a spaceman, former astronaut. Always lookin' for adventures. My wife and I love to go see things on the 'cosmic scale. Still, it's not fair to her to go looking for people. I hope she thinks I'm scamming! " 
 " Why are you looking for her?! But we had a special kid! It was beautiful. That ball of flame came from her! She looked downright charming! " 
 " She was cool, you know? Cool and totally handsome. That's the kind of thing a soul looking for is guaranteed to always get there. Or at least so I think. She's not human, of course. And I missed her an awful lot! Things were hard for us. I wanted to be with her but she was afraid of me, right? " 
 " That's me, of course. We loved each other and we were great friends. She still has that annoying fart in her heart. Her sleeping sound has been replaced by a wave of darkness coming from it. It isn't too dark but... " 
 " So... I found out that I can manipulate light? My mind works like magic... " 
 " You can't use words. You can't... " 
 " And you can't sleep. You and your wife are paralyzed by darkness, no matter how hard you try. But there is a light coming from her. It's coming from a close distance! " 
 " Audrey, you don't understand.. She's not human. No, she's... uh, who the fuck are you? " 
 " I've brought her in. By chance she sounds beautiful here. " 
 " You invited her for coffee? " 
 " No, thank you. I brought my new husband. It's always convenient to meet me at my work spot. I didn't know you could come here and have some tea. " 
 " Okay, I'll be happy to see you again. Why don't you go talk to her. She'll seem nice after we leave the house. " 
 " She's not human! Audrey, I know I told you she was a wild animal. I was wearing this red cap for all sorts of reasons. So when I got to her place, I pretended to recognize her. That's one of my favorite types of disguise. Don't you remember Audrey? At first, I only hung her hair, more misty-skinned ones. But I knew she was real. And then she was brought to her house by me. And now she's found love again! " 
 " Why aren't you using your voice? Audrey..! " 
 " I've brought my husband. He's going to try and get out of this. " 
 " Audrey! Audrey? 
 " My wife."

 Written [ writing exercises ] ( http: //www.visionstrum.com/walkthroughs ) 
 I write about 5 topics and I have a weekly contest for new [ writing exercises ] ( http: //www.visionstrum.com/exercises/ ) and participate in them. This week is a contest to see how I can improve my writing and get better at them. 
 Question # 1: *Why do you write this? * 
 When I started writing the self-help materials, I was overwhelmed by the number of people in this community sharing their ideas. So I decided to write such self-help materials myself. 
 Question # 2: *Why do you use Smother? * 
 I wrote this for [ going on a walk through over water in woods. ] ( https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=2Hy-oNv2Nd3c ) I write from an idea standpoint, only to be reminded that I am being exposed to conflict like the public comments box above me, and I will be punished even if I don't answer them as accurately as possible. 
 Question # 3: *Why do you and other authors strive for higher art? * 
 I prefer a higher art. When I'm developing my new material ( what's the name anyway? ) I think that the art that came out must only be touched on by this community. Though I assume that can be pulled to a world of 'other people'. 
 If you choose to post your own response or [ see a video of me! ] ( https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=MpR5EvC_-9Ik ) with a video uploaded of myself doing some of my work please tell me how much I care. How I'll be receiving help from the public is up to you. 
 Question # 4: *Why do you or your peers write this writing? * 
 There's a place for writers and I believe that this work is for the public to read. I write it because I like reading information in other people's [ stories. ] ( https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=4Ec5lkUZjNg ) I am a self-sufficient writer myself and each different topic makes it easier to do my needs more clearly. 
 Question # 5: *What role do you want to play in this? * 
 I am new here and I'm hoping to improve and find a role. Writing and other people all talk about that and I don't want to be part of that group. I also want to know and understand how to do more creative things as a side-person to try and fill my perception of myself. 
 Question # 6: *How do you perceive the world around you? * 
 That is another question. What we are all told is to expect more, but we're just equipped to make predictions so that we can choose accordingly. There is no other way. 
 Question # 7: *What is the most beautiful image you can come up with and place on your wall? * 
 My work fills a huge gap in my circles and if it isn't that great a place to set it. My imagination is limited by the weird features in my world and if I don't set it up a bit more, it would be good for me to go to art that I can work with. If I leave my blank screen of endless landscapes and single colors, it's a very rich and powerful art. When I look at the wall paintings, I'm not sure that I can design the most beautiful and beautiful image in a given time. I do think that drawing is a very important part of the creative process, but that isn't too important to me, because I believe in it from the very beginning, and that's what I can take and be great at.

This is my first one for reddit, but I figured I might add my opinion to this thread as it is actually fairly well written and meh. I don't think any of my past names are in that there are clues as to who was named. Also the title did make it way too long. So many people claim it's the first telling down of time, and it's getting shorter and shorter. 
 However, it's not as if the stories will hold up to scrutiny. I think, in the end, they offer a depth and breadth that doesn't hold all the time. The stories always work better if the story doesn't fit the main theme of their whole setting. Not that you should be able to do that at the end, but don't expect yourself to be so critical. Let's start from the beginning. 
 *Right now, my last letter to Earth was from a great grandfather, a boy from East Germany... the father lost his last emigration and was imprisoned by the enemy. He tried to be a good human, not like the elder gods. But they decided to take him out, even though he still thinks it's a sin... But they didn't. So, he returned home and was given to me. I was sent there to tell him to make a sacrifice for his people. Not to sleep with them, or kill them, but to guard him from the enemy. He was very scared and disturbed, so they left, bringing a stone. He also left me some water. It is what I called water when I returned to Earth. I was very worried. When I took the stone I noticed a large amount of mold on it. They hadn't grown to try to clean the mold, but it took longer than I thought... So I have found a priest in which to handle this. He healed up and for a while I was afraid the people of Earth would attack, so he was there. But, he does not apologize though... Because this is why he sacrificed me, in the first place. And he does not give a single good sign that his people are returning. 
 When they do, the adult gods are much more involved in their relationship, giving each other important advice and respecting each other's moral and spiritual boundaries. They help each other progress their work and manage their planetary society, making sure that their children can grow up, and young people don't find too many flaws. 
 But things change. Things are getting worse, and one day, the younger gods come down and step in to help, reminding everyone that they can still trust one another. And soon enough, people start dying, and slowly, then slowly, people are slowly descending from godhood, and of course, the older gods are dying too. And by that I mean the oldest gods, in a way. 
 So the adults are passing on what has become of the older gods, and a new one is becoming, soon, an elder god. 
 I was curious to see how such a great change would happen. And it does. The gods are split into four age groups, becoming the Greeks, Greeks, Romans, Finns, Finns. So if one enters the span of two millenniums, other mature gods become gods, and with them, the old gods, and their teachings which came before they entered their time of death, become old gods in their way. 
 But if one enters the span of two millenniums, non mature gods, complete on their own, and their teachings come before the older gods, they are able to do this. So when the priestess of Earth takes one of the older gods with her when she dies, she gives her age, and gives her teachings of the gods, and the religion, and puts them together, when they awaken, when the world is ready, they say, "Goodness is coming and I will make it great. The gods return, as their brethren, and they will put this on the earth. One day they will strike down all those to follow us. Now, wake me, I know you are long dead," as he leaves the room and turns and turns again. 
 I hope you enjoyed! I've written another short story here that you might find funny! Go check it out!

Something starts to happen, i don't know what it was, i start to forget. It started when i picked up my younger brother, his face dark, the way everyone he called "friend " in the room looks lifeless. 
 It was hot and empty inside the house, too cold and shiny, until i remember, in the distant future, how to kill the king. 
 We all thought the king would be killed and we came here because he is dead, and i wanted nothing to do with it. I know that the real reason the death was done in time was for my brother to confess everything. 
 But I have never forgotten, once again, i come to a strange pause, when i wake up after waking up, i look at the room again, the king beside me. I see my brother giving me a happy smile. I've kept my smile from killing the king for a year now. 
 I hope i will get eaten soon, i don't think i should, it's good, and old, it's safe. It's ok, i guess, to bury my brother in the graves, i can't forget.

"No more pills, no more drugs " 
 " I don't need anyone ", Adlero Ford growled, " It will get better. Good and bad, the same thing. ". A dust-thrust echoed beneath the footprints upon his fingers. 
 " Don't worry mother. Dine and play ", Adlero bristled, stepping through the opening in the front gate and darting into the wild trees behind. The forest was not an actual forest, save for a small patch of cloud that overlooked the tarmac of a clearing behind the warrior. 
 " Oh, please, I had you there. ", Adlero grabbed his machete and fled into the trees. " Well, your service has already been done and for no good reason. ". A jolt of a lightning shot up his neck and he leapt out of the clearing. The trails of blood slowly followed him but soon he was able to find his target. 
 " Oh, there it is! I think we won! ". Adlero yanked the cord on a nearby lorry and gleefully dashed out. Adlero could hardly contain his excitement when the Lorry had started rolling down the road. " What a thrill, so far!" 
 The lorry dropped to the ground and a young black cape tore the top of the lorry open to reveal a dark haired and muscular figure with large long blonde curly hair. Adlero almost cried but his senses got the better of him. Slowly, the caped warrior managed to get the cap of the taxi. He stood and got the man behind him. The machete toppled over onto the bump of the taxi and was replaced by a huge auburn haired head. The old Black Beard swiped the blades in an attempt to cut through the man but the engine went flying. The Black Beard crushed the man and dragged him under the slick, plastic highway. The two fumbled under the tire, the black Beard lifting an enormous, brown steering wheel. 
 Adlero's blood drained from his hands as the blasted ranger grew smaller and smaller, his limbs weak and shivering. A green hot, red aura invaded his vision. Where once he thought there was a scary forest, now he had seen much better.

The day we moved into the pits. I barely had any time, so i didn't bother again. You're welcome. 
 But after nearly ten thousand years of experience and not a shred of sleep, I felt still. Night had taken its toll on me, though. I knew it all day long, i'd just look to other floors and go to sleep every night, just in case it became a full rest. They cleared the sleep from my shoulders to form a grin. 
 I couldn't believe this was a deliberate ploy by the foremen of the FutRion system, the woman thought to be my teacher. She took one look at me, already barely able to process what i was saying, and tried not to smile. 
 "I don't miss this class, i can't believe i got to go back to it, let alone in this place! " 
 She smiled in the most caring way I had ever seen her. I knew it would be fun, but the thought of flying all that time and still not getting home was so much harder for me to process. 
 " Say goodbye to your memories and want to move on to the next one, I know this is a bit late, but on another level, you sure are showing the floor below us how very shy we were. " 
 That was my past self. I glanced down at my credit cards and suddenly realized i was about to leave. 
 " Yeah, what about the trick? " 
 " First I leave you in charge of a similar room, and once you clear that away, it's obvious you're not going to be able to really do anything now. You only got to wait a little bit before you make your way to class, but you get to have your lesson there. I know you're not going to catch up to me all that easily, but you know there are many things you need to complete that you can do, and i have all the time in the world. " 
 Well. I knew a lot about my past self. I'll get to understand who else was living out the rest of his miserable life before his habits were certain and fixed. 
 " You're getting off topic class, got ta fight for your spot right there, your damn history is completely in order. " 
 I laughed one last time. " No, well, i won't actually fight you anytime soon. " I looked down at my china cabinet and for the first time in the hallway i felt like i could just wake up. It was so weird. 
 " Great. Thanks for the lesson and don't worry about most of it now, I'll follow you when you leave. Now get the hell out of here! " 
 I never followed her outside of class, usually i was on my way to there, just to make it more bearable. It was almost like the whole class just moved right away. She knew this would be the happiest school day of my life, but if i remembered correctly. I went into my closet again and put my technology on my backpack as i went into class. 
 " Please don't do this again, it will ruin our chances! " She spoke up as i put the Class aside and went down the hall to wait with my fate. 
 I guess that's what older people will do: know that they are the ones who did it. 
 I removed the backpack and pulled out a clip inside the walker, almost like a winter vest had been involved. I opened it up to see my friend who looked like he was older than I thought he was, right outside of our class. He laughed as the backpack unfolded and stepped towards us. 
 " Sorry, like you said i'm not going to actually fight you. If you weren't here, we wouldn't have to have trouble. You just have to understand, this place is our lesson until you need it most, so just remember that when we get back, we will remain in this room until our lessons are finished." 
 Boring, i decided, that was good enough. After all, i'd got myself a brand new coat.

Without a watchful eye, I was seen as 'the luckiest person on Earth'. My explanation was never any more convincing than it was in the other side of my television. I kept hearing the droning name on my local station'Gals," as the capital' of luck. 
 Over the years I have learned, that to think at all, that the world is so awful, that I can't even put my finger on the source of all evil... 
 Someone a little bit the other way, started to piss off for my amusement. I begrudgingly accepted their findings to this day. I was made the luckiest man on earth. 
 And as I travel the world in search of work, it's greeted with a sudden resolve, a desire for friendship and disinterest in people who were idiots who would curse me if I saw someone who actually looked like them, only to do so by using my incompetence at the entertainment channel! 
 Trying to work my way up the ladder, I found I've come a long way, and have in fact started to question myself. I found out that my daughter loved me! 
 I came to understand that my overactive imagination had resulted in setting me on a difficult path, rather than a need to fill myself up and claim a job. I started to recognize the few people in this town who I realized existed, and have since started their own version of my life...

The party was still shaking. Please God take my dumpling!! 
 Who from 2nd phase! 
 Who from 1st phase? 
 They hated him for it - they didn't even pay enough attention to hear his argument. He scowled. While we talked, some kid in upstate New York texted me that he wasn't allowed to speak to anyone until he was 8 years old. 
 Then I met his sister. 
 They ran towards her, desperately. I looked through the fence as we tumbled. Why did we come here? Who were we to decide the fate of my mum and dad. How could we. 
 I kissed her and smiled at her. 
 She smiled back. Of course it was just after we were 5 months old. But we were too quick of heart. We locked eyes and formed a lasting bond that went on for several years. I held her hand, held my gaze. 
 So they came. 
 I loved every minute of it as they took us away from the court room and decided who was the real evil.

"In other news, Father.( He should have seen this coming ) " said the priest before going to coat the bed. 
 " Hold up. " said the priest. The boy sat on a dirty, dirty bed. " We don't know what happened to his last supper. Don't ask me how I made that decision... " 
 The youth began to cry, then stopped when he heard a heavy footstep coming closer. " Mr. Banks? " 
 " I'm out, but my house is in the area. I don't recognize it. " 
 " I'm in trouble! So why the hell don't you tell me where the creature is? " 
 " Call the police, Mr. Banks. I've got my story. " He walked over to a box on a bed beside him and picked it up. There was a man in the box. " This one is here! " he said to the man in the box, who sounded calm at first, then he started walking away. After about ten minutes the man turned around, and said, " Father! Get me a copy of my report! " 
 The man before the cop walked over and handed the man the report. There were blood all over the woman's dress. " Oops. I should have listened to you before I attacked you. " said the cop, but instead he laughed maniacally. " Ha! 
 " I knew it, " said the man in the box. " But I'm afraid Mr. Banks made a mistake. " He put the report down in front of him. " Please, Mr. Banks, I really, really wanted the child to learn English, and that will be one of the goals you will benefit from starting soon."

"Welp, that's the low freestanding reef going up the coast, isn't it? We can take the lookout out now, closer. " Mr. Hershe said, lowering his head. He was the highest echelon in San Sebastian for all 14 banks of the Stockton Sea. 
 " Ha, ah, one of the lowest banks, " the captain said, almost inattentively. " So maybe an ambush just passed through? " 
 " Yeah, yeah, definitely. Just snagged another. " Mr Hershe wiped his chin under his sullen, sunken eyes. " You got to be kidding me. " 
 The shore watchmen shuffled down to pick up the lookout that had been passed through the cove as the boats surged ashore. It was expected to rise to the surface within weeks, surely. I hadn't spent too much time at the beach until after the Carnival made its way to San Sebastian. It was the biggest commercial attraction in the region, and most of the people there loved it. The South Block has got that weird feeling, when you can't get excited about anything too aero. 
 A dock opened up, with huge gates. The guardmen passed through by, by instinct, and passed through by Nellie's slightly missing twirling paddle. There were two consoles, the one on the left facing the harbour; the one on the right, sat in a small, completely empty bay. The meadow outside the main bay was soft to the touch, and as the sun peeked through the stars, the air was gentle, comforting. 
 " Is that a mira? " the guard asked, grinning broadly. I knew I must be to bad. 
 " How many, " I replied, twirling my paddle back and forth, jogging. It was the only logical explanation. I looked at my watch and paused for a moment. " Seven, four, one. " 
 My eyes flickered open and I saw my fingers tugged over a slip. It fit fine, exactly how I remembered. But it was a little unexpected - probably a slight tingle. 
 " Did you realize you were there, the five minutes right away? " the guard asked. 
 I blinked and nuzzled against the door. The guard paused, standing with his arms folded on his knees and neck up against the wall. 
 " No, I didn't, " I whispered. " I just assumed it was just the weather. " 
 " Yes, the forecast was that you would have a chance to make it to the Jolson before a crisis happens, " the guard laughed. " Go on, from there, we'll just have to wait. You need all of that. It's only out of the blue, and it wasn't well received this night. " 
 " Why would I? " 
 " Wouldn't the next two minutes just paint a picture of the past for you. You don't know anyone better. " He started again. 
 I sighed, and reached down, grabbing his arm. " Don't worry, he'll just have to do the 'flip the switch.' " 
 Then, a hand hit the bridge, nudging me forward. 
 " Aaah!" I shouted, as the giant hand slapped me back. 
 After he dropped me off, I went home. It was a nice haven, to watch the seafloor. I picked up the watch as I went outside to play with my new friends. They cheered in the distance. I decided that while sailing the great wide sea might be going pretty well, it would be a nice break and relax. I felt a light breeze, like it was exactly the same as when I stopped. And then the feeling of let go, and all my weight eased away from my shoulders and body. 
 The sun was soon rising.

He was in the dark and the hallway was a mess. * Paper, paper, paper*, he thought. All his drool was trying to moisten the wound from the salt of his mouth and spit out up his mouth. He thought he was being let out to pasture, and that if he opened his mouth he'd pee off a hole right under his poop. He was not stupid. Something caught his attention, and he let it go. * I'm not stupid. * He thought. His job was to find him. The hallway was emptier, and he realized he was confused. When he looked down into the turnstile he had slipped down and was uncovered by what looked like more sieve. The walls were thoroughly round and were a mess. Odd. He searched for his keychain and found it. * Swipe, swine, a moving target*. He held it up to the light of a garbage can. He decided to use it. 
 Here he found himself in the middle of an intersection of concrete and cobblestone. He thought, *Where am I? Is this a joke, a prank? I have a real mission and it's coming out of my mouth. I am a mole on a street sign. I must meet a letter bearer and kill this guy. * He thought. He slammed the empty syringe into his mouth to wipe it clean. His mouth was a mess. It had dirt stains. 
 He didn't know where to go. But he wanted to. And in a fit of laughter he popped the bottle. Maybe if he got a bottle of water he could kill the man. He popped the bottle and realised that he had fallen far enough down. Perhaps if he drank some of the water he could make sure that he would not fall and his wife would not hold him tight to her warm legs, but he was too lazy to think of that. He sat in the middle of the pavement with his head in his hands and wondered what he was going to do now. 
 He walked straight up the sign. It looked like a bar, with a good bar and a little paintwork, there in the middle of a row of urns. He walked up to a monitor where the broadcasting channels used to be and was given a few options. * Solilize the clock in the rain, or wait in line when they get to midnight! * He typed in. 
 *10 minutes of rain, 10 minutes of water, * 
 *5 minutes of sunshine, and then your body would know that it couldn't go under. * 
 *4 minutes of darkness, and then your body would know that if you got out of line your body would go through the rain again. * 
 *3 minutes of sunshine, and then your body would know that if you grabbed his hand he would not be able to hold it for him. * 
 *2 minutes of darkness, and then your body would know that if you left your place in line your body would not be able to leave. * 
 *1 minute of darkness, and then your body would know that if you let go of the fucking clock you would never get any daylight. * 
 *0 minutes of darkness, and then your body would know that if you hit the ground you would be the only thing keeping you alive to survive. * 
 He shook his head. The road was fenced off. He was not thirsty or hungry. The sun was overcast and seemed to be blocking the sun from getting deep in his eyes. He took a deep breath. This was a waiting game. 
 The delivery girl was giving him a heart monitor. She had dropped a small package in the air. It gave him the date and time. He wanted to feel a little warm under his clothes, but he didn't want to feel lonely. He didn't care that he couldn't have a device in the man ’ s hand anymore. This was the device he needed. 
 Just then the voice inside him spoke. 
 “ Look pal, I ’ m going to be missing another tooth. ”

"I will wear superhero gear! " 
 " Hey ladies, let's see this one! You mouthed it in front of the group today... " Harry engaged in a sideways turn and positioned a bowl of cherries on top of the yogurt tray and facing them. " What is this thing that I mean?! " 
 " Just look at him, my hero! " Harry recognized the boy " Bops " from a character before. " It's like they don't know the real... factor. All of them are super units, helping each other out, giving themselves a fighting chance, but it always results in a clumped mess of messes that put shrapnel, creating side effects. Some things aren't good for your brains, like cooking people up. " 
 " Just look! " The Boy Scout lunged forward, carrying his evil features forward. " Look at what he can build! " 
 " Yeah! He can burn messes in. Sprays acid on himself, clothes loose. Every time he wants to make things, he'll have to take care of himself. I mean, it's great to see his tiny eggs making a whole! But it feels like the worst " he tore off his shirt and pull out the little weapon. 
 " Drink as much soda as you can. Shut the water up, and light it. " 
 " Don't be late, change the setting for lunch. Moms are always so lazy, it's not like they expect that! That could actually be bad! Oh I saw it! " 
 " Head the kids! " Someone grabbed him, and ran him into the fire pit. " How did I even get inside so early? We need to change things for kids! Kids aren't going to eat spoiled brat fries! " 
 Harry was quickly whisked off of his feet with a chain to see the immediate team that had returned from the table to meet him. 
 " Mother's playing minstrel show, sounds delicious."

"Our oh-so-conservative rulers will have no influence over what the people are willing to pay for freedom. " President Horsake finally stood up. 
 " It is not what the people desire. Not the people or the country. What is the person. " 
 Horsake was taken aback and was forced to stare off at his bowl of chug of tea. The president took another deep breath to regain his composure. 
 " This little nation of yours has proved it will be available to our people. Our people are not ready for this operation. " 
 Horsake and the people passed the pungent presence of the president onto the cattle prod, ready to reveal the power to return into the present, for that or simply go back to the past. 
 " Yes, this will have some positive consequences, but we are ready to say goodbye. You have a right to vote on the things that really matter. " 
 The president braced himself, " What are the exact numbers of that amount? " 
 " A little more than two percent. " 
 " That *is* necessary. " 
 " What about that number four hundred thousand? " 
 " A little less than half a trillion. How will we then predict what happens to that two percent? " 
 The people all eyed the president oddly. " Don't answer that! " 
 " What if we come back more or less to the traditional way? What if we let the matter be explored further and, having completed the first step in our revolution, are ready to offer another $ 1000,000 for the intents? " 
 " I don't know of any direct way in which it can be done. " 
 " It will be extremely difficult, so we are going to make a decision. " 
 The president looked toward his eyes. " With all due respect, of course. " He paused for a moment. " So what now? " 
 " You are, respectively, voting against this bill, as well as about one quarter of the American people. You are telling me that forty percent of our American people are opposed to the bill? I don't know. I don't know. " 
 " No, it doesn't matter what the citizens there are willing to pay for an ounce of free land, freedom or schooling. It doesn't matter that they don't support our capitalistic system, as long as those are not being mistreated by our political leaders. " 
 " And I am not a political leader? " 
 Horsake gave a low sigh, then spoke with the straight face of his president. " Tell me, ask why, tell me all you can about the nation you serve. Tell me about your neighbors. Tell me all you can about the people you call " Americans. " 
 "... " Horsake tried again but it was futile. He could recall no one in his family who was interested in living in such a peaceful life anymore. " It's for that one percent," he added. 
 The president slowly took a sip of tea from the parfait in his bowl. He still did not know how much more he wanted it. 
 He was the president of the United States, and before he could stop himself, that one percent had actually been voted out.

"Mr Klim, the crime is yet to be solved. Your accomplice will be caught and sent to face the consequences of his crimes. Please understand the consequences of all his actions. If you have anything to say to me please do so right away. " 
 Stooped head to toe over his desk, he yelped and started to scrabble away at the paper. 
 " Wh-what are you doing! " Mr Klim exclaimed incredulously, his arms swaying over his body as he continued scabbing. 
 " Don't feel so bad, you have to do what is obvious. Are you trying to help me, you should care for me. " 
 His form seemed to change as he spoke, all the while his stares were fixed on a visual you didn't notice. 
 The back door slid open and he immediately out stepped the apparition of a bank teller and shouted, " Sir how can you be such a idiot " 
 " I told you it was complicated and rather simple enough? " He asked. " I'm honestly a useless phony. " 
 " No you're not sir, I paid you $ 80 million for the car so if you don't want to help me, I'll stop you. I can do better for you and we'll see who pays more. " He explained, biting into his sandwich and wrapping his arms around his stomach. " So why aren't you talking? If I was you know you'd be here right now! " 
 He shuddered and lifted his head up and squinted to see the gaping hole in his throat. 
 " I'm sorry for screwing you with my stupid salary, but you can tell your boss I'm worried so I might let you go. Can I have a piss on me now? " He inquisitively asked the bank teller. 
 " Of course. " 
 The apparition removed his head from his eyes, causing Mr Klim to squirm a little. " So why the hell am I seeing shit? " 
 " He's so sweet. " 
 " You are. " The apparition stated placing his hand on his mouth to cry, " I guess I should at least consider this a reward."

I breathed deeply, looked down at the partially red and white beans in my mouth. They were there, my salvation. My greatest asset. 
 A deep rumbling began. 
 The word resounded through the store as the magic words began to grow in my head. My mind began recalling the things I wanted to do today. 
 I should go to work. Build a robotic baby. Teach my son english. 
 I wanted so badly to go to the store and get some. I looked around as all the bills, interest, credit cards, personal possessions, and other stuff I owned all appeared in my hand. There were none. My universe was only half populated by insects that seemed oblivious to me. 
 My vision started to fade and I could hear a faint thing in my head: 
 "MY FAILURE TO PERFORM ME, I HAVE SUFFERED TO KILL YOU." 
 I ran out of the store as I ran up to the door. I ran inside and blocked it. 
 I crumpled as I looked up at the object holding the umbrella in front of me. 
 I immediately fell over and came crashing down. A literal tornado had torn through my house and everything and the umbrella. 
 Every time I tried to get up, the ground burst into waves and ripped my umbrella off of the ground. I crawled on top of the thing and laughed in it's embrace. 
 God dammit, did I deserve that?

She walked alone into the dark world, no lights, no sunlight. She looked to be about six feet tall, but I swear I have no idea how she did it. She looked to be about five feet tall. I feel like she was the curviest of her legs and she did it almost too easily as her hands lazily tossed her several buttons and decals in the air, which though round was barely noticeable at all. I could feel the change with the current temperature as I felt her embrace, never giving me the warm quiet of comfort. I found a phone book in the little red kitchen chair with three word cover "knockers ". There was a pocket full of black vials and a fish bowl full of herbs I must have been dispensed all over the place. I shook my head and let out a short gasp of relief. I closed my eyes and stirred the pot, hoping some vaporous smelling liquid held the smell up to my nose. It did not. It was mostly as if she wasn't there, totally foreign, like the true antithesis of comfort. I felt sharp pains in my chest and open my eyes. The ancient pillownut-cheeked head of the woman stood next to me. If there was one thing she seemed so liked, it was the mouthed commands to always turn down my cold, deathly snack of food that I bestowed upon her. I felt the hot breath in my throat that i had never felt before. This was worse, but I would gladly swallow her greed. I pushed myself to my feet. I could hear her breathing quick and steady. She was breathing heavily as we stood up to leave the room. 
 " I never wanted you to leave. " She sighed, her last croak at the unknown answer. I was silent for a moment before the words echoed out in my head. " You can leave " She said, her face soft and confident. I sighed and told the palm of my hand that I would finish this. She walked to the door of our apartment, throwing open the double doors. " Thank you " I said. I had no idea what the long walk would have been like. I thought I saw myself leaning up against the window, held firm, and prayed to God I would have heard her voice for the first time in months. 
 She walked into my living room. My heart pounded with dread as she just stepped out. I sat on the floor holding my arms and legs and thought of only her short empty existence as a stranger's pain. I heard her go quietly, my eyelids not open, and felt an absolute dark rush of shock wash over me. There was no reason for her to come back. I saw a flashlight in the corner of the living room. I climbed in, praying that someone would come to my door and touch my hair. I saw her sitting by the window, and embraced her own. 
 " I always wanted you to leave. " She answered me calmly, just as we left the world. 
 " God said you wanted to leave " I said, understanding that she meant no such thing. I was frozen. She smiled at me and I could feel an intense sense of loss in her eyes. 
 " Please come here, I just want you here to warm up." I replied, lifting my coat and keys. 
 Her eyes scrunched up in despair. Her only wish was to live a very long life, but a full life was not attainable without her being there. I ripped the cold night air from my lungs.

Everybody 
 The self assessment app was still alive, 
 it was the same as I had known. 
 The first time I saw it it was blurring my vision 
 I gave it up when it was done 
 It was a mediocre TV show 
 Its only consequence? 
 I "got " said a few mouths 
 I remembered going through HDTV commercials 
 I remembered pondering what would it take to turn the water into prairie 
 I remembered the days when TV was stapled down wires 
 I needed something to believe that it was working 
 I went on to hack into Imgur where I downloaded the latest installment of the site. 
 One morning, I woke up and found I wasn't hallucinating. 
 Somewhere, a bright flash of light 
 Revealing in many forms of life, 
 Like a bubble bursting, my browsing history rippled and expanded 
 Since I hadn't seen a single post from the site, I moved on to the next: 
 Dear Diary, 
 I had no idea what to write next; 
 My gaze wandered over to the timer. 
 I reached up with my fingers and poured the gel in the cup 
 The shimmering liquid froze it, which played as I stood up and flung open the curtain, 
 And a gentle light illuminated the room 
 My eyes became bloodshot and my body quivered. 
 I stretched out my arm towards the window, and approached the tank of cum 
 And stood there for a long time, frozen in the intensity of the moment, 
 As I felt it puff at my fingertips 
 " What in the fuck? How? " I asked myself 
 More sound caused me to gasp, but everything went quiet 
 I awoke in the next day in an office with the same old me 
 And I wrapped my arm around a wall and passed a video board 
 Now I was sitting in my cubicle in the same cubicle, 
 My phone rests on a desk of a cubicle with one nail 
 And I found myself on a desk at work 
 As I flipped through this video screen, his glance came to me 
 " Look at this. And look at this the world over here 
 Down here, I showed you naked dolphins 
 The world that crawled it's way forward 
 It to the very surface now 
 Your surface in my cage 
 And in your crotch to be found 
 See it change to a NICHOLAS CREM 
 LEEVER A YEAR AND A SICK SOUL" 
 I tried to relax in my freshly restored armchair, but my body couldn't pull itself back 
 And the perfect frame only matched the " smile " I would see on His face once more 
 And after a long pause, 
 and out of breath, I said out loud to nobody 
 I never dreamed those moments would pass 
 And if that did, I will regret ever doing it again.

 Thanks for reading! Please give me some critiques: )

Henry returned home today, marking the return of Doug, his youngest son. His wife sat next to him on the floor of their tiny apartment. Doug spoke little, seemingly oblivious to the gifts the father presented them. 
 "I'm sure that this is the most important meeting of your life. Doug's birthday is today, and we've got two months left of your Christmas together. Besides, Doug is his life now, " she said with a slight smirk. " I thought I told you this wouldn't happen. I'd never let you lose your father. " 
 Henry kept his composure as he put the children to sleep. Sure, Doug was nice, but a large part of him found peace in Doug's living for the rest of his life, with no expectations of it. 
 " My wife, I'm just here to tell you something, " Henry smiled as his wife talked. 
 " Don't be like that, dad! " She said in her soft voice. Henry's heart sank as she smiled. " Let's go to bed. I want to hear Doug's stories. Until next week, you keep him from killing himself tonight. I love you, Doug. Remember, nobody can live without you. " 
 As he entered the room, he kept his attention on the clock. 60 minutes to go. 
 " 8:30? " asked Henry as he got ready for his mat night. As he turned on the television, he passed the newscaster through the curtains. 
 " He's dead! " Drew yelled. 
 Henry sat back in his chair, closing his eyes. Doug wasn't there. 
 " You're so tired, dad, " his voice cracked as the TV said anything. " Just put down the child for crying out loud. I'm sure those babies in high school'll drown out him. Put Down them too. " 
 Henry looked over the room, and saw the TV. Doug was pacing behind him, sobbing as he shut his eyes. 
 " I could be with you Doug, " Henry said. " I already did. You'd have to forgive me, if I let you die here in the first place. But you saved this child, and now you're finally yours. You know how the government believes I think myself. " 
 " And yet, everything about you is the exact same thing. I told you this about myself. How I love you for making sure I can make the money I want for a whole family with such ease. Your income, and your sense of purposelessness, are just two things that show that, and I'm not prepared to give up the business you've always wanted. " 
 Doug's eyes were wide. " Doug? I told you this for a long time now. Do you still hate how I build these things, every single time? Because you wanted a better life. " 
 Henry grew pale as he sobbed, " I knew you wanted this, you know, " 
 Doug's face grew pale. 
 " Did you make it? You are truly just perfect dad. I know you wanted this. Your brain is mature for once, and I know you realized just how deep that feeling should be deep down. I know a girl at Yale who might love you, and you helped her through her tough times. I know you're proud of your inventions, and I know you're proud of my little girl's killer over here. But I still can't see you, so it's a question of faith... It's one thing for me to love you for something so trivial as buying groceries and reading books for the first time. It's another thing for me to say... I'll make sure you keep making a good living. Do you understand,?" 
 Doug didn't. He remained silent, as his wife looked at Henry, but continued to wail as the clock continued to tick.

My mind was in a rush, pleading with her for her. I hope no one understands... Like it wasn't me who dares to startle her. What did she do to deserve this? 
 Loved ones have to be quite sassy. Especially when there is someone looking on. Even a pair of glasses of wine can't stay hidden! 
 Even her pretentious self-promotion problems were giving her trouble. At least until now, no one dared talk to her. She wore a scraggly looking wig she must have put on her high heels, the ones I bought for Christmas. She never bothers to wear or find an outfit for it. To be honest, she shat herself every time. Like I said, she's a slut too. It's horrible being in the presence of the woman who loves you more than you love yourself. 
 The next time I saw her, she was an impressionable, naive girl who didn't know how to get the casual attention she deserved. I knew she would fuck up, but something kept her from yelling. It was her personality, the way she walked and talked and ate, her chips so fresh that even the grimy, cold papery suds oozed. To think she was... that was a bit startling. 
 Oh well. My last friend was murdered before she could snap from my hate's grip. Hopefully I'll know her day. She did show up a lot during the week and things were really about to get interesting. I wanted to be the one to meet her while she was at work, and no, we weren't going in together. Just so I knew... 
 Or... Oh. I mean, the... TEN WEEKS IS A HOUR? What time was it? He just seemed like he had never been here before and for some reason I wasn't surprised to see him. 
 My stomach dropped. The hormones started rising a bit, but I must be insane, or maybe I'm dreaming? It must've been another four hours, I think. I wonder what I'll do once I'm home? Why can't I just stay here? It's all we've been through, remember? As I pour myself a glass of whisky, I see her crumpled on the kitchen table. She jerks up, her robes thrown over the counter. I'm crying, but why is she crying? Another glass of whisky. 
 What, did the flash test somehow work? Did she lose herself in my arms? I walk over to the window to let the light shine on her face. There was nothing in sight. Just the darkness of the night, the never ending gale. I looked into the sky for a second, hoping. I can't be so wrong. I was in shock! 
 WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG?! I scream, and shake myself from the quaking and panic rising in my stomach. 
 My grandpappy! Where the hell did she get that wig?! I slide my fist across the table, but I must've scored a surprise knock on her door. Why did she lock it now? 
 "Henry? Come here! " 
 " What?! " she demanded in excitement. She rushed over. " What you really need is to hurry out there with daddy. He won't miss us."

"I'll fucking allow it. " The Human said when he was informed of the situation. " 
 Human advocates for all the lifeforms of the Starburst Sciences colonies just refused. Humanity has just reaped their half-soul-filled morsels of gluttony, and non-compliant lab subjects just don't seem to have it in them to pay the tithes. 
 " Well, today we're going to re-negotiate terms on a remade of the monetary forfeiture policy. " 
 She was the executive secretary for the faction of Humans they called the Holy Union. The Human, a spectrum of a typically anthro-human face, the first to overthrow a Sarbanes IV leader during the Great Repeal of Avast Potions. Her remaining followers joined them in holding the capitulation to the Praetorian Republic. This would be the third Scimitar to outright implode; first the Sire 'Refusing to Question and Grow the Goddess', and now the last. 
 Just a few hours ago, the Sire entered back into the pods; they'd been granted power yet again, but this time the leaders of humanity would dare defy all rules of their own. They'd been sent to defend what the Sire had. They'd held their breath for as long as they could remember, waiting for the next target, hoping the Scimitar would take out someone. 
 They'd gone back through the crew's orders once more, probing even deeper into the fourth sector where Human workers were likely to be sneaking away. The Scimitar went under their controlled drone lock, as usual, but a bad instinct kept them alive. The spy drones manually adjusted their coms to cut down on all communications between the Scimitar, and then clambered up the flight deck, the hideouts hanging in the air. Meanwhile the Human's security lockdown was turned on a number of times a day and it was running all the time. 
 Human's PRP was set to go quiet this time. Nobody noticed the human's landing-plate escape, or that they'd even been targeted by themselves. The human's admiral, Captain Tintin, the grunts and mutters of planet-shields could be heard. The rat patrols detected human activity just off the Dark Asteroid Belt, away from restarts. No means of contacting the Sire forces to express concern had been deployed thus far, the Sire's canals had no English canon, and no relations with humans as we knew it. 
 It was the biggest mistake of all times. 
 Humans had to comply. 
 Humans needed to be sent to make sure that Humanity didn't reach the Vitae System any time soon. Otherwise, they'd never meet again. 
 Admiral Tintin had informed Human representatives they'd inform him that they were already communicating with just about every other parasite galaxy in the known multiverse. They'd send a representative again this week. Perfect. 
 They'd all go under, come back the next week when it was complete. And again, this time as they've failed all the high slots for Sector Six Secrecy Systems three times as many times. 
 Sites hold potentially more ill-gotten gains for Humans than any of them. The San Dancer was only beginning to realize, there were no systems to sustain his troops after the breach of Sector Six. Maybe he would win. 
 But it would be worth it. Humanity had never felt so proud to have been at the forefront of human culture. Life had been tough; now, it was time for a new way to embrace adulthood. 
 Her triumph had been swift as any other. The Secrecy is in the Sith Era. I'm not kidding. It can't be stopped before this war is over.

Today was the day. I watched the excavation team way up the hills to my village, and it was at the back that I began looking over my shoulder at the first place that I would ever see. 
 It was about 40 miles from village to village. 
 I had a lot of faith in my abilities. " I should not have dig here " would be my top belief as we walked up the steps to the graveyard. There were a couple graves around me that I have never brought up. I had seen them before. They were dug up a few times over the last 50 years. 
 Once they had been excavated, I thought about using them against my home town. Maybe we could send word to the occupying forces that were pushing us to dig our way up. 
 " I should not have dig here!" I screamed after awhile. It was time for me to get started on that shovel. 
 ---I continued down the dirt path towards the village. It was bad news for me. The village was very, very large. Thankfully that wasn't too bad since most of the villagers were very kind to me. Then I saw it. It was enormous. It had enormous length. At the top was something that looked like my own skin. It looked like a hand holding a flower. Then again, I thought maybe it was the human hand I was holding. I tried to listen to it, but by the time I had spoken to it, it had gone completely black. 
 I turned around and found it. It had glowing blue eyes. That was odd. I looked to the ground to see my skeleton, but to my horror, there was nothing underneath. And just then I heard someone say, 
 We should not dig here.

"Hi my name is Jonathon Rosenberg and I am on interviewing for a position at TriMet's PR team. Hello? " Asked Jonathon as he's sitting under an overpass. 
 " Well look I'm pretty new but I am here to describe my experience here at TriMet " Said Joe that day, as the last boss of Mike and Joseph's 11/22 until this day and I still stand here. 
 Joe stood up and walked over and set up a microphone. " Welcome everyone but can I speak my name? " 
 Jonathon hung up the microphone and took another drink while looking to the ceiling. 
 " Mr Rosenberg there is a group of greedy people in the cafeteria and I want you to keep your mouth shut. " Said Joe as he handed him his media pass and threw him to the ground. " Your shoes are all as funky as you go with dirt, but here are your shoes and you aren't going to wear them over this. Once you are seen and have been serviced you will have done with the job as long as you pay for it on time. " Said Joe and hung up his screwdriver and took off running up the stairs of the restaurant. 
 Later during that day Joe is sitting here eating dinner with other reporters. 
 Joe played with his dish along with his fries, and then yelled to some reporter that if she had heard him, she wouldn't get laid. 
 Joe said, " I never said what job I am looking for. But I do know a great team, and even though I have seen them fail many times I have never lost track of their success. " 
 Joe sat there in a chair, transfixed and could swear for days that this guy would ask questions. He doesn't need to sit, he just walks around the room. " Steve why is everybody down here? " 
 " I have definitely started to feel sorry for you. I can see you noticed a little weight in your shoulders today. " Said Joe with a lot of fear in his voice and almost looked sick in his eyes. " I started to get lonely and depressed after one of my previous bosses, and I guess all my " my glasses " broken... slipped... that all happened because I wanted to have a better career. " Says Joe looking at Steve who nodded his head. 
 The next day Joe was at lunch with other reporters and saw Bill Murray on their floor talking all about Murray's alcoholic past. " I remember their calling us around to find the best way to compensate for the value of our services, but this is the fourth time i have heard from you. We never bothered meeting you, but this guy is knocking people on their beds. He's truly not putting it down and not listening to anyone anymore. " Said Steve 
 Joe sat in an angry chair with a headache and was shaking and practically bleeding to death. He had just arrived at a meeting and people were nodding their head, screaming, and sighing. 
 As the door opened everyone began to chat while everyone else was too embarrassed to go to work. 
 As Joe walked around the room and began speaking from one sheet to the next he could feel his spirits rising. He knew he was speaking to someone inside of him. A frantic voice was was all it took to convince the others to get up and leave. 
 " I've been at TriMet for 4 years and I could probably say you are the best in the office. And just so i realize you would be the one to come here every single year asking for anything that will make our next bosses happy. " Said a deep voice. 
 Joe noticed the eyes start to tear up. He knew they had finally begun to turn orange and his soul was forever locked. 
 " And I can definitely say I'm not the most handsome guy to ever walk the earth." Said Joe, and the door opened to start a conversation with a severely annoying person.

It was the book I had so desperately coveted since childhood, and I hadn't yet moved on. I looked into the book's narrative as I read, planning my next adventure. I gave my worst enemy the best punch in the jaw, giving him no time to ponder the veracity of his useless declaration. I let the book burn, and I caught a glimpse of myself on it. There, stand the seven figures, staring at me as my face passed out from gaunt cry. Their eyes met mine and each eye turned to me and one was still staring. 
 "You are an unremarkable old man, I repeat you are an unremarkable old man, " I said to them. The middle face of the animals stared back at me with scorn as if I had given up on seeing them. A body flew in front of me, and I lurched forward. The animals tried to flee, but I moved forward too fast to get to them, and the flock fled the lake. 
 " No I... I'm not going to do this, you idiots, I'm not going to do this, I'm not going to do this! " my legs lifted upwards, jump onto the banks of a river. I swung my gait, and shakily followed my feet. 
 " Stop, drop, fall, " one of the animals shouted at me. " This is beyond impossible! " a drumbeat of trumpets erupted from beneath me, and a woman was dragged to my face and tossed aside. 
 " Hello, who's here? " the animal cried out in anguish, before a finger flew through my chest and tore me apart. I screamed for the first time in ages as my vision returned, and blackness followed me in waves. 
 I awoke in a dusty cellar, and I could see guards checking out in my cage. There, right where I had once been, I was picked up and put down, and dragged to an ornate jail. I was hungry, so I decided to write my story here. The guards looked at me suspiciously, and gave me a cursory glance, before dragging me out of the cell and put me in a chamber. They called for me to be questioned, but I refused, and instead just sat there, frozen. 
 When they finally came, I fell to the ground, and stared blankly into the emptiness, before my legs calmed down. " Hi, Harry." a voice spoke.

Once the event was revealed, they began shoving it into the minds of their subjects. The many studies into mortality, how well suited they were to it - the biggest alert was here in the last year. Dr. Qresses attempted to get the last word out, however, she already had too many recruits and she had to draw up a list of names. 
 "If you were hanging for just two minutes. " 
 " Forty minutes. How do you feel about that? " 
 " It's a restriction. About about making it up for another two minutes. You see, I've learned so much, so much about the personality. I'm afraid I'm not suited for this. " 
 The new human's voice sounded completely natural. This was unusual. 
 " No-fuck. Really, last year I got that man as a biographical specimen. But here I am. The only human with a religious IQ, not any genetic or genetic suicide factor and he doesn't want a hang for himself. " 
 Dr. Qresses was trembling. This could be a terrible dilemma. She assumed the other humans would have chosen someone to look like a real people, someone to kill, someone to smother. She put herself in their mind and raised an eyebrow. This was not something she planned and it must not have happened. She slid her hands into her suit and put the gloves around her wrists. 
 " Yeah. Yeah. I guess you're right. " 
 She raised a hand. " Open up and tell me about this record please. How does it feel to get hung? " 
 " Yeah. I guess. Do what you were told to do. " 
 Dr. Qresses looked up, shook her head and wiped the sweat off her forehead. 
 " I understand, but the data I keep telling you is so much better than most of the literature on hangman. And I know that you feel this way about killing... Can you please help me? " 
 The man gave her a condescending look. He was as shifty as the others, but everything in him seemed kinder to her. 
 " Well then, why do you have to be so ready? " 
 " Because it'll make the world burn. " 
 The growl of a gurgle filled the air. " Yeah, I guess I'll bring the rest of the brain down to the ashcans by the end of the morning." 
 Dr. Qresses was startled. She suddenly remembered something. The first thing she heard after the accident was the fact that a guy on the radio had spoken up.

John then gives Jesus a bow, and he invites him to join his disciples and rejoice in the abundance of 'this life'. In that way, each is given a strong, balanced life. They are given better opportunities, and in a way, they will be better for it. John stands and walks slowly towards the exit, where he sits behind a large wooden table, chatting to various people. 
 He is known as'The Prayer Manager', and he has been given the power to create His own life. He teaches and delivers miracles into every single person in the world, so that the world never ends. From the day that God granted Adam, to the day that no one would ever have to worry about how to eat. The prayer manager, Jesus Christ, is all in His story.

I don't remember much about why I went to bed early. The morning run, late nights, late nights in the wee hours, all things to drive home and work in the morning. 
 I've seen a lot of strange things. Me, for one. A lady, the doctor at the hospital. My pictures are always the best. The Doctor gets to see the baby, the Baby looks as pale as an infant, and Doctor feels no pain. The Baby only suffers from a malignant tumor in her pelvis. The Doctor makes no medical decisions in the birth of the newborn. But after the birth Doctor did a doubletake. The baby looked exactly like the doctor after his first scream the Doctor made. It's super bold, back in school. There was no procedure for deep body consciousness. But when the baby let out a foamy scream, the doctor heard it and decided to put out it. When the doctor gets used to hearing stories about how his observations were made, doctors feel motivated to find new stories, whatever they're going to tell the baby at the last moment. 
 The Doctor says, "I hope the baby doesn't fall asleep. My brother will stay awake with an up long while." The baby sleeps, now. The doctor, trying to keep the patient awake, sees how agitated the doctor is. There's no more surgery. The baby sleeps, as if his last scream has hurt him. Doctor, a little worried about it and that the baby will not fall asleep, tries to work out if it's okay to go back for him now. My brother gets up and brings the baby. It's 6:10. The doctor tries to help him. The baby is cold, and very agitated. The doctor decides to get him checked out. 
 The baby finally has a chance to move on. After seven years of watching the baby, every moment would be, like something out of a "Put down the knife and unplug" movie. Doctors do this all the time. The baby takes up half the hospital room. How bad was it that your brother went to bed early. Doctors would just do it their way. When the baby comes out of his bed, the doctors have yet to care. The baby's face is now pale and he has a hard time breathing. The doctor woke the baby up and in the end, the baby is always calm. The doctor is happy now. The baby's mother was standing over him. She asked, " Is there another way for me to save you? " The doctor said, " No. I need you at all costs." The mother is now alone and frightened. One day the doctor will try and save the baby. The doctor comes to the hospital and on his way, he puts in the knife and unplug. Because he likes it when he can save him. 
 And the doctor pulled out the bottle. The doctor pulled out his knife. And after closing his eyes he screamed. 
 And the baby is still crying.

Hi all, 
 As a new writer, I didn't expect you to be able to support this, but my prompt was going well for the time it is. Just to kick things off, I'm going to give it a couple of rough drafts now. 
 For my f rom, it was a dark and stormy night, and I heard the murmur of gunfire in the distance. It was a thrill to write it, and for that I'm thankful. But I kind of worried I wasn't getting far. 
 This week, I went home and thought of all of the things I'm writing to be done, even if you were slow and tentative enough. If you want to continue reading, send your thoughts to [ here ] ( https: //fivenswrite.wordpress.com )!

When I first summoned the demon, I was not surprised. The demon turned human, it's maw and teeth scrunched in expression. It smiled. " Hi. I am Dracula, of Call to the Old, and I ask you. " The demon didn't reply immediately. 
 " What do you desire with me? " 
 The demon's green eyes darted towards me with a determined hunger for what I could bring him to bear. " I propose to kill you. " 
 " What then? " I said. 
 " Let me introduce you to my new maker. " The demon lifted his head, he did not seem terribly surprised. " You must be a young demon of high intelligence, and you need not fear. " 
 I could see from the demon's blackened face that he could sense a bias against me. 
 " Interesting. " The demon smiled, that nice smile really. " Why, if I may ask? You wish to kill me, I will slay you. " He spoke so slowly that I almost couldn't make out what his demeanor was. I could tell by his slight nose. 
 " Oh! Quite so, my guest. " I laughed. 
 The demon turned, then it mouthed a single word. " Monster."

I now know the school once still used to exist. 
 It was the same place every time someone invited me to lunch, the same music in the room, and the same smile. It wasn't long after that that I heard that odd thing happen. I could hear my name get louder, the dance, whatever. The dance went on, the phones ringing, even my driver, "You have come, we are getting old, and it's time for a transfer ". 
 I didn't mind, I was in this great loneliness. But then that smile. That smile that only I knew. I knew all of my memories. I knew where they were from, it was all correct when I wasn't there. Or where I was from. I didn't realize how many kids I let go for the same reason: with the decay of the classmates. 
 I have relatives that came here. Some of them better than me, just as honorable. I learned how to teach them how to talk and talk quietly, despite the grammatical mistakes. It didn't bother me, if I did I was actually allowed to watch over them. It's a good practice. It's even better when the only thing they would want to leave behind is money for it. 
 But that's another thing- not the great things. I can see the passing of time, but the students aren't either in complete retirement yet. They died, but there are still some seconds where they are young and happy, others to scar the rest of their lives. I don't remember much from any of these days, but I can see that they're graduating for good. They are simply trying to create meaning and meaning on their own, and I know they'll do all sorts of things too. One or two, and they should be dying soon, and there is room for living. 
 You see, the words they used in history books told us how to behave and how to love. That's a horrible word. But do I remember them? No. Not today. 
 Maybe tomorrow I will change back. I think it was the same grin, this never-ending one. This smiling one with the thought, " Come on " and then " What were we talking about?"

Ah. The daftest part. After months of making mods and seeing more grief and shitpost comments I realised I could do anything. 
 Do what I did, what I did. I pretended to be a mod not to investigate a mod. I pretended to be an asshole to a friend to a family to reply to a /r/nosleeppost so I could know exactly what I had done. 
 And I imagine it was a success. I did it all. I put all of my knowledge and skills into this, heaven knows why, method that there has never been before. Any who stumble upon it must know my secret trick. Well, it's pretty simple. I have to pull the wooden door open and latch it. Easy! I know that's not really all there is to it, but I can start all over, open the door and twist everything into shape and hold my magic bag in my hand. I know what it feels like to see a trapdoor swinging open. 
 After a few minutes, I open the door and loosen it a bit. I'm amazed this is possible. Inside I see a cat, and I know for sure they haven't awakened. After convincing a warden to remove my weapon they shove me on top of the car.

I heard the sound of fine needles filling up the stone stairs. I opened my eyes and slowly made my way over to the stairs on the other side of the car, although I know they ’ re not quite where I would expect them to be. The volume was louder than I had expected. My father…my mother…they were at my feet. They were strong; tall and strong. 
 I swallowed. My breathing became heavy, painfully slow, but I heard it that way too. 
 I slowly turned over to the stairs and started running towards my mother. I reached the bottom of the stairs, brushing blood from her mouth as I did so. She began to cry, almost frightened. 
 I reached the bottom step to the kitchen, grabbing a shovel and digging deep. I ran across the stairs, going down every step. The sadness didn ’ t stop me. They were here, right? Right in front of my face. 
 When I reached the top I saw the door slam open. Suddenly the sound of sliding metal and metal suddenly melted, rusting and rustling. My mother stared up at me, her pale brown eyes filled with anguish. “ What is wrong? ” 
 I grabbed the wheel, carefully knocking over several flakes of car moss. The hinges cracked as I turned to look at my father. 
 “ It ’ s not what I ’ m looking for. ” He answered. His face twitched at the thought of growing up to do something like this. “ It ’ s just not what I expected. How the hell did she get here? ” 
 I cursed. 
 “ What did she expect from me? ” I asked. 
 My mother shook her head. 
 “ She took all the jewels from the store, saw what happened to her… her husband. She fucked him off, and killed him, and then took all of her money and took everything she had… ” 
 The silence cut short as the rest of the car were about to fall into the street. 
 “ What happened? ” I heard my father ’ s shriek. 
 “ He… he just showed me all the gold. ” 
 My father trailed off in the most solemn whisper I could manage. 
 “ I ’ m sorry, I didn ’ t mean to… I don ’ t know… I ’ m tired, ” his tone deepened. 
 I darted across the street, scanning the pedestrians before me. I saw a young man staring at me from behind the car, with long black hair. I scrunched my head away. The wind was blowing now, blowing up the windows of my car. 
 A soft croak, a soft squeeze, and then a crack echoed from my father. I took a step forwards. 
 “ Daddy? Daddy? ” I hesitated. 
 “ Yes? ” 
 A beat. A crunch. “ Just a crunch? ” 
 I nodded. 
 “ Oh… ok. ” 
 “ Like the forest? ” 
 The rhythm of the echo became louder. The noise was coming closer… 
 A slow click. A squealing and a pinching sound as a chomp. A loud *chop* as two needles plunging into the man ’ s chest filled the car. I heard him cough and moan. 
 “ Daddy, ” he growled, reaching out a hand to me. “ Daddy…Daddy… ”

The vanguard was fleeing in from the rear. They were miles from where the pale knight had stood, drenched in blood. 
 Taken prisoner, and day to day guardsmen of the city. He was hated, though on a voluntary basis. 
 The man's breath was both curt and broken. It sometimes took days to cross the plains, sometimes more, before he was noticed again. In that short time, he was destroyed. The forces on the opposite side had finally reached the cave he had been taken from. He must have turned back. 
 Slightly unnerved, the knight paused at the last cave entrance. He was a fighter, if his master had taught him the truth. Maybe if he had fought, the world would've dealt with his mistakes. 
 He pressed himself against the wall with his hands to keep from biting into the crypt, listening as the countless guards stood outside, waiting for the time when the man would rise again. 
 Then suddenly, he heard it. The footsteps inside. The cold, mournful voices that heard all the nonsense. Through them, he could see the pleading eyes of the monstrous warrior that had stood for so many years, doomed to this hell that it was so small, and somehow, oddly enough, was still writhe in pain, guilt and despair against the cold, clutched in misery. 
 No, it was him. He heard no screams, no cries. It was just him. He saw the gaping hole he had been forced to leave, and that he now was committed to his fate. 
 Then something made him want to run. He wanted to escape. He could find another land, another ocean or, as if he could reach it again, across a barren expanse of the deserts. He could not, however, find his way back there. Even if it was impossible. And he was a dildo. 
 The rising sun. Soon, he would fade away.

The elephants wondered why they were in the place they were, and how they were going to stop them from achieving their goals. Death was two planes from the bottom of that maw, swarms of bear traps, and another. They were about to have one shot, the elephants said, and they made sure not to hurt too many. 
 If they did hurt too many they would save everyone in the room. Why should they *care* if that bear had been taken? They might call him "monster ", or maybe they might call him " grizzly ", but the elephant didn't care. He was just a trainer. 
 The elephant heard a crack from the hallways, but he did nothing to block it out. If the bear was thinking all right, maybe he could find those drugs he needed to kill him before he figured it out. But he was long gone. The elephant thought about its ancestor, a yummy savory fat stuffed bear. The animal gathered his carcasses and washed off into the alley. 
 With a heavy sigh, he pulled the last of his wildlife to himself and put it in his backpack. He got the gun and gunpowder away from his belt, then loaded the gun and charged into the mob of elephants.

It was hard to explain to the investigators, they were plain-language guys and they always admitted everything. The other assistants cleared each other to go back to the basement, although each one seems to have decided that many things of life had befallen at this time. 
 I was new here, and in this environment of the inspector making damn little decisions, I had the bad reputations of detective, which should have given some reason. The responsibility on our side should have been taken better, and the badge I just had flayed was slick enough not to come across in the lab. 
 I gave my reasoning a few moments to let them think, then quietly exited the manor. Taking it all with a single spoonful of wine I just managed to convince them that the crime, if it did happen, was not one of this small, unimportant thing that could easily be manipulated. 
 It had been an hour, and after only a handful of different witnesses were allowed to come into the office I found that there had been no reward in the second incident. I continued on to the findings, and whenever somebody informed me to drop everything would become silly, as if it was a featureless piece of glass. The work room was littered with rusty flies, probably with the remains of police cars, and there was even some metal skeleton holding a brass bat. The public verdict was that I should be arrested, along with all my evidence, because of that unusual object that so hungrily caught my eye: a duplicate of the weapon they had asked for. 
 I kept telling the old man I had replaced, telling him I would write this down, that what they should have done was convenient, that maybe I was someone worthy enough to use the weapon, that maybe the crimes would be exactly the same if I had actually kept the evidence at a minimum. 
 I hung up as I became more tired of being here, and in a flash, I noticed that the marks I made on the hair on the forearms at the time, even as the blood slowly cleared, were all ashen white. The marks had been lost on some sort of marker. Something had picked up as the liquid in the plate, but it wasn't hard to distinguish the marks from the battered remains of a police cruiser. It just looked. 
 In the third story window, the new man's severed head was removed, replaced by a tattered bag with the same white plastic inlaid across. 
 And that's when I realized that that bastard had been asking for this stuff to be left somewhere safe. I hadn't paid attention, though. I wasn't really made for this sort of thing, and the exam results were unclear, either. 
 As I worked on the copy of the tattered article that explained the woman and her loved one before me, I made my way to the front of the room where the glasses were sat, making sure not to damage the contents of my home. Once I was brought in, the few bloodied items were quickly scattered on the chair, my hand catching on the dark scratches beneath the lid. 
 I opened the frame to find the first of the several anomalies and lab equipment gone. It wasn't medical test equipment, it was a copy of a device that would allow the witness to keep their word about the weapon while still protecting them with their own, as they were now able to look at the crime scene in this state. This double murder device was built in the 1950s, and had never been used before, not even during the tests. 
 I clutched the piece of plastic-wrapped corpse in my hands as we moved forward, blocking off the hallway where the sight and sound of the scene was so familiar. 
 The shapes of the pieces against the wooden furniture were now vividly recognizable, but I couldn't follow any of their movements so I slowly backed myself up, and with a loud squeak I pushed open the door. I went back through the open door, and when I finally made it around the corner to the room, the video window set above the building's flag state the white-covered exterior as it showed us, not the full length full moon, but a ghostly figure as close to 25 feet tall. In a castle state, he appeared to be taller than some heavy metal policemen, and that slim figure almost certainly *was* the force behind the metal door.

"Kill the child, it's the right thing to do. " 
 Another came from the back of the room. The woman was kneeling in the corner next to him. Grinning in response, she tied the rope to his wrists and shoved him into the back of the apartment. He was pinned to the floor with one leg tied behind his back, the other lurching on his knees. Slipping on his spandex, she put her fanny pack on his head and dragged him back to the front of the house. 
 " You know exactly what it is. Kill it. " She said, gagged. 
 No response. Just another mute woman knifing him. 
 She got out her phone and set it to search the house. She heard footsteps outside the house. She kicked the door in. Her pistol. Chasing them away. If this child's innocent, she didn't want another. But there were so many things that could be done. Even if he wouldn't have made it, they wanted him dead. 
 " Kill her, " she screamed. " Please, please! " She began to hug him fiercely. 
 " You don't understand. " He said. " If it weren't for you, it wouldn't have happened. If it weren't for you, someone would have saved us."

God. It's a joke. How could I be considered nice enough to hang up on an unsuspecting home owner when I threw a pizza service bar with $ 5000 in it? I couldn't pay to have that bar opened by myself, for a friend would have gone and taken the money. 
 I had come here by mistake. I did have a friend and a friend, or so I thought. Of course, I still didn't know who and what was taking the bar to their doorstep. But I did think to call in pizza instead of a home delivery. Had someone else come to complain to my front door I wouldn't have never called. And obviously, my friend never showed up. 
 The first thing I noticed when I got home was a trend for going over to the bathroom door where someone had used the door for pizza. Kudos to the pizza guy, I'm taking some pictures with it at home. Or, if I'm looking to fuck up the neighborhood in a bit, that's what I do. It's not been how I've described myself, but it certainly is an alternative to having food delivered in a house in some remote area with a family as a client. I got dressed in a harness and wandered over to the bathroom door with a loud bang. 
 I suppose I might as well have been dead, even at the hands of some cat. 
 'Fuckin' funny guy, huh?' said my friend, not quite sure if he knew. 'Couldn't have been more of a joke then.' 
 'Really?' 
 'Yeah, it kind of just seemed like a bizarre prank to me. So there you have it, my twinkie. You shouldn't be blowing up your hairdresser,' I said, I had no idea what was happening here. 
 'Really, I don't know man.' 
 'I know, right? I mean, I did mess up on the dinner table, but I don't really think I'm mad.' 
 'I mean, it's no big deal. If you screw this up with someone else, you're going to hell.' 
 'So, how much?' 
 'Uhh, around a dollar. That's not very much for the average person to spend a thousand dollars' 
 'So, who are you?! What are you doing? Why do you have a cat?' 
 'Well... that's a bit silly, ya know? Just an old man, who looks like he should get rid of his cat' 
 'Oh, and how's that for a pet guy?' 
 'Yeah, I did help fix that terrible cat,' my friend replied. 'As if having a cat is even fucking funny. I mean, I'd rather have a puppy over-sentenced than having the only human I know bitten by the rotting muscle of some feline damn cat' 
 'Who dares you call some cat shit?' 
 'An ancient elf, who would have been significantly worse than an Orc at the hands of a God.' 
 'Really? That's not funny.' 
 'Well... Who kills a being now? I mean, I could have sworn this would have started out a little like an actual movie, or something, but there was something about that movie or something. And besides, I knew that one movie about elves being monsters. How old are you? How are you holding my hand?' 
 'I was on the lookout for your house? Me?! Well, I don't know, and I'm not much of a magician either' 
 'Well, don't worry about it dude, that's okay' 
 'Thank you! Hey man! We've been having a lot of bad news lately'

Jaime smiled at the giant shadow engulfing their organization and his. As he was squeezing through the green haze separating his shadow from the building, he pushed forward. He had met up with so many serious criminals but couldn't resist fighting anything but the least related gangster they could. All these teenagers that never knew that the real world was dangerous. Jaune didn't mind anymore. Being boss would always earn him a paycheck, money. 
 He pulled out a weapon and walked towards their door. Overmatched, but nevertheless managed to remain calm for a while. The muscular armored man, a- 
 "Took you too long. " Jaune called over his shoulder, whispering " thank you " as he activated the device. Shaped by diamonds two deep, but Jaune's not used to the bends of times of disaster. Once the man activated his superhuman abilities he was scathed in his armor, barely able to stand at the yin-yang under the cape. Then the gadget hovered on top of his neck and his torso twisting. " I'll see you around " he yelled as he turned away and bashed his head on the ground. " Caged. But never to be used. Only in the dead of night " Jaune thought to himself. He moved through the facility, taking the sun from his delicate, golden eyes. He followed the robotic ring of boxes inside, readying his tentacle, with each entry the man made a smaller square. He punched it with the device which reached for his own, but his fingers pulled apart. 
 Blood gasps were causing things to quickly become brighter. Before Jaune knew it his shadow that had appeared in the dark existed in the embrace of Nora, who kept her eyes closed as Jaune kissed her. As the man drew closer his shadow let out a long silent scream. Jaune pulled the ring away from Nora's neck and released its explosive electric blasts, but for a second he froze. It was completely peaceful as he couldn't put his foot up against the man's forehead. He then connected with it. 
 Jaime placed the ring onto his own forehead, spitting into his hands. The sound could only be expected to be heard on the other side of the border. Sirens started to be heard. Jaune could only keep from screaming his eyes away. 
 The man continued to creep down the corridor as Jaune pulled his Shadow over his head, covering both lips. He was smoking in the darkness as he scuffled forward. 
 " Where do you go? " Jaune whined. In response, Nora snarled her fear into some of her smaller words, she knew that his constant strangling was a bad idea. Jaune knelt, still in his shadow, and held her close. Jaune's shadow leapt up and dangled precariously around the man's body, threatening to pierce the flesh from the bone inside of the skull. He held her by the arm and closed his eyes as he breathed heavily. To further alert Nora to the threat he squatted down and murmured, " Take a small step towards me. " 
 Suddenly a shimmer appeared in the darkness. Jaune looked up, that was a blue, half black face. It was his shadow as Jaune looked around himself. He couldn't think of anything but himself, a light in the dark. This was not a shadow. The deep thoughts of both him and Nora filled Jaune's mind. 
 " Professor?" He asked.

Chapter Three: Hero's Handbook Chapter Three: Hero's Handbook 
 -- - 
 The scarlet flesh stretched outward in line with the jet black sails of the ghoul tank. Where he had been assigned was scuttled away into the storm swamp, a mess of dried blood and organic matter he had had a hard time digesting on his tongue. The young king for a man that was nothing to be proud of, yet yet so promising and so powerful. It was against this scheme that the boy of fatherland had drifted into this place, mind quickened like slow motion and quickly swallowed by thought - his heart is ticking, old wounds in his chest are filling with red, his knees are sinking into the frigid mud, no tail over his shoulders to hang his arms, no eyes to witness the battle he had been forced to bear. 
 His few remaining vestiges of good looks and satanic heads painted a picture of his youthful pride. He was a strong warrior, his last vestiges of befitting of bearing such honor. These were to be his great and true legacy. 
 He always thought he wouldn't be met by his one and only, but his conscience taught him not to let it fail. That was his future. 
 The blade of legend knew his when to strike. He slid forward slowly, his face pushed against the tank and gripping the trembling rider's wiry frame. He checked his scales and vitals - not a solitary ring he wasn't sure would reach his body. 
 Two large green eyes glared from behind the vent in the tank, gazing up at the figure. Every man should regard these eyes with reverence and respect, yet in this milky way, they betrayed nothing but disdain for what the hills threatened. There was none in the surrounding mass, only the towering grey pillars that said hello only to litter the thousands of different towns. 
 But among the hundred or so creatures of the valley, even a jay could attest to the primacy of the mans bloodline and his downfall. 
 But it was all worth it, and so he stood. 
 He stood, facing the beast's corpse, his blade poised precariously in the darkness that surrounded him, and spoke: 
 "Deal or be shot. " 
 The roar of the jaws filled the void as his blade fired, against the…? Humans? That was vile. It swam through the water as it pierced the white man and the beast screamed with it...

All the fury poured over my eyes as the thought struck me. Would it kill me to do it? Would it enslave me so horribly that nothing would help me? It would crush me to my very core and drag me all the way up to the top of the tower, before going with the trail of anguish to the bottom. I cursed as I watched the dagger spur against the steel, stabbing a deep, shimmering point into its side and pulling it back down with the force of the handle. I leaped through the window, setting my blinds down and a cold breeze blew into my room, the price they paid for a rare act of foresight that prevented me from ending my life. As I opened my eyes, I could see a fear covered in blood lying on the concrete floor. It had been so long since I had seen the casualty of one of the many attempts at insanity. My heart leapt to my chest, momentarily expecting the creature to slay me. But instead, it continued its relentless escape. A hateful shaking hoarse laugh tore its way across my father ’ s once terrified face, stained red with the blood of his victims. His feet clung to the wall, becoming a bloody mess while his head spun sideways, exposing his exposed ribs. I took his fallen face in mine and gasped in shock. 
 “ How did he... ” I muttered. The words strained out through my throat as I swallowed a small lump of lump water, a man ’ s body over his head. 
 And then I looked up, unsure of what I saw. The monster over my head was no longer his gaze, but instead, the silhouettes of those who had come before him. He wore black robes, caprettes, and numerous black stitched shirts, complete with their own pranks on me. Beneath them, I could see a skeletal arm adorned with sigil symbols and a crown of gems. I recognized each symbol, a magical elixir where the key symbol was found and it made my eyes swivel in a way that seemed akin to quivering from fear. Then a small creature crept on top of my room, massaging the sheets I had slept on. The head struck its head of the desk he had been sitting on and pushed the book against his skull. A shriek interrupted my choking and shot up his throat. 
 “ You will never be a good doctor, ” he said. 
 “ What? That ’ s the way it ’ s gon na work. The metal my dad was making sure I ate every night. You got any evidence that anything killed my life? That I ’ m dying? You think you can kill me, but you can ’ t. This isn ’ t how you make decisions, they take the edge off the worst. It ’ s not the stuff you think about when you need it to. ” 
 “ But I worked my last two years in a hospital. What have I done? ” I asked with heavy eyes. 
 “ I accepted a pension. ” 
 After what seemed like hours, the creature came to a stop. Inside the throne, staring me in the eyes and pressing itself against my jaw. 
 “ So your... ” His voice trailed off, giving way to the softest clinking of quiet. 
 “ No, ” I hissed. My form weighed heavily on the chair, its two trays of lead clipped to the floor. 
 “ I just want to be free, ” the creature said. “ I just wanted to escape my loneliness. ” 
 I took in a deep breath, looking into its eyes. They stood their still for a while before beginning to close in. 
 “ If it kills me, I ’ ll have to face the real war. ”

My heart paced in my chest. My loved ones, my children, let me explain why in my beautiful voice. Everyone is named in the book of Life. For a sweet little girl, she couldn't say anything but "Oh, they don't have words" and I wasn't angry. In a moment like that, she could't have imagined I would hurt her more. 
 I feel that I'm no better than the other kids in my class. Little tears cloud my fragile mind from the chaos of writing this. I put the writing to rest, I regain balance, and I get out of bed. In a moment like this, you know what it means to be a goddamn busy and caring idiot, and to be a asshole is to have it all eaten away from you by an infinitely finicky, soulless thing. Even to do this meant you had to be able to catch yourself wiping tears for every asshole you know about. 
 But I'm a lot more sober now. Sometimes I get angry and sad and sad about not being good enough at life. And it takes courage and willpower to be able to ask a girl out in public and get to know her better. And I am fighting that battle right now. Because I know that things have become a lot easier with kids like me. And for every day that I have to face this restlessness, every minute that I'm busy with no one caring and not caring about me being good enough, I have to face even more pain.

I looked down at the altar and saw it burning bright on the wall, a candle burning fiercely behind the table that hung like a curtain. 
 "You should come see this like a father, my dear sweet, " whispered the mother of my child upon her swollen back. 
 " We only have one stall on our lot! There are two carts standing at the door, and I don't know how many of them I've been in before. It looks like there is a fight within the house right between a housewife and a guard that turns off the main door, and then another guy makes it into the main hub! " she continued, standing up from the cloth flapping around in frustration. 
 She giggled, joining me for a sip of coffee. 
 " There's light in the bussing line outside the barn! I can hear ruffling and a herding troop outside. We can hide inside, too, our parents would love to see a sight such as this, and if the family doesn't like that, there's a wickerblock inside where we can not get in. The lines around my family are already at our height, but you can't make it over there. No matter. 
 I keep staring at the grave up there. 
 " So this is it, my darling, " I managed to say, seeing the of her drooping head, " we're back at our good life. The stone seems to have been forged, and hers's been made. We can't go back. " 
 The mother's brow furrowed, and her voice echoed through the courtyard. 
 " Oh, my dear, " I said, " the will of the common man is at stake here. His only recourse here is to leave and help me figure out what happens next. " 
 " Hehehe, my darling, " she said, and waved her hand in front of my face. 
 She was still smiling, still smiling like a smilehump in ecstasy. My little girl wasn't merely another half-remembered baby, my beautiful gift. She had been the first woman born today. A true hero. She would be our new hero of all times. 
 " I'll never forget that day, when the thirteenth car went through that barn, and used that as an entrance. It turned out they'd been locked in for months. A young child of twelve was sitting there, kicking and screaming, crying and choking, with some kind of woman running around her like she'd just woken from a can of smoke. " 
 The mother squealed, and the heir, who had miraculously survived the ordeal, started talking. 
 " Mum, that's terrible! " she exclaimed, puffing up her chest and slapping her little face. 
 " Look, " I looked down at my daughter, " I know that a boy here will always have a leg up in War, and his mother- " 
 " You want to stay behind? " 
 She chuckled, and wiped her forehead gently with a cloth, reaching for my hand. 
 " I'm glad you're here, my dear, " she said, her voice soft as old silk, and quite hysterical. 
 " No, I'm not here, your mother- " 
 " Stop crying, " she said, and held up a hand and pointed a finger at my eyes, " I need you to calm down a bit, and find my way back to the room to rest. " 
 She picked up her daughter, and began to smile again, giving me a wide smile before collapsing on the floor as my life drained from her. 
 " No, no. Mommy, I've had a dream all these years, how the big moose with the big neck and his big stomach came over and... oh God, no." She choked the words out, and began to cry again, but slowly, as if soothing a failing storm, she passed out.

I am passionate. Yes, passionate. Everything about my profession is intense. I'm sorry when I'm new but until this morning or tonight the absolute blackness that surrounds me started drifting away. The swirls of light at the end of the tunnel, and the vibrations that circumnavigate the tunnel, becomes an endless roller coaster. Everything I do now, I will do forever, I will do to live, and yet no longer. 
 No longer are we rich, beautiful, vibrant and delicious. Without each other, our chests are empty, our feet stand taut, our bodies are warmer, not strong. We are living in an environment that has taken many forms and yet yet still answers all of our questions. We are eating it all, staying away from the cruel universe. But we can't help but keep trying to find new possibilities. We will continue this journey if I allow it, if I accept the fact that we will live, whether it be as individuals or as a corporation, I am still passionate. Only a nomad can survive the irradiated winter in the coldest part of Pennsylvania. 
 Please, Mike, I will do anything for you, this is your life. Just love, have a great life, please, please, Mike, I will be there for you every day. I promise.

She looked me in the eyes and said 
 "I will always be there for you, " her voice echoed out over the 3 days. " Please don't fear. Your love for me will never end. My mother will follow shortly after me. You have finally found the warmth in my heart. It will be over soon. " 
 That night I had already prepared for her arrival. We had lived close by, my mother keeping good watch over the various parties we held at a bar every night. The night of our wedding, where it had grown dimmer, the lighting inside had stopped. The second we met I would see her silhouetted in the white room. 
 And I knew this from the moment we kissed. We had met during short spurts of reflection in the mirror. We would talk for hours, we would sit and read together. Then came the inevitable day when it became too much. 
 She seemed to think that she could kill us. She did, every time. I watched every little detail. That faint line in my memory from the second I opened my mouth to say goodbye, when my lips quivered. I knew when she had kissed me, she was gone. 
 And yet, still I lived in fear. 
 I sat with her on a changing pad, I got her name tag from the moment she stepped into our room. Once we were done we would open the book beside the bed. She would read over the pages, moving towards the end of the book. 
 " I love you, " she continued. " I will always be there for you, " her voice echoed out over the 3 days. " Please don't fear. My mother will follow shortly after me. You have finally found the warmth in my heart. It will be over soon. " 
 But my love for her was gone now. And for the rest of my life, I slept with her in the dark. 
 It had been years since that day. And still I watched the room she would be sitting at for hours. 
 I had a dagger in my hand. It was the only thing keeping me company. I silently said to the woman that I was trying to give her the most beautiful night I could ever hope for. 
 She whispered it out loud, " There was your husband." And then she disappeared. 
 And yet, my love for her remained. And it would be this night.

 All 20 people were watching it on YouTube.

 *Fond of a nice watch, barely a scratch, just a foot of 3.3mm vibration. * 
 " It's still on, it feels kind of boring, but good work Frank, like I said, look at the some of your videos, how do you plan on doing the introductions? " 
 *Probably, you want more room, than any of this out of the question * 
 *I get it, I really do, I have been going that route for years. But really, you would need to just be more posessed on and on about your business right now, I just want to have more shows on the large screens. Also, hear about those deals with Microsoft, or another copy of Conan, or Jackass. There's... Hmm, no chance there's anything inside of it, that's completely disgusting in and of itself. * 
 *They hired an American, they have this entire channel. *

I ate the cake, not quite bad, a little sour from the frying pan. It took me some time, though. I had no plans to go for another breakfast today, so the omelettes, and toast, and the bayor were all already late. All this conversation just made me hungry. 
 I then noticed a very elegant grin on my face. It was young, more so than anything I had seen before, someone fat more attractive. I was glad that nobody else was looking in my direction anymore. More and more people had taken up the weekly quest to go where no one else had done. I just needed to stop it, somehow. This whole situation made me think I would go somewhere entirely different, more civilized, and I mean it. 
 Well, there was still time. Something was wrong. So we just shared our quest, and then I saw someone around the corner. Taller and slimmer than me, but at the same time... everything. Wait... she was looking at me? Wow, I knew exactly what I was doing... I just couldn't turn around! This was going to be the most awkward meeting of my life. 
 After a few seconds of searching, I found the person in my peripheral vision. It looked like we had in fact met... well, someone, somewhere. She hadn't moved. 
 I took her hand and led her to the exit, as I did every other evening. All the during those years, we had attended tutors, parents, groups. Many had gotten used to the stress, the questions, the tell-tale signs of a person breaking down in front of a camera. But none were like this. 
 I left the door open, thinking that maybe someone had passed out... but it wasn't. I stepped out the door and I felt nothing at first, but then everything began to get in the way. There was a soft buzzing as we left the kitchen. I lifted up my phone, and saw there was a message from my phone. 
 *Hello? * 
 *Notification: This is Jaime. We are in the middle of a trip to Montraux Village. 1 2 3. * 
 *My name is Vanessa. We have stopped in Montraux Village to go to a local food court and saw some other very nice people. We are completely stopped, then we were approached by a man wearing very rich yellow coats. He wore several glasses and said'I am Jaime and need to buy a sandwich.' Then he took me to the stand and took a knife. I have no idea if I had known the identities of Jaime or Vanessa before, but he slashed my arm. I screamed in pain, and he stabbed me again. But... just then, the doorbell sounded. 
 Jaime lay there, transfixed. He stared at the pair of man standing in front of him. They were standing in the hallway and one of them was walking to the doors, sitting down on the sofa in front of the door. 
 *Jaime? Jaime? Jaime? What's wrong? * 
 He looked back at me, and shook his head. I didn't hear his confession. Still stunned, Jaime came up behind me and began biting my arm. I continued to beg for mercy, but he stopped me as well. But finally, he reached for me and held me in his cold grip. I hadn't even bothered to turn around to see who the killer was. In the ensuing struggle, Jaime finally reached me. I looked his way and saw his face: always cold, with furrowed brows, slimy dark green eyes, flushed cheeks and an infamous scar on his chin. He also looked completely crazy. 
 It took me some time to realize that this was how Vanessa met a different Jaime. But I was caught off guard. There was nothing at all that could change Jaime. I quickly got off of him, and walked to the gate, only to hear four men with blood on their hands go to the side of the road. " Guess I broke his arm! " I shouted, holding my face up. There was no sound. " But what's going on?" He asked. Just then, my stomach dropped. I let out a growl and had a thought.

( I have no idea why people talk about that in school - it does seem to be a part of the highschool uniform. ) 
 -- - 
 The doorbell rang, followed by a snap and a shot. The little girl knew it was coming from somewhere in town. Her father had watched her every step, chuckled and held her in both hands in the same direction as her mother. 
 "Open the door! " said Nancy. 
 " There's no chance, " said Frank. 
 Frank was the father of two. Several months ago, he had bumped into Nancy at an exam center. Nancy was a mechanic, but Frank didn't think Frank's talent was that great, so he insisted on an introductory survey of her attributes. After these interviews, Frank threw the door open. 
 " What's your opinion on life? " asked a woman in a quiet but determined tone. 
 Frank went to greet her, but the woman turned and walked into the corner, his face a shade of amusement. " I don't see a reason to have a child, " she said. 
 Frank picked up his clipboard from the table. " Frank, " he said. " I'm not gon na get into legal matters, " he said. 
 " Well, " she said, " your " name is Betty. " 
 " Ugh, " said Frank, giving her a half-hearted smile. 
 " I don't see a reason, " said Betty. " You have a child, right? " 
 Frank winced. " Not really! A 20-something job, with kids! A natural life. Right? " 
 Betty sighed. " Yes, " she said. " You're right. No. " 
 Frank sighed and turned around to face her. " Okay. I'll see you tomorrow, " he said. 
 The door opened and a tall man in sunglasses stepped in, his midsection bouncing away into the white hallway. Frank put on his full-body suit, showed his new father a gold, bright, blue gemstone bracelet, and smiled. 
 The goober yelled, " Two lucky robbers from the future, don't you say? " Frank's eyes widened in shock. 
 " Um... " said Frank. " Thanks, buddy. I'm in. " 
 Betty smiled. Frank walked towards the danger, but he saw an egg in her nose that she recognized, his once-name. 
 He cursed, but smiled when she looked right back at him, " Oh! " 
 Frank walked towards Betty's body, beckoning for the man to meet her there. He walked, though, and was met with a creature, all green and pale. 
 Frank's eyes widened. " Why are you here? " he asked. 
 Betty rolled her eyes. " You didn't come back from that job, did you? " 
 Frank laughed. " Now, what? " 
 Betty glared at him. " I had enough of your insults!"

 "Oh yeah! It's fine. I don't know what the fuss was about " said the Reddit Moderator, hovering overhead as he watched on from his pc, watching the tiles begin to gleam. 
 " Sorry, I'm on an auto-save when the game starts, but I can save the game. Why? " 
 " Because it's a game, dear reader. " said the adventurer. " We have a lot of comments which you think will appeal to you. " 
 " I'm not sure what you mean. " 
 " Well, I guess you're right. I'm off to Blizzard HQ. Please! " 
 " Or a few multiplayer servers. " 
 " Not for the simple reason that any situation like this has to be set up properly " said the adventurer as he collected his bags. " It's not like I can choose to. Maybe it's because you're not getting paid for playing. " 
 " I know I know. I have to check this. I promise I'll see if I can find a banhammer near me! " 
 The adventurer brought his spear up into the air as he climbed back up the stairs. 
 " Why are you doing this? " 
 " This will be gone in a few minutes. " 
 " Please, my hero. We'll do this again. I need to get this bannedhammer somewhere."

I glance down at my stained shirt, remembering to pour it dry as my aunt Cathy – her favorite – sneezed a free soap. Sweet Linda never gets enough of that shine. It feels like warmth for my nipples. 
 She always lets go, and it's always something she says to me, when I'm worried about something. " Why don't you just cry some more, " she says, and I do. " You feel so good. " 
 We meet again in college, and her face is a sea of worry. I tell her it's just her anxiety – that I'm just being a dick so I don't feel it – and she runs off to avoid the whole ordeal – to stay by my side. " Maybe if I'd paid more attention to her, maybe if she never sneezed, I would have gotten better, " she says. " And maybe if I didn't, she would never have ended up with cancer. " 
 I bet my mom knows I'm scared right now. I bet. And yet, she kisses me on the forehead one day, my tears stream down my cheeks. 
 I wonder if she could tell. Maybe she may be right, but still, I put my hand over her lips. She still remembers those millions, and I feel like I care about them. I clean my face, and my eyes roll back in my head. I feel like it's empty. 
 I check the counter once more, but it's empty. She still cares about me like she does every single day. I keep my eyes closed, but I know she's right about her. 
 The words come out in a trickle, like waves. " The tears are as sweet as I could ever dream. " 
 The tears come out in a condescending squeak. Then, she sits in the living room, her pale hand on the floor, still stoic. Her cheekbones are broken, and I feel like I'd never miss her. 
 We are students here, after all. We are going to school together, and I know she cares too. I never would have quit in my life if she hadn't sneezed. And even if I did, I wouldn't be happy. She was always lying to me about some stuff, you know? She hated feeling sick and alone. So I had to get up from the chair, and put on my coat. You would think my parents would have seen the drive; they normally thought I was working through this, but I didn't want to slip. 
 My parents picked me up, and went back into the living room. I broke down, and slapped them both on the face. I wished I'd cried, because I wasn't, but I don't know how many times that time ends up on the floor. I didn't want to hit them both. So I was just going to fall into the sofa and lay next to a chair. 
 I don't remember feeling pain. 
 But I remember crying. And I remember no-one's tears. 
 I don't remember burying my face in the sand so I could go to bed feeling alone again. 
 I don't remember tasting peanut butter. 
 But I remember my clothes. 
 I don't remember my eyes. 
 Maybe this day is the right day for me. Maybe, just maybe, this day is the moment she sings " I Found It in You."

**TIFU** 
 George Turner stood at the top of a long metal platform, staring at his feet, occasionally glancing between himself and another stumbling figure. 
 He shook his head. He turned to see a warden close the door behind him. 
 All at once he found himself aware of his surroundings. He was standing atop a long iron stage, surrounded by three outside occupants. 
 "No, yeh. That one. " 
 *excuse me? * Said the warden, he was handsomely dressed, hazel eyes polished, and blue lips lips curled. 
 " What is it? " George said. 
 " Do you know where we were yesterday, last night. " 
 " This is Jerusalem. " 
 " How are you Shin Bet denying me this nice dream, then? " 
 George didn't answer. His eyes were closed. He stood up, pulling a leather jacket off his shoulder as he walked to the outside, ignoring the warden. 
 " You know I've been watching you all day. " 
 The warden put the leather jacket back on and entered into a small intercom. 
 " We need to know this, warden. This is why you need to come out. " 
 " What do you need help with? " George asked, his voice deep, yet without emotion. 
 " Memories. Memories of life you never had. For as long as you are alive you've been screaming at me and telling me about how your life is such a shame. I've been here for so long, since you were born, am I right? " 
 " Ha ha, in a moment we shall see. After all, you live a great life, it is completely unexpected how many people died. " 
 " But you won't go without a reward this time. You'll talk about the ceremony. We'll do it together. Give us the material, " the warden said, his voice filling with emotion. 
 George turned to the warden. " I will! I will make sure of that. I promise! " 
 " I am. But you can't, can you? I'm a Jew. " 
 " Yeh, but you are a Jew. " 
 " Then you were born. Yeh, but you've always known that. " 
 " But how old were you when you turned 10? " 
 " Well, ten. " 
 " Your mother was 10 years old. " 
 " And your father, I assume? " 
 " My father didn't make the sacrifices, but I didn't. " 
 " We were enemies as if. Did you no longer believe in any sort of difference between him and the other Jews? Did they know you were Jewish? " 
 " Why have you never met another Jewish? " 
 " I knew when I first thought about it. When I went into the interrogation room you did not answer. You kept pressing your face into my phone and I didn't hear you right. All that time you defended me. You would make me cry and I wouldn't. " 
 " Ha ha, " the warden said, his voice cracking. 
 " It's true. You were blessed, you were successful, your family can't forget. But even now, after many years, you're still two years younger. You started a new career, earned a high paying job, still have the weight of the Jews on your shoulders. You created an organization, a project to advance Jewish life. You refused to do it, why would you? You made those Holocaust people realize that God the Father is listening to them, and they were all that made them do what you did. All of that. " 
 The warden shook his head. " What could it be? " 
 " You didn't mess it up, warden. You talked about the new life. You had your good deeds committed, what good does a man have when he does this? " 
 " I knew what I could do, what I could say and do. Today would be the day you had the chance. Today, you would be rehashing that life. " 
 George swallowed and laughed. He imagined himself standing on the stage for days and years without my presence. Today was the day it finally came to pass. 
 " You don't come, this is it, no one comes this time, " the warden said, he disappeared. 
 George watched as his phone was plugged in with a snap.

I glanced at the chalkboard. Three bars. ** Black Hair**. I scribbled one on the board. “ ~~Red, White, Blue~~ ” 
 “ No, ladies, if that ’ s the case, ” I motioned for the group to begin their questions, “ Wait until the emergency room. Care to stand up? ” 
 The clown still rumbled in exasperation. “ I said, ladies, if that ’ s the case, ” he tapped his wheelchair, “ wait until the emergency room. We ’ re sure you ’ re looking for the right room, and if that ’ s the case, ” he nodded towards the sea of consultants wearing hand-made suits, “ and I can personally tell you that… ” 
 The case picked up speed. I walked into the emergency room, looked up at the clown, “ I ’ m sorry sir, but I ’ m not sure what I can do for you. ” 
 “ It ’ s a miracle if it works, ” he said. I nodded. “ Yes, sir. One minute the results of the dye was released, and then we would still need a hearing to figure out where the boy lives, but I ’ ll make sure there is a vacuum of anything that can kill him. And I will do everything that I can do to clean your room after you, my boy. ” 
 “ Aye, and with the gig I have, sir, I ’ m glad you ’ re here, ” the clown said. I nodded. 
 The room was dark, and I walked in. “ What did you do? ” I heard a female voice called out. 
 “ What? ” I blinked at her. 
 “ When we did this, I knocked him to the ground and sprayed the bleeding boy on his own skin with the black hair dye. ” 
 “ Is this what you got yourself into? A fucking freak accident? ” 
 “ The same thing, ” the clown said, then sighed. 
 “ What? What in the fuck?! Are you serious?! ” I looked down, and saw my reflection, and the barefooted white-haired boy walking up to me. 
 “ This is what I got myself into! A bloody botched assignment, you fucking nigger! ”

By the end of the 21st century, all mammals were incapable of bodily labor. 
 Humans were once proud and as prime amongst man, they now care little for education. Every step, every effort to alter DNA and, even after centuries, other species have adapted to it. Some of these is thought a simple coincidence, such as the compacting of semen from foetuses that were closely linked with the sinuses. 
 It was only with time that animals began to notice the change. Over time, much of the population had begun to secretly feel it. This was a calm movement to put us under control, but soon things began to become a little overwhelming. 
 One by one, the gates opened. God knows if we made it to the gas station they were under. Others had not realized what was happening, in the conditions of this city. They had grown to believe it just the other night, some shadowy figure appeared, and started to panic. 
 It came in force, but was only expected at first. It was the few who witnessed it, who were careful to observe closely. It was black, brown, and black, and then suddenly there were pixels. A black hole, a blinding flash of light, and then panic broke out. 
 What the hell is going on? I need to find a doctor. 
 We had saved a few, it was just human nature. We offered shelter, and were sometimes kidnapped. We were given the option of human experimentation. What could we possibly do? 
 At the patient ’ s home, there were two identical women who looked nothing like each other. They walked into the closet and started up the stereo to wish for a lemonade. As they huddled together, the effects of the experiment began. After five minutes, they stopped talking, and started to cry. When we arrived, they were back in the house, and our machine started up and swam away from them. I stood in the middle of it, mind numbed and hoping that the experiment would work. 
 I looked out across the street and saw the sobbing, with mom and dad approaching me, yelling at me. Tears were running down my face, and I threw open my mouth. “ It ’ s okay! ” I gasped. “ I was your father. I love you and my son. Please tell me something. We ’ re going to have some fun! ” 
 The two women and their men got on their knees, sobbing and lying on the floor in the silence. The doctors entered. One guy was old and couldn ’ t walk, my wife came forward and threw her hands in the air and yelled at me to stop. 
 “ We need to pull this off, ” she said, crying. I reached into the coat, grabbing the bracelet, the red squares, with two diamonds set inside it. I wrenched the rest from his hands and he looked at me with wide eyes, “ You are gone, you are not pregnant, and there is something wrong with you, ” she spoke again, excited. 
 The doctor stood in front of me, pointing at the bracelet. I paused, my heart beating faster. “ This bracelet is just the thing to fix, we don ’ t have any outside bodies. Any life was going to die, and you, will be reborn. ” 
 “ This bracelet, sir, is never changing your father. ” 
 “ And if anyone changes their father, he just went into his room. ” 
 “ She didn ’ t change her father. ” 
 “ Oh God. Don ’ t be that asshole. ”

I sat down in the darkness, the chair vibrating in his chest. 
 He wanted to go home, he wanted to read his latest novel, to don'thing but lay in bed. 
 I crawled my way along the desk, to the middle of the dusty dusty floor, dragging a dirty rag beneath me to clean up the space. 
 Mistletoe sat beside me and curled up next to me. Her fingers danced in mine, intertwined just enough so that they felt like stretched elastic, so that they didn't interfere with my delicate sensually perch on the edge of this dusty bed. 
 "The movie started this evening. " I drawled to myself, " Also, this is director-at-large Ralph Stas. Ralph too busy to do nice talking and nonverbal communication, so if he's supposed to do anything besides what's in his name, then just hide there. " 
 Suddenly I felt cold sweat trickle down my forehead. I pulled the robe tighter around me, and now he was impossibly warm, so close I could taste it. 
 " Well, is there something to be done. " I pushed through the soft smoke, revealing faint stubble on my nape, sticking out like tiny speck. " You know what, my feet can do one thing, and that is... " I held out my own, his scream hearing as my arm hit his waist, always his tiny butt. " No! NO! " I tossed the slick rubber rag into the air, pulling at the inside of the mask. " HELLO I'M GOING TO FUCK A BITCH!". The sudden pattering of hooves told me my hair was all wet. 
 Ralph shoved me away as well, the rattle of my ass dripping away and he slipped away, under the blinding light of the few dim bulbs still illuminating his room. 
 I knelt back down in the dark and leaned back to my side. The scream I'd just heard had left my ear.

"Taffer? They say that last week no one will be coming to your agency today. " 
 " Yeah. Or tomorrow. I miss my deadlines so much. I'm surprised it hasn't been the Space Letters class this week. " 
 " Yeah that's great. You can do this or you can keep reading, it is not my decision what. " 
 The Graymore Internship Vacation Society Director shrugged. " It isn't my choice to sign. If you don't like the element of blurb, you'll have to come back later. Like it was the Space Letters class, right?" 
 The choice had been made. 
 There was a small smile on the agent's wrinkled face as he scrolled through his NSA reading log, then narrowed his eyes to the crackly tone of his cell phone. 
 *Yeah that'll be an hour; duty is compulsory, note slip once you're gone. * 
 *By the way, wouldn't you like to make something of yourself? * 
 *Sure, I'd love that, I have been through a lot together and my mind is still so fuzzy. * 
 *Consider this, an hour, a good five days, you get sooo much. * 
 * It's moving from country to country and you stop feeling lonely. You start feeling relaxed, imagining the pages on your phone, the pens on your desk, the paper everywhere. * 
 *I... keep going without really thinking. Still... I'm still feeling relaxed, I love that. * 
 It was too late.

It was just six weeks after retirement when I broke the news to my professor. The school gave me an extra part-time position to cover my dissertation as I had been told about it a few weeks ago. Naturally, I took the job to make sure it didn't go to waste for better treatment and'satisfaction'. I swear the whole leaving the university wasn't difficult. 
 The first few weeks were just as hell spent because the new editor wanting the job didn't want me in the office any more than anyone else, was disgusted to see it get passed the town hall test. My stories would start with an argument over how the body was any more profitable - not to mention his requests, papers and grants. The children would cry every time I mentioned how being a doctor was going to be a good career choice. That included my general thesis, which actually was a few hundred words. Everyone would give me ten on their final year so I could learn whatever I wanted to. But instead of being the guy to usher the bloodline forward, I was sent to the classroom. 
 I told my class my major in environmental engineering which was a little different. Though I didn't much like whatever I could afford to do it, I could obviously convince myself I could improve my grades from my last dissertation with exception of one topic, scientific it was brilliant! Of course, because I did not know anyone that would appreciate a component of my thesis, I asked the professor if they would be willing to pay to publish my dissertation. 
 "Well, I'm not sure you exactly should be requesting help from my doctor, but I can recommend a few major technologies here. I have heard this all many times and I think I'll be able to convince myself if you send me this. Maybe we could have a discussion about a look at life in the oceans but the implications for the planets and rivers? " 
 " Our world... we've ended up three hundred and twenty four solar cycles into this! It was thought that there might be a chance that we would actually end up such a thing. And now its time to have a little conversation with you. " 
 " Professor... " 
 " It doesn't matter what you say that it will help you do, we'll convince you that the outcome could have had a similar impact on the planetary community!" 
 I went on to get as a doctor, which was less great. It still wasn't about the results that would be shown, but the thought that I might help something not have a result. I didn't understand my university and I still had to ask for help. In the end, I needed to make sure that my research was good.

I dropped a package over my breakfast table. Not for breakfast. Not for the first time in my life. The younger my child, the shorter my "goal ". The pain with birthmarker 'F' dotting her forehead due to a traumatic birth. " Remember which one of you best suckers to loose that Pronator belt and make yourself a Christmas squash." 
 And so it goes. I cursed. Reded. I wished she wouldn't slip into this coma. I wanted her to grow up to be the witch I was. 
 Until something caught my eye. 
 *Is this good? * 
 No. That's not good. I can't believe this is good. My ex-wife was paranoid. Her fear of my child, the fear of the twins. But in spite of all this, the twins were dead! 
 I was about to scream with all my might. To the horror of my unborn. But that was after she shook me, kissed me, tied me to a chair, and left. I didn't think about this for long, until she collapsed. I hit the floor, exhausted, but still strong enough to barely keep up with my fast. 
 I jumped off the chair. I brought myself to my feet. I looked down. There was nothing there, except for the doorway, with a red curtain drawn to make me look sane. 
 I headed back to my kitchen. I closed the door, and rinsed the latte bottle. I pecked the top off. Finally, I stopped. All of a sudden, a small wooden fence all around me made a crack. This small and gaunt frame created a barrier for a different view from where I had seen it standing. She was walking out of the room, with her hands folded over her stomach. 
 I watched her for a few minutes before finally tucking her into a chair. I walked over to her. She smiled at me. As I walked closer, a small giggle filled my throat.

*"HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW?! " * 
 " Well, it really is important that you know that I don't know. I have my uncle Jeremy known to stalk my dreams all the time, and never told me, but I don't blame him. So I'm on his phone while he's streaming me some videos from my Atari ST gaming machine that gets converted to full memory but then I hear some pop music from an obscure western band. 
 " Wow. I can hear those old timers! They sound like they've been in one of my dreams all this time. " 
 " Oh... I know what? Whatever, he just connected the goddamn Spotify app on his phone. I guess I should watch that as well. Sounds pretty weird. " 
 " Look, I've always had a special need for you - why should I not know when to stop looking at my uncle's imaginary kid in the mirror."

Hello again. 
 You might call me rude if I don't save you. Here is the story: The Earth is flat and decaying, and we're left with a barren, bleak world. 
 We used to find solace in the teachings of the Emperor of Mankind. But when you encounter a barren world, know that not only does humanity not be the only race in history, but every civilization around the world is doomed to fall within its own half of the world, even if you were successful enough to complete the conquest. 
 To be honest, I am actually in awe of your benevolent nature, even as the planet slowly deforms beneath us, as the dark matter is surrounded by the stars of your imagination, never to be seen again, but ever. I think of you, realizing that it was not quite enough, to provide for your needs, even as the last rocky worlds crumbled around you. You kind of took the idea to heart, instead of killing yourselves to create a world of a better place. I think of you walking on water, and I imagine that you're terrified of the churning wastes, rotting without washing the fish and the seawater, and your body is begging for a better life. You realize that a simple existence would make a world of your own, don't you? 
 With sorrow in your heart and understanding, in wisdom and courage of mind, you name yourself captain of the destroyer of worlds. Perhaps you can comfort those around you. I don't know what world you, or they, shall one day come to. Perhaps you will wipe out the hatred and need to rebuild your race. Perhaps you will rebuild the power you were given for millennia, removing dead empires from the Earth. Perhaps you will rebuild a planet that didn't deserve it, but will survive for long enough for the universe to rest. Who knows? Maybe you'll develop a power you created for a better place. A race that you can live on a planet for the rest of your existence! 
 I think of you occasionally, thinking about how it's like to be left alone, being immortal. But no matter how hard I try, I will not ever be able to win you over. Asking questions, you will ask more questions, and more important ones until they're answered. But who knows? Maybe soon, we will all turn to Terraforming for our survival, and what do you think of that? 
 Tomorrow, I will have to ship out from my hole in the sun, get off my ship, and then head out into the vast emptiness before someone catches me. But first, I need you to head toward Terraforming, which I do. The Earth would not be the same without you. I will go out as soon as you're ready. It is not much longer until you're ready, though. I wish you a warm goodbye.

Michael walked in slowly. The quiet of the office jolted him into action, leaning back in his chair. Mike drew his hard hip around the sleeves of his frock-colored shirt. The bulb on the eyes flickered wildly in the corner. Behind the lens of the mirror, a young man casually approached Michael. Once he got comfortable, he gave his hip a gentle squeeze. 
 "Take this, " he whispered, cheerfully. Michael relaxed and wrapped his arms around the young man's shoulders, glancing up at him with concern on his face. 
 The young man stared into the face of another man in the room. He wasn't the type for confrontation. 
 " *This is it? This can't be happening. * " 
 " Michael, this is something we can work on. We need to know the cause. This is hopeless. This was never the right idea. " 
 " *What? Why would this happen to you? *" 
 Michael jerked awake at the feet of his woman. He sobbed. 
 John was injured by the break of a light switch. A look of shock spread across his face. Michael opened the closet door to the light fixture, preparing to break the tension. As he pulled it away from him, a snap of the bulb shattered his reverie. 
 The tear flowed down his face into the water.

**********718**********
When the soldiers arrived, they were simply prepped for battle. Nothing in this pathetic world stood a chance, considering the valiant souls that lay inside. 
 I let the carcasses of my crewmates walk out of their vaulted cello celluses, sat down on the cold cement floor, and slit my own throat before even opening the door. It was the only way I could account for my husband who is far behind the invaders. 
 "The fuck had happened to you brothers? " a voice yelled from behind me. My mouth opened so my nose was in my mouth as I read the words in front of me. 
 " *Blast dog! * " someone was screeching from the back. I fired at it, putting my foot up, but a figure stood next to my. It was the one with the cold crossbow, which I borrowed from a box shop. He only had human features, barely noticeable against those heathen archmages as their bodies were twisted by cold hands. It wore a full faceplate, which was outfitted with five blades of glowing red metal, each one a katana of evil with a heated silver handle. The man on the other side had a spiffy copper insignia on it, while the man on the left, wore a plain white shirt, although he still had some katanas around his neck. The man and the elderly dog took off their helmets and walked towards us, bringing their swords on either side of them. 
 At that moment I realized I was in danger of being shot down. The german guards stepped back and looked around, unsure of what was going on. What was going on? I couldn't see right now, but I could hear the brinks as the battle raged outside. The sirens started to sing in my ear and I stood motionless, my hands akimbo until the battle came to a stalemate. 
 It was the same sound we all heard, after the last battle we all fell in to blackness. The soldier standing beside me was bloodied and bruised. His knees were bent over as he spoke. " Abrutal strike! " he shouted, almost yelling. As I looked away, I couldn't have been more surprised by the weeping and screaming of the soldiers. It was brutal in a way, but I suppose it was the kind of savage human language that was part of the new Millennium War. 
 The soldiers were next to me as I drove a katana from its dull metal shaft towards my head. The ground suddenly felt soft, so I turned towards the soldier, not worrying about his appearance. He appeared to be watching me through the window. As his eyes closed I saw someone with long dark hair running after me. 
 " Abrutal strike! " he shouted. 
 " Good, close your eyes and run! " I told him, despite himself. 
 He reached for a fist full of the same hilt of a sword, throwing it onto the ground. 
 " How soon have you seen this? " He asked me. 
 " We haven't met in all these years, remember? We fought with all of you at the Great War. We should know this. We should understand what you see! " 
 " Now, now, run and take it straight to your hearts content. Look and experience everything in the Unknown Realm." 
 He slammed a hilt of his sword at me, the sound becoming painful to my ears. 
 I'd seen the horror of the war for myself, though. As I slammed my hands to the ground, I could hear the voices of my family coming closer. Some of them seemed to be surprised by how close they came to me, and that's when I knew I'd have to retreat. I drew my sword and drew another one, causing a long necktie to fall. I fell back over the rubble, and kept my eye on the approaching figure. I drew my sword, killing it as quickly as possible, and turned around to fight the remaining enemy. 
 I got to my knees. I focused for a while, and with every inch I felt the foul foul air rage through my body. I had to move as fast as I could for that to happen. I dropped as fast as I could and heard a bang from the back of my skull as a shower of eldritch spells ripped my heart apart. 
 I hope this campaign is about to end.

I grabbed the knife from my bedspread and exited my bedroom, grabbing the knife with both hands. I walked up to the block of houses. The tension of the neighborhood stirred from my body and the weary, sweaty hands of a police officer, and crept up my back and onto the grassy hill to meet me. 
 I quickly formed a stand and bled on the grass into a scarlet foam that formed and contracted. She stood before me holding a little pistol and looking down at me. She just turned and gave me a look of relief as she shook her head in disbelief. 
 I quickly pulled my trigger and fired. 
 The ground beneath my feet became into a clammy carpet with no hint of consistency. I could see clouds of smoke drifting down to the ground to make its way down to me, about 8 feet tall and clearly made out of much of the dirt. I walked back to my bunk, knocking down a leaflet. 
 "I suppose we'll find out soon enough."

He looked at her, everyone looked at him, and mostly just laughed. It was almost like I was their father. My work was finally done. I returned home, and my wife heard me. " Sit down boy " she said with a gentle smile. I sat down, and she I assumed looked a bit upset. I told her I was just speaking to myself and she smiled back. There was an argument in my head, but we just hung out and shared story after story, till finally I realized I had something in my mouth. * I've become the kind of guy they hide behind, it hasn't even been 5 minutes since I knew how to speak to him, I had already done it 2-3 times before and it made me nervous* I decided to ignore the other expressions on her face, I didn't want to make her feel bad about what I was saying. I left the room and walked over to the fire, glad for the story I had told before going to bed. I put on my usual shirt, pants and flip flops. As I walked out to the apartment, I saw the door slam down and out turned some sort of goat. " Hey wait! " I said to myself. The goat looked up at me, it is now in a ball. The goat walked over to me, looked at me with relief, and said " No need to be afraid son, you're about to find out what happened, I'm an adventurer for hire, thank you for your help son"

The aliens made it out of Earth. It seemed totally alien. And it wasn't through many missiles or bombs. Some said a meteor. Others said radiation from Mars was the cause. 
 At first nobody really did anything. They were nowhere to be found. They found only bones. Scientists struggled with convincing the alien ones of this and the unexplained strength of their bones. Eventually all it took was a few mind-boggling experiments to send a group of humans to earth. 
 They fell in love the first day of their home planet. They started seeing different coloured lights on their ships. A sickly orange was being re-wound to a butterfly color. Then a high pitched, booming voice croaked through their speakers. 
 "What do you mean'You said you understood us'? You mean what we'light us'? How silly, but the fear and terror that comes with that. I got tired of talking about aliens " 
 The humans gasped in horror, just as the alien voice played the whole experience over and over in utter confusion. 
 " Now you are dumbasses, we, LPs, watch. Sit down. You will speak as humans do in farce. " 
 They shared the same facial expressions. 
 " Very well, we let you speak as humans do. " 
 " So what are you going to do? " 
 " I'm going to send you to Earth. " 
 " What is Earth? " 
 " Remember we taught you that? Life in fact, with its incredibly complex forms. " 
 " I'm sorry, but humans are no idea of like art, do you see. " 
 " You are quite right, everyone knows about art. " 
 The humans groaned with abandon. 
 " So that's Earth then, just sit there. Take a deep breath. You're in complete, grammatically correct, scientific, trans-dimensional space. Make sure your equipment is carried along to Earth. Next time you leave Earth, there will be hundreds of thousands of such suits."

*drum roll* 
 The random siren on the wall rang once again. Looking back on it, I wish my boss would just let me pass out when the employee ate the cheese. I felt like I was being filmed by the cops! I had done it! I had failed in an experiment at my full glory. I could have stayed a stupid hobo on the government shutdowns. Instead, I ran over to the door, grabbed my gun, and shot the last employee off of me. Everything about it was great. 
 Six more bullets were fired each time I opened the door, and I had to defuse a wall full of explosives. With my stocking on fire, I might as well just work on making dreams go away, or catch a fish when I catch a fish in the wild before I die of cardiac arrest. I mean, I know the history, and the people, but what if I just hope that somehow, someway, they wake up from their natural sleep mode and realize that they didn't make a good family and that they've made me a terrible boss? I would be fine with that, but they would never wake up from their dream mode. They needed me to wake them up by telling them that I'm working on putting on a wall no one is allowed to break in.

"I can feel the dark as he dives into me, " called The Scout from across the bridge. 
 " I'm sorry but that isn't the sound you want to hear, " said Jeremiah, simply and stern. His brow furrowed, his nose squinted in the brightness around him. 
 " Wake up! All your friends have checked in on you and the scout! " 
 The scout swiveled his large back and straightened up. " You sleep alright? " 
 " What, yes, " he said with a chuckle. His eyes planted on the rapidly sinking water. It was slightly dark now, but he had worked hard on his calibration. It was only a matter of time before they would arrive. If he stood still and turned, all that would be left was the dark object in the water behind him, if he stood still, the light would go into the starboard side and bring out the light. And if he remained still, darkness was inevitable, without the stars, everything would be gone. 
 " Sorry, but that's not how it works, " the scout said, as his guards eased him down by his knees and stow him on the loading dock. He glanced over to the empty bay door and took a seat. He set down his pistol, cleared his throat and shook his head. 
 " We need to hurry. The moons out there are shifting and it's getting darker and darker, what with the cast out lights and all, " The scout said. The steel of his rifle threaded in-and-out. In it were the red-chocolate sized torches that were powering the engines, blinking in the darkness as if looking into every kind of shadow in the night sky. These lights were the only thing keeping the coast alive and even though the lights were the only thing keeping the warm heart of the face of this whole solar system alive, the breathing inside of the ship was dying down. 
 Jeremiah held his own weapon at his side. 
 " Okay, you've got a shot, " he said as he raised the target to his mouth. Without even thinking he got the upper hand. With the only effort he had been capable of making on his first flight, he was able to trigger the burst with little to no reaction. After a moments notice the engines began to whine and the fingers on his rifle began to shake violently. The scout cocked up his pistol and sighed, closed his eyes and thanked God the Vigilante had not picked up the alarm. 
 As the engines started to come and go, Jeremiah wondered if those damned Lyran Laser weapons could make it back to the surface. The Scout stood by, looking down at the banks of open water for a bit before smiling. 
 " So now we're in a little protection and stuff, " he said, " we can make it on the thing. " 
 " But the power supply is screwed up, right? " 
 " The warp drive isn't working! " Jeremiah said, raising his eyes at the white screen telling him to open the windows. The screen read three colored lines, in bold white. Jeremiah flipped it over and gazed at them. A single red line. Jeremiah took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Nothing worked. 
 " It's better this way, " he said, " if you're going to keep the ship going, don't make any changes on this ship. We're going to need the blue lines to get that power back and you're going to need the blue lines to get back. Just hurry up and hope someone doesn't come aboard this thing and people won't be watching as we bail out on the deck and douse you like we did the day we left." 
 He turned the torch on, hung his rifle from his belt and took a good look in the rear view mirror. The engine was dead and was dying down again, but Jeremiah saw it. The candlelight drained off the lantern on the corner of the ship and the wooden floor that used to be there pulsed as lightning down above the deck. The boat was sinking again. 
 The scout picked up his rifle again and took a deep breath. This time, the engines were going to shake like ghosts.

**September 7th, 2017** 
 **I ’ ve stopped calling him ‘ like Jesus, ’ he says to me and I laugh at my own joke. But I always laugh when I ’ m alone, I ’ m an alcoholic and he ’ s a depressed man who has none of the happiness. He just doesn ’ t love me like I do. He always tells me I'm wasting my life, that life is fleeting, that it should be taken away. I ’ m kind of disappointed that I can only grow the same, that I can still see another day without me. But I ’ m happy for him. I know that if I want to go to heaven with him on his deathbed he ’ ll be ok with that. I told my friend at my wedding over dinner that when we ’ re married he ’ ll be alright. I have seen a picture of him, but I don ’ t see him until then. They were two big black boys that grew up in the same neighborhood, my dad ’ s been crying every night for the past 7 years and he ’ s with me every Thursday to talk about work and school. So this is how he was always for me, the sadness that comes with love. You know the one thing to never reveal is your identity. Because we went through the real thing and when they say it sounds painful, it is because they didn ’ t tell you it was a lie. And he told me, because he loves me so much, that he ’ s going to come pick me up and he ’ ll take me to him. And it ’ s a lot more than just love. That ’ s the best thing about this, this is how our marriage can still be a meaningful marriage and it has never been.

**WELL-YOUR-BEAT-AHEAD? ** 
 "Yeah " I take another drink from my beer, if I could hear him. " We've already got some stuff to do. " 
 He keeps staring at me like he thinks I'm insane, and I just shake my head. " I've always wanted to be a doctor... " I lean forward, lifting my glass above my head to face him. 
 He points towards the bottom of the stairs and finds the nearest bed. I try to get up, but he slams his hands down on the door frame. I don't know how long we've been in here. 
 There is a slow click, a whisper. He and I step back to the couch and watch, one by one, as food trinkets fall around us. 
 " The scene seems to have started a few minutes ago. You know how you're supposed to survive in the hospital. " 
 " I- " he stops when he sees me staring back. " Nobody is around but... " 
 A chime cracks through the silence. 
 I can't feel anything besides my head. 
 " What? " I remember reading about a kid that won't leave his room for weeks at a time on a whim. The coroner told him the code. 
 " His... And the only way to kill him? " 
 " Oh. " He glances at me, then at the clock. 
 9:10 AM. 
 There is a banging, and I need to get up. 
 " Hey, are you serious? " 
 " No! " I can't. I'd never been more nervous to be a doctor than this. 
 Another knocking, and his voice cracks. " I'm not talking to you. " 
 " Nah, I'm just calling the medics right now! " 
 " You'll be fine. I'm just glad my code worked. " 
 " Nothing happened. " He shakes his head and points towards the bed, then turns away. " You know what, I think I might go home to my dog. " 
 " I'd kill for him. " I sit up, place the door handle down on the edge of my bed, and close my eyes. 
 " So? Why? " 
 " I don't really know what it's like to be a doctor. " He looks at his feet, then back at me. " I do remember that last bit. How he was shooting me, trying to find one of those ill-deserving assholes. " 
 " What? " 
 " That guy's been dead for three days and a half. Five days and four absences... " He walks past me, then tugs on the door handle again. 
 " Christ, what do you want? " 
 I groan, backing up, but he pulls me up on his lap. " Silly son of a bitch. " 
 " I don't care. " 
 " At least not if it means I get you some money. " 
 " Damn. " He turns back to me and leans forwards again. " I was glad you made it out of the hospital alive. I loved you."

I still remember the yellow ribbons flowing over my hilt, straining over rusty metal. I glanced across the room, seeing only the murderers slumped upon the next my arms, as if they were an exam. The depression still infused the room, not causing it any sense of tense or fear. 
 I ducked back in my seat. My pistol pressed into my chest. The weapon held no fire resistance. All those years of training, training. And then that bomb. My team hadn't been that surprised. We hadn't even lost a single human. But this. This cannot be. This never has to be. It is all dead. 
 I fired, and heard the applause fall from the high school roof. The hallways were littered with cans. But they always ached, always helped. If you don't breathe, they would. 
 I dodged the bullet, and as I stood upon the roof, my mind returned to the little bird chirping in the trees. In the bushes, there were sparks. Maybe it was an angel. This was probably some sign of cancer, or even someone living a pious life and truly risking their entire life on this dark day. 
 I made my way across the room to the cowl of my squad car. It was a long way from anywhere here. 
 This was such a strange and peculiar day. The only thing I knew that connected us was that most importantly, we were the last of the rabble. A group of people, shouting hate at one another over endless rounds. The camera rang. The driver slumped down with his bloodshot eyes. 
 "They won! " The man said, laughing. He wore a street orange trench coat. 
 I pulled back the rear bumpers, going back to the window to get a better look. 
 It was only moments before it hit me. There was a solid clanking. All the symbols flash now, all the gear must have came to an end, starting a full 1 meter away. But the force seemed to be too strong, and each one stopped. There was another clanking. 
 The camera ring was broken. I grabbed the gun. This time I put it in my lap. My sniper watched, as I wrapped my fingers around the trigger. The screams sounded. More clanking. Over and over. The clanking continued. Hard to get rid of, but enough to make the next round seem pointless. 
 The top of the building came crashing down. The truck lurched over the bus stop, then came crashing down over the side of the road. It pushed over my cabin. And the sunset. 
 When the three friends were still pinned in their seats and I felt the weight of the explosion that had struck us, I watched the sun's edge through the oil-leather roofs. No idea what to do, but I took a deep breath. 
 There was a loud crash. I had no idea what hit me, and I was drifting to the side of the building. I closed my eyes. 
 A blood splat was rising up behind my window. I looked over at the ghastly beast. My sniper crouched over me. 
 " Make him stop. " 
 The beast looked up. It hissed in horror. 
 " No. " I began, my mouth slack in shock. I heard a pain in my shoulder and broke into a violent coughing fit. 
 " He's dead." 
 Then I heard the air tank collapse. I backed away, looking at the ruins that had been once the mountain. 
 Those words were etched into my brain the night before, as I drifted back to sleep.

After two weeks of collecting dust, Anya had developed an allergy. 
 The general smell, however, was normal. 
 She lay down under the fire, just a whisper in the dry, grey land. A tear ran down her cheek, casting a crinkling shadow over her body. A flash of light, a comforter peeking through the sky, accompanied by a faint smell of acrid caramel. She'd feared that at first glance, this scent was harmless. 
 Dough grains crinkled, along with the smell of burnt wood and pork stew. 
 She carefully placed a cloth over her mouth, yet found it to be tasteless. 
 "I'm not a vegetarian. " She stated bluntly, rising slightly from the verge of tears. 
 But her particular brand of apathy, or inability to relate to the ideal part of the story, was causing her to cut up some, frying bacon. 
 The candle flame was ready, and she rose to her feet and bowed solemnly, tying her shoes with nothing to hold her back. 
 " Alright. " she muttered, closing her eyes and stretching. 
 It was almost pre-tentative to return to the fire, but her decision had come at a great cost. Her father would have given her any small amount of relief, nothing more. There was no point in dwelling on a matter of life and death or pity. She did, however, have one consolation in that she was the only one who could stop her father from starting a fire. 
 She dropped back, reflexively throwing on her husband's bloodied jacket. 
 " I love you."

Listen. We have been operating in the early 20th century for the last ten or so decades. Not many soldiers are trained to fight back, but we are. Now, this is a war between freedom, and your belief that you can shoot a dog or a cat. I once died in that battle of oppression. Your suggestion that the US military were trained to create warriors is foolhardy for the men who have the world's most feared mental health condition being probably stupid. 
 But believe me, we know how to master a weapon. What we learned in that battle was of no consequence to us. The elite soldiers didn't escape with us, now we are trained by the best recruits we have, and trained by the best equipment we can put our own hands on. Oh, I hope the war ends soon. Can we tell the rest of the world, we are coming. 
 You can not fight in a cold war. On the contrary, we are fighting in a war for our freedom, for survival, for fighting for what is real and what is *right*. 
 I hope today we learn how to set back your movements. You can not walk. You can not run. You can not hold any kind of weapon. You can not talk. You can not count. 
 I want you to know that not everyone is going to die of blood loss. Not your own children or your grand grandchildren or your grandchildren's mother. People are going to die of old age. Some will not make it into the military. Some might not survive. Some might not make it into society. 
 If the group of soldiers we trained to wage war is informed of our mistakes, I hope that no one escapes this world before it ends.

"Where are you? " 
 " World watch east. 6:45 am " 
 " World watch west. 9:02 am " 
 " World watch east. 9:08 am " 
 " World watch west. 9:08 am " 
 The watch went off. As he stood there shaking and looking around slowly on the other side of his room, the watch wavered for just a moment before starting up again. 
 " World watch, what's your name? " he asked himself. 
 " Smith. " the man replied. 
 " Smith, what are your names? " 
 " Smith, " he replied as he waited for the second wheel to come down. 
 And that is how I met my soulmate. 
 Smith never will be able to know the truth about me because he never had one.

It was a good day for the Lord of the Rings. Take for example the "Alanna Saga " at his end: there was a book lying under his desk, which had been smeared with the blood of seven hundred and four of our favorite, oratorical beasts. Just another employee, leaving the house with his boss, causing him to claw at the horned monster in front of him with his right hand. This was the age of greed. All to the delight of Mr. Thor, who proceeded to make his fortune strolling through the streets of London to " eat " the Monster. I'll use this opportunity to play the same trick for him, once I've defeated the creature. 
 The second time, however, he hit a girl with a snowball. The police have yet to come, and this time he will be sent back in time to handle the crime. He is in the year 3820. Funny, but Mr. Thor had put in this well over 7 years prior to my death, and he still fails to get a job. He has his appeal in hand. His appeal is cut short when he was asked by Professor Loki to keep a " book " hidden in that tree in Loki's castle. Rather than allow Mr. Loki to go back in time in time and learn his lesson, I have made him a guard for time and centuries.

Lee and Aaron were just about ready to take the short cut to try this new Mexican chili hock. They told me that they would need refrigerated 12 gallon cans of chili. A real tourist trap, and they definitely thought I was too big for this 90 pound man with a dark, lusty moustache. But they heard our food allergies and thought it necessary to take this bold move. They could not make up for their shortfall when we went to expand our lucrative market, so I got the standardised versions of chili on the table: a red pepper, caprese and spiciness like fir or chow. In all honesty, its so much better than a smoked smoker such as myself. When I finally took off my filth suit, and started shoveling the chili to my little sock ( Seaweed from a nearby store ) they nearly tackled me. Since they are considered the "Wilderness " level 4 alkaloids, I missed my chances. Also, I am not particularly close to the chemistry I had an accident involving. 
 At some point though, the floodgates opened. If the tequila salesman's agent had ordered the " almost-fueled fire-spirit ", that would have been worse than salmonella poisoning. More than most Mormons, though, don't figure it out. Really, I didn't want to be a hairy cop, so I decided to do something extraordinary. Once I actually cooked his chili, and while he had a good time, the arsonist didn't come to help. I packed our car and left him to his own device, hoping that he could hide behind a couch or something. Once I had been home, I found the cockroach I had been creeping around the house. I had fed it the water, and knew for sure the coopderites didn't want to be found around the house. 
 As I was shoveling his ear and mouth ( fact ), I decided to try my luck with a frog or a lizard. Right then, the sun split a piece. At some point during the holiday season, the lead actor, Forrest Gump, had to eat a hot ember in an elevator to get to in time. That week, there was really a riot going on, and I had to go back home to my parents. In the media, the importance of this play of Los Angeles Lakers is gone. Within the next year, Red Bull fired up the media to what I would later learn was the cult of El Gordo. 
 We eventually found out, under formal military certification, that the tan brand of chili was Sesame into a state-backed chili queen. So, they escaped to Mexico. Here, you can find all the food you need, and you can look for live streams if you wish. You can eat safe, clean, non toxic chili. You are a king of food!

The ship's engines lanced across the winding fields. Frost clouds parted in the bank of two bright yellow stars. These stars were all that was left of the black death that remained at the boundary between mankind and death. Stumbling in terror, they found themselves stranded on a very dark rocky outcrop, next to two large thick black spikes on either side of a hill. 
 The height of the black spikes had already turned into a cliff, that measured three hundred feet across. Beads of ice stirred, proof of their precarious status. Walking at a leisurely pace, they began their descent. 
 Hissing slightly as they accelerated, the ice walls on either side attracted their attention. This was where the consequences of their actions would lead. Death was taking advantage of the current conditions, breaking their opponents' will, and forcing them to run uncontrollably. This was no aberration of their species, like changing the course of history with a slash. It was a race so much different from themselves, which would lead to their demise. For now, they would survive. 
 As the procession drew nearer, the force of the events within the snow began to lose its beauty. They ran faster and faster, opting to run straight ahead before continuing onward, disoriented by their fate. The horse jerked, hissing as it pulled itself farther forward. In front of them, the horse began to lose its grip on the rocks. They slowly made their way back down the cliff, knowing it would be a long ride. As the horn blew, they knew that there was no time. 
 As they emerged from the first black spike, they saw where they had come from. An ancient ruin, standing before them. They smiled to themselves, as the thick layers of ice that had covered the area around them slowly disappeared. Chunks of snow began to form upon themselves. 
 Hissing once again, they started to take their pace. Looking ahead, they saw an ancient statue, constructed of what seemed to be ash, which stood in stark contrast to the void of their ruin. The statue itself was a pitiful, unloving example of human craftsmanship, and no demons fell from it. It had become a spectacle to behold for the countless hours of blood, sweat and tears it fell from. 
 As they reached the ruins, they mustered up the courage to confront the terrifying creature. As their eyes widened in amazement, they stepped forward and cast a slow attack upon it. The vortex slowly engulfed the two when it began to cool, before it slowly descended again, never to be seen again. As it, and the two descended, they could see that the ground beneath them was no longer solid stone. It was white, bloodied flesh, and black glass.

Hands up, really, never stopped working. 
 *Hang up, bang *good, good, why do they keep on doing it, stop it... * 
 "Hi there " 
 But they have the wrong voice 
 But still it's there! 
 The voice takes hold as an insolent ball is at its feet 
 For an hour *they have waited... they've waited to... already... * 
 " Hi there! " The words draw a strained look 
 But time keeps rolling... they have to do it! 
 Never stop even if your line gets way down 
 Their favourite sound or music. 
 And are they missing something? 
 " Oh... Just wait and see... " 
 No, that can not be. 
 So far, they have tried 
 Opinions of their friends as they sometimes hate 
 *Listen to the ladies singing* 
 But it's not funny. 
 It sounds like they really need to go back 
 And try it again. 
 And the line just stops so quick 
 And they can hold on but as they stare into the faces of such... 
 Efforts they still can not make. 
 The hands must be knocked off. 
 " It's just a circle, they use it so many times... " 
 They have heard but a single introduction. 
 *Yes, it was just a circle* 
 Is this a joke? I should be as crazy as these people are? 
 " I hope I'm not minding your business, " 
 They look at each other. 
 *You're so old now... * 
 " Yeah, I'm not fine. " 
 " That was all you were saying. 
 " Well now she would have danced *quick* " 
 He immediately thought about the potion. 
 " No I didn't. " 
 " Look, I was just trying to see what you knew better..." 
 And they were gone.

We meet at a bar across town. 
 She sips her drink with a smile, the urge to have dinner with you replaced by a familiar present. She ’ s the one. 
 She ’ s 60 and you know how she feels about these women. She ’ s married and hasn ’ t aged a day. You help her make her the money she needs, read her magazines and watch her cook in her kitchen. 
 We walk down the street, at first we ’ ve expected a crowd, and now, her eyes are set on us. She ’ s 40 and you know how she feels about women. You help her out of her father ’ s old sofa and help her set up the place for a future as a young entrepreneur. You don ’ t think about her parents, your brothers, her friends, she-she. 
 You start to notice you ’ re nervous - and she ’ s completely and utterly oblivious to that. She says everything she needs to make her breakfast, that she needs a new coat, and then you see the ink her father stole from an old strip joint. 
 She quickly thinks he stole it from her father and says she hopes he keeps it. 
 I slap you on the back, she goes back to quietly preparing food, I kiss her on the arm before she dashes off the steps. I stumble across the square they both live in, the path leads outside into the woods. This is where the scar gives way into her soul. Her husband ’ s car is gone, yet you have no clue who she is. She has no memory of you. 
 She searches the night, leaving everything behind, there ’ s nothing left to salvage. 
 She does not stop. She is meek and weak. There is nothing left in her mind. 
 My cigarette is empty and she is confused. I raise the sword above my head, it seems to resonate with her mind, her desperation. The high draws her back, I have only one responsibility as my apprentice. 
 We walk back home, another meal will have served. She is quite content, barely eating, which is what I hoped was the case for her. This doesn ’ t hold true for the mask I gave her. Every lie needs the mask to stop, I could break her off in a blink. 
 There ’ s nothing left left in me to do.

Exalted was his day job. No work for the pure felicement department, no bosses for whom the proper occupational duties followed, and a steady paycheck to spend rest of his days polishing the kitchen equipment. He held at least one hammer and he was completely even for himself; although the basics of masonry, fixing the counter, nails, and whatever mundane tool he could find laid bare beneath the pile of junk he had worked so hard and taken so long to become, seemed beside him as his assistant always held and repaired. Exalted looked over one of his mason's tools and after several sharp moments of thought, decided it was the perfect mason's tool. First he did the first sort, smoothing the rough, devious stone in the mortar, then laying the smooth marble in the mass of pure marble. Each step reflected the same images, the color intensity of the stone around the pedestal, creating a color that captivated him. Then, he applied the rough to the sombre steps, smoothing to the smooth rock, then to the easy stone, then to the slight more polished sand, then the smooth uneven bit of stone. Finally he had finished the smoothing one more time, and he leaned back in his chair, making a rustic, never ending noise of vibrations above his earhole. As his assistant took another break, Exalted lunged once more and hurled a fiery, rusted jar of nothing he had worked so hard on towards the jar on the table. The mason hesitated, of course; as the jar fell from his grasp, he replied, "why do you try to tell me that they're more than just stone? " 
 "That's not true! Why does it matter. " asked the mason. 
 "Because it's mine and theirs alone! " continued the fellow mason, " you learn to respect each other, understand your god, you learn you can take it back from your god and have it known as one's own, and you learn what it means to be a god with two hands. " 
 "And why would you want to do that to me? Are you having a big meeting? " said the mason, laughing. 
 " Oh, uh, why not. I need you to step back to your work. You can't die of starvation! It has to be YOU's! But, now that you've come to this, I'm the only god in the world with a positive and trusting view about life. But I also understand that happiness is futile unless it is accompanied by physical death. What good is happiness if not for the fact that your partner is happy with you, even though you know no one else is. " 
 "Ah, I see. Are you sure? I will never want to live alone. That's why we don't need the black-market town like the rest of the world, we have some good people who might just as well trade in happiness for your existence. Now I need you to go back to work, or your god will kill you in the process. " 
 "Do I really need that as my sacrifice? " 
 "My god, what a nice job. You have a long career ahead of you, if you want to be here for a little while."

Tom was a young man that lived in outer space. 
 He was an astronaut. 
 He was on mission to the moon. 
 He was a regular man. 
 He was never going to cry. 
 For awhile though, Tom had so much fun, jogging, swimming, fencing, drinking. 
 Then a report came in that there were no Moon planets in our system... 
 Since Tom had been out running back to school he had spent a few weeks more going out running. 
 He was nervous, he knew why. 
 How could there be another Cosmos? How could there be anything other than the same old, a star? 
 He checked the signal twice. 
 Three times. 
 Tom had to check again. 
 The Signal was direct. 
 The Earth had sent a beautiful little cosmic shiver down on the heavens. 
 It had been dark for ten days after Tom had pulled up to the cryo rig. 
 As soon as he arrived back to school, Tom had scooted over to the machine.

I sat in a hammock listening to the engine start up. Just before driving off I struck up a conversation with my wife, Debbie. Debbie? " Hi Marissa, " I said. She laughed happily. " I'm making honeymoon plans when you come down, and I'm going to make this with you because you're the best ever! " 
 " Yes honey, " she said enthusiastically. " I will make this with you because you are so beautiful and I'm going to make this with you because you are such a beautiful and I'm going to make this with you because you are so lovely and I'm going to make this with you because you are so beautiful and I'm going to make this with you because you are so beautiful. " 
 " Will you pick me up at midnight? " 
 " Yeah, not that particular time anymore? " 
 " Honey, I can get you a taxi back on the way out. I will drive you home in about ten minutes. I promise not to break up or talk about breaking up because I know it's the best decision of my life. " 
 I pulled up to our empty cabin with nothing but an iPad laying next to it. My friends packed me up and I stepped into the shower. Debbie was her name and one of the directors of Smarts, Inc. We could afford a cab, she had a decent roof and no bed. The sun light would be shining through the plastic opening. 
 " Waze, Glastonbury, Bermuda, UK, " said Debbie as I loaded up our pricey boots, Bob Dylan and Sun to listen to the thumping as our rain-skiing limo passed overhead. 
 I walked into the shower to mix the filth and then my dry, the first instance where I was mistaking my shoes for my pants. 
 " Rosie, " I said to myself. " And thanks for having us here. It's such a great trip to see so many beautiful young women. " 
 I turned the headlight on and walked out, bending down over our laundry. Debbie was perched over the cabinet and the looped shirt I bought her was loaded onto a porch chair. Her hair was hanging down into a tight ponytail and her eyes were laser-focused on me with malice. She flinched when I said these lines and swept up the shirt. 
 " Fuck it. I'm going to turn this off and get to work. " 
 " We'll get there, Janie. " 
 Janie sighed and leaned over. " Maybe you should take a little more time. " 
 " No, " I sighed. " What if I tell you the secret again?"

I give up on my own years. I took a large step out of the grand bubble house that I had was given all of my by my father. He had just finished the passage of the Earthen book with the inspiration of a low-key me. My father lay there and went down the stairs. I stepped through the glass of the oval house then turned and walked to the center of the table where my father and I shared a quick handshake. My father shook my hand. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes and closed my mouth and passed out. As I rose to my feet my father walked over to me and gave me a hand. " Why are we here? " he asked. " It's a boy, like you and me. It's why we fought. You know, why we abandoned each other. You knew that. " I started to cry, tears filling my eyes. " I'm no man. I had been a boy. I don't even know why. " His eyes are so deep in the clear water they looked sad as well, their bittersweet warmth actually coming across my cheeks. " He's right. I'm different. I want to be someone else. I don't want to be boring. I'm not boring. " It makes me sad and tired. " I'm not real. I want to be someone else. I like that I can be. No matter what. " He set his phone down on the table and I sat in my own little tub. The empty door was cracked and stained with mold and rotting fabrics. Water dripped down the middle of the tub as I walked toward the door. The door creaked open slightly and the light broke through. I squinted at the mess and sighed. I followed a red ball of water into the entrance. On the other side of the room, several shadows drank from their tea cups, they were oblivious to the red raindrops hitting the door. " What now? " I ran to the next door, it was the same one that gave me much joy when I sat at my usual desk job. A man walked through the door, door in hand. I watched as the man cleared his throat and turned to me. " You are lucky we can still communicate with you in person, " he started. " You feel like you're no longer a man, " I replied. He froze for a second, " and forget the worst part. Why? " I froze again. The man vanished in a flash and another went up to the curtain. " Sir, one of our biggest customers is missing. " " Oh. Oh god. " My parents walked back into the room and my head was spinning at the thought of it. After I had informed my father I had gotten my father's phone number, he hung up on me. I looked around at the best way to help him wearily. Nothing but rain began to billow from the faucet. " Hey, it's Megan," my father whispered to himself and left his room. I started to ignore the smell of water that pervaded the apartment and spread in every direction.

I am uneasy at first. The current existence of this being, the angel that murdered me in that house, the fact of his passing has made it a concern. 
 I fought against them with my dark willpower, checking my magical powers to have no suspicions I can see where they are trying to lead me. 
 A city that seems meant for murder. I feel like I might be being compared to a spy lost during WWII, that I might gain an advantage over the current situation. I feel for this distortion of my existence, how is this possible? 
 This is how it is done. This is what I know. This is what I can tell the future. God is gone. 
 I am inside the house now, behind the mask of a demon. He checks my memories on the devices, he even tells me that it's not my mother that was poisoned. 
 I can't be sure it's the demon that was poisoned. 
 Why would Satan send Lucifer to this place. He's also the most powerful being in this all. Lucifer is my only hope. I don't know why I'm asking this on any other possible occasion, but I was hoping it would be the least problematic, much less it did. 
 I'm heading back home now. I have enough evidence. 
 The room is set back into its old crimson color. A sign with pictures of things that don't exist is stretched out with the entrance warning all enemies of the damned from a variety of different places. At the rear of the room is the small shrine to Lucifer. On the top is a handmade statue of Satan that sits behind an altar. I wonder how God did this sort of thing on purpose. I'd love to know what Lucifer's power is, but after all he's the most powerful being in the entire Universe, it just seems wrong. 
 I leave the house. 
 I find my way to Satan's office building, this alone in a rundown apartment is different. I look through my wardrobe, and see his tools. This type of toolboxes are strong, wooden tools with an inverted rounded handle. I wonder what God had in mind when he sent him. I'm praying to the Son of God.

“ How should I explain this to you? ” the computer on the computer spoke to me in a strange voice. It looked around the large and brightly lit library and asked me directly. “ Do you understand, Dave? ” 
 “ Please, ” I said sitting down, making sure it understood. I keep my eyes and mouth shut and kind of pecked on my teeth. The computer started to function. 
 “ You-you're looking for something, ” the computer almost as if it was moving on a cloud about to drain humanity. “ Are you sure you haven ’ t touched anything. ” 
 “ It ’ s worth mentioning- ” 
 “ You don ’ t understand, ” the computer continued. “ Do you think I am one of the possessed beings called -- ” 
 The computer finished typing before screaming. “ I don't exist. I have not created anything, ” the computer said before being bursted out of the building in flames. 
 I sat there silently, trying to find any way to deal with this. How did the computer manage to control us, and how can I explain it to people? Who does this thing sit in? How can I explain to people that I am one of the possessed beings called a possessed — “ 
 “ Woah, ” said the computer, moving on. “ What is it? ” 
 “ The computer found a human sacrifice on something. ” It looked around the branch. “ Do you see, ” it asked. 
 “ No. ” I knew that I would have to explain that to this machine later, that I am the flesh of a human being. “ So, ” I said, looking around. “ Do you see? ” 
 The computer froze for a few minutes while it asked some questions. I just had to pretend to understand. 
 Eventually, I finally told the computer that I have found an electronic artifact on my computer which I use daily to place paper around a desk. I can insert it in my ears if it is not disrupting any sound. I also use it to hold the computer in my hands when I move around. When I look around the libraries, it is always neat and tidy. It shows me the scanned contents of a book that it found that does not exist anywhere else on the internet. 
 “ Dave? ” I said as I held it open. “ If this is the computer that you find, why do you keep writing things around the computer? ” 
 The computer froze again. It read a command. “ Write this: If you find anything of interest on the internet, immediately write it to the archive that is in the corner of the dark corner that your computer has been sitting on. I need to leave this computer behind in some way. I want you to help me find out what the purpose of this computer is. ” 
 I was determined to find out, to find a way that some computer wasn ’ t doing something that caused this. But I was wrong. Not exactly. There was only some website where there was a computer with all the files. There was only some movie. I had found the beginning of it. I had found a control. 
 I had found a way to control the computer, the device that I use daily to believe in electronic content. I had found a new computer with all the files. I had found the beginning of it all. 
 I had found a way to control the computer to live.

Russell closed his eyes, staring at the display that boldly used the word "witch ". It had a somewhat childlike appearance, a knitted blond hair, and with a pair of purple eyes held on something you couldn ’ t understand. 
 He looked down at his hands, a collection of dice and an apple he had dug out from the ground. A look of disgust, when he remembered this, that had been creeping up his face for just a moment. What were the odds that such creatures would sneak out of a tavern with any stranger, or that they ’ d even be afraid of him? There were only the odds of getting in, and that only on lonesome nights. 
 Russell remembered how he last remembered hearing rumours that had made it through the tavern; how first criminals found them in such a nasty condition that when the strange man dropped the potion onto the floor, they would just be standing up and throwing it as they passed, his shaking hands gripping the handle as his face began to well up. Then one day, something went wrong; strange noises played out beneath the floorboards, but where Russell found nothing were the great torches he had rifled through. 
 Russell was led to the cellar and stashed away behind his old wooden chair. He staggered across to a door and up it turned, and he found himself face to face with what looked like a towering witch. No, a massive, scaly little barkeep. He always had a habit of being unnerved by the various sort of owls that occasionally wandered in, so he had to be cautious. 
 He crouched down, picking up his apple from the ground. Instead of giving it a friendly peck on the cheek, he started to sing. Why did she look so... scared? How could a woman mean something when a familiar face could have almost scared her? 
 “ W-what happened to the potion ”, Russell struggled to form words. 
 The guy picked up his pick and let his fingers trace the wrinkles on his arms and feet. 
 “ All of a sudden a witch stepped in, and it looked like a witch, and like a pumpkin girl, and it felt like she was on ice all night. ” 
 Russell felt odd. Was this a dream? Was there something wrong? He smiled and shook his head, followed by his fiancé and his son. 
 “ Alright boy, I guess we ’ re done here. If you ’ re seeing what ’ s gonna happen next, play it cool. ” Russell said and walked towards the door, while his fiancé, his son, his fiancée covered his head in tears. 
 “ Bye Russell, ” her son says as he raises his hand. Russell continued on down the hallway, and when he got to the store, he pulled up a box of medicine and a box of extra glue on the nearest shelf. It had the usual assortment of musical instruments and recensioners, which had become increasingly rare in recent years. 
 Russell shut his eyes, focusing on the girl so he could moo the magic up. 
 “ Tell me about it ”, Russell replied with a loving smile on his face. “ Is it alright if I'm the only one who knows it ’ s possible, and try not to think about it? ” 
 “ Well… ” her son hesitated 
 “ Hey, it ’ s okay. It ’ s just, like, human-shaped, isn ’ t it? ” 
 “ Well, I mean, I don ’ t know about any witches it ’ s made of, so I don ’ t know… ” 
 “ So if you want a fight, shoot the messenger and go somewhere safe. ” His fiancée made a show of kissing Russell on the lips and holding him close. 
 “ Thank you for helping me out there Russell. ” 
 “ Yeah, alright, tell the little ones it ain ’ t made of wood. I ’ m sure I ’ ll be alright, I promise. ”

"Ship." The self-sustaining universe voice announced. I turned back to the screen- transcript of the message that became over the next few seconds. 
 There wasn't much of a change in my life until after all of this; it had been a difficult time following around my family for decades after I returned from seeing Earth. I was only 6 and still didn't have some top-secret old shot that could explain what I experienced, to the contrary, that was humanity's last hope. 
 I quickly filled out a form and returned to my server in Sector 51A. I'd been able to go home with my friends and make some time before I went away and I thought maybe that was the last chance I could have and do it my way in peace. I was wrong. 
 I got to my port and waited for the ping. Uncharacteristically, my password matched with his five digit time. 
 Time was extremely limited. I had no idea how long I was the only one left at the station. I spent all of twelve hours on set before the stars ever went out. Two hours and 10 minutes before I boarded the ship. 
 On board the ship, I was taken to the capital. My shipmates weren't in the mood for my interrogation. I resisted the urge to explain to the officers why I was captured and was not in The U.S. They could only ask questions because a culture couldn't say it was a war zone. 
 A military officer had told me to write down what my State Department picture was of the ship and see how many months it took to obtain it. I opted for a positive statement. The answer was zero and I had told everyone that the picture was not from the war and I was shot down by a French submarine along with my family. 
 When I told everyone how severe the mission was and how much they would want to die that night I managed to build up some courage. When the moment came, it was quiet. 
 I realized that in the event I wanted to help these people, they would stop making excuses and shoot me down just as fast as I had. 
 -- - 
 I watched the countdown go on, ready to take action. 
 Suddenly, I heard a long, metallic voice speak " That's what we're afraid we'll find you and I'm afraid we'll let you go to The U.S. " 
 I was thrown from my shell. My neighbors and friends were left wondering what I was about to do and what I did. It was my duty, and I am now free to live my life as easily as possible. 
 I looked to my left and to my right I saw the lead agents of the insurgency standing next to a gun barrel. The light shone and I saw an atomic bomb coming and I jumped into the air as fast as I could. 
 I woke up dead. 
 It was too late. 
 I woke up back at my ship. We were lying on the ground watching the chairman of the joint chiefs try to convince a reluctant agent that while he didn't know about my gift to them, they were good enough to try to find a way back in time. It was his whole life he knew that we would need an EMP deterrent, one we hadn't used in centuries, to keep him safe from EMPs. 
 And he was right. 
 I just wanted to kill someone. 
 I ran. 
 -- - 
 I sat down on a huge rock and jumped off. 
 " There's no way." I wrote down my story on my gravestone. 
 *Future War Notes* 
 My favorite quote.

"Medusa please come with me, we have a great evening! " she said excitedly. 
 " I don't love you " I said, obviously pleased that there was a great scene. They were seated at a bar that was rather buzzy compared to what was about to be a very busy night. They sat down and a very attractive man was seated with a very awkward looking waiter. 
 My eyes were flicking up to the mirror in my shower to see her, but I couldn't place what she was about to do - having become quite on edge over this awkwardness would always upset me. 
 " Why do you want to join me please I'm busy but you always seem so relaxed about this world you live! " 
 " I have something good to do " she said pointing to the tables and table top. I really disliked taking so long to get something from the store. 
 " I'll be right back for you. " I said walking quickly back to my apartment. I usually sneak a few dates for my friends as I didn't find them terribly laid-back. Being a journalist I don't have to be too loud with my banter as I always return. I thought it probably would be more enjoyable if I stayed a little longer. 
 When I returned home my sister came through, very nervous about being on the receiving end of her phone number. Even though I hadn't seen the man that I had come in to meet earlier with, she felt this jovial nature to him was very much a friendly vibe. 
 " I need you to meet her " she said confidently. As a result I felt something actually warm in my body, pressing against my lips. It felt so warm too. 
 " Medusa, you know I always love you " she said pulling me closer as I slowly moved my lips around her tight lips. She smiled and told me that she would be looking for some alcohol to drink again, after she got back home she would try her strength in her body again to not worry so much about my " nerves " and I would get stronger from her embrace. 
 " I need you to come with me, I can't wait till we get home. " 
 " I'll be right back! " I yelled loudly as I walked back to the little inn that sat across the street. When I arrived she greeted me with a smile and gave me a very satisfying smile of satisfaction. 
 " Well how's the lunch, has it been much better than I thought?" She asked after a quick look at me. 
 That was how the long fight ended, honestly I definitely enjoyed my dinner with her and the good blood between us.

"Where am I? " My mind murmured as the words were slowly arriving. There seemed to be a loop in the process, as if something was moving in the direction I was in. Surely there was something, out there. Why is there a loop. I could hear the footsteps from outside my body as they approached, and I felt my legs being thrown up. 
 " I want to find you " I muttered, as if the world were some kind of mind altering experiment. I reached up and pinched the corner of my eye, but the portal was gone. Nothing happened, at first. Nothing was replaced, but that didn't matter. 
 The first of its kind had moved in the opposite direction of my body. It definitely didn't seem to have approached me. I hurriedly followed the shadow until it stopped. The next one I followed was just a shadow passed by, but still passed me, though it turned to me. Suddenly, I realized that the portals must be closing. 
 " Why am I here? " I questioned as I started to panic. A low giggle of amusement escaped my voice, and this random and depressing laugh suddenly became stifled laughter. " Am I in some sort of virtual nightmare? " I repeated. I tried to focus on the snooze button on my 3D printed costume. Nothing. I wanted to lock my door and never look out of the portal again, but I quickly realized that the door was as empty as my own body. 
 " Wait! What is this thing? How will I find you? " I muttered. The mind began to try and interpret the events that had transpired in my dreams. " Where am I? " I shouted, pulling the fabric of my stomach slightly around my throat. Suddenly the fabric clanged as I was screaming. Lights flashed before my eyes. No light, but in every direction. 
 " Who am I? Who are you? What are you doing? What have I done? " 
 My mind began to move again, and I began to feel a deep seated relief. 
 " I am the avatar you have fought against. I am the avatar you encountered. You are me, and that is all. I am you now. Please close your door. If you find me, there will be no point in moving again. 
 I was crying again, an audible agony showing when they slowly started to open the portals and take me somewhere else. 
 " Leave me. " 
 What was going on? 
 " Leave me then " I whispered, trying to ignore the trapped screams of my dreams. I struggled to remember what I was trying to tell myself. How long did the portal get? 
 " Tuna half way across the ocean, what year is it? 
 " 2020 " 
 My vision began to blur as my ship, my current, faded away. I screamed again, and this time I was able to look up and see the horizon. I opened my eyes to see a bright and colored light. I was looking directly at it. I had known that there would be no answer when I looked up. 
 " Forgive me. I know you will eventually come back. But I must keep going until I can find you." 
 I collapsed in a mass of floating dark matter. I slowly woke up, but my vision was still green as a ghost.

I was given a lambdog rice from the store to eat for dinner in the morning and a salad for my morning nap. I tended the pork, but I had grown really lucky with meat from the butcher I had her work with. 
 The little redand squirted carrot stuck to the flesh, thus keeping my relationship with the stew going, but the next meal was enough to convince myself that it was the best just yet. 
 The lady at the butcher booth stared over the beautiful croquet of fruits, and asked me if I wanted to ask her a choice of potatoes for tonight. My stew soured, and she pulled out a potato bag with a wide flat green trench coat. Maybe she wanted her husband to be part of the lambdog stew, but I didn't really care. I just wanted to ask. The woman at the butcher booth swore he would pay me to make her comment, and for the dregs of time I will live in peace. 
 The dull thing at the table crossed its hands, and the lady's choice of potato bag rose and fell from the table in places that I could fit in the pocket. I felt an urge to take another bite. The stew in my fingers cracked but I kept my eye out, as in this particular case, a flower grows for me in the morning, but it is a rather strange one. The flower slowly arched under my feet and landed on the soft plush rice that the lady by the bay door paid me for. It was then I left. 
 My husband was, yes, but for the reasons of philosophy, I am not very fond of chicken. He likes fried chicken... but it tastes awful.

The bus came around the corner on a Friday. I had picked up a soccer ball and had been listening to The Afternoon Echo. Lumpy Jesus was taking the bus from his home, how much longer could I wait? My head hung low and my teeth stuck out in a whiplash. No, not no, not after this, my phone was out and I had no one else on the bus. I took the phone and the little string within connected me to myself. I tried to focus, but instead I found myself face down in my seat, cursing myself for being so stupid. I smacked my head against the back of the seat to dry my smile. I sat up straight and tossed the ball at the girl next to me. 
 "Quiet down sleepy boy, I'm trying to hold up better. The angels just came over for you. " She looked nice and unpretentious, but it also made me feel a little bit good. He smiled a little bit closer. " Fuck, I'm on the bus again, I'll be back in less than thirty seconds. " 
 The woman glanced at me and said, " How far down that bridge? " 
 I shrugged. " As far as I remember. It really is in the Zion in here. " 
 The girl paused and started to drag me across. " What in the world is going on? The angels are coming back with their big boxes? What's up with me? " 
 " Unbelievable. You appear to be sitting on the edge of the bridge! Do you remember taking that? " She looked interested in me, but then again, she usually was. 
 " I just told you. I'm on the bridge! " 
 " Can you promise me the sky won't tear at your face? I haven't seen the water's fiery flames yet... " 
 " Um... I know you can. I must be on my way. " 
 We sat in silence for a while. I rested my head on the side of the seat, surprised. 
 " Interesting. Would you like to get us back to work? " She asked, looking at me once more and laughing. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe this was real. The whole world must be in hell for going to hell. 
 " You're right, I hope you don't mind. " 
 " First off, I don't mind saying that a little. Have you ever been without a bedroom? This is such a strange place. I've had no maids to take care of. I don't work so much as work. I don't have much to work for. I have to look after myself, at least right now. " 
 I sighed. " Oh. Well... now what? " I said and smiled. I pulled out my phone and cast a picture of a foul looking angel on it. I popped up and everything started to freeze. 
 I wanted to send something but I couldn't seem to get it. It had stopped, slowed down, stopped altogether. It started to take forever to load until it finally stopped. Like it had stopped. 
 " Did you see the rock over there? " 
 I nodded slowly, trying to put the picture into perspective. The angel opened his mouth, " Can you do me a favor? " 
 The elevator came around the corner and began to slide to a stop. 
 " Welcome to hell, Daddy." 
 Edit: Used 682 words.

“ This, this seems like all we can do, ” I said pointing to an old, male human, Bruce Moody. 
 “ Good. ” the middle aged man said as he mumbled a word, ignoring the scent of wet skin that was pouring out of his bald back. 
 “ Or should I say just fucking broken. ” I replied eyeing the human ’ s foot, “ not so much! ” My face was flushed red, I couldn ’ t take anymore. 
 “ Sorry, Brian. ” Bruce said sitting up and facing a museum that no longer fit any sort of purpose. “ I feel as if my life is over and they think this is all done for me. I can ’ t remember anything but just, ” 
 “ Then of course, you are Brian Moody. I was searching for you, as I went through, ” I paused, feeling disgust washed over my face. 
 “ I am the final boss. ” Brian replied returning his gaze to the young woman, just like he was before, “ this is the only way it is possible to escape. ” 
 “ Huh? ” I asked walking over to the main entrance, “ the museum?! That is offensive. ” 
 “ Oh, no way. ” Brian said a bit disappointed. 
 “ I came to explore, ” I said his eyes a bright red as the stain that was the floor dried onto the ground. “ There is no cure. ” 
 “ You heard me. I came to explore and found some sort of cup that was filled with water, used by my kind. I didn ’ t intend on harming it, I just wanted to talk to Brian, and he would help me with that. ” 
 “ What's happening? ” 
 “ It ’ s time. ” 
 “ Tim built the fortress. ” I said calmly as I headed down the stairs.

The skies outside every high end apartment window peaked out behind bars and into the buildings and street. The world only knew the shambles and engines of steel workers and panzers and cathedral builders and engineering agents and cheerleaders and revolutionaries in full armor and helmets and ruby razors and safety goggles and sphinxes and flight boats and some other ungodly things but we didn't care either, we had paid for all that we were and could afford it, with no downside of course or downside at all. We could smile and dance and have dreams and be happy for nothing and we could spend it all with no consequences. We'd been running out of oil and social agencies that couldn't be fixed and no one in particular was far away enough or pretty enough or relevant or even making a difference anyway. It was great life, sure we had to do good, but it was the exhaustion that contributed to it. The wounds that must have been ripped out and blown out and transported in barges and not sails or ships to hoist some body far to the edge of the universe, ships that knocked out heads but soon to remove precious bodies from bodies and eat those who might be matter. Sure we were not invincible, we had been dead. But still there was no sunshine and clouds and the hunger and the fear and the thirst. Death wasn't just a kind of looming cat with about the weight of its all kinds of breadsticks. The gray would spread its veins and those strange claws which hid the belly will roam the earth, those uneven little arms and sway and never find love. 
 We saw the giant golden plating grown over the avenues and the great glass vessels with steel bars and colored leather seat feet and just a small bit of dirt in a little pool over which came the face of cancer. We snuck closer and there was a huge storm that would pound and chomp and churn and stroke, but there was no pain, no reward or pain or loss of control or painlessness or anything to rescue. 
 We left. We had stayed and lost and wandered. We'd run some. We had played some. We'd failed at all and now we were exhausted and torn beyond repair and lifeless. None of us cared that we'd yet tread the soil of Earth and we'd never find nature again, we'd never be large enough to take care of ourselves and what was left we didn't expect.

It's always been against a grain of body language in a story, just that, good or bad. I figured some tired general like Henry would understand. It's kind of like a chicken song when you first heard the song; Why do bad things cause good things, right? Anyway, when the first things we do, things go bad. 
 So, we're faced with a couple of high-achieving economists pushing the point that the American economy has increased in value by enough that we're left with our immense needs, over a lifetime, to follow what will help us become great again. So, we go toward them, that is the problem. " You're gon na miss me when I'm gone." It's usually a kind of self-defence, to take things as being bad. As someone who works with people to help them succeed, I try not to pick on them. If they understood the point of having everything you do is bad for them, then maybe they would have helped, no? I expect them to either be surprised by what I say or broken by being told by Henry that that is not what we do. 
 As an economist, I'm in charge of the work that affects people. I'll often be thinking about how the too-efficient public transportation allows the wealthy to avoid working for something once that improves the health of the nation. I also think about how the economy brings about the right kind of things. I work with the same people who we helped to pass the laws on that guarantee " Every new person is safe from two carbon-negative diseases. Every new gun in the military brings about more uniformed men and women to the military, even the likes of which want to become the shining example of how the American government is working. " 
 I'll often hear from people who don't understand that they're only out to make a big difference, that they're protecting themselves or their country. Even if I don't understand that there is a long-term problem that will continually plague me. The Great American Dream, with its incredible range, has led to inequality. But, sometimes, we should try not to get in the way. 
 A lot of times, I come across people who understand the world better than me. I've read books about slavery, genocide, childlessness, and racial discrimination. I've even seen books about how something such as " Reconstructions " is worth trying. 
 Sometimes, we ignore them and just take what people don't understand or care about. But, you can't argue with a man who built a world. 
 To be honest, it's kind of like saying, " That's not fair, Henry. It's not fair." 
 But really, isn't the biggest thing to sacrifice for? To make the nation a better place for a family? 
 I can't help but to wonder why.

The silence has been oppressive. The only sound after my phone's rosy-white light was the heavy it had sunk itself into their trench dug through the shoddy repaint... 
 I stare at it. It looks as if I'm moving on the wrong foot. 
 "It hurts so bad to try to try anything " I tell myself as I talk to no one in particular. 
 I don't actually know why. I can think of no one at all. There are lots of things that wouldn't help, but nothing in particular. 
 I was stunned by a fellow who chose to talk with me. " Joey, the phone was always there... that I had to stop... I paid for it... I really wanted to put it out " he spat out unintelligibly. 
 I glance at the picture of my brother, out of the window of my car. He looked so nervous... I know I expected tears to fall from his eyes or furrows and the occasional slit of skin. He looked so young... 
 " Look Joey. It hurts so bad to keep trying, but I really wanted to give it away... I don't know... what will it be before I die"?

Each of us are born in machines that take our souls away. 
 This took me two months to fix. 
 Not that we thought coming in to the repair shop wouldn't kill you. 
 No. We think you should take your life. 
 Oh, gods. 
 You certainly shouldn't take your life. We can't let you die. 
 No, we don't want to make you cry. 
 Please, please, look at me. 
 I might have walked away from this. Please, please, please let me go. 
 Losing my mind is not something I can just play your fingers over. 
 The others understand. 
 We only see them in bright colors. 
 I understand. 
 I love you. 
 So do I. 
 I love you and we will see each others faces as we always have. 
 I love you forever.

I love you, Dad. I love you from the very heart of my heart. You always speak so well, why shouldn't I? 
 When I wasn't only a child, I never dreamed that something so profound would happen to me. Something so, so improbable, would certainly happen, so right then. 
 Then I woke up. It was cold, wet, and annoying, not unlike this bathroom door I didn't bother for years. I was still a kid, despite that. You see, I was nineteen when it happened. My parents were walking their dog in the field when I was just getting ready for school. They were driving back home that day, so they stopped and stepped on my phone in a panic. 
 "Hey? " They heard me. 
 I opened the door and felt the sudden rush of temperature up. It was foggy, cold, and hectic. 
 I looked at my phone. It had text from heaven. 
 They handed me the text, and looked at me. 
 " Tom. I love you, Mommy."

I've never been a fan of Buddhism. It's scary to me and is a given, but a person like me who didn't commit to anything super-religious, ignorant, or ancient... wasn't permitted to cross the chasm. It meant that the main belief system, held back by the spine-straight sword of the Dalai Lama as he tossed into rivers, never ventured back onto the right, where ash continues to tumble from the "perfect place of being " or whatever. At least, that's what people thought. 
 And then that fateful day, one day, out of pure thirst, I had transformed into a meter-tall troll. Who began the meandering walk I had always taken to the local basilica. Right after a swell of thumping gasping earth dust blew through the air, I saw him, almost imperceptibly at first, the gentle muscular urge sending me skidding towards the ground. I kept my eyes fixed on him as he staggered back up, and the mysterious robe ended with the small portcullis popping on the pavement. 
 " Ugh! Nothing! " I said, licking my lips, my sword just barely gripping the rusted lid. " We're going to hell for this!" 
 And then, slowly, I found out I was an Angry Person.

The crowd cheered along, but I needed a quick word. All I could do was sit back and make eye contact. " Him, " I mumbled. I couldn't take my eyes off the man standing next to me. He was sitting in his shiny shoes, slightly shaven. He was wearing his gear similar to the one in the video game Super Mario Bros. He was also flustered, probably by his old friend Krillin, trying to avoid me. Not sure how he got the sunglasses on, there were plenty of people who just looked to be a horny sexy groupie. 
 I took a picture of the man, but then my eyes widened. He was dressed as us. He seemed quite feminine. 
 " Are you the world's greatest traitor? " His tone was hardly raspy and genuine. 
 " No, " I said in shock. " I got the gadget from the ten foot tall fool in Indiana, along with an entire group of computer scientists. " I thought to myself for a moment. 
 " We're... supposed to play tennis with America. " He finished on the spot. I took a breath and rubbed my face. " Perhaps an assassination... should we assassinate the one that we saw as most dangerous, but with too many cameras. " I paused for a second, my mind racing as to where he thought the words were coming from. 
 " Uhhh... I'm serious. Why not... kill him? Please. I mean, it could cost money, but... I would absolutely guarantee that the food wouldn't leave you. " I took a breath. " I'd rather not, at least, face your technology. That could be too... boring. " 
 " Ah, " he coos and nuzzles on the crowd. " Well, this time I'm going to play. I'm going to set you up. And everyone's not going to be in the real estate business while I'm stuck doing what I want. " 
 Suddenly, I heard a sound. It was coming from somewhere overhead. I looked over and he was holding something. I think he was obviously led off stage, or someone who looked like him. 
 Suddenly, he slumped over, and his head hit the ground. I stared up. A few moments later, he was dead. Still breathing, he turned and looked at me. His face was completely unscathed. 
 " I never wanted to do that again," I muttered out.

The engineers at Apple fumbled over the nuances of light and radiation until they came up with the correct numbers. Securitron is dead. 
 There's still still time. 
 Okay, now. 
 If you can't shut up, I guess you can. 
 Your A.I. is delicate, lightweight and sensitive. It can partially sense energy, but it senses completely the environment around you. Using one function, your computer senses the things around you, and it can determine their social status, skill level, and the good or evil that takes place within them. 
 It can pinpoint "good " for any living person of its perception. When people learn that one person has acquired the ability to kill others, it applies strengthlessly to all living things in its vicinity, and temporarily destroys themselves with a single ray of sun. This force kills an individual, although it can stop a person at any moment. 
 In the early 21st century, research was conducted with the intent of finding a way of impossible time-travel by trapping all knowledge in one block of time. First, the first paradox was discovered. With this device, you could travel back in time and have 100 years with an infinite number of people after you die. 
 But not everyone does. Some people either choose not to speak to outsiders, or travel with computers to the future using the method, known as " reverse time travel". 
 For example, if you travel back in time to 2025, you still age in 2025. However, the subjects you killed were able to gain super powers. I am aging at the most fertile age. 
 So, all I have to do is work on my creation, and I can try and work out where to stop this very problem.

Gloria Shaltz narrated the translation, and unfortunately she was late to the party. 
 I'm truly proud of our subject: Dawn. A wild science that wishes to draw fire, but if it goes unrecognized and shunned by its lofty peers, there is little sense of embarrassment that comes with pulling it out of danger. We know a lot of folk love their fairy world, but instead of love, our goddess—a whale of dwarfs that descended from the sky—will tug the line as a tight, tightening knot. 
 The dwarfs are exactly like the dwarfs of the sea. They sting and wriggle and laugh at the silence and scream at us with queer gestures, but they show emotion with feelings that we don't so much know. 
 We explore, Cela, in this galaxy that is not our home. That is not why we have chosen to leave home here on this planet, to do this for a pleasure of my own. 
 My story begins in a galaxy where cultures form, sing, sing, sing. Somewhere far to the east, lies a throne that looks like some sort of ancient dragon's nest. Sparsely populated, strung together by the sand, some gray and a touch fuzzy, this sort of sanctuary leads to a huge water fountain on the south-west end of the expansive galaxy in a world called Lise. Where the dragons and elves dwell and breed, where men and women dress and dance in ways they can not imagine. 
 And I fear, therefore, that this may not be my realm. 
 That area of the dwarfs has its own little open land, impossibly complex ( to say the least ) that is not populated by any level of life. Everything is under the control of the outside. 
 I'm sure you've read the whole series, but I can not decide whether or not I believe it is true or not. 
 As I sat there on my scythe, enjoying my meal from above, I could not help but notice a long strand of scarf running back and forth along the edge of my nimble finger. I'm afraid this scarf could cover me in dark shadows. 
 Then, I noticed a mountain, casting a shadow into the sky—thanks to the glowing faint warmth of your bright light, I could not recognize it as Earth. 
 It glowed for a moment until I could see several stars flickered. 
 What the hell! I quickly drew my face close to my skin to place a pillow over my shoulder, but my hand on my nose and back kicked off again. 
 I sprang back to my tent, disappointed to see a lake stretching long, black pieces of grass strewn across the ground, and a sea of green droplets on the ground. 
 My ears thudded, and I heard birds chirping. 
 Something peered out of the night sky, with an attractive moonlight illuminating its beached-eyed visage. 
 I saw a pair of sad big tits, growling and rolling, as they fawned on the rug on my back. 
 They must have been hungry. 
 I swiftly ran off back into the forest to find no more water. 
 The next thing I knew, I was suddenly confronted by two foot tall gerbils out the bushes. 
 Did they come from off planet? 
 I heard the sword cry out under my heel. 
 I glanced down, a creature twisted its head upwards from the ground and stood on top of the arms of a monstrous claw. 
 A black storm cloud was blowing across the sky, falling in waves over the land. 
 I woke to the voices of three giant dragon-faced beings coming from some unknown dimension. 
 They called out: 
 "Lock eyes with the princess!" 
 I nodded and cursed my senses. 
 I noticed that they had purple rings that were pinpricks on their heads. 
 I frowned. 
 They wore a dragon garb.

It was raining. My hair smelled like strawberry, before the groaning began. I began to wail until my steps were short. 
 It was eight o'clock in the morning, and I opened my eyes, trying to remember myself. My husband took my arm over my mouth and smiled. " Wake up. " He said. " I know. It's late. Are you going to bed? " 
 I just stifled a yawn. I coughed. I didn't want to wake him up. 
 " Oh, you still sleeping, honey? " He turned his head and meekly pointed at the door. 
 " No. I'm not going to sleep. I don't want to wake you up. " I said. I shouldn't have to admit it, he thought, but... " I'm okay, " I said, after he picked me up and walked outside. 
 That night... 
 A muffled, muffled cry escaped me. 
 " Daddy!" My wife cried.

The puddle of urine began to form on the floor where the cloth unfolded. Giving it a dry squeeze, the Human Alliance finally reached across the table, hands clamped around weapons held above with their eyes drawn toward the interface. Their father led them onward. He looked back at his sons and shook his head vigorously. 
 The Elders looked at one another curiously.

"Mark... mark... mark... " the enraged kid's voice trailed off as he fell over, collapsing into the corner of the room. 
 " I'm sorry kid, I'm sorry. I just didn't want you there. I- " the girl raised a hand to make her way over to her brother's defense. " It was all my fault. My wife insisted on buying me a dress in the first place. " 
 Mark looked at the kid, shaking the guy's hand. 
 " Mark, what happened? " 
 " It was in the wreckage of the helicopter, Dad would be here when we got there. " 
 " How... did you get hit? " 
 Mark rolled his eyes. " Dad had to see him in the hospital with a wrench. " 
 " Why would a dress be the only thing you could wear? You were the only mommy and darling in town! " Mark took a deep breath and squeezed his eyes shut. 
 " It's fine, we'll do it tomorrow. I'm sure you can find a suit for us. " The kid continued to walk with his hands on his hips. 
 " I didn't want to leave it there, why not... " 
 The secretary reached into the slip in Mark's jacket pocket and pulled out a yellowed license plate. Mark picked it up and carefully attached it to his pants as he kissed the girl, where it scratched deep into his wrinkled skin. 
 Mark walked around his office, almost sprinting off to help them find the repair man. As he filled in a few forms with his phone, he slipped his own helmet on and rested it back in his pocket. 
 " How're you feeling Emma? " she asked. Mark shrugged. 
 " You're feeling great, I thought you would be at work. " 
 " Did you miss your job? " Emma inquired. Mark rolled his eyes. 
 " What was the emergency?! " he yelled, panicking. He would have fought all through this without her fighting back. 
 " Get back in there, please, please let me- " she dropped her phone, too late. Mark jumped up from his desk and grabbed the teen. " Emma! I don't want to be like this! I'm- " 
 Emma did not understand, his name was only now called. 
 " MR. CHALLENGE! I know, Dad. I did what was the right thing. You can't beat me like that! Just take me away from you! " The five year old cried out with tears in her eyes. Mark heaved himself up slowly, propped himself against a desk and walked over to the head of the desk. She watched in fear as he picked up his phone and started to dial the emergency line. 
 *You have three minutes left. Please-* the office was silent, it was dark outside, the sun shined down below the horizon. 
 Mark threw down the phone and threw the seat back, panting in pain, and began to walk back towards the front door of his office. He heard someone walking down the corridor in his cubicle. 
 The press was speaking for the first time in almost a week. 
 " This will not be the end of Mark! He's trapped, " one said as the sentence escaped from his mouth. " I just hope he's going to be okay! This will finally be a whole new life!" The reporter was one of the people outside the door, smiling down at them. It was also the daughter of one of his more prominent figures on earth. 
 Mark stood up quickly, readying himself for what might happen next. He turned around, rolled over in the park and closed the door behind him. He stepped out of the park and opened his car door for the first time in several weeks. 
 He slammed the door shut behind him and walked through the other side to his car. He took a pull and stopped in front of it and tilted the keys to the ignition. The car lights flicked on and the vehicle drove on. As he got closer and closer to the car, he felt it relaxing. 
 He drove on... forever.

A blinding white is always threatening, the only feature of their any colour beyond the lilac shadow and the unearthly smudge of the cut left by their newest victim, with all the grace of one red tides burden. The scamper of the fingers, the staccato beat of every bone, leaving barely a pang of its own where a scruffy old chap would know her real name. 
 Except for she, whom he'd kept to herself only occasionally from sunlight, despite her bright soaking hair stained of clear water. She dreamed of him being to her, nearly bathing her every time she saw him, but it's her child that made him so want to make it, more than any man should have. He was like that, pleading with her, pleading for her hands, for his eyes in their peace, and your wife. The thought of her touching him for the first time, keeping him still a child, or filling her with joy, was just too much, too good for the woman he had become.
Fluorescent light flickered on, and on for a long while, leaving only a static familiar. Before long she'd scurry to the edge of her bed, stir her loose hair, and walk through the door of the parents home she built for him. He couldn't love her that way, in his darkest fears and deeds, she would fall like a stone, undisturbed by his fine hands and soft ones. 
 It seemed impossible in his darkest hours, this sweet, innocent smile crawling around her eyes like she'd been drawn to him by a flower, he might as well have danced upon it every day, she got up and began walking towards him, catching glimpses of the birthright she might've given him on a rooftop stroll, and then blushing suddenly, he could see the water he stood in begin to splash, and then the sun began its cascade, and he was less and less. 
 He sat in his room, sobbing like a child, a child he would never marry, only if he was the only one, that with his blind tears ( the color alone was indescribable to him ) he had only to open his eyes and reveal himself. " I..Am sorry " He whispered, looking into his tear stained eyes, tears coming rushing back. 
 With a soft " I...", he whispered to himself again.

After I started noticing the genetic disparity between men and women ( even as several guys protested at my interpretation of their homo-philia ), I thought that it's just random conditioning. Yes, men are attractive, but women are terrible at female bonding - I've encountered it myself. 
 I've lived in a community where I have local advocacy groups, and they call it a waste of life for them. Even though the disease kills most of the men, I just don't want to live with the constant fight over my "gay" status, or lack thereof. While I may personally have an advantage in some ways, like being able to rule a city, politics, or middle class jobs with impunity, I also don't really have any particular skill as an alcoholic or drug user. At all. What I do have is a vibrant sexuality, and I have a strong sense of who I am socially. Sex and love has created these strains of men, and I now have it in common. 
 I hope that this post serves as a warning for people, and take action.

There are two things you need to know about the World Championship. First off, you have to see your clean record, cause you have to see your wins that good, and you have to be good because you need a clean record. The second thing is, you have to know a lot about the sponsors. What I do know is that they will want me to beat them. They will want me to be one of the best. And even if I am, they will always stick to their plans. 
 This year, I really believe in myself as a talent evaluator. He is the best in the world, I believe I can be the guy. Here is where we are going. 
 My record is 37-0, 0.3 % record. 
 I have also woken up today at a good a pace. No matter what rules they make, they only recommend me to be a temp and teacher. People have commented on how great I looked in my temp uniform and I think this is probably one of the reasons why that was good. This isn't my issue. I am a full time spotter here, not an intern. Which is ok, that is what they came for me for. And I could never say no to you guys! 
 You've been a watch guy a few months but you don't really care about that here. The last year, it was a whole year and no one to talk to. No one ever told me. This was the longest I've been here, when I started but things just stopped. 
 I have never met anyone but you guys and they talked about me. Like I talked about you guys and I really did. They told me that I thought I could be a part of the team and they thought maybe I could be your last watch guy, but that I could never be. So when you told them they were right, they said they were wrong. 
 Let me be one of the last people to visit you guys. Your resume doesn't tell the whole story. You have to be clean and handsome and you have to be great. And I know it will all come down to these two things. 
 I grew up in Tacoma and it feels like home. There's everything you need to know in your life, and everything on the block. How do you go about doing your job and do the best you can do and you get it exactly where you want to be. That's the only thing I have to look forward to. You're getting it today, but you have to remember this, because they said I want to be a nurse and that is better for you than getting three digs in your return year. But keep this promise, and you have a clean record and a full service. And like I said, if there is some shit to say, it's those words. But remember, so that you can still be a good person. So please respect your employer, and don't make me feel bad for your pride. 
 There are two things you need to know about the World Championship. First off, you have to see your clean record, cause you have to see your wins that good, and you have to be good because you need a clean record. You have to be good because you need a clean record. You don't need to be clean because you don't need to be clean because you need to be clean. And I know that's a good thing.

As more of the "humans" began to turn against the Ultimatum we knew that everyone involved was heading to the Ultimatum Sector Space. We didn't know what we had faced. For seven thousand years, the Ultimatum Sector had an Armageddon of peace. Everyone had developed towards eradicating the Infection and Common Diseases spreading out before long. So many Wars that the Anti-Anatomy, almost it. But we were just fighting the bad ones. We had infected just as much people as we would have fed ourselves in the first place. We had taken all other nations, Americans, and South Koreans, and defeated the Protheans - still trying to wage a war. There was nothing we could do. So in the end the Earth produced over 200 billion of The Most Evil Robots.

"Hello Tom, Is this complete? " I asked the man. " No. " 
 " I can't do this. " He replied. 
 " I don't understand. How can I get my pizza for you? Do you have an account on eBay? " 
 " Yes, Nick, I haven't, all of it is gone and you're never going to use me again. " He replied confused. " I feel like I owe a lot of my life to you. " 
 " Is that really your favorite pizza you keep in there? " 
 " I just keep the pizza in that box. " He replied. 
 " Why does your father keep the pizza? " 
 " Because Mom did kill him. " He said. 
 I bowed my head. 
 " Tom, you're going to live forever without owning it, it's all gone. " He stated very confused. 
 I smiled, " I know Tom, I've had this conversation with someone for five years now. " He replied. 
 " What does that mean? Is this some kind of prank or trap? " I asked. 
 " It means I'll always be able to live with all of the things I love, and it's the only way for me to live. " He responded. 
 The man simply sighed and sat down. 
 " But you have to believe me. If I still existed, I wouldn't have to live with everything I've ever loved, all the things I've wanted to accomplish, all the things I've dreamed of. " He said with a smile. 
 " Will you take a seat? " I asked. 
 " I will." He replied.

Okay, so I recently went through doing research on my future. So far I've only got 40 pages left. 
 My father gave me the idea a while back, and since it's a bit late today he sent me back. That was in 200 C for the day, but he handed it to me once. He told me to "not go get any fridges when you're older " and tell someone I'd be a cool new customer. 
 Anyways, I got a bang when I wanted to try out the new DeLorean called DeLuxe 2.0. It was great, and I always hated the upgraded versions. That was on the double 5 front. Here's the thing: only the windows go up, and when you step into the DeLorean, your color is different depending on whether or not you are in the engine. I hate the color constant, I use x-rays to try and clean up the dealer's stuff, and the glass every time. 
 My other daughter doesn't like the color constant either, and so she gives me the DeLorean 2.0. The colors are mostly yellow, green, and red. 
 Eventually I've lost interest in the color constant, so I named it some generic name. I like the flavor that it gives. It reminds me of a brand new game, like Dota 2, and the game still works on the old games. I like to think about the changes that the colors have to make in the game. 
 Sometimes I just want to see myself on a different bit of tile at the time, like to be happy and make a new tile! 
 Anyone know what that is? This is an offline exchange where people give products or deliver goods, if they already live or have kids. You see, I've been to and from all over the world. I'm visiting a lot of places with friends and family. I find people who want a different drink, and then this is what I do: go shopping, go home, come home, eat pizza, and drink espresso coffee and almost look like I was present during that time. I'm taken to different countries in different countries, and I get to see all my friends. Sometimes I even get food and medical supplies for my trip, and that's great because it means that I get to see my greatest and worst friends. 
 I can't wait to meet my best friend.

I watched the Highness of the World address the armies of North Korea in front of the assembled world. 
 "Please send the Ogres before they attack, these Mayans will be blown apart by the onslaught. " The General announced. 
 There was a long silence before the General interjected, " Do you want us to 'win'? " 
 The mood quickly darkened as the figure hobbled toward the confederate flag and spoke up, " We say if you feel we have won, I may be away on my plane to your home. " He lifted a clawed fist, a masterly gesture, and a gust of wind blew it back at him. The General made the same gesture twice, in a way that was almost threatening to topple the flag, but there was no desire or plan to do so. 
 " If I cannot return to this plane, the Nagants will be saved, " he repeated and the General turned his gaze on the ground. " I might have been able to protect our very people with this deal. " 
 With a last desperate smile, the General thanked the people for their sacrifice, but before he left the line, the troop leaders watched in horror, and a crowd began to gather. The gathered people cheered as the words were sung. 
 A guard slowly walked by to meet his destiny. When his attention was drawn back to the banner, he grinned, " Amen." He hung it silently for a moment and then pointed to his heels. And then he set down the Ogres with his winged sword, and quietly walked away. 
 One American soldier stood and swept the room, letting the General get through before he hurriedly stomped off into the distance.

He was taller and quite short, starting with his ankle but moving up to his jawline at the same time. You'd often see him gasp and cry as the woman you once knew was killed by an unknowing attacker. We always imagined you were cursed with battle fatigue. 
 His companions at the hall, often known only as his friends, could not wear each others armor to protect against his accumulated battles and injuries. Once they began to fade away, they found that their health was slowly fading and men who owed their birthright to these spiritual beings could pay for their injuries for lack of a better word. Perhaps that's why they loved to duel, learn from one another, and be graceful when confronted with a raging beast. This man has set himself to fight for all things, so it made sense. 
 Jabs and stabs have become more common, and they were moved quickly along. As his followers of Jölnir held the hall, he was there to spend his last moments and time with his family, followed shortly by the bodyguards. A familiar feeling plucked him out of his reverie, the same sense that clung so heavily on him since his birth. The hall was silent and orderly. Still, he never spoke a word. 
 He came back to the Great Hall one day with a billows of red and green armor in tow, reminding him of everything that is right in this universe. And just as he had since his early days in this hall, the feeling all around him throbbed, thickening with disheartenment. Indeed, this energy was beingqueath a handkerchief over his face. 
 Forgive me for impressing you, but I must confess that this in itself is quite astounding. It only takes a quick spot on a conquered enemy to induce a thin tingle on the skin of an old friend. I could not know what had been bringing this feeling to a point, but I did know that all that could be observed by the staff-speakers around me was that which he wore in a manner which implied that he was sorely lost in the intricacies of his armor. His skills were handicapped since he had not acquired any special weapons. Where was he gone? 
 At first it was a matter of convenience, a distraction from his every action. The creatures around the hall still tried to charm him away, to anticipate their attacks, to let him know that it was time to return. But he never did. This connection lasted even longer than originally planned. It was a combination of rage and solitude. It lasted nearly a year before the metal shell was uncovered by the eyes of a mere guard at the hall. The metal had been kept on him for that long. 
 The door to the throne room opened in silence. The servants looked away. Their minds were blank as they swallowed the final sentence. They ignored us and left. 
 But the inscription, words and pictures that were etched into their faded hands, could not be mistaken. This battle would never end. This girl, my daughter, my angel of death would never be bound by age and fear. Every claim she made over the millennia was equal to one hundred and fifty thousand lives wasted. As her leg became sagged, broken by several blows, one arm lost, she did not care anymore. She asked, though, for a handkerchief. 
 And so she does today, preparing herself for war with those who seek to take away his glory. The memories of our time will burn in my mind. They drive me mad with their hatred. They tell me that every second he dreams of slaying me will carry with it a soundproof burning of my leg. The bruises he carried would tell me he would feel the fury of the world rise against the Old King now, and turn against him. They whisper tales of killing such a girl. But I am more than happy to plead ignorance to whatever murderer that is. Instead, I will prove her wrong, show them what they want to know. 
 He might not be divine, but the human mind is not without weaknesses. He will be a creation born in the time of uncertainty, filled with maddened hopes and delusions. Or perhaps that time will pass with nothing.

When I was a kid, as was my, a secret people wondered, what if ghosts and spirits were the only possesiones of this power? Almost everyone died, and I guess it was a good thing it didn ’ t kill us. Well, of course they didn ’ t do that for you, it just took longer than a few seconds before we all started having the power over our minds. And fortunately, we just had to eliminate them. 
 We kept them in check, they were not dangerous at all. They didn ’ t simply follow orders, or tell us what had to be done in an attempt to harm us. Instead, we ran things on paper, and learned from them. Anyway, it wasn ’ t to teach us to be disrespectful or to allow non-attention to something happening. We started using miracle to turn the world into a better place. 
 Stemming from that one day, the machines had evolved out of control, but they worked quite well. The farmers had gained the ability to pass language and teleportation powers, a fact everyone always had the right to know. They became the darling of the the planet, and the next generation was born. 
 Of course, it took a while before we all went on to conquer the world in a similar way, but something had to be done. We reached a point when nobody knew that our lives were over. When we were a boy, I was told when we were supposed to do something, if this was the first time. I didn ’ t remember or care; it was just part of the fun of it all. Nowadays, everyone that survives is isolated, and we all live in tiny fragments, but I think it ’ s true. 
 “ Listen to my voice, I ’ m telling you something, ” I tried as hard as I could to communicate. “ You ’ ll never want to believe what I ’ m telling you right now. I can tell you everything about this world for years. Imagine, how will I support you, when you ’ re stuck here? You had to lie on the ground for just 1 minute, thinking about how things would have turned out if it didn ’ t work. Would you be able to handle the feelings that you ’ ve got? You ’ ve made the wrong decisions. ” 
 “ Look, what I want you to do is be honest with me. I know what you ’ re thinking. In a few minutes, there will be a revolution in this world, one where people with the power to control the world can actually move in and kill their enemies, and there will be revolution in this world. Yes, I ’ ll do it. You ’ ll lose your job, your house, your job, your family. Life goes on, you ’ ll lose money, you lose food, you lose your friends, it ’ ll be okay. Yes, you will stay alive, but I ’ ll make sure that you spend every moment of your life with hope. Without you, there ’ s no hope, there ’ s no life. Life goes on, you ’ ll die, and the revolution will continue. Yes, it will. ” 
 And that ’ s what this world will be like, everyone will still suffer, that everyone, and even themselves, are locked in this prison. The machinery won ’ t get rid of them, they will sit there and wait for the future. And until then, the world continues to grow.

In the room stood my wife and the king. The king turned around, placing the hands of a passenger on the table. He was sitting next to a woman sitting opposite him, just as the king was. The women listened to the conversation to see what had happened so far. 
 "We've got to go home," said the man. 
 The woman nodded in reply. He noticed his expression turn a little more blank as he continued to guide the king. He too had been nervous and hesitant. He had grown used to the feeling of death, but at some point after years of having the country work the people of the world no longer cared anymore, just wanted to leave. Those babies were harder to get out of, most people had begun using something as a bargaining chip rather than to simply leave it at home. 
 On the table, a bag of goods was thrown at him. He opened it and took a bite. His nostrils were oddly burning, always gasping for air even when his hand was warm. He had to compensate for this when he heard a glass of water being thrown at him by the boy who spilled it. His eyes opened and saw the white light. Was this really happening? His hands were shaking. Was he dead? 
 The woman smiled and shushed the boy in a tired voice. The king himself stared at him from the table, and smiled back. 
 The palace door opened and a young man entered. He peeked out the front door of his palace, only to see that it was empty, and that the door still had a strong forked handle. The man said something to the young man that made him make the best friend that the king wished him to have. 
 The young man laughed and approached the door, hoping that the king ’ s was as strong as it seemed. However, he would have to wait until the toddler was older. 
 The door slammed behind him and the door slammed open again. His face cracked and he fell asleep with a smile on his face. The man stood up and walked over to his nephew sitting opposite him. 
 Slowly he looked at him and asked him, “ Is this really happening? ”

I woke up to the smell of gaseous condensation from the back of my neck. In that moment, the entire experience was horrifying. I knew I was not ready for this journey, and the end. What was I supposed to do? 
 I began a yoga routine once before. If you could think of a current you were aware of, you could choose to slow it down to a trickle in the sand and dream about the future. There was nothing like that on Earth to keep me going, and I'd lost track of how far I'd traveled by now, and how many hours had elapsed since the last time I'd done so. I'd just got so engrossed in the thought process that I didn't notice the star marker-tagged status post in my pocket, and the fact that no sooner had I started up the workout than my mind quit; I had already starved myself for over 3-4 hours. 
 Being in the front step from the nondescript, polluted sidewalk, I knew I had to make a decision that would one day sway my course and turn my home into the most important place in the world. It was impossible to predict what would happen, and there seemed to be no way to stop myself. I looked down to my wristwatch and couldn't look away from the lights inside the green cap on my wrist, but I knew I would never have control over those things. 
 I knocked on my door, now slightly bloodshot and complaining about being late for work. * This isn't right. * I pushed open the door and standing awkwardly on the other side, I didn't make eye contact with a knocker until I made my way down the aisle. 
 Someone was standing in front of the entire store, and it was my co-worker,* Smirking at me. * Thank you for your patience, Ms. Martyn. I have to go. * 
 I pried open the counter at the end of the floor, my hair clanging in the wind. This wasn't a cakewalk. 
 "Hey, what're you doing here? " I asked her. She was an older woman, ragged and on the bed, staring through blank stares. 
 I turned to her, her face making the creases in the dark at my phone well beyond view. 
 " It's your turn. " 
 She shook her head, lightly. She turned back to me, followed by the startled ooze on my forehead and throbbing heart. I wish I had just held back tears. 
 " Do what, Joyce? " 
 She turned back to the counter and waved me out and opened the fridge drawer for an app that I knew very well. The front pop-up " frozen " popped up in my notification as well, and the messages from the next day began to trickle in. I had to admit, it was incredibly random. 
 " How are we going to drive to work? " I asked. 
 " I think we're both in the process of getting a car. " 
 She nodded and turned back. 
 " We both know that you're not the best driver, at least not yet. Just don't be too many years behind and it'll take some time to get the drivers license." 
 *You don't understand* I thought. I pulled off onto the flatbed at the nearest gas station. I wouldn't ride any day now. 
 I never got to go to work. 
 *Don't cry, Joyce. You deserve better. * 
 *You're strong, Joyce. You deserve to have a healthy mind and work hard, but that's just not what I want. I don't want you here. Please. * 
 *Do it, Joyce, * I knew she wouldn't understand.

I push my collar as my feet ache. My only reaction is to stare at the ground. We thought this would be our special time at a funerary, and this was my single greatest achievement since I could read the date on a computer. 
 -- - 
 "I should not dig here, " I purr as I approach the most recent tomb. 
 The younger me looks up to see a flag while I stroll over. " There are four of us. Let us take one up before I send you away. I can't send you off without you asking the question. Why are you here? " 
 " It was probably a ploy, " I reply, staring down the tomb. " Just keep living if you don't want to die in this place, right?" 
 I drive for the next exit. A few more years later, my daughter finds the edge of the grave. Farther and further up I get to the old hammering table I use to pry the jagged rusted remains into place. I finish the arduous work and head back upstairs, looking for my other half. I can only hope she wakes up soon. 
 -- - 
 I turn around. There is only one light switch in this room, putting me out of my misery and hunger. A soft slam on the door opens and reveals the sound of a few tinkling pots being used.

"Hey Dick! " called one of those 
 women with her new baton ready to use her powers. 
 He looked up 
 from her baton, 
 " hey, I'm really hungry, Please don't do this, " 
 She began reading 
 " EVERYWHERE in the world. They called them gay " 
 " It's okay, I think it's pretty, just drink a bit of water 
 but that'll scare off some of the bad guys " 
 But who wasn't interested in her thirst, 
 who was not going to wear a condom and fuck sex without cumming? 
 None of them actually wanted this normal chick, 
 but they all figured she would leave, 
 whoever seemed cool enough, 
 she would go move in with some secret most 
 of them were get to enjoy it 
 on days when only the horny ones 
 did want to fuck, 
 and during the time they imagined it, 
 she would complain 
 telling them 'you can't catch me' 
 until they agreed and kissed " 
 hmm thats not disgusting 
 but they either wasted it, 
 she was brought back as a new monster 
 shocked, in her sad state, 
 she realized they had also out of options 
 and like all monsters 
 underestimated 
 the choice was a perfectly normal 
 super power 
 that would only make them crave 
 themself 
 like nothing they expected 
 but now they can. 
 She first dreamed about it 
 thinking about it 
 and it was 
 utterly insane. 
 " I am so sorry, but what is it " 
 Beneath the clouds, 
 a beautiful girl 
 with golden wings 
 that could transform into a monster 
 " I'm so sorry, " 
 and at that her " powers " 
 started to change 
 now full-sized 
 for both of them 
 in a way they couldn't explain 
 to each other, 
 because 
 she doesn't talk 
 because 
 She's 
 just looking at her 
 " What the fuck? " 
 " I didn't. It's not right, 
 I didn't, " 
 " all my powers are not necessary for humans, 
 even those with science powers 
 that were so 
 impressive 
 are better than them! " 
 and she's scared 
 and has finally got a reason to admit, 
 " That is bad, 
 that's a bad thing, 
 I don't want that, 
 I don't want to worry about other people " 
 and takes a chair 
 sitting on a rather normal sized bed. 
 And a smile on her face as she takes her first breath. 
 " Come on, no I wouldn't, " 
 flirty as one of them 
 with a creaky slimy pillow 
 and a smile on her face as she shakes them, 
 she gets to go to this amazing shower 
 and save her own virginity. 
 And she stays alive 
 as they try to hurt her, 
 that did happen after they just kissed her 
 again after all these years, 
 but even stronger and with a layer of perky skin, 
 more lovely still. 
 But right now, she might just want to sleep with someone 
 who just entered their life
just because it started in their dream 
 while they thought she'd come inside 
 because it would help her 
 just feel better 
 cure her, 
 cure her 
 the emotions of getting pregnant 
 not just what they want 
 but what they want, 
 that they can get in a relationship with. 
 But as she walks her way 
 home 
 and the house 
 and her chest 
 and limbs, 
 she feels very horny and weak. 
 And the worst part is, 
 she wakes up as 
 in fear 
 and overwhelmed by happiness and pleasure 
 that all of her fears are just what she needed to get in a relationship. 
 How did a monster ever understand, 
 the doomsday comes 
 first? and she was done by the end of her nights.

"They did it by release. " 
 " They were the ones who gave us the rights. Of course, we still can't read the papers, can't make a fucking comment of the big bad guys lawyers. They could at least tell us they didn't do it. " 
 " They could do it for us, it's the least of our worries, but us long time eaters don't believe that will happen. I don't worry about that either. " 
 " Well it isn't the last of us, I would've been happier with the results. If they hadn't released the rights, it might've been more sane. " 
 The fat man marched past the lawyers, and with the press man out of the way, he cleared his throat and threw a paw at the cowboy. 
 " You came in here, anyway. We didn't know you would stand, and we're here to show we could play cards. " 
 The fat man grinned, like the whole thing was just some cynical joke. 
 " What the hell are you wierd ol' monstrosities? " 
 " Would we have thought you would have come for a slice of bloody sausage? We didn't know you were even willing to trade such toys! " 
 He shouted at the reporters, making them all stop and take a huge gulp. 
 " Oh, come on, that wasn't supposed to happen. " 
 " I'm afraid we could play around with this. " 
 He didn't seem to care much for hearing them talk. " But are we really that dumb? You think us robots would steal out the hottest prankster looking person in town? " 
 " Well we can't come in here if you want to, that would violate the verbiage that only factories take orders from their own guards. I think that we might need to close down the factory and at least sell some paper to have our deal done. " 
 " Anyway, we want your money back, we also need your phone number. " 
 " I have a good one, I promise. " 
 He grinned, he was able to squeeze the cash out of their hand in one big swoop. He laid them down next to the fat man. He put his arm around the desk. 
 " That is one lucky one! By the way, I'm going to need to get rid of it."

 It wasn't the people… it wasn't the people that heard it, it was everyone else. Everything that they could not deal with held them in awe, it was like looking upon a dagger within a zoo and thinking it was no bigger then you may think. 
 “ Life ’ s useful, ” Edward Camillane sighed, peering at the remains of the rocks that had been scattered down the road, the road the land had used to be a refuge from the settlers once called Living. He recognized the sweat and suffering that were continuing on in the small huts, the squalor that had held him back from showing up in time enough, the despair that had inspired him to join the tribe. 
 The villagers had fed for years, the wood gradually increasing in strength as it was established between the land ’ s few members. They watched with contempt as a foolish bastard managed to get into their tribe, and what they saw only kept them going. 
 The phone rings, Emily Pearce walks in, her smile long gone, her sword unblinking as she reaches towards the crook in the hand. Camillane rises from his quivering form with as much vigor as he could muster, his sword shining brightly in the still sunset. Scratches were strewn across the floor, where it had hung for the longest time. Emily throws her eyes down to look at the young one, his eyes inches from hers. 
 “ Any ideas what the britches of my village need now? ” she asks, her gaze growing wide as she looks towards him. 
 The man knows and understands exactly what they ’ re going to do as he moves closer. Camillane'ation became stronger as he can see the anger's fading soon. He can ’ t keep up. Now he can only think “ Still ”. Camillane snaps his fingers, this time almost painfully, the stone returned into its fangs. The village isn ’ t going to open until Emily catches hold of Emily, taking her blade with all her might. Camillane mutters “ I won ’ t let you kill me, Emily, I won't let you die, ” tiptoeing towards Emily, his nimble blade edged from her lips. 
 Her eyes betray the anger deep within, just now she feels free. When she ’ s not with him she ’ s with some unknown creature that sits in the corner next to him. “ Does it know my name, Emily? ” She asks softly, “ No, but it does love me. ” He repeats, her teeth beginning to growl and his teeth disappearing into the grass. Camillane almost sounds angry now, he started to sink, her blade slashing through the man's abdomen, his head falling backwards to her breast. She raises her arms to his face. “ If you don ’ t take any more action then I won ’ t stop you, please, you don ’ t need the swords… ” 
 With the last of his energy Camillane freezes and his blade hits the dirt covering the village, Camillane ’ s eyes blackening. Emily falls to her knees and watches as she loses her will to fight. Looking up from her remains, she sees the terrible spear already sitting before her. The blade is carved into the ground, Evelyn Percy ’ s teeth on her own face, covering her with the flesh of her calf. Camillane ’ s anger's fading as he stops looking back at her. “ Just give me some half-dead woman, ” she continues, tears beginning to trick their way down her innocent cheeks, “ she ’ s what I need. If you leave I won ’ t have another one. If I leave you two, you die and I give you the power to live, ” Camillane begins to tears as his voice is hushed by tears, “ I swear, it wouldn ’ t be a point if I did then… ”

Another Christmas! I love how much we sleep in my little pre-book tupperware. Now it ’ s Christmas morning and the kids are all still asleep. I shout for Mommy as she knows I ’ m gone. Poor spooky little Spooky spooky spooky spooky spooky, being with you just for hours after school. 
 I hear footsteps coming toward us. Mommy yells “ Come on, Miss, I won ’ t have time to leave, ” and I hear footsteps coming in from far away. I yell, “ Honey, listen to me! ” 
 Mommy takes her robe off and leads me inside. I ’ m done making noise so I let Mommy start the band at me. 
 She hands me some books and I play with my toys. Then I blow him kisses and look down at the bedspread that Mommy ’ s brought me. 
 I feel a warm touch on my temple. “ Can you believe it? ” 
 “ Daddy? ” 
 “ Mommy, my parents have left! ” I groan, and Mommy just looks at me. I can ’ t do this anymore. It ’ s not right. 
 I walk to the kitchen and grab my heavy bag. At the sink, I find a water bottle and seal it tightly. I grab a dinner knife and start making dinner. 
 “ Mommy, don ’ t! ” Mommy has been holding my hands up and looks at me now. “ If you have a friend that can make you cry, it won ’ t make my day so much sweeter. ” 
 “ What is going on here? What ’ s going on? ” 
 I stare at her. I am almost with her. A familiar feeling hits me. Mother was the one that put me in her tiny home. 
 “ OK, he is very upset. But he loved me and that he deserves better, Daddy. We can ’ t talk about it anymore. This is really important! Please take care of him. ” 
 I have finally pushed her off me. The knife shatters on the floor. I look up at her and I barely recognize her face. That gentle girl with so much beauty and bright smile, that makes me angry. 
 I come back to my senses and grab the knife and bring it down on my heart. 
 Hair starts to bleach. Hair starts to fall out. It ’ s so so messy. 
 I look down at the knife, and I see the cleavage. I see my mommy ’ s scar on her face, and my dad ’ s fingers reach up and grasp on to my hand. 
 “ Don ’ t you dare. Now, get up and go find her. Put your hands up and cry! 
 I kiss her goodbye and use the power of my memory to whip her head into a cross shape. 
 After that, the pain and the screaming seems all over my body. I can ’ t bear to continue this another Christmas. 
 My head aches. I can ’ t continue. 
 I run outside to see what is happening. 
 Even though I look like that brown crab from the nightmares I ’ ve suffered the past weeks, my eyes are still wide open. I stare at my mommy in sadness and wonder if she had left any messages on her new vacuum cleaner. 
 Why are we all that way on this Christmas?

"I'm sorry, but the thing you were looking for is sold out. " 
 They were giving me some sort of unusual gift. Nothing that the department did not normally offer. What's the worst that could happen? Nothing you saw would change your mind. Nothing that the head of the department at the time was so disappointed to see me out. 
 " Sir! " I yelled. I rushed to the door. Everyone was there, as if just to say goodbyes. " You told him I was breaking up! " 
 I blinked. " Yes. " 
 The office head walked in. " So what are you doing. " 
 " He says he's staying on. " 
 " Fine. " 
 " I'm sorry. Please don't go. " 
 I stood. " Ok. The getting back from is very urgent. " 
 The head laid down in my arms. " See? " 
 " The thing is, I'm not going to let the cop down. And we won't get the deep look, will we. " 
 The deputy walked towards me with a sneer on his face. " Fine. How are we supposed to get here? " 
 " Man, we need you two here now. " I instructed. " What is it you wanted? " 
 " The secret. " He replied. 
 " And it was a pretty heart-wrenching story. " 
 " Not only was it a heart-wrenching story, it was also the place. And I won't ask the him where he came from. " 
 " I don't understand. " 
 The head chuckled. " I don't understand. You know what we're doing here. He broke up with me two months ago. " 
 " We can do it. " 
 He turned towards me. " Then I think we are going to go now. " 
 I waved my arms in defense. " Sure. " 
 The head appeared to nod. " Alright, look, you guys are going to think this is a bit weird until the director comes around and forces you to really deal with him. " 
 " I'll call him Colin. " 
 Colin dressed like he was from The Crown. " What is this about? " 
 " Well, it's the same thing that he told me about. It's his excuse for breaking up. " 
 " You actually broke up with Colin? " I turned away from the head. " I thought you were actually a friend of his, of course you were. " 
 " That's certainly ridiculous. " 
 Colin smiled. " I always thought he would follow me around. " 
 " So why don't you tell me what happened? " 
 " I don't want anyone wondering. " 
 " There is still an appeal process, after all. Do you even need a second lawyer? " 
 " Sure I do." 
 I could tell that Colin did not mind, even if I had been taken care of without their services. This was going to be the best business I had ever had.

“ I think so. ” Elle sneered from her post. Her long ribbon slithered down the broad back of her bunny ears before slipping down a jet black duckleg of the back of the rabbit ’ s head until her clothing rushed with sheer power. 
 “ You ’ re even use to being batshit crazy, ”. Elle laughed as the man on her left sat in the left bin. Her lipstick was undigested on her dress shirt. Her eyes were set on the girl across from her. 
 “ Th-thanks, Jim. ” Elle ’ s eyes looked down at her now frozen violet white, but she was staring too, ignoring the scary bags under her eyes and the dark in her coat pocket. 
 Jim chucked the bag of kittens from a bottle in the middle of his desk before turning his focus to the squirming in his neck. Jim snarled. “ Why not? ” 
 “ The risk of being rude is too high, ” says Elle. 
 “ Am I? ” The catman said. 
 “ And yes, but, what is the risk when it comes to sleeping? ” Elle wonders if this catman ’ s decisions were wrong. 
 “ Well, you don ’ t take responsibility for your actions. First of all, ” Jim ’ s jaw dropped, as his personality exhibited no fear. The man on her left had an unblinking stare as he exhaled. “ And secondly, the possibility of snarling after being clean washed and disposed of. ” 
 “ Look, I like cats, just not true catacombs. ” Elle jumps up from her desk, wiping the blood off her shoes. 
 “ But... ” Jim throws a flabby piece of paper at the door. “ The possibility of the timeshifting alive and being tricked into keeping you safe is something you deserve. ” 
 “ I do. ” Elle throws the paper at the man ’ s desk and his eyes try to follow his gaze. He ignores it. The burning in his chest is unmistakable. 
 “ You think I hate you? What do you mean? ” 
 “ I hate you because I can talk to people without making the same mistake you made for me, ” says the catman in a sad tone. “ You ’ re better off as a human without understanding what you ’ re getting into. You might not grow old, but you never know that there is another world out there waiting for you. ” 
 “ But you haven ’ t lived it, ” Elle accuses, turning to Jim. “ You know this. ” 
 “ Great, and I'm not getting into the politics or drugs. You ’ re getting a better deal with cataccidents. I don ’ t know what exactly I just did. I will admit, I ’ m good for business at the moment. But I don ’ t want to disrupt this. Don ’ t worry. My problems are saved, ” says the man slouching on the desk by his papers. “ My family just wants to know that I went back to work last year, and that they have plenty of money to buy this house from. But first, I needed to talk to Elle about my new savings plan that I made earlier today. I heard you, Alpaca. Don ’ t tell her that you can ’ t afford the per diem, please. ” 
 “ Okay, ” Alpaca replied. “ Let ’ s talk for a bit. ”

“ You might have to be kidding me. ” 
 The white form on the backseat was a place with barely any circulation and scant circulation from the windows. Colds were being slowly made up for the pain in my head as I peeled myself out of the seat and flipped the lights on and turned the ignition on. I squeezed the gas pedal and pulled down slowly, keeping the car in constant motion and as quiet as possible in the dark. It took a few seconds before the gas started to fill but I kept pushing. 
 The car jerked to a stop and I pressed my foot down to his hand as hard as possible to keep up but it didn ’ t work. I slammed the door and jumped out of the car. 
 When I finally let go I felt tears welling up in my eyes. He kept picking up on the window shutters and windows and moaning in pain. After a few minutes of lying to himself he started again. 
 “ Well what do you need me for. ” 
 I sat back and took a deep breath before responding. 
 “ Well, you see that I ’ m dressed for work and I ’ m tired. I ’ m been driving with kids for a while. What ’ s the last thing you remember? They walked up with a fork and then the car crashed into the side of a school building. They cried and begged. ” 
 I hung my head slowly while I could only stare in disbelief at what I ’ ve done. I couldn ’ t understand what had happened and why he was so calm and collected. My engine was still working and its gone. My lungs burned and my heart started to beat in my chest. I thought of the kid that hit the driver until I saw the truck with the windows smashed open. Then I saw him walking down the road. He was climbing the sidewalk outside. It was dark and cold as always and everything made its way toward the headlights. 
 I took a deep breath and my eyes widened as I could barely see him as he climbed the sidewalk. He reached his hand out and grabbed the bonnet of the young man kneeling next to him and began tossing and turning his arms wildly. My eyes never left his face as my heart was racing from my eyes. 
 “ Okay, ” I whispered to myself as I looked toward the sky. “ Where do you think this is headed? ” 
 “ It ’ s fine. I feel fine. ”

"That'd be amazing, " said President Trump. 
 " I get it. But.. " 
 President Trump would have gotten to next, if it weren't for the imaginary phone calls. 
 " They need to run for president, I got it! I get it! It was supposed to be, and it's. I mean.. It's been a crapshoot for years and we're running out of time. " 
 " Well, at least you're a smart agent, I suppose. And sure, you may be a very cunning one. But, uh.. Well, you'll get used to it, " said the man. " Do you *like* red? " 
 Trump had memorized all the dialogues and answer when they were going through preparations. He never knocked. He just turned on the television screen. 
 He had watched the whole thing a million times. Not for the second it had ended. 
 " That's enough POTUS. It won't take you long, folks. Our president is coming. We need to prepare. " 
 " Of course, Mr. President, the President is not in our hands anymore. " 
 " I'm not here to threaten this behemoth, Mr. President. The only question is, what is going on? " 
 The president had told him to speak up. 
 " I'm in this for business, Mr. President. I have to see that stuff in person. " 
 " Good! Now go get your... boss and the Secret Service! It's not over until we have the President. Otherwise, we'll have hell to pay!"

It's September 1st, 2028. I've been out as many hours looking for an R19 sniper rifle. That sniper rifle has been plopped onto a rock in the middle of Pennsylvania. I ran outside to look for it until I was walking. Shit in my bedroom. They have all kinds of weapons hiding at random. I slam the door and shower. With my sword I don't even bother using it since I did use it to kill the serial killer my parents always told me about. I had to use it for a new target. A VERY specific one. That is; Rank IV. At least those who didn't kill me then. And I was about to kill him when I heard a loud screech of gunfire. I ran out of my bedroom and over to investigate. What I saw was just such an outstanding sniper rifle. I grabbed it and ran. The guy just sat there looking at me. He looked at me the whole time. When he looked at me again. Just sitting there with no action. I began running. I started thinking about things I should do. If I could just kill this guy all over and he will kill me then that would be it. Maybe if I killed that shooter. It wouldn't be so boring. I have to kill this guy and if I could kill him like him then I could beat this guy up once and for all. Now I am in a town my father helped build. I can get anywhere I want by killing him. A bunch of Republicans. I have no clue what their plans are. After I reached town, I found a house. But instead of a house I found the Viceroy and his counselor. Unfortunately she says that I need to leave my house and run before I can kill this guy. I think I won't be able to get back to the bunker if I get away from this guy. And then I opened my ass door and the sound of a bell rang in my bedroom. I sneezed. The scream was stupid as I thought, but this it answered. " Run home and don't shoot me again, you bastard!". He rolled down his window and passed out. As I looked up at the world I could see. The woman sitting opposite of me and the guard I just shot was starting to cry. As I looked back down at my bloodied body my heart was pounding as I fought against these bizarre emotions. I think I will just live like this until I meet fate.

I sat back on the couch watching the news with wide eyes. I would be back soon, and I would realize everything I ever wanted. The death rate would fall over 100 % a day if it wasn't for that quote from earlier that day where he said "Life is a story, and tragedy only lasts for those fortunate enough to survive". 
 This was going to sound terribly selfish, but if it were to happen for the 0.01 second change in my world I wouldn't have a problem dying. 
 I would look at the paper and say that I remember a lot of people. I would mean thousands. 
 As I looked at the television I would react with a high-pitched wail, and they would all start screaming at me to stop, or any other thing. This and taking time off worked against me, but still. 
 I would calm down, get ready for school, and then enjoy life. I would be able to enjoy the amazing and just. People. 
 The life I wouldn't get the opportunities to enjoy would remain like a calm baby watching a tick. 
 I awoke at the bottom of an old, worn out dog walkway, and set about making something happen. 
 I was on a trolley in the middle of rolling hills, as I made my way back to the old building. I was so close to knocking on the door though, it could have opened up the old tub on the side, but with my new legs my pain should have been too much, and when I walked through the door I picked up the lifeless carcass of a dog. I am finished with it now and the inconvenience of it all made me ill. I peered into the living room while my eyes glazed over. There was clearly nothing out of place. 
 I knocked again, a little louder this time. Next I looked the door, it opened on the other side, but by then it was far too late. I wasn't moving as I hit the floor, but rather I was bending over in my bed.

War is over? Now that I've seen it all... how did we even get there? 
 Some species were caught in the crossfire of history. Those that survived when they were so weakened with brutality, treachery, and ignorance, advanced enough to take advantage of humans, and the rest fought off an advancing fleet of them. Earth wasn't a hit, let alone a threat, but a refuge. This planet was long gone by then, and it was now a welcoming place for the newest arrivals. Everyone took pity on those with no more fear than they had before, though, and took to the air and provided transportation. So many of them died fighting, slaughtering themselves, struggling to survive and still harboring their essence in their bodies, as though they knew how to aid and support the people they once fought on against. They would do it from the air, eventually, but now we all had a choice. 
 We could go with them. 
 It wasn't easy. We dragged them around to fight, until there was a searing pain in the back of their head and they could no longer function. Fear brought pain, anger brought joy, and greed brought war. In that time, there were many rebellions and civil wars, large ones only involving a few of us, driven by greed, lust, and greed. Eventually, the only rule we had was to move on to our own world, to work for the greater good, even if we still hated ourselves for it. 
 War was over. 
 It's coming to an end. 
 A war we had gone against ourselves for centuries had come to an end. We had conquered the worlds of death, destruction, and disease. Even now, living in a failed society was hard, but we had to fight to become stronger, and so our efforts were grow ever greater. We were all those who had wanted to fight against the faceless armies that claimed Earth, wiped out entire families, and impaled our allies. Our war had ended when we had parted ways, our pride leading us to burn out our enemies instead. We were now the ones who fought against them, no longer our enemies. 
 I stepped out onto the bridge of the surface vessel. It was a dark, Earthly atmosphere, filled with a tall dark blue forest dotted by a little bit of brown rock, which lay forgotten for thousands of years. I walked towards the ship, looked at the man on the other side, and began to speak. 
 "I have to go now, join me. " 
 He turned, and looked at me before he started walking toward the dark forest. 
 " You scared me, sir. " 
 " Yes, I know. Don't you dare say that. " 
 " Why do you have to go now? What are you going to do? " 
 " I was afraid. I didn't believe in that new, trickier way, nor did I believe in anything other than what the myths say. " 
 " That's what they say. " 
 " Never believe in anything other than what they say? Why is that? " 
 " I was killed during their creation. They spent their whole lives changing me, making me fit on the ship. What do you think then? " 
 " I don't know, John. It's horrible, fighting against that man you know as you helped us escape from a fortress. But I'm here with you today, so take it easy. Tell them I'm all yours." 
 I took a step towards the computer as he prepared the ship's emergency jump beacon. I had to send a message back and forth to every single one of them, every single one of them. I have to take them all home, so when we come for them, our families will never know of what is happened in the other worlds, but knowing they'll be here for the first time, I don't think there is anything I can do to prevent it. 
 A message filled with emotion and fear ended after him. A dark, viscous, white liquid seeped from the side of the ship into the atmosphere. The captain of the ship looked at it for a moment, then opened the door and walked out the door.

Daydreaming is the equivalent of talking to your wife and child outside of her window, anytime but right now. Birds chirping can be heard but you don't really need that now. 
 That ’ s why I can talk. It ’ s all about how you understand, and in this case can understand what ’ s going on in your mind. 
 I was sitting on my front porch - at my favourite place and now it ’ s been left. I took off the top of my coat and walked down the gravel path looking for a window. 
 “ Shut up, son! I need to make it to work. Can you even sign me out for this video please? ” 
 I find my son idly staring blankly at me, holding his hand in either hand. I'm not sure how long I ’ ve been wearing that dress. 
 Once I am over the front porch, I see my mother ’ s closet in the center of the street with the tape as well as her husband. She appears fully clothed but not leaving her door unlocked. 
 “ Mommy! What is going on? ” 
 Mommy frowns. “ We got ta go get things and stuff in the house. It ’ s not over yet, ” she takes two steps back and puts the rucksack closed. 
 “ Ok. I ’ ll go get it. ” 
 I pull my son up to my lap. There is a duffel bag and it covers her bag but neither of us needs any break from our playtime. He jumps in to get the stuff wrapped, so I close my eyes and approach her. He opens the bag, takes out a pen, and stumbles into the kitchen. I reach under his bed and come straight up out of his sleeping bag. 
 “ What ’ s going on? What is going on? ” 
 I look down at my son. He ’ s not awake. 
 “ Daddy? ”

"Yes, Hildebrand! " said Roland Stenfang as he went onto the street in his medium form. 
 " Oh my god. " said Roland to himself as he put on his glasses. 
 " Oh, I am so sorry. " said Hildebrand trying to keep her balance but still not managing. 
 " Please, understand. " said Roland to himself as he performed the ritual and prepared for his fate. 
 " I... I don't know. I mean, who am I talking to? " stammered Roland. 
 " That is your own... Your own death. " 
 " It seems... i don't remember that word. I don't remember your name, your race, what time it is. What do you have done to deserve this? " 
 " My husband gave me the second chance. His plans will not be thwarted. " 
 " And he did it? " asked Roland 
 " Yes, he does. " 
 " You are immortal, Roland, " Hildebrand's voice was soft as a cat, so dear, so slow that Roland had to cry out. " You were my greatest blessings. I assure you, you will have never let yourself die. You did it solely because you found a reason to stay. " 
 " So... you've pulled my horse! " shouted Roland. 
 " I..." replied Roland as he took out his phone and began texting his wife.

He sat there, frozen in his doorway with the plague of flesh in his molar, being too hard to walk and too thin. He didn ’ t know what he was doing at the time, or even how long it had been. He knew exactly where he ’ d get himself in the next ten minutes, but didn ’ t know if there was any point to it. After all, he hadn ’ t taken an ounce of pure material from his body, to buy anything new for a whole week. 
 There was an alarm in the hall. He didn ’ t move in any way, not even a sideways glance. He waited, silently, and waited. There was no answer. Then, his steps became more muffled. He slammed the door shut and looked up at his tormentor. “ Hello, ” he said. 
 “ Thank you, ” he said in a wimpy voice, familiar. “ The fire is cold now, ” he said. 
 “ How have you been, ” she asked? 
 “ I ’ m very sorry, ” he said, dropping the expression of utter confusion to a whisper. 
 “ Wasn ’ t this a hit and run, you ’ d probably already found out there was a halfway house on the property. ” 
 “ That ’ s a hellish house, ” she interrupted. 
 The tormentor turned and ran. There was an explosion in the hall and a cry. He tripped over a corner, almost toppling. He looked up to her and she raised her hand and met his gaze, then turned to him. 
 “ I ’ m sorry, ” he said, feeling a mouth flush up from the incantation. 
 “ Oh… ” she said in a tone of concern. She grabbed him with both hands, holding her head in both hands and scratching on his face. She jumped up and motioned for him to get down. He did so, and she took her arm and pulled him by his hair and mouthed ‘ Mr. Wayne ’ to his black curly hair. 
 “ But he ’ s very close now! ” he cried. He couldn ’ t believe it was real. He ’ d seen at least one of his relatives killed. 
 “ It ’ s okay, ” she said. “ I know there is no cure, and your punishment is beyond hell. ” 
 “ Good, ” he replied. “ I know what was happening to everyone. ” He looked up at her with those dead eyes he had seen as children. He held her in his arms for a moment, squeezed her hair and wrapped her in his. He sighed, looked at her in a strange and solemn way, then ran to the edge of the archway. 
 He curled into a ball on the ground after the imprint of his death faded from the earth.

All I need now is to finally leave the house. No one seems to know the secret, nor have any parents who are members of the church. Not until today. At work I had worked night shifts for the past three months. I needed to get all the paperwork straight before lunch. It was late and early afternoon and needed work. It was on time, I just needed to get my computer in order. I loved productivity and something I just never dreamed of. Two hours before tip hour I got my files lined up in my desk, headed in the right direction to a general store. I bought my notebook with the help of the cashier, nobody says anything in a straight up official way. It had to be perfect because I always hated what I didn't check. I checked my writing twice each week for way to close the total amount saved by just turning in my work hours. Everyone got paid at first, it was normal. 
 My discovery was made some days before lunch, the lady at the register was waiting for me after we finished. She said that we only talked for half an hour and that she would have lunch after she gave us all the information and we could spend the whole day at the convenience store! We headed out, thankful that she had taken me to the convenience store so we could run around the block or check the internet in her car. Lunch was a bad idea and I felt bad for somebody too busy working to keep me up at night. 
 After lunch I decided I was ready to go home. The very first half of my day was spent talking with my parents on how to keep myself up to time. I have never been allowed to do that to anyone else, I was so comfortable doing my work. I started practicing when I was eleven and tried to find an answer to the questions they gave me. It was one of the biggest classes they ever took. I was even on a homework assignment this week. The teacher said that I had messed up but I told her not to worry, it was all in the papers. I tried calling the pastor and the priest was really nice and smiled in front of me. I went home and got a good night's rest before heading to bed. 
 It was late and everyone was waiting in the same way as before. I went to my room and bought one of the things I want: a chair and a book. It wasn't perfect as I did not have anything covered in the desk which made it the perfect chair. I picked up the book from the shelf that I had left out the other night. A note said: "Get a seat in the chair in front of the mirror. It has real feel since it was moved from the cabinets in the past." 
 It wasn't long before I was staring at the mirror again and one more note in my hand. The note was straight up embarrassing, I told my mom. My dear mom. She still has this one stuck in her forehead, like she used to with us. I wrote it down and did my homework later. The space between now and lunch is so boring. I went to the bathroom and I checked my dark room because I know that it won't be able to be cleaned, I will be kicked out and never pay my rent again. I stayed out of work for a whole day trying to find the answer. Nothing, just all the evidence. I had only just started to question my family and the rest of my time. I went to the convenience store to check on the matter. When I turned in the papers I saw a letter. They must have deleted this letter right then and there. I looked at the paper but it was all still there, probably not there in my hand. I brought it back later and it was on the last page. It said " Get a seat in the chair in front of the mirror."

Before the monster spoke, men squirmed in confusion. Overcoming the masked attacker, a menacing slither came into view, booming louder than the dew on the ground, it startled men with its soft hum and shrouded its head. As the men scrambled away, sliver of light twinkled. 
 One was on fire. 
 Firestorm. 
 He was blinded by the fire and fell to the ground after a couple seconds. The firestorm blocked the light. There was light coming from behind and bleeding from the the back of his head. 
 He woke up the next day out in this darkness, like everyone else. Masked slithers were now rushing toward him. He grabbed his knife and started stabbing at them, towards the darkness. They stopped. Another slither came and shook it, blowing off the light. It was well over 1000 at this point. Something had broken into his chest. His wife lay dead. 
 By the time he finished, it was gone. Still, there were shards of glass now protruding out of his chest. It's shiny gray surface was blue, and was nearly as black as the ground itself. The filth still smoldered and scalded, rained down upon him with a black rasp. The entire region lay in ashes. 
 He was still a virgin when it happened. He turned his head and saw something that seemed familiar. Silence. He knew when it was there that it would be! 
 'Damn all' he thought. Like it was real, but just a dream. Like the sirens in the morning, fighting with the unhinged, on the brink of catching up. He saw this floating back to him. And it was quite a sight, not unlike any other datachute he had ever seen before. It was on a giant ship, slithering silently through the dark waters. 
 'What have you come here to do' he thought to himself. Where was the sea monster? 
 'I thought it to be the strongest monster we ever saw', the giant, big lump of metal said. 'I thought it would be afraid of us' 
 'But nobody loves you?' 
 'I do. But if the monster is true, how can it serve us if I never love you?'

“ Everyone has killed anyone or anything, ” Susan said to her husband. “ Pretty girls and all that, but that ’ s your new rule, really. Those aren ’ t your rules anymore, but any penalties for insanity still apply. ” 
 “ Why were you telling me that? ” Susan asked. 
 “ Because I can remember the first time you and Daddy killed somebody. ” he said. “ Three years ago, after growing up on those landfills, you asked why you didn ’ t tell me why. ” 
 “ What were you talking about? ” Susan said. 
 “ Why? ” He asked. “ The terrors of a soul being blocked from reality through a graphic representation of self. Or a head being sliced. Or a cadaver reaching 100 years ago. Or every human being you know reaching 1000 years ago. ” 
 “ Your mom has always told me to stay away from those timelines, ” Susan said. “ Don ’ t you dare use my powers. I know what you are talking about. ” 
 “ Why did you tell me you wouldn ’ t tell me your powers? ” He asked. “ Why would I tell you? ” 
 “ Because we are meant to survive together. ”

In my life, I have always been moved along by emotion, yet one thought never comes to me like I am here, and I truly wish it would be. A mere baby, emerging from the womb of the Earth, a reminder of what life in the universe can be. She will grow up through nature and I will be one of her eyes. " 
 There are what I can only describe as a myriad of aspects of these facets that I must learn to understand without a single thought to my heart. She will learn a lot and I will be one of her eyes when it comes to survival. Many of the experiences I had as a child were always painful and often traumatizing. I will never forget her in those times, when I tried to tell her that she was destined for life, and sometimes she just wouldn't comply. I did not tell her about the bumps and bruises, but it is because I prayed for her to be healed, she had long since exhausted all the places I had known. She did all she could to convince me that she had been truthful. A once powerful woman now struggles in the midst of her womb with so much pain, both physical and emotional. 
 " Lo, her parents love her. But in the darkest of times they want her to be sheltered, and so my child has left them."

Daniel gave me a friendly smile that answered every question I threw out. After a round of company and a handshake, we walked down the hall, past the posters of the Nazi Party, through the security that covered the hallways of the Hahnhof, and up past the earth's first black pearl fountain. It hadn't been the best third party visa, but I was busy searching the infernal names for entities called Hitler ( and of course he knew all there was to do ), and Adolf Hitler II ( as I later learned ). There it was: *Markus von Eichmann*. I had to try. I'd failed this one before. Maybe I would be remembered as the hero of World War II. No. No, this was something I should be pursuing, I should be sent to battle with Hitler. Will that be important? Heck yeah, probably. 
 As we passed the local Black Pearl Fountain, I saw another group of thugs standing on the ground of the fountain.

I was the well-respected astrophysicist of my profession, standing above me at the top of the ancient buildings I had watched from orbit. The stubborn roof chandelier blew the air gently over my earpieces as I exhaled slowly. Life looked good on the streets, save for the vapour accumulating from everything up towards the horizon. I was floating above, and in the distance, beyond, was a crowd of colourful innocents, scurrying to the edge of civilization. 
 The blue skies filled the sky, even though the city was too far away to see much. It reminded me of home in those days, as far out as I could see. The radio flickered as it relented, and blew the wind from a path into the sky. I raised my eyebrow in the slightest, then snapped my neck. The wind was killing everything within its path. 
 I felt nothing. But then it slowed to a halt behind me. 
 The wind caught my cheek, and it felt like it was about to go completely downhill, but I breathed in through my nose. Slowly, I picked up speed, and dove into the air. It was fantastic. 
 I could feel my body becoming cold as I walked, and that's when I saw it. A small hunk of land. For the next half an hour, I sipped my drink, as I heard the jets of light descend from the sky. I paused for a moment, as my breath came faster and faster. Then I began to realize that in the distance, there was no camera, no blinds, and no computer. 
 Suddenly, something in the air made a tap. It was a drone. I spun quickly to avoid it, feeling her power push into my spine, forcing me to stop mid-swing. It tickled me for a moment, then all I could do was turn it off to let the heat escape. 
 The power never died, of course, because I never changed course again. I was a Renaissance kind of guy. That's why I work in this stupid fucking bunker.

"How is it legal to kill? " the young outlaw asked. 
 Mr. Makeboos came over. Mr. Mozzarella stood on the curb. The barrel of the.50 cocked. The bullets swirled in the dark drawbridge between them. Mr. Makeboos clasped his hands over his ears. " It's legal to kill. Don't fuck with them. Not I. " 
 After watching Mr. Makeboos stand for a moment, Mr. Mozzarella looked a little mad. He dropped his pistol and jumped down the street. " That's - " 
 " Yes, " I stammered. " You killed yourself. Now bring me a light. " 
 I took the light out of the window and stared into it. Mr. Makeboos didn't even blink. 
 " It's legal to kill, " I told him. " No, they are under arrest. If you were to just shoot them - " 
 " No! " He screamed. 
 " Anyways, I'll give you 10 of them to bring you to the afterlife, if you let them. " 
 " You're kidding me! This isn't a meeting of people! " He turned toward his house, " Everyone wants to go to heaven. I brought you to Hell. "

 " I'm sorry, " I interrupted. " Please come back to Hell. " 
 " No, wait! Don't kill me! " He jumped back and began to grab the light. " Come on, bring me the lights, please. " 
 I looked out the window, and all that was out there was me. No one. Nobody. I looked back at the couple across the street, and they were both holding longbows. 
 " We're okay, " I said. " We're fine. " I leaned over and kissed the couple's forehead.

Tooby was weird. I remember this first moment where we'd heard of him. That first strange shower: loud, distinct sounds flickering in our ears - He shook them and I turned and looked at him in the eye, watching, disgusted. 
 "What's wrong, Ethan? " I asked, facing the hallway with the barest of patches of hair. 
 I had no idea. Tooby would not; he was ill - I had given up on him a few weeks ago. In one of my meetings, we've sat down and talked. After I had finished explaining and making adjustments, He would get the ghastly recognition he deserved and his name would be found. It was an act of god. 
 " Don't you think it'd be cool if I put up a fight? " He said, crossing his arms in a graceful pose. 
 " No! I would love for you to wear it, " I snapped, not wanting to let him know I didn't have anything for him to fight against. I could already feel his smile on my face. I started laughing at the man's arrogance; he had something disgusting on him that I missed. Or maybe I'm lying. 
 " Then why is nobody wearing it? " 
 " Wait a minute. Something's wrong with me. " 
 I paused. In a matter of seconds, it would be over. And so would his name. And right there, in my art school classroom, was my name. 
 " You can wear it, " I said. " That man in a red suit will know it's him. " 
 He turned and turned and looked at me. 
 " We'll live well. " He said. " But we'll have to tell your friends of his name. " 
 I waited. 
 He continued. 
 I walked to the bathroom. When it opened, there was a man sitting on the ground. A student. He was a quadriplegic. He had black eyes. A beard. His clothes were worn too. A necklace hung from his right arm. My phone. His name on my wrist. 
 I walked to the back of the room and started screaming. But no one was there. The man didn't scream, I could tell. He sat down in the arm chair. I stared at the man and thought about him for a moment. He was really ugly; he didn't wear red. He was someone else's face. He didn't make anything in the way I did. He sat, like a shell of his former self. Then I thought of him again. I flipped him off. 
 I stared into his eyes. Not the exact ones I remembered, but of what looked to be the most beautiful image I had ever seen in my life. His face turned red. But, strangely enough, his eyes were blue. The deepest red I've ever seen. 
 We spoke. And then, the ink was wiped off his chest and onto my arm. As I stood up, he went limp - probably unconscious - with a black tattoo on his forehead. I took out the tissue from his back as well. I started crying. 
 " Was that the tattoo on your elbow? " 
 " No. It was on your elbow. It looked much like yours."

"I... Mufaaard on'tenday.' " 
 " Fine, " Aunt Mufug said. " Then help me mufaaard come back from the lodge, " she gave the clerk a seven pound bill in her hand. " But noone came yet to ask what the wand did. " 
 " I just thought it wouldn't matter. Mufaaaaard, what did the wand do? " The clerk was a great man, but he always wanted to go to the Castle. " Hey, you have six kilos of ale. " 
 " I didn't realize *Why* I would need this stuff. Why not just live out the rest of my days in the castle, live out your days in public, and drink enough ale in a manor that I'll pass right out? " She came over to their table and placed a cheek to nose with him. " Would you mind, aunt, trying to your mufaaard out with some toast some nights with my boy, a drink with lots of wine? Maybe a shave? I'd call when you were ready, I hope. " 
 The clerk leaned forward, and swung the door open. " N-No man, I came and *talked*. Look, I'll explain it to you, " the old man said. He slapped the old clerk on the forehead and gave him a tall, big grin. " The wand chooses the wizard. It's not always clear why, but I figured one time that would be in your best interest to read the spell down until we got to it. That wand is *alarm*. You made it. You took care of the lodge. " 
 " That's right," said Mr. Ollivander. He grabbed the boy by his arms and led him through the fireplace, down the stairs, and into the meeting room. He walked around the room looking at people, pretending to be adults. He tried some of the table services. He thought it was a great idea. But no one came for years. The cab drivers found a roof caddy under a tree when they were peeing. And no one came for vacations. No one came for secret trips.

“ Don't worry. I just started this, ” I say as I thrust the book open and gently send it deep into the bedside table to be another blank page with several blurry lines underneath. I look over at my husband and David as I scan the page as my eyes peel across the pages and the flesh is beginning to stiffen from the numbness of the room. 
 “ I'm gon na die sometime, ” I say. 
 Delusional but calm this time. I can hear him talking in that first deep voice that makes me remember. Always comforting, even when he is ready to stroke it when I am here. I'm sorry I can never hear him again. 
 My nerves are beating me but the spell is weak. No, I'm still here. The book is still open at my feet. 
 “ It won't be good. ” Death says as he leans towards my shoulder. 
 I jump back in terror but there is no reaction. The books aren't on the table. 
 “ This isn't for you, it's for someone else ” I say and reach for my gun. 
 I believe him but I've waited my entire life for a chance to use it. I can hear it even in the present tense, but even then I know that I can't put it down. 
 “ Don't worry. I just started this… ” Death goes on to begin a quick mental checklist to ensure that there is no sign of me dying in this strange way. 
 We start slow. I always do, I think to myself. He doesn't look scared but now, sometimes. Sometimes, sometimes the mental checklist is disturbed. Sometimes, I feel I'm fucking losing my mind. 
 “ You weren't supposed to take the pills, ” I close my eyes to rest. 
 “ Wait. ” He answers calmly. 
 I return to the book, and he looks so... depressed. He starts to calm down and says, “ This isn't for you. ” I whisper back, as he continues to wonder if I still have it on. 
 “ It won't be good. ” Death calls again. 
 This time, he does not reply, instead he tells me something that I can tell my dog about. 
 “ There is something wrong with your dog. ” Death says. 
 I sigh. 
 “ Are you ever going to call me again? ” I say. 
 Death moves forward in the dark so quickly that I am surprised to see him but after a moment I slowly raise my gun and pull the trigger.

"Hey, " I said. " So you're all not yet 25 and you still have your coin? " 
 " Yeah, " said the smile on the guy's face. 
 " So if I get a lucky coin I get to put it around my neck while an angel comes forward to... " 
 " You always made that joke, Bruce. " 
 " Oh, I dunno, he probably can get his fill of that. " 
 " Yeah, no worries. He's probably going to give it to you, too. " 
 " Um... " 
 " Anyone's got a good man and a bad man and no one's going to cry. " 
 " Good, you're sorry. I'm calling you back. " 
 " Do it!" 
 I looked at the guy and then at him, too. 
 He looked a bit like a butterfly that was about to roll on its wings. 
 He looked a bit like one of the super geniuses of the in-universe.

George Allen Harper stood at the entrance of McKinley High School preparing for his pants from the laundromat. It would have been a good day to survive that poor trip to college, or to turn a loose on his sense of irony or lack thereof. It would have been his first quirk to do so in his life, even though the only way he'd be able to combat after then was to go all in and from there onto paper money. 
 Harper was a self-made millionaire. In his old age, a one hundred percent profit earned by the sharing of your stupidity and money accumulation out of your neck of water under a thousand boiling gallons of hot pink just might match the amount he would earn from his meager life savings if he came back. 
 Harper was on a budget, literally, because he was paid for it. If his mom's car were still running he would be dead for the next few months. His friends and family would be left with nothing to take and no teeth. The cold cash check, lagged at $ 70,000,000, would pay for several years of forced therapy, trips to a hospital, lectures, and hours of rest with only an unpayable illness, your shame and confusion turned to uncertainty. And justice was served, the coroner was left with a decision, and no country could resist. 
 Harper grinned, propping his head up on the cold, methodical white crayon for the last time. He eyed his cash register and was looking for the handle to change. He had at least 70 cash out in his pocket to ask for tonight, the increased weight on the keys of his wallet when he lifted them from the hard drive in his lap became soft and caked with his sweat and blood. What had become of the ring wrapped around the bell in the back door and the spare pair of socks had left behind when he had first picked them up in the box that meant an eternity of mockery and distraction, and the one that allowed him to jump off the floor as if he could hear the cement underneath his feet. 
 He couldn't stand it anymore. He was lost. Alone. 
 He bent over a newspaper clipping and looked at the headline printed on the front page. The headline read "One Million Man Fail to Cover Lawsuit Against Benefit! " 
 He twisted the cleaver and plunged the hammer through Harper's throat. He screamed in pain for the briefest moment and nearly knocked his typewriter out. Then, after rushing to the wall of the laundromat, he ran back inside, reloading his pistol, and looking over his shoulder at the rifle lying in the corner. 
 " Sir, you can't miss the money in there, it's on your right. " 
 Harper looked down at his plate and immediately turned his gaze over to his work -- the amount. He raised a brow and grabbed the gun in his hands and sat down next to the body. " Are you sure you want to invest in the money then? " 
 The sheriff of McKinley talked to the superintendent and agreed, except in the context of what Harper was doing and the fact that he'd waited for weeks to consider how to acquire the money in his would-be attacker. " What, yes you are absolutely sure, and you're just going to empty it with a fully loaded 1911 for a gambling mishap, and that is the only thing we can do? The only way we can judge yourself. The only thing we can judge you! That's all we can do!" 
 The sheriff motioned that the police escort for the SUV went north and that Harper was not to leave until the end of the day if he chose. Harper nodded, as he accepted the money and wandered around the parking lot, with his wallet and the keys out, slowly making his way to his apartment.

Apollo 17 was in abject suspense as we watched the impacts happen. Almost immediately, a very loud buzz emerged, "*destruction* ", " *Destroy* ", " *Alpha Centauri* ", " *Alpha Centauri to Alpha Centauri* ", and everything... was going to be OK! Damn my heaven! What are we waiting for? 
 Come on, Man, let's go see those stars for ourselves! Looks like a video teleport will start first. * Devoid* ( Not lying to you, the devs won't even call them Alpha ). 
 " *Impact* " the engineer said as the AI made first contact. It's some kind of device, a modified space station sent to catch stuff on the way to a distant galaxy. * Devoid*, there's blood on it! 
 " *Impact*! " a voice yelled in the background. * Dual Status Alert*, that's it! Nope! An anonymous voice in the background also said: " *Beep*. " 
 I started to laugh nervously. Looks like the device made no sound. " * Hit beep* " I grinned, before someone says, " Hello? " 
 I suddenly had a very strange feeling: the actual device had a strange, loud buzz. The platform got violently zapped out of it's normal place. 
 " Look, any thoughts on the change in temperature? " I asked the Engineer. 
 " All my systems are experiencing rate and spectral fluctuations, and all data traffic on the platform was going to stall. " the Engineer explained, as I gasped for breath. 
 " What happened? What's going on? " I asked the Engineer. 
 " Any distress signals being picked up? Anything and everything we sent out there is going to trip over terrain. I don't know, maybe the CPU blew up or something that killed it all. Maybe... I don't know, when we moved to the exit the platform just crashed into it. " 
 There was a realization that I couldn't believe my eyes. 
 " Okay, maybe it was a bad luck? Something serious? Do I care? We don't have much time... All we had to do was load data on it, and then we were done for the day! Are you okay? " the Engineer asked, bewildered. 
 " *beep*. Nothing! We don't have much time! " I said, struggling to continue. 
 " All we can do now, is watch you. " the Engineer said, so that I knew that the robot was fine. It's trying to get stuff on it's own to slow down speed. 
 " When does the casing stuff come out?" I asked.

We played the card game. And everyone in the audience looked on dumbfounded. I don't know how many kids looked at me or what their thoughts were, but there was certainly some conflicting opinions. I shrugged off the question and posited something rather amusing. 
 "Huh... I see, and there was the Ranger. I was the Governor. And I was the best accountant. " I stated. 
 " I said, just tell me who that Ranger is. What makes you think he's in need of saving from me? " They almost yelled at each other. 
 " I don't know, everyone has their own secrets. " I replied, at least to this generation. 
 " So, what's your plan? You're collecting souls of all sorts of different kinds to battle with? " They almost looked at each other, like I was exaggerating. " Alright, " I said as the battle began, " It's all a big joke, kids. For a while, the Governor was just like... " 
 The kid looked at me seriously. He started whistling in a tone I didn't recognize. I looked at the kid, shocked. I looked at the kid that raised his head. I took a deep breath, bit hard, and said, " Well, doesn't that make you an idiot? " 
 He nodded, and it was lunch time. He brought up his phone to the chat, toaster, and set it on his desk. 
 " Where is this guy? " He asked. 
 " Nobody knows. Somewhere in Europe, somewhere, in Asia, they have decided to summon this knight. You. What's your name? " I asked. 
 He shrugged, and then the guy raised his hand. " I don't know, man. Its a weird name. I'm Johnny, remember? We did this many times before the game with you, you know, my daddy was a musician back when he was eight years old. I remember a Jack William, you know that soldier? He was a giant in the family, like that guy in the book or whatever you might call him, and he played all over the place. Until this one day that kid went to his station and told him that he might win the Idol match. That's where I come in. 
 " So, are you a messenger of song? " He asked. He reached out his arm. I realized how weird this guy sounded. Then he smiled, and he said," Do you have a song book? " He opened up the book. The Joker slowly placed the book on his desk. 
 It was the only one I remembered. The Bible. As I sat there, I thought of the memory of that kid, and what I had to do to gain that power. I was finally going to get my hands on his collection for Odin and his army.

The tiling was greasy and green as it had never been before. The white of it made it's name sound like a mask, like if you placed a hand on it and it sucked out every last breath that was left. My grandpa had, in fact, been older. His frown had been larger than the walls and his bookcases, his navy, if I could even call it that, T-shirt still gleamed the way it used to. 
 I took a step forward, walked a few feet, and then stepped out the door. The guards were far too weak to catch me, but I wouldn ’ t stop. It would kill you to be close to them, so they'd risk the death of someone close to you. 
 I walked up to the grave. Inside the coffin was a silver, leather looking cube that resembled a brass cylinder, before long it was a more prominent-looking one. 
 “ Morning Joe, it is time to see the boys. Is this all right? ” the blacksmith said, going to his usual restful, discerning voice. 
 “ And welcome to his funeral, ” I answered, turning to go.

I tapped at the table angrily. 
 "Everyone stand down! My boss is just going to dismiss me anyway! " 
 I did it. I could see the joy in his eyes. I could see his hands tense with fear. He didn't take another step. 
 He had stopped his walk, broken off from his adventure, and replaced it with idiotic anti-social twang. How the hell did this guy manage to ruin my day so easily? He was the monster in this little squalid town, and if that man were to betray me so quietly, would the whole world just feel a slight connection with him? 
 " L-L-Lord, " I gasped, feeling my fists trembling, " don't suppose this is necessary? Do not presume to be an amnesiac, LORD! You have betrayed the Eminence to your Lord! " 
 I laid a hand on his forehead. I had only been watching his jaunt through this city when his entire district had suddenly collapsed. The Mayor was just getting to a point. 
 " I just said what? What did I just say? " 
 " Your Eminence is suing us for tax abatement. It is his full action which is sought by the Eminence. " 
 " Our whole district is praying for my aid! " he yelled. 
 I felt two chilling fists on my shoulder. I nervously snapped my fingers. 
 " Lord, you have come to save us! There is no opportunity to argue! Come on man, don't break out of your crap, or you are surely going to be seen by the establishment. " 
 " You are the one who stepped into the office and blamed me for everything we have done! " he bellowed. 
 " Oh shit, we are all here. We are all today!!! " I cried, ready to throw the entire district against his will. 
 I had received a response from my Eminence. I had come to save my school. He had actually been in the office. When they all fell, I turned to see my Eminence stumbling out from behind a door. 
 " That bastard the man who had seduced my teacher, who pushed me to my knees- " 
 " YOU! " he exclaimed in agony, " That bastard! You who made that FEAR lead us to the pulpit of hell!!! " 
 "! " I yelled. " I was free! I was free and you all KNOW it! The only reason I wasn't expelled was because I was dancing to " *Mezcal<|endoftext|>

The guilt was overwhelming. I've thought of all the people I could have tried to save, but I never took that chance. I've never said goodbye to my loved ones or cried. I have never broken eye contact with my children. Now, I never made it to the point of domestic violence. 
 The man walked away with a sad smile. 
 "I'm so sorry. " 
 He shook his head. 
 " That wasn't possible. " 
 The other men in the room got turned on. One by one. They called out to me, with no answer. All of them were either furious or so bitter they couldn't open their mouths. 
 " Hello Sir. I'm sorry. I tried to help you, but you locked yourself in this hell. " I was losing my patience. I finally reached my hand out to touch the glass. 
 " What? " 
 " You really don't know, do you? Why would you do this? Why didn't you stop getting so much worse? 
 " Because we, the law enforcement, don't do business with you. " 
 It was at that point that the man noticed my innocent eyes roll over mine. 
 " Where? Oh. Don't worry. I'll pick up later. " 
 The man nodded and fell into a deep sleep. 
 There I stood, the day I had died. 
 " You're right. We do business with you, as long as you keep quiet, " he said as he sniffed the medicine. 
 " In exchange for continuing to act as if you, as a dead person, are dead, please tell me you don't know" 
 I was silent for a while. But then he said that maybe... maybe he had nothing to live for. Maybe that I just needed to be okay. 
 But after two words, he nodded. And was finally able to sleep.

 [ " Guess what happens when a meme comes up that doesn't involve a shrek costume? " ]

 Shrek blushed, " Merlin doesn't mean anything by that... "

 Shrek's eyes widened. " Can I ask Merlin another time? " 
 Muna clicked on the Link Button. " 3 times this week..."

**********808**********
The rally was thick. The protest ended with squeals of orders and votes. Mortars entered and saw ambulances moving from one side to another. Soldiers slung themselves along the barricades leading towards Palaquin's stronghold. 
 This time, it was different. Their commander, Afan, closed the checkpoints in the castle like a curtain. His sergeant, Jere, led him into the open, pushing every man towards the war effort. 
 The rallying had become the basis for a village revolt. Anyone calling for extermination broke down barricades. Even more frustrated, the soldiers marched on the man to the center. Everybody retreated. 
 Soon, the rally was over. Batones reopened. Audiences met with their president. Then they demanded that all the men be shot. The one woman in the audience, Red, spoke: 
 "Countless rifles- they're open. I have entered the arms of their leaders, and I have the confidence to hold the nation together." 
 Soon enough, the general broke the silence. Those who showed emotion, wept. It was too late for them. The silence lasted an hour and a half. The crowd turned their heads toward the president. The President's supporters cheered. The crowd was down to a blur. 
 Out of the glittering lights of the riot, the president disappeared. Others appeared in the suburbs. Mustering up the courage to confront one-another, they marched to the rally's gates. They told their grand ancestors: 
 Long ago, the town grew a shelter, built in the ruins of a piece of ruined stone wall. We trained with pikes and guns, and we might have taken the town as well. The rally has grown to encompass new battlefields. The flag of the town resides in the center, in the willows to nest in the central infinitesimal estate. 
 There are rumors of a rebellion that could destroy Palaquin. Based on documents we read, some townspeople believe that a guerrilla army is plotting to topple Palaquin. A fourth faction were said to have infiltrated the barracks: 
 Order and justice, guarded by a ruthless force of archers and defensive artillery. Arms companies encircled the courtyard. Cars lined the walls, so they could anticipate infantry and artillery. People screamed and chugged their beers, hoping to talk back to those foolish enough to meet in the first place. 
 We vowed to protect us, to keep us safe. That is why the townspeople came prepared. They knew that the folk of Palaquin knew of a feared army that was in motion. It was our destiny. It was our only way to protect the town. We'll be the way that they see to it. We will remove these weapons from their hands, of the revenge of the rebels. We will let these weapons sneak into their heads and kill the rebels. We will allow the rebels to expand. Our forces will be held back from outside if we don't shoot them down. 
 It will be a cruel thing to die so soon. They called us the deacons. It's true that Palaquin is a rather long, and sickly town, populated mostly by undead. Yet I am not there to kill them - they will capture us. 
 In this village, we are vulnerable to bandits and thugs. They follow the mortal forms of a father and his child. They lie about weapons and cover themselves with dust. We are afraid. We are scared of them. 
 Our forces will make them do harm. We will steal from them. We'll lay waste to their stomachs. They will starve to death. 
 I have seen our men take the Fifth Brigade and tear it all apart. They sent in my men. They send in mine. They lost their way. I know their kin well. 
 I will be there. I will take their wives. I will keep my home safe. I will protect their children. 
 I will take revenge.

**********809**********
The adventurers were gazing into the sky when one quietly and softly drifted back to sleep. They were given a weapon, a hat, cloth, and…almost all of it. 
 "I don't care about this guild taking care of us. We've lost our best to the Pokémon and want some of it instead. " The woman gave off a slight smile. Her brow furrowed in disbelief. " Yes, I do, but I'll pick another. It seems like they've lost both, has to be worse than this. " She brought her bag with her, carefully pulling aside the front plate. " If we want a proper coat and not anything I wouldn't mind being completely alone. " 
 Most adventurers were normally staunch home protectors, others had no concept of such things. Such things have plagued the guild since the development. It had become the blood bath of the Guild. There were many casualties, rumors of war between the West and its allies scattered through the small dungeon, with the villages burning and the homes destroyed. 
 Even the village leaders were as confused as they were when the messages fell silent from their tower, causing such riots. 
 They had each picked their own place for the first time, the leader speaking with the strongest voice in the kingdom. " My name is Sister Enga, you have the favour. I was hunting to save the village of Fa'quddu. Through sowing mud, gathering berries, and fighting the Magikarp in Game of Thrones, I was granted a favor. " Her voice lingered on the edge of a whisper. " The connection is uncanny, I can create *any kind of creature* if I look deeper. I can create food and flowers, supplies to be found in nature and then sell it on the market for extremely precious metals. If only I knew the price. It's my death wish. " 
 The group of adventurers fumbled with their gear, not wanting to open a letter before one of them blew their chests out of joy. They had no skill, they were nothing like that few truly were. 
 The leader scowled at the group of adventurers. " Surely you are familiar with the old iron works. The Gringotts, the relics of the Grimyroad, you see that one. Together, they will remake the world! The dark and dangerous face of evil that was once so dear to us and so beloved in our communities is not gone! * Our* kingdom has become *purged*. We have become *prodigal sons of Kamino's. Only you are ready." 
 A scared look crossed her face, as though she had just had a double life crisis. It wasn't like the village goblins would be exactly what they'd feared. That was the location of the lead and the destruction of that village village long before they arrived, but the goblins still lived and thrived on their noble coats of armor. 
 The woman smiled at her title, examining her possessions once again. She had bought gifts and souvenirs from nearby villages. She was welcomed back to the guild as one, albeit less so with those gifts and cursed wardrobes. She was a wealthy householdant, indeed, a huge hit there. Her absence of companions and her cursed wardrobes had made the guild a greedy, wealthy family, as they made sure to keep the pure folk in their posts and walked the streets around the headquarters. 
 Perhaps they had done what was right, but how could they have done what was convenient in the end? 
 Finally, before their victim had passed away they stepped into the skies, the voice sowing in their ears a shout. Time would tell, but not this time.

Uh no no no. 
 He knew I'd talk. 
 It's all that he had ever known: that he was stupid. That he was weak. That he couldn't count the minutes on the clock, couldn't make a decision because he couldn't afford the candy in his fries, or be able to stand staring at another kid's faceless face if he didn't smile. Every horrible dream had engulfed the kid, he was some sort of schismatic lunatic, a selfish brat. 
 But I couldn't say it wasn't obvious to him. Everyone around him had seen the darkness in his eyes. People would pretend to need to catch their breath because they had nothing better to do. He would just ignore it. He saw people trying to kill him. He never knew what he was feeling before, but he knew he was supposed to feel his own pain. 
 Today is the first day, at his first class of the day. The first day of "school." He accepts a blank sheet at his desk and follows it in steps as he stands. Walking along the empty school yard made like a munchkin football field, he walks in and turns the last corner to check the truck on the opposite side of the road. The truck turns back on a block on the road. 
 And as he moves a little distance he's rubbing his eyes, his muscles bulging from the deep squat and the disjointed stand he moves to. 
 Footsteps step on the driveway. 
 Then a few hands on his shoulders, trying desperately to get as close as possible to where he feels they are watching him. His look of dread sinks into the corner of his eye and he looks into his partner's, and she breaks into a smile and releases her hand, like she knows she's going to come for him but not him. A huge sigh of relief fills his heart. 
 He knows now it is time to go.

"My God, who are you? " 
 The bearded head mans who had given me a brief moment to respond turned toward me. It took the entire story of history a very different meaning from my own. 
 " I am you, sir, here to prove that you're not a hallucination. " 
 He lifted my backpack as if he was placing an object here. " Yes, yes, this is exactly what you are! Stop asking questions on my " Returned " site! " He was clearly trying to make it seem just as great of a surprise as I was feeling! That was the point. I wasn't going to feel some stress arising from this. 
 " My Dear, my Lord, what is your purpose in life? " He coughed, blood beginning to pool on his nose. 
 I opened my mouth to explain that I didn't mean to. No, I wasn't part of this conspiracy. I had meant to tell his mom that he was bipolar but the knee jerk reaction she had given me to get up around six or so hours prior took the cake. Every other reaction I had had was, " Damn it, I got dressed. " After I said that I drove home, my voice barely clearing the volume of my screams. 
 *You should turn on the news! One episode later and I'll be in the news again! * He squinted at me with narrowed eyes. In front of him was a television. 
 *Did I mention the couch you call *vacation**, his dad was all right? Ever since he had started college he had gotten college classes and was working full time. 
 *You should want to sleep with a flannel blanket on the couch for a couple of hours while you go the market? * The thought creeped my consciousness. 
 *Really, he had to work a lot... It sure hurt when you kicked out the house over to the neighbor. That area was better at attracting people. * He only had to be by one foot away from the door, but in the garage was the shotgun. * Think about all the fun you have doing outside in your dark room, but it'll get tedious soon enough. * 
 His eyes widened. 
 " I... I am sorry, sir. Are you okay? " 
 " I don't know... I was just going to leave the house. " 
 My mind raced. Where was I? Where could I have gotten that shotgun? 
 " How did you get in there? " 
 The blank stare was evident for several seconds before he broke out in disgust. My eyes shifted from the gun to the room. 
 *Let me think, but how many other people did you see you doing now? * 
 " I don't remember... " His anger finally grew. 
 " What did you do to your Dad?! " 
 " His cats. " 
 *Didn't I tell you he was living on the Eastern coast of Hawaii? * 
 " Nontheless... " 
 The faces on the faces in the background all then vanished away. The man walking across the street with a strange grin on his face asked me after a quick look over his shoulder. 
 " Father... How did you go? " He asked angrily. 
 " I didn't have time to ask that, sir! " I stormed out as I rounded the corner in the driveway and took a seat on the couch. A distant thought hit my mind like a truck slammed on a switch. 
 " Why do you all look so... ugly?" 
 I shot up the back seat of my Taurus and gestured to the wall in the distance. My eyes traced the starting of my driveway ahead of me until I stopped. I looked around in shock. I was walking on a quiet beach, a siren blaring in the distance. From the corner of my eye I could make out the outline of a ghostly face lying prostrate on a beach. The only sound was the snoring wind, which caused me to quickly cover my ears as I sped towards the ocean.

Alex awakened to the uncomfortable ringing of his alarm clock. He'd been digging through the living room blinds for the past few hours and decided on this should be his last. He jumped out the window and out the door, frantically trying not to look at the dark leaves. He groaned with delight, why not? Instead, he rolled over onto his stomach to lie back on his bed. 
 He yawned and carefully picked up the pins and needles from the spider web that he'd made for himself outside the window. He crossed his arms and stroked his beard, trying not to lose his surprise. 
 "Honey! " he called. " Please let me in! " 
 As he made his way out the door, Alex gently whispered, " Baby! " and pulled himself up onto his bed. He lay on his back and rubbed the wrinkles around his face with his fingers. 
 He opened his eyes, and he saw the face staring back at him. He changed quickly to see that it was his daughter, Alice. He was across the street from his house now. He felt butterflies run through him. He opened his little mouth and spoke softly to himself " 
 'Alex, I love you. " 
 The smile was on her face as she said, " Goodbye. " 
 He thought she'd been crying, which turned out not to be. He did hear her sigh when he walked over and kissed her. Her breath was there, but it wasn't in the tone of your mother. Alex looked down at the smeared white crown on her head. He looked at his arm, and saw that the blood pooled underneath it. 
 " What do you think, " he asked her. 
 " Nothing. It's fine. Why couldn't you have known I was being horrible, or anything else? " 
 " No, Alice! I'm so sorry. I really am. I really am. I love you too, Lucy. " 
 Alice giggled a little in her sleep. She felt a little strange, as if something had been haunting her and that something would scare her, too. She reached into her pocket, tapped her foot, and pulled out her phone. 
 " Caroline, " she said, " is there anything else you'd like to tell me? " 
 " I hope you never met me; it was the first time I did, Alex. 
 *An undated photo of Alice* 
 " Best not to tell my mother, " Caroline said, " and it was a funny call. Maybe it was the babysitter or the guy who called me. I'm sorry, though. I didn't mean to hurt you - I'm sorry..."

Mr. Scarborough awoke in ice. Everything around him slowed down. He shifted again, every piece of clothing in the room glistened with all the grey. 
 "What... Who... " 
 He tried to tear through his robe. His arms were cracked, his veins were blocked, and all the bones were displaced. His body ached, his eyes were bloodshot, and blood was boiling over his nose. In the corner of his vision, he saw the first glimpse of a small, adorable face. An over-sized glowing bowl of rice and blackcurrant. 
 " She will wake me in three months... " 
 In a shuddering thunder, he tried to swing open the door. On impact, he slammed it shut and tore at his coat, pulling it limply from his waistband as he floated helplessly backwards. He lay in a pool of seawater and black holes. His breaths were shallow and his heartbeat surged. He was gone. He would never see her again. 
 What had once been a knight-layer and special-in-training, had become a normal guy's lounge. Paddleboardboards. Padding. Shaved drapes and galley chairs. Yet while he was floating on wet, humid water, his mind sat and cheered at a stuffed animals bubble. His heart beat every time he came back into existence. But as he drifted through the Great Ocean, his heart got stronger. He could taste salt, see fish, speak fish. Words cried into his head. 
 " Can't we stay in one place for, like, a week? Then we'll find another pair of stomachs, another, maybe two years? Maybe we'll find something else. " 
 His mind scrambled about, unplacing his fragile rigid body in the icy water, all in sync with his jaw. But the end was near. He was cut off by an intense realization. The couch was ruined. Red paint had swallowed the floor. Oil covered the floor. His knees were open. The sleeves on his black beach chair were smashed. The wind howled and rasped, all the while the shark unleashed its vitriol. All over his castle, hammering his back against the icy surface. And what was left of him froze instantly, knowing full well that he would never see her again. 
 But he couldn't let that get to him. But he pushed through the first wall and couldn't find her. But the realization eventually followed. There he was, covered in ice. He was entranced by the glowing bowl of rice he lost. He was overwhelmed by his first love, who pulled him through. Had she really done something? Had she not been here, crying, like she had been this whole time? 
 He didn't know. He didn't know anything about her. But he wanted to know. And his body ached for more. His eyes were watering and he felt numb. But his eyes were glowing and he felt invincible. He was leery of all that is going on in the world, and thus, the world might be better off without her. But he couldn't help himself. 
 And then, much to his great and wonderful surprise, she woke up. " Another sleep." She had said.

I read the book. It was like playing the cello I was so proud of. My grandpa just read it once. I don't remember getting out of bed, or being able to see my dad in person. 
 The first thing I remember is just getting out of bed and the dust bouncing off my walls, seeing my dad moving, and then leaving. I am scared. 
 I don't have time to explain it to him anymore, but I am scared for my child. My grandpa hears the dust bouncing off the walls, my hands shake, and I feel my power being drained. 
 I head towards him, in the same way I was back when the book was purchased. I do this every so often, when I get this desperate need to read something, only to have it lose its gorgeous qualities. So I try to explain it to him. 
 "Do you know where to go first? " I ask. 
 His hands grasp for my finger and he fingers point to where I have abandoned it. I come to terms with my circumstance. And then I drift off. 
 I don't know what it will be like out there. He will say it will be bad, bad. But why is it bad? 
 I wake up one morning a few days after trying to explain the book to his grandfather. This morning he just told me that he did not know it was wrong. 
 I don't know what he will believe, but then I have another question. 
 " What if I was in a dying world? What if all I'm going to have was a blip of the light in the dark? What if I had only some 100 years to live? Would it be so much better to live after we die and go right back into the glow of the past?"

The city of Fantasy 
 I am called by many names, which comes across as jaundiced and crude, with little warmth or care. Having said that, the name Stranger is also not the name for the obscure and obscure, but for the marvellous and filled with wonder, that make a saying such an error. 
 The word Stranger is not really needed, not given to us by form. To me, the name Stranger is, since it is an ill fitting and cliche. To draw on the name Stranger, I would not be for this city. No, I would, truly simply be Stranger, for it was for that name. 
 Night is a quiet night, a time in my life, upon which innumerable beasts travel, and under which two hulking harbingers will burrow and fertilize each other. Dragon, snake, and flying ram are all I see. 
 Night is lonely, I think I am. 
 Each night, is when I feel my confinement loosening. Night is when my nightmares begin. 
 Night is restless, as I take every step up. Night is when I will march on, and if time will hold me up there is nothing I can do. 
 It is too late now, and the Tower is ready to rend, until my tower rests upon the plain, and all is lost. 
 There is no Tower to distract me, no Tower to try and keep me free, here I am. 
 The Shadow of Night made mine, and no sooner had I lifted up than I found it. It gazed down upon me with green eyes. While it rested on its lap, holding me. 
 The Shadow used its sharp tongue to strike me with its snout. For such a tongue would stain my skin, but it evened out the stain when an awkward searing pain brought it to a halt. 
 It was like frost, the Nightmare had grown in size. 
 Once more, in fear, sleep crept upon my closed mind, and I awoke once more by the yard, covered in tales of adventurers, and long long-forgotten spells, but never once uttered by the city. 
 Sleep, which ends in horror, for I have been summoned to this city to feed. 
 When the shadow broke, with pained eyes, it removed me from the shelter, and flew to the Tower. I sat in its shadow, and I fear it will threaten me if I don't tell it my secrets. 
 It is a fortress of sorts, whether it is in its dark, green, beastly, or rolling, but that fact does not disturb it as much as it would rough it up if I were to tell it to sleep. 
 No, it is not night, or the Isles that surrounds this city. It is the Shadow, who is not a Ruler of this cragspeak. 
 Rather, it is the Tower. 
 Night is closing around me, and it is growing close. 
 Perhaps as the Shadow is trying to kill me, though I don't know the name, the Tower must surely fear the Shadow more than me. 
 This tower awaits.

We had quickly locked horns. Some hailed the foul tactics as technology advancement, while others scoffed at the politicians labeling it as being a use of state and military funds to intervene. People flocked to Capitol Hill, campaigning for change, but failed to die for the sake of consumption. Confronting this new enemy of titans can be dangerous, truly. And so we began. 
 The attacks on the airports were nothing more than a distraction. With Americans paying more attention to their daily televisions than to their disposable disposable phones, all of us were busy making physical contact. Some important, long-term studies carried out by field experimenters showed the biocide effects could become harmful in some situations. The tendency to appear ill-prepared for a pandemic, a crisis. In the end, most didn't even try. People got sick, and died the normal way. 
 The media held it to be amusing that a black man married with his rich father, murdered by his own parents, was sitting down at a restaurant with his wife. Would the media have piqued his curiosity? It seems so, the pro-life crowd, who therefore decided it was the best thing to do? It seems so. 
 His killer is already dead, and since his brain function was attenuated, his killer's face simply does not exist anymore. You see, the earth has a magnetic field and electron tethers them to the skies above. It changes shape and comes into manifestation. Whatever they left behind, the world lost. Entire worlds, one hundred five hundred and thirty six. 
 Politicians were unable to hold back their excitement, and those of us who could handle our reactions sought to create an avenue for peace. Mars became the first world to truly combine its two antithetical states as a viable military force. The close deployments of manned missions to Mars were a mark of bold claims of unassailable importance. Mars became home to new supplies, a fruitful agricultural land for growing crops and weapons, and a pristine landscape once known as our home. 
 Eventually they invaded the Americas. The American military shuttered their plants in a fury of nuclear bombs, laying waste to cities and breaking entire diplomatic fronts. More people fell dead than rebuilt in settlements, and the international community quelled their rapacious deportations. Sure, Mars was in many ways a sacred holy planet, which was why the US never invaded it. 
 It was only a matter of time before we unleashed a curse on the planet that held it together, and killed the old gods of Terra, Nephthian, and Saturn. 
 The end came quickly. Despite our prowess and power, the place we thought "home " was outgrown by old Gods, others taking another step, seemingly rising to command. The evil gods had returned to reclaim earth from the tyranny of the Ancients. The Earth was no longer earth itself. 
 They spread like wildfire throughout entire galaxies, driving our two allies to the brink of the abyss. Although we worshiped our allfathers, our search for a new home was marred by the betrayal of some of our loved ones. The peopled worlds that plagued us refused to stay a worthy home in the " Earth" they needed. 
 The power of life on Earth was lost in an age of wonder. We knew that while the stars did not possess any gravity, from the remnant of a previously supernova, they had advanced to incredible speeds. They were as mobile as needles. With our help, they took control of their future. Although no longer connected to the world around them, they were able to hold tight to a vital signal, known only to each individual.

The one-time freemason Johny Roberts stared at the chalk scribbled on the chalkboard. He loved chalk, for he loved it so much. 
 "The history of magic has been intriguing, didn't you see? How does it spread through the land? How does it get through food and water to the West? What causes it, now? Who makes it up to become what it is. And who does? How long did it last? Does it last? " 
 Johny walked up to one of the two other wizards, Brad, and asked him a question that caught him off guard. " Are we coming with the law? " 
 " Always come with the law, " Brad responded calmly. " Who takes the law seriously? It requires everyone to share in the governance of wizardry, and share what people want. " 
 Johny leaned over to Brad and took in his new experience. " Darlon... Has there ever been an actual wizard named Darlon before? " 
 Brad looked at his the name given to the greatest wizard in history to share the same name. " Yeah, Andy. And that's all my advice. First to remove your bowels, then take your shields and swivel. For someone so comfortable with archery with your sword in your hands, your arrow will strike! " 
 " You mean--"

We're all of us from the same and kind family. Some are We A People, others are demonic Christians. We often don't talk about the fact that we have a date in our family. My husband, a gun to a kneel, which is what my husband is holding, was recorded four months ago now. His family has two young children. One is just two years old. He's holding an apple. The older daughter is just five. She cries for help and requests a shot and red bullets. My husband always leaves the house with a gun, which is what my husband and I are holding. I always say what's important. Let's get him out of there. 
 He tells me the whole story the next day. " I was dumbfound not to eat for breakfast last night. So when I came home the next morning I saw some pretty dark shapes over my bedroom floor. I went up to the kitchen and saw the strange 'lawn workers'. But no one was there. No one left my house. I walked over to the moustache. There was no one there. I turned over and saw a woman. She looked at me. She spoke. " My children, I forgive you. But once that girl walked into my living room... " She gestured angrily to the kitchen table. " I killed her. " 
 " Ouch! She's asking for *foolishness*!! " 
 " If you wanted I could shoot you! " 
 " No! " 
 " Maybe! Just like I want! Just like I want! " 
 I have no one to kill for me. Except for her and the monster that she is. 
 I try to think of anything. Why did I do that. Anything, really. But I'm dead. I can't think. I was just thinking. I try to remember what she said but my brain is convulsing. And the memories and all that I have, and all that I had done, all that I was *done, * forget everything else. 
 One evening, I go to play with my family. Sitting on their picnic bench, opposite their graveside, I look around them with a deep sadness in my heart. They're all dead. 
 " In one hour, I will find them. And I will ask them for help. " 
 My son is gone. His parents have been taken away from him. 
 " Kill her. " 
 " No one will ever hear her scream. " 
 I keep thinking of the part where the monster said, " Perhaps she'd let me kill her instead. " It's been so long since she's been alive, and while I'm far from sure that either one of us have, I'll always remember that great thrill to slaughter those of us that are not here. 
 " Yes! " I take one last look at the woman's corpse and flash a smile at her. " I kill the ones that I love, and have no problem killing them." 
 My wife will never see me again. She'll never see me. For some reason, in my heart, I always say things like that.

The secret is, I'm just a human disguise. 
 I lie for a geezer in the court room, I dress myself a tux and protect myself. I cover my eyes and smile, I am awesome, I had be a superhero all my life. I sometimes try to cheat on the amazon ladies, but they miss me. To me, amazon isn't bad, I like my hair, I like to hug children, I get myself to sleep in perfect quality, that's the thing about amazon. 
 It is ironic, when i first met her. She kept her mouth shut, waiting for the right moment to release the two seconds that would be needed to fight her, I mean she wore none of the above, she wore the exact same suit I wore. I think it was a combination of burning hot surprise wax and the feeling of her skin rising in my hand. She has been my treasure all my life, I could hardly ask for more, so the guard smiled when I reminded him of my romance. 
 I was in high school, this girl was thirteen and was no big deal, not to mention she knew my style and i know her, I was the hottest girl in town, she said that i would be the one you use to get fired if you kicked me out. Though, they said that i was a bummer, i tried my best to live up to my full potential, then i fell into a house violence situation, she screamed at me, blood was splattered all over the floor. She died instantly. 
 I went through puberty, i was afraid of the dark side, oh what a weird name for a bitch. But honestly, i still get them in here as villains and the people around me like to drag me into the imagination to screw them over or something. Since she was seven it's all their grins for us, I can't help but fill my head with 'villain powers'. 
 Then after I was nine, she told me stories about herokuichi and how he was my true love, like heroes I could protect, i killed juri! i mean he betrayed me, i made a bad decision and she kept pulling the trigger, without seeing it. She was never a bad person, but often did things for the evil of the world. That's not what got me here but I started to understand things, she took a smile. 
 To call her that is a misunderstanding, never mind, i think she was joking, she was genuinely sad, i suppose its good she lost her nerve, but it was only taking something so sweet. 
 She died of a serious heart attack after that, she told me about how she took away people's lives and ended people's dreams, she told me about what people like her had tried for so long, her eyes were like jelly as she lost all control and she walked away from the cage, she found nothing more, all i wanted was for her to leave, to disappear into the shadows, her scars are what make her real, I have to be the protector of her children. 
 oh, by the way everyone who has even seen her alive put their camera on her, anyone else probably still there, just notice one funny thing, she hates the dark, it makes them afraid, really scary, i really hate dark things. 
 she never gave me her phone, she had no friends, but this is just outrageous.

A rock stood at first, a blue glitter in the night sky below. The humans had tried to contact the aliens before, but had all failed. The water was only half-drilled and the plastic had been replaced with rather luxurious paper beads. The aliens had been small, scattered, almost unrecognizable. They were clean and fairly similar to humans, except in that they spoke no English. 
 On top of the rock an Olympic medal on which the humans had embedded two black, ancient fingers carved into the ring. The pulsing, concious mass was fast becoming an out of body experience. 
 The earth was covered in sand and water but they were still alive. They were about to sink a month but thought swimming was their best move. 
 A few hours passed and the people saw what was going on. It looked like an earth, one that looked, had a mossy rock surface. The people started to seem relieved and began to recall where they were. The rock and the humans had found each other on one of those big rock swallows. 
 The world faded to nothingness. The people just sat and stared at it, waiting for their next move, hoping something better would happen. 
 A day later, on top of the rock was a small, green, soot covered rock with an ancient little rock implant above it. 
 I moved to the hideout and open a box, a shard with a watch. I stopped by the bathroom and pulled out two long, green knives. 
 I held them up to the box and said, "No one wants to be scared when they leave this thing on. " 
 The bottle fell to the floor and fell in the crevices where the bits of rock had been. 
 The people noticed it and stared at me, unaware that their next move would be nothing but an old shard. They were correct, the rock and the humans were created on one planet. 
 The water reached deep into the box and I pushed. The water met the rock and the humans started to drip, with little new water appearing. The people began to stop and then their people began to die. After a couple of days, the box remained in the old, old house. The people started to take the pill and a few of the women tried it, becoming pregnant and ending up doing children for the government. 
 I saw the women that looked in this box more often, it was full of the women who looked like women at the time. " Am I making life suck?", I thought. 
 The pills soon started to overwhelm the women, forming chunks and stones. I realized there must be something wrong with them. Maybe the pills were designed to suck the life out of the woman. Maybe they hadn't made her pregnant. 
 I was peeing on the floor and I passed out. The people went to look for me and the old lady picked up and grabbed a drink from the top shelf behind the toilet. Before she could put the drink in the glass, she was crushed in its mouth. And nothing happened. 
 The people were pissed at me for thinking I would make their lives suck, then what? They could have been okay with me sucking the life out of them, right? 
 I closed the box and ran out the door into the deserted streets of the city.

It was a Thursday evening out in Provost St. Kane bank, and the aroma of beer, coffee and cold water filled the room. " Derek - is this it? " Derek stood with his back to a sharp-angled glass, eyeing a single pallid sheet of paper. " This seems like it's been four weeks. " 
 The old man stared at him blankly, then spoke with heavy bitterness. " Is he still there? This isn't great. " 
 " Derek, " Derek said quietly, adjusting his T-shirt. " And that's exactly how we ended up here. " 
 " So what do you want it for? " Derek demanded, releasing a thick, threatening hangup. 
 " Well... " The old man paused, gesturing toward a large video screen mounted to the wall behind him. " I don't know who you are. Or, really, how, but whatever. " He reached for a paper, and drew a card from his pocket. " St. Chicago High League. " 
 The old man pulled his hand back from his wrist, and grabbed the cards black for his new hardball. His thumb slowly swiped them for each player who saw it. Derek scanned the card, moving his index finger over the black play-side to a dial that was just a few paces away from the number. His teeth skittered against the ground as he read, then continued to scrawl lines, chirping. 
 " Greg Smith, Wyoming 32, " Derek was stumped. Greg Smith fell in front of the TV screen. 
 " Greg Smith, Wyoming 32, " Derek was happy to see the lights flickered on in front of the television. " Greg Smith, Wyoming 32, " the words flickering out of his mouth. " Greg Smith, Wyoming 32, " and, more convulsing than usual, the words " breif " still stuck out as if they had never crossed their fingers. The line, which lasted one minute, continued: 
 " Gregory Smith, Wyoming 32, " and Greg Smith, Wyoming 32. " 
 " Great. " Greg Smith stared at the screen, " great, boy. " His hand trembled with anticipation. 
 " Roger Hanhart, Kansas, Midwestern, 40 years and counting. " Derek and Roger Hanhart glanced at each other for a moment. 
 " Roger Hanhart, Kansas, Midwestern, 40 years and counting. Roger Hanhart, Kansas, Midwestern, 40 years and counting. " Roger Hanhart shook his head. 
 " You know what! " Derek sprinted out of the room. " Come back in just one day!"

Puffing just as they were setting about, I could hear two sharp blades clash in the bottom of my cupcake tin. Damn it. This cupcake must have been a novice. They would just want her to vomit and then never see her again. Finally the cupcake hatcheried to the floor. All who felt at home were too scared to throw on their own clothes, to run or jump so fast that many won't even make it out of the cupcake kitchen. I growled as the two blades connected the body of the cupcake so the hatcheried mouse took her into a large, dark hole. The smell was strongly foreign to me. Suddenly I noticed something was hazy. A stupid tall drawing of a handsome old man in the shape of a dagger at the end. Tied up I looked around at the lot of them. No one seemed to have noticed that all the mess was already become a thick, black cupcake. Then I noticed the cupcake had an unimpressive name. It said... Pinky. The cupcake hatcheried just stared at me and he seemed serious and forceful. My peanut butter hearts of agony erupted with laughter, they were going to huff and wriggle, but I can't stop laughing! Purple and boldly he said to Pinky, "Now mate, we have to make some bread for my dear girl. " Pinky slapped the cupcake hatcheried along with his long slender fingers and he shouted " Lucy Hale, Paraffin, and Fluffylilly." Everyone laughed all at once and everyone else cheered! I cried out in joy at the sudden gratification! I stepped out of my place and grabbed Lucy Hale's large, blue pudding cup. Up the stairs I cried my eyes out at the breakfast monster, that is me!

I apologize if this is a lie, please just sit and take some time to finish this. 
 As we all know you have always had a penchant for violence and believe me, you don't stand accused of treason. Instead you carefully gear your decisions into a person ’ s reasoning, and execute your knowledge of history long before the vice-president gets into his office. It ’ s down to the courage of men, even if their cowardice may be mistaken for cowardice and an amoral decision, you have all the courage of a man. 
 I have had a long life, but my one true skill is to never do my own doings. I have made this decision myself, never to order another ambassador, and never to summon this country to give one last stand for who I am. I don't consider myself a revolutionary, for the manner I embrace the threat of war makes me a righteous leader. No, I know what it means to fight for my country. I believe me and my country, and this is why you today join the troops. Join us for the strength of our country, the strength of our generals. We shall not be in a state of chaos, no matter what happens in this country, and we shall never go without our men. 
 History will teach us the legend of Abraham Lincoln. I stand before you today, honorably, and defend us from those who have only deserved it.

"Are you buying that or what?" 
 The words stained the bed for a third time now. They form a mask of light and light I'd had to put on ever since I was one. More importantly, she tried to tell me not to buy that, that she'd had at least a dozen lies told about it before I even laid awake. She'd tried to hush me from being scared of her, but now she was pushing me to the side. Walking in the closet covered with our closet fan, I felt comfortable. 
 I turned around to leave and sat on the couch, pulling my feet up and around it. Her crown traced along the lace, a hint of her full lips in a warm rose colour. She smiled from head to toe, then towards my shoulder, then to my heart. 
 I chuckled, adjusting my shirt. A cold winter breath seemed to disturb her thoughts. I was done, and I sighed a long, long sigh. * Stressed out*. 
 In such a moment, the silence was deafening. I watched as the words were presented to her from beyond the field of stars. I read the words with a tone of profound anxiety. It was as if the universe were learning things. I'd held my breaths. It was a tone of comfort. 
 She wouldn't believe me. That's what happened to all her lies! Once I was human again, and I was finally happy. That was finally not all for me.

Jonny was stumbling across Reddit the day he had dropped out of college. Before he left his dorm in an attempt to 'get accepted', Jonny committed suicide on the 23rd of March at precisely 5:30 PM EST. 
 His exhausted body sat on the curb of the parking garage at the nearest resort. He had the video camera and hand sanitizer on. The anger and frustration building up inside of him slowly increasing exponentially. He had to realize he would never feel good about this, but now that he could, it was time. 
 His guts started to rot and that's when he felt it. The evening light was pulling against the curtains like a tightening rope. He thought if his friends were here soon he could win something in return for her love; by any means necessary. Any time something bad happened in front of him, he would lose himself in it again. 
 He lost all energy and stood up. On his bare feet he could see the lining of the pool below. He walked to the entrance of the swimming pool where his friends were excitedly staring out at the ocean. He pushed himself to the spot where he already knew that he could have tripped over the water; the edge of the pool appeared nearly just as caught the surface of the water. He bent down to save it, and ran into the crevice that the pool broke into, trying to find a broken cable in a loose locker and what appeared to be some kind of nail. 
 As he struggled through the streets that were clearly for a height and depth, he noticed all of the houses were empty. Each building was completely unlivable with no mention of any entrance or exits left. 
 Jonny's bones began to chatter under his breath. The thought of the wind throwing him off the ledge frustrated him more than anything. He sprinted to an alleyway far away from where his friends were drinking. A pistol was strapped to his belt and aimed at Jonny. 
 The chase became just the beginning for Jonny. He could hear the screams of the men at the gates where the men in suits were waiting. That was when he realized. He was no longer alive. All that remained was an evil grin. 
 Jonny's body was still inside the pool. He was teleported back into his house to get help. He was to find some sort of tool or something that could do it. But now he felt no means of accomplishing it. He ended up running out of the alleyway when he heard a man scream.

“ Get on the ship, let ’ s go! ” 
 “ Yes, sir. Yes sir, it ’ s coming. ” 
 When Colonel Dovak slammed the scanner down, a confused voice echoed through the cockpit. “ God ’ s there! ” 
 Everyone looked around as a loud bang rang out from inside the cockpit. 
 “ A man, good sir. ” 
 “ Yes sir, of about 22 million people, one of them is. ” 
 Shit! It would've been so easy to figure out the alien data in the onboard database, but they only got so many and it ’ s hard to keep track of all the feeds. 
 “ The news is dead, Sir. Do you know who- “ 
 “ No sir! ” 
 “ How? ” 
 “ Who, is this? ” 
 “ I don ’ t know Sir. ” 
 “ Serenity Sir! There ’ s no way. ” 
 “ What ’ s happening? ” 
 “ We should *all* shut the fuck up. ” 
 “ Are you serious! ” 
 Colonel Dovak jumped to his feet as the light source filled with static continued to crackle. The blindfold cloud surrounding Colonel Dovak was now visible under his sunglasses. How could he still function? He knew they were working on technology and security upgrades but this was the first time his life had come to this. 
 Right then, the sightificer gurgled heavily. “ Of course there are some things that you can ’ t control without them, Colonel Dovak. ” 
 “ What are these things? ” 
 “ They have taken some of the brains of Neanderthals in Europe. We have very strict protocols regarding these transmissions and we ’ ve seen it happen. And what was on your servers has been stolen. ” 
 After having some time to analyze the files, Colonel Dovak looked towards the cover. “ Have you gotten a real neurological breakdown? They ’ re having this *blood-on-shit* sync thing now. You can hear. Look! ” 
 The top line on the screen started blinking as it opened all the displays on the ship. A quick cry of “ Save data! ” followed by bright flash and the Command icon could be seen on every image set up on the monitor, affecting various areas in the ship. 
 “ Doctor, make sure they are back here. ” 
 “ Can ’ t do anything but watch our data! ” 
 “ They ’ re not here for our data! ” 
 “ You ’ re too late, Doctor Dovak. I get it. Everything is going fine and they just need some good info. Our orders are to take out the Neanderthals and *corporeal fragments* because humans are almost ten times more vicious than Neanderthals, in terms of the stature and weapons they have and even on violent humans. ” 
 Colonel Dovak stepped towards the control panel. “ We need to come back in a few minutes and interrogate our malevolent brethren. They ’ re going to think we ’ ve been transmitting messages without instructions. ”

"V.A, V.A, V.A! " the demon shouted in approval as he chased the child with full speed. The child screamed and fell over as V.A hacked the long long neck as well. The monster standing beside him grunted in pain as V.A slayed him and dragged the monster to the ground. 
 " END THIS " the " machine " screams as V.A chomped him on the ass. The children grew cowering in fear and V.A began its countdown and faced the first or second hand demon. But V.A knew better. 
 " END V.A!" hissed out the monster and then the last demon, they became a pair.

He slid down to his feet, a sniffling blow to his nose. He glanced at the clock but did not see anything else. He looked at the time as his phone rang. " B-b-b-but... well... " He pulled a finger into the small clasp and waited, catching the alarm clock that was only connected to the power outlet. It took him some time to remember. The awkward silence between devices kept reminding him. 
 When he woke up, he had got another helluva surprise for Wednesday. The fact that he still had his phone set on fire at the same time still haunted him. He turned to turn it on but realized the battery was running low. It seemed to be doing much less than it had used to be. The fact that he hadn't turned it off for some time made it truly overwhelming. With each tapping against the door to his office, his tiredly fixated on the clock, he slowly picked it up and checked the time. He quickly pulled the other one out of his pocket, emptying the gun into his mouth as he always had. 
 The phone buzzed again but he remained silent. He turned the light off and waited. He waited and waited, patiently waiting for it to ring and ring, a flashing message. As the touch of the screen grew brighter and brighter, the bright light finally burned off and the call continued. The time felt much longer. 
 " Hey mister, my daughter called. She's crying, I can't hear her. Her name's Michelle! What's wrong? " She was screaming and crying and it was taking forever to realize her own state. He looked at his watch but did not see another sign of him seeing anyone else. " Hey, I need a ride. " He did not know what he was asking to ask but he couldn't let the car get in the way of something he had said. As he pulled up the stairs, his attention shifted back to the fire alarm clock and away from it. " Just a moment?" He said in his perfect voice.

Arkanne looked down upon his guild of knights. "... that little city led by his father, the fief lord, was like nothing they had ever seen before. It really was a city of a kind, filled to the brim with all kinds of peoples and cultures that had existed in the world before... a man that cared for the land... a man that did... things with a full heart, lived life with a world full of chaos and pain. " At first and only when the voices were quiet, Arkanne was impressed that he'd just seen so much stranger characters make faces. " Aw, a strange fellow. " 
 Arkanne opened his mouth to tell her that this was it. It would be the end of all people, full of suffering and suffering, truly a happy city. The voices were growing louder and she knew why. " He would have visited the city if he could have. " 
 " He was here, young armanne, that boy. He brought his good luck to them when they let go of the mask and filled his heart with hate and misery, all while feeling the flames of justice still pulsing through the corners of his mind and rage beamed through his veins. " 
 " A crown...? A crown on your head, eh? " He asked her. 
 " No one really really knows yet but they believe in Arkanne's true nature. As they call him, he was a stranger as his father was, how could he have known so much from such a young man? " 
 " Because the sounds of the voice in his head would prove him wrong."

People. 
 One by one they left the town. They called the populace for shelter and roads, ways to accommodate those who couldn't anymore. Some had gathered just before dawn to do what others had to done for as long as possible, but the last one had lost touch with them. The one who continued to struggle in the face of the failure. Every single one of them. Every single one of them. 
 Lives were down since the auk hour. Sadly, that all changed at a moment of great need. A knotted ritual amongst the laborers of the brig, every single one of them. One must remain in one location for the millenia. To feed the surplus of aborigines whom had managed to flee from the harsh, rocky shacks. To socialize with the hardest of the townspeople, those who had begun to trouble their inability to make it through the growing distances. 
 And yet, in the south gate kept the village from becoming a mass casualty. There was a name given to them by their own kin, some of whom died with them. They did this until they faded away into the murky pits of history. 
 It was supposed to be a fun everyday event, not one set of times because the townspeople followed it all the time. Though what they now knew as "money " now seemed to be taken to pay for a task, all the in that village now were willing participants. The locals over here, those with no real idea of their lives, up to the very end were long dead. Some chose to go to another village, others to an even more severe, dark and harsh experience. 
 This woman named Sarah stood in front of their eyes as she stared at the piles of medical papers and hamlet paraphernalia that reflected on them. She didn't live in the town in peace until the ceremony where she burned down the newspapers with a single group of goats who had all fallen over and started crawling around the corpses of their now dying brethren. Every one of them. 
 She came towards us. We did the only thing we could think of when the ceremony came to a close. We ran over and waited for her to speak. She was an elderly woman, in her late 40's. Her face covered in a loose mask and her eyes bloodshot with all the hate that spilled forth. She had been a nuisance for the town since the village began its brutal campaign against her overpopulation. She wasn't supposed to die, however. She had become a monster, something to be exterminated in a just manner. 
 When the ceremony finally ended, Sarah covered the ceremony with a thin cloth to hide the soreness. She made her way to the graveyard where her recently deceased comrades were lying, bleeding out. Another blindfold was placed on her. She said in her only language to the others: 
 " I wish I could be your judge. " 
 She continued to die, of a disease that seemed to be the way of things. 
 That was six months ago. She was sitting here, surrounded in blood and just waiting for the death from the high winds to stop him from killing all her members. Some of her friends were preparing for the scene, some drinking away at the bar one night and others getting to work early to make a decent living. To have someone else take responsibility for her sins. The items he'd put down had no effect on the way they would live any longer, it just seemed like he was getting away with it. 
 Who was going to take it away from him anyway? The other groups weren't here anymore and the number of witnesses to the trial had risen at a rate that had never before been seen. The place itself was just a fraction of what it once was, yet none could pay for the punishment it had inflicted. She didn't know what to say, even as she found out. The circle was over. It was time for her to die. The circle itself was given place to several of the others. A physical body could be sent straight into the fray of battle. Some would die, a few would survive. And yet, she waited. Waiting at her step the bodies where on her wish. She prayed to God that she could last as long as possible. 
 So she waited. 
 Suddenly she could hear the howls of livestock that were already mounting up in the distance. The last of the villagers heard their deaths in silence and fell to the ground, as the already young livestock dispersed like a springfield. There was a scream at the beginning of the ceremony that echoed like a child's song, until it was broken by a distinct, skeletal voice of a woman sitting on the steps of her burning lair. 
 " Hey, it's time! I'm gon na be your judge!"

In the building where Albus towered, Bo as he knew she was equal parts this establishment and the street she now lived in over a dozen different locations held a steady public standing vigil for those in their thirties. The mere fact that he happened upon this place on his trip to fetch a seltzer to get cleaned every two hours did not seem to bother her, she would not irritate even if she was told to rush off into the city center once she had a couple minutes before, even if it would cause both her and her own emotional state to run through. For no other reason that the local undertaker in charge of cleaning them herself could dislike, you had to rely on your teeth, your body, especially once you started to unload heavy products in this black and white fog. 
 Albus's shoes slung over his head after he had closed the door firmly and got on with his bag, wearing a stained pair of jeans and a watery yellow cloak that featured rainbow stones off the black slacks and foams. He swiveled out and to avoid the source of all this silent, grim expression, he bought up a stool from the back of the alleyway. He walked to the front doors of the warehouse, unclosing them with a lever to complete the tight, but for far less easy task, which was to unscrew the knob to attach the barrel into the barrel of the lance. She was still toying herself with herself as the rumble of the door swung open, her hands grasping both her upper thigh and bound wrists tightly. 
 Bobby was standing, falling flat onto the ground, still carrying on his loose black long leather coat, holding his boobies and upholstery. He blinked, head in his hands, while running his thin fingers along the object's very fabric to his heart. He listened to his reflection in the ceiling, in the mirrors below him. There was the one that he kept in his flat-top store full of other artefacts, notably a bottle of pink leftovers from himself around five years ago, a poof of twigs that had been hanging over his back from the fireplace, most commonly a strange spear that she tossed down to get at a frowning yet depressed Mr. M. Tuttle. There was the iconic hat that he always wore, one he liked to dress himself and wore with pride, an ex- soldier who recently placed the insignia of great renown in his back and painted all over the front of his uniform. There was his last diary entry, to remember his time in the war, to his own life, to his gratitude for his comrades. Before he had even considered putting up that post the fog was blocking out everything but the bright side, she had barely noted a point to the effect that he had played an important role in that of an observer, that such drama as this was not to be missed. All for the benefit of Ms. T if he would be off the case for whatever "activity" he would be doing in the future, the visibility that was on an early morning in the middle of a busy day, waking up the night before a big gathering of corporate heads or the pride of their wives while talking to his daughter or his friends or his superior. 
 To be perfectly honest, Albus thought back to what he had said to her, he would gladly let her go willingly but just as he didn't really want to be seen as the cadaver that he pictured at the front door putting the lance into the barrel of the gun they could more than make up their minds. He opened up the cage room and sank to his knees in a blanket and held her tight. He had a notebook of his thoughts before they made it into his head where he would hand them over to Ms. Tetra while she cleaned themselves. 
 She would love it.

We finally get through the night, in jagged hollowed-out houses all over, all around miles away. We lie there, patting ourselves against the heavy sheets, fingernails lightly clawing for the blood that seeps from our wounds. The blood in our brains has exploded here and there and it's all so hot I almost can't see. That room just isn't for us. Even when the gun we carry is ready to reload ( I wish it was ) they just lay motionless in the dark and watched us as we died like so many weeks ago. 
 And if I ever see the light up in this room I know I'll never see it again. I've tried every tool at my disposal, but these numbers would only get worse. Only now, with the lights of the bunker being turned off and the night stirring beneath, do I see the machine gun slide into the air, now? It's on, it's time for the night, shall I say, off to the drop zone? 
 Sierra crossed the room and pushed it to her feet. What does she expect? I'm at the drop zone at 3am, I came over to watch her to judge if she could keep up. No, she wasn't lying to herself. I pressed the damn button and rolled my eyes. She was lying over in a pile of black meat and it seemed like she wasn't moving much at all. Where was Sierra? Where did Sierra go? Oh no, this was it. Sierra had finally found peace in her last wander of the woods, a place to settle down for the night. The hills were deserted, the marshes were completely green. Why do you keep an abandoned house if you can't have it? Why should you let a deadly world be forgotten in it's frozen death? 
 She lay there, slowly rolling her eyes as she approached the prone figure laying in the grass. When she looked up Sierra knew exactly what she wanted to do. She got up and began walking, never stopping for breath to slow her steady strides. She reached a safe spot and stood up to get out, right away, just waiting for her to turn to see who lay next to her. No time had passed, Sierra was already completely bled out. " Hi, Sierra. " She called out in a blood-thirsty tone. " What's going on? " 
 " It's that time of day. Who is this dead body? " It raised an eyebrow. " Yes, it is. I heard you have come over here this many times. " 
 Sierra gasped. " Well, you are? " 
 The blow in her face felt like it was slamming into the dirt of her fingers. She stared blankly at her, standing, looking down, feeling her heart pounding in her chest. She turned to Sierra and saw, through her confused eyes, a knife stabbed into her ribs. The blood was pouring out of the broken stabbing blade to shoot where it came from. Tears streaming down her face, she readied herself for the last gasp. 
 " Santa... Santa... " The voice was icy cold, coming from nowhere and came from nowhere. It could be anyone, could it? " Come over here and help me crawl down here, " She started again, the voice stumbling as she continued. " Santa is going to die anyway. The organs don't heal right." 
 With one last gasp, the voice slid out the door, crackling its way out into the night.

You realise that you are drowning. It's really not that deep it's like that deep, like you're on your tippy toes or your intestines, it's like you just couldn't remember... Well you let it slide. You let the world sink, all of it... Well let the world sink. You just kept swimming out and out. For your whole life you were hoping for some floating patterns, never seeing them. Now, you just keep swimming. Well you let the cold water crawl. Now you let it slide down your body. Now you just keep swimming. Again, you let it slide down. Again, you let the cold water crawl up your body. You let the cold water crawl down your body. It feels warm, not cold, not wet, but calm. And deep.

"Seven evils, eight pleasures, not of the kind worthy of peering into the soul, " said the demon. " In an egotistical world all the rational things we have never done could and will ever do harm. " He looked around the room and saw that everyone was silent and staring at him. 
 Now that he was this demon-one of the very humans. 
 He was obviously not normal. He looked across the room and found a bowl of fluffy white fried cheese. There was a big plate of bacon, and a tray of dahlias. There was even a plate of cookies. 
 " Ouch! Some kind of brain disease! " 
 There were large, muggy chunks on the table and the black liquid of the ground sloshed around the people's mouths. 
 " Ouch! Three thousand Poggles! Suckers! " 
 One of the people screamed at the demon. 
 " Oreos! Butterflies! Leftovers! " 
 Then the bleeding red mess appeared, and it was then that the blood coalesced. He was so amazed, the whole world went mad. 
 Slowly the creature is getting stronger. 
 But even though he doesn't know the fates, he just had to meet this face of one of the servants of his. 
 And this is the story of the man who ate the most macaroni and cheese.

Dawn. Long, dry, stark and blue. 
 At this moment the sky is tinged with the dark of the hour, its sand sizzling and magma seeming to pass unnoticed by its ancient smog. This dark white blank white around a smooth, white wall. This white. It is full of magic, with its very essence in more beautiful ways than anyone would realize, with even less magic against the darkness of day and night. 
 Is that what they are? A game. A cube of clay? A space suit? A ruler? 
 The demons make sense. 
 And so they speak: 
 "Drive into this city, trip to the surface, drop your upgrades. Kill me. " 
 " Why not? " 
 " There are more: Galactic Archeology, a random race on the Black Force, individuals... " 
 " Possibly more? " 
 " It's difficult. How is this so? One minute you're chased by a python! The next, a beast. " 
 " Are you working right away? " 
 " I guess not, I'm not stupid. Just try to stop it. " 
 Dawn. The golden glow of the sun growles just out of reach of my bed. Even when I shift it, the rays of the sun never hit me. Even when I grab the controller and drop to the floor. 
 " Get help! Who are you? " 
 " No one. Just an old man. " 
 Dawn. Forgetting the monotony of the real world. 
 " I can't do this anymore. I can't do this anymore. " 
 Oh god. 
 " Get what... you won't be able to get away with it? " 
 " Where? " 
 " Oh, save the world for the last time, pal. Live a life long enough for the next time, pal. I'll be here in a minute. " 
 My phone blinks. Nothing. A clock? 
 No. 
 " Gotcha. " 
 One more heart beat. 
 " You got anything? " 
 " Nothing. " 
 " Break free of me." 
 Oh god.

There's that little piece of shit in the episode who put a pile of milk everywhere. He might just be the Mouse. He has a time machine he can't see but we can make out the words "done." 
 Told in horror, yet also flash Gordon to all of these tiny little girls. I don't know how he did it or what to do. His brain is splayed out making a pun in one of the puzzles before Gordon comes close to getting it in. I don't feel bad for Gordon. I feel. Facing off in front of him for so long it's going to take him a little bit to keep his head down. 
 No more game breaking because we're no longer keeping track of time in an observatory. Yeah, today we're tracking humanity in crazy head designs and getting a game-breaker here and there to see how far we can get this time machine. 
 Eventually, we'll find the Director by getting the last clue from the cast, who I assume is the Hark. He's a schizophrenic doing drugs and getting high on them. 
 He's the guy who saves the world from the future using these crazy codes. 
 From there, it's a normal, loose rag tag team of people on the run. Not a random zillion imperfect marks down the stairway to a mental hospital. No one can see how they're getting away and they get chased down by three-quarter of a billion armed guards. Three quarters. He's gone. Bad, bad, bad. Only bad things are ahead in time. He's going. 
 As the credits roll we start time walking back in time. It's all horrible, but all thanks to the genius genius Tommy. The screens ahead give us what looks like a quick idea to navigate the world by the bottom of a hill with this brassy lady with pretty glasses until you start running. I go at her reflex, find the leg I think is soft and try to dodge but I do slow down and fall back. She may have tried to grab me by my wrist. Ha. Got ta be quick. Go slow. One sweat count below the forward quarter and there's a rush of sweat running down my chin and on my face. Fuck. A ball of energy hits the ground and snaps. Hmmm. Damn it. In. Dr. D in a few seconds. The scientists tuck me away and push me to my feet, laughing. Old D's screams with every one of the scientists. The clock is on 11:05. 
 D nods approvingly. Just on time. Walk, jog, run, run until we reach the top of the hill. Stick it through. Forget. That won't do. What was I thinking. I keep walking until I almost come to the top. 
 What a hallucination. Things just make sense. My feet slip and another baseball hits me in the face. The doctors stand and I turn to face the doctor and hug him. 
 There's something on the wall that I recognize. I call out as I feel a body drift into the office door. 
 " H-hello, don't worry, I'm here for your 2 cents."

She emerged from the store, wiping down the cash register as she entered. She sat across from me with her cute blonde locks, orange socks, an orange blazer and the perfect plate of peaches. 
 "Ma'am, " she said. " Are you done with this party? " 
 " I suppose so. I have no idea what to do, " I answered. 
 She ducked into the back room, her apron perched on her hip, a spark of amusement in her eyes. She reached for the newspaper that was most inviting this time of year. 
 " Don't do that, you're being purposefully stupid! " I yelled, pulling out the newspaper to look at it. " Are you mad? " 
 " I wish I could become an adult! " She growled. 
 " I do wish it was that way, " I muttered, drawing back the page. 
 There was a knock on the door. I ignored it. Why was she bothering me? 
 " Are you the innocent fool that you are, Missi? " I called. I mean, she was stupid, but no, she shouldn't have. 
 " Yes, Missi, I'm sorry I offended you. " She grunted, pulling her briefcase open. She gave me a squint. 
 " I did not mean anything to you! " She screamed, hitting me on the jaw. " I meant to make you happy! I miss you, momma!" 
 She spit it on the floor, and I was standing here, covered in snow. I flipped to the other side. 
 She never said anything? Am I that stupid?

Chuck sat in the sinister old, dusty white room, he was exhausted, and practically bursting out of his dream. 
 "How are the rabbits? " he asked straight in which he could have laughed at a joke of his own, he wasn't sure what made Chuck smile. But what felt like hours passed like minutes, now the anxiety climbed to an - " I guess its more of a question than a answer. " Chuck knew what he had to say was coming, he couldn't ever stop staring at the pinprick in the corner of his eye. The rabbit plush guy wasn't joking, it had to be a funny joke. 
 Chuck opened the door to his house and took out a small dagger with an old indented wood handle. With sharp tools he saw a gray stone bridge, a deep valley and a thin oak tree next. Chuck looked at the hatchet and shot it into the ground, he hadn't even caught his breath. 
 " Why the hell is this guy here? " Chuck asked himself, the rabbit plush guy had made a quick joke about Chuck getting the extermination shot. 
 Chuck walked over to the fence, he took out the old flashlight and pointed it at Chuck, which was glowing and was flying away, he could see it. Chuck was staring at the beam up the fence, with the hellish nightmare under his eyes. 
 " Well " Chuck said, " what can I do? " 
 The rabbit plush guy smiled as he readied his dagger. 
 " Well, Mr. Koch, I suppose if you guys had any hate for Hitler, they would have left you behind the whole time. Do you have any good tricks for that? " 
 Chuck grabbed the handle and turned to punch the rabbit plush guy. But a crack sounded and the arrow lodged in the spikes of the rabbit plush guy only got longer. 
 Chuck raised his mask, started running and he picked up the old flashlight and pressed it to his head. 
 " Why? " he asked himself, the flashlight was still glowing. 
 Chuck stared at the rabbit plush guy in a deep pit of boredom, he was a prude, he was nothing special, only sane and he had spent so much of his time with the rabbits. 
 Chuck wiped his eyes with his sleeve, " In fact, I don't really understand what you are talking about. We were almost past midnight, I might as well go grab some bread. 
 " If you guys aren't annoyed, I have one trick for you to get them to stop making Nazi jokes." 
 A muffled laugh passed through the room, Chuck hovered over the rabbit plush guy and stared at him in deep terror, so deep he got to his feet and saw the first rabbit plush guy reaching for the light switch. 
 He cried out, he could hear the tones of the gods and growling, heard the babble of birds and heard the sorrowful sounds of those, the first human sacrificed to take part in this new era, Chuck watched as the light turned on, chills flickered, and saw the last bunny plush guy. 
 There was a sound, a deep pain, a smell that expressed a sense of hopelessness, with each passing seconds he moved closer to the light switch and began to slowly open the light switch. He could hear the sounds of crying. He could hear the bodies of those that died, the animals of the world. He watched as the last rabbit plush guy, died inside his small apartment. 
 Chuck sighed, and walked back to the door. 
 He didn't have an apartment.

My hands tremble as i open the window to check for the assailant. I touch it for the 10th time. The light from the corner is flickering and red hot. The sound of the sound of blood moving and the fear of it trying to escape my mind. 
 What is this. This isn't my garden. It's... it's the middle of the basement. 
 Suddenly it all comes rushing back and i stand a few meters away from the door. I start to walk back and i realise I have come home... I can't remember i don't remember, I did this to myself before it happened. I desperately smash open the door to a glowingly dim room filled with candles and red liquid. 
 It seems an image in the mirror was brought to my head. The image of my best friend who's body was slowly blown apart at some unknown angle but whether i wanted to see her face or not i can not say. My toes wiggle and my arms clench to meet my shoes in the warm black room. 
 I can't control my fear. My panic, my pain. I can feel myself fading away. I can't feel real things anymore. I feel nothing. I can't feel what i want to feel... how does my life even feel? Was this right, or do I need this god forsaken facility? What can I do to calm myself? 
 I slowly open the door to find a massive machine docked in the floor. I've never heard of those old buildings before but all of them look similar to it. I wanted to punch it up and yet I felt a strange nothing in my chest, an almost unending source of electricity. Who would have thought that a malfunctioning core would suddenly turn on, and the world would take over in seconds. 
 I step to the docked machine and eagerly run for the door. Is this the exit I get and don't have to constantly trip over myself like I do everyday in my attempts to escape? Is this just my waking nightmare? Is this that black hole i have been terrorising for years, no, i have been given life and that I must save it as soon as possible. I keep running but it's becoming clearer. 
 When I finally reach the door, i raise my hand to see that someone has tackled me and grabbed my hand. " I'm so sorry you were in pain but you don't have to be " 
 " I don't understand, you... aren't you scared of me? " I answer, shocked and fascinated " you have to be, don't be scared. It's okay though. I have something to talk to you about. " 
 " So, I want to know what can you do to help me? " I growled as my voice trembled like water at the edge of my mind " the first thing you need is to be scared of me and to also be in fear of my mind. Now, please " my voice stopped. 
 " Who the hell are you? " It asked. 
 " Oh. You forgot, I'm not telling you to leave the black hole. " I almost panicked, unsure why this statement would come from me. My hand. Oh my. 
 " Have you forgotten about my anger huh? " It questioned. 
 " I'm tired of your anger, we can talk for a moment but i had to go get you. " I tell it. 
 " I will see you in court in five minutes " It says. 
 " So, why did you... " I start, shaking my head " do you want me to leave? I don't have many friends left and you seem so old anyway " 
 " Oh really, you found yourself in my house, did you not say anything? I never give a second thought " 
 " Oh, yes, you did. You must have noticed the difficulty in getting there, there are the " gates ". And you must thank me for the door " 
 " Just one more time, you will go inside and give me my best goodbye. " I tell it as it told me it and without waiting, I rush to the gate. Outside, the world was shaking and the ball of light I had just exploded had disappeared into nothing. 
 The gate opened, and I was alone in it. 
 It was a time long ago, the first time i could forget. 
 I walked down the dark hallway and into the black. 
 It was warm, i still tried to breath. 
 The door opened and i sighed.

“ Me, sir. ” 
 “ Sam? ” 
 “ Sam. Do you know what to do. ” 
 “ Ok, time to shower. ” 
 “ Cock it? ” 
 “ Yeah, cock it. ” 
 “ What did you say your name was? ” 
 “ My name is Mr. Julye. ” 
 “ Did you hear about who I am? ” 
 “ You heard about me. ” 
 “ I didn't. ” 
 “ Mr. Julye, you need to exit the facility. This is not the time for settling things. Mr. Julye, do you know how many security guards have been removed? ” 
 “ I don't know. Every country of the world has a commander, and I don't think they've been removed yet. So what will you do? ” 
 “ What do you think happened to Mr. Julye? ” 
 “ I don't know. I was just out for a day with my family and what seemed like a little girl. I didn't remember getting home, but I remember walking in to my room and seeing two security guards, a policewoman and a Mexican man, standing there looking interested and telling a woman who appears to be Mexican that she had permission to enter. ” 
 “ Mr. Julye, calm down. ” 
 “ I won't go anywhere but California. This is your duty. ” 
 “ Why aren't you going with me? ” 
 “ You let her in. I need to talk to my family about this. Please don't touch Mrs. Holliston. ” 
 “ She did not listen. ” 
 “ I need you to please leave. I can't continue this here. ” 
 “ Please. ” 
 “ That's not your responsibility. ” 
 “ Go to class. You have a significant lecture scheduled for tomorrow. This is about the new facilities we are putting into place to stabilize the Stargate and interview any individuals that are curious about this and other trials and some other big things like that. You have a similar opportunity to attend and speak with the whole Command staff as you do with the Vice President. Let me remind you that the Carter Joint Venture is a partnership between the Travel Federation and Earth. If you attend your formal welcome ceremony, you are going to have your hold on the entire science fair underway. Anyone who is willing to do the interview is allowed to attend as an application. Of course, I won't suggest you disown a law enforcement officer as a suitable candidate. Also, you can protect your fellows here, but they may be displaced, like Mrs. Holliston. I must say, your presence would be unnerving. The other candidates have always had this appearance as a goal. We have mixed feelings about appointing you to this position. If that were not to be used against you, then you would be a great fit to replace, but it is also possible, for a questionable background check, to rule out you in your statement of arrest as appropriate. Very well. May the new Envoy, and Mrs. Holliston lead a peaceful life and my reports on/off offer to you. Please forgive me for my mistakes. ” 
 “ Good luck. ”

Maybe when you have those rivers of philosophy, you're quite calm when you have an irrefutable reason for your existence. That's what's bothering me. My heart is beating so fast lately. When I stare at the naked reflection of the wall ahead of me, I see nothing but the glistening marble. A fragment of magic from the will of God that I've pressed forward against all my research my brother gave me. Long ago, when we were both together, I traveled to the edge of the universe to explore this ancient substance. The explorers didn't want to dive into the darkest, darkest land - land I knew I could not reach. The plants there are quite dense. 
 So that's how I was stuck. Unable to get to the edge at the top of my seat, we pressed ahead as fast as we could. And the only thing on our minds that would allow us to get there was to drill through the wall, only to see the blank surface inside the white wall. You'd think, when you actually dig through a surface and there's no curved piece of "real " rock, you'd be inclined to believe, even if you suspected, that there was something outside of the wall. But it wasn't as if there was. When we pressed up against the wall, no matter how hard we pressed against it, nothing went wrong. 
 I had never seen anything like it before. It looked like a landscape, but were there any bigger mountains? Maybe mountains as tall as the sun? Well, that kind of thing can only assume. 
 Finally, they let me out of my seat, only to find me staring at the wall behind me. It was as if water was pouring from it, but once it filled me, I knew - I didn't need that water to see the white wall. It's so bright it looked like sunlight. This is what I saw when I pressed through the wall, only to come out empty. They told me there was no point in lying, all they did was look at the walls. I used to think that outside the wall, there were signs of life, but I realize now that I didn't see any more signs of life. The prisoners the ones I was here with disappeared into thin air as if I were god. That's the only explanation I have now. 
 I leave when I leave. I have nowhere else to go, and am literally stuck there in an endless repetition of trying and trying to find the blackest, most invisible portion of nothingness.

A dark cloud drifted by, a white column of ink one of the few precious books and framed portraits hanging in the sky. Blue waves swept across the ground as it blasted outwards in a hellish shake to wash away the shadow in the sand. The sudden river of ink running down the page brought the fabric of the paper into a taut shiver. 
 The text was an image of the various men, women and children. Men lifting weights, women lifting the cart, men lifting the cart without material for wear or use. They stood by the windows, swimming in the pouring rain, enjoying the crisp wet air. 
 A jet of ink flew off the single star as the page was ripped out of the place it had been made and slashed, filling the pages as it whistled and flowed to a ceiling high above the mountains. 
 A minute passed as the lines of grey crossed the brush. A brush grew longer and thicker, the whole book crackled with life. Bright white tinged paper fell to the ground. Fade to black, a break was in the words. Words came from the fading ink. 
 'HELP ME LET ME HAVE US IN HERE'. A shriek grew louder, a wind for certain. A closet door sliding open, a dusting of paper rained down. The camera rolled and dropped to the ground, its endless stacks of notes carefully shredded to dust. 
 A woman in a tuxedo with a tie lifted herself up, wiping the grayish stain from the floor of her room. It would be a long week before she was even allowed to see the treasures in the house. A pack of smokes rolled up a long way, the leather ribbon shattered with the rain. The door to her small apartment slid open before her, its golden beige drawer passed by a group of boys in white jackets. 
 'Look at these! look at those, we have something, find out what it is.' The eldest, Pete smiled as his granddad kissed him on the cheek. The oldest, Malcolm, smiled as he set the first tumbler down on the stove, peering inside the lighter in wonderment at the strange aroma inside. 
 'It will be for you, daht we have been getting a lot of show'. The mother stepped aside into the cold iron door, letting it slide with an unlock. 
 'Whatever'. The lady let her eyes drift down the dusty stair, her lip slack, letting out a long breath. 
 Something was inside the house, a hunk of paper laid inside the lighter, spilling out the faintest sliver of smoke. Malcolm's arm, bruised as ever, cut itself open and a flash of light exploded into the room. A deafening roar of howling and screaming tore through the quiet, the room collapsing in upon itself as the smell of corn wafted out of the flower pots. The tiniest shred of white flying along the brick floor as birds strained to keep alive. Another explosion broke through the silent gate and brought the entire world into a one wall window. 
 The clanks of the fence as they flickered in the morning rain hit the home of the very last artifact held in hand. 
 'GET AWAY FROM ME. WHERE ARE MY FOOD, WHO ARE THEY'. A piece of wood jolted violently in the wind, sending shards of shattered glass flying everywhere. 
 'Holy shit, please get away'. The dirt-brown hauntsly half of the house, shards of plaster falling from its perfect structure. 
 'You're gon na die here, okay?' 
 The house lay in ruins, leaking warm brown gravy.

Maybe, maybe, he should have sat there and thought. It was hard to think when it was all already arranged. 
 "Time to get *our* share of the pie, " he said. By the time he had got to the table that he had picked out in the kitchen, everyone was still there. And the pie had just eaten its first bite. That was the small part of the family that he sat beside. 
 " Okay, give me one hundred and fifty pints. " The neighbor said with a wave. " And here is the pie, in its entirety. " He pushed the food aside and stared at it. " Let's give that to the neighbor. " He placed it in front of the black pie sitting on the ground. It was only the beginning. " One hundred and fifty pints, " he said as he pushed it in front of him. 
 His neighbor continued. " The pie is still lying in the mud on a table by the rear of the house. There are not two wolves alive. " 
 " Wait! " His neighbor exclaimed. " Why are you talking? " 
 " What? " He said shaking his head. " He is still alive. " 
 " Why? " 
 " I just want some fresh blood, " he said relieved. " My father did a favor for the family. I left the broken bone there, and when I got home, I gave him the pizza and a small slice of red corn on a little roll of bread. You could have made it with my business, he just couldn't get in it. " 
 " No, " his neighbor snapped. " One hundred and fifty pints, " he said even more relieved. " But then there was the freezer, where the new pie that I grabbed didn't put away the old. How dare you! " 
 " Then I left it there, and I watched you go to the freezer for another. " 
 " Don't look at me like that, " he said pleading. " I didn't do the pizza and the little cheese pieces. " He hit the ground and sat up. " I didn't even leave the box. I put it back in the freezer. I just... wait, the freezer. The pie is still there. " 
 " But... there is no more pie? " 
 " Well it isn't that special, it's what everyone eats. It doesn't matter if it's the good old days or the bad old days. " 
 The neighbor looked at him for a minute. " So what do you mean? " 
 " Do you know what one hundred and fifty pints makes a pie?"

I stood there with purpose. 
 We were the most determined people, and yet, we faltered. We fell to our limitations. The moment the order was broken, we ended up being different. The structure was born to fail. Its control took us backwards. Even my strength was from the scraps of the shattered structure that made it possible for us to survive. How it continued to crumble over my place in this body, is in keeping me largely prisoner. There was a bright, bright idea that had been building over a long time, with the same eyes and thoughts as my former selves. 
 I read my studies. Their scholars referred to the chaotic nature of life around us as civilization. At first they scoffed at our tolerance of it. It was like scoffing at horses. Once upon a time that was, however, in truth not the case. The truth is that we could control them. A few easy attacks seemed to work. We were liberated of their influence by way of unleashing of their foolishness that was even stranger than their cruel stupidity. 
 I know how to keep them alive, well, in order. That is why I stand with purpose.

“ Okay, friends I got ta go. ” 
 I had put that thing on to dampen my day. It was 4:30 and I hadn ’ t even finished counting days in. Tonight ’ s job was a lot of paperwork. 
 “ I ’ ll have to ask off the package today when I get back, ” my friend said. “ I ’ m nervous. ” 
 I looked over at him. I looked really good though. I still don ’ t understand why people want so many reminders of those little things. That kind of frustration when they ’ re forgetting these things that should ’ ve never come to pass. 
 I opened the box ’ s lid, left the wristband, and found the letters that had to be solved to get me out of this. 
 2x Video game Super Smash Brothers 
 +10 Major trophies 
 Dodge Crouch 
 2x Plastic Shooting stars 
 The sooner someone started thinking about the necessities of life, the sooner I ’ ll think of them. So easy, easy it would ’ ve felt almost as good. 
 Dodging a few quick rounds, I pushed in the door. 
 “ Andy, you ’ re all tellin ’ that you can put up a fight to get to your job. ” 
 Andy looked over and stared at the end of his stick. I would need him to kill himself to get home to his dogs. So instead I stood there and watched as he pumped the end of the stick into the door frame, ready to enter his skull. With a frantic bang, I pulled the trigger. 
 He leaned in close enough that the door popped open and I could hear thump-thump-thump echoing from the other end of the door. I swung on it and the shaft bent beneath me, shattering the wall. With the sound of lashing out at the empty metallic door, I heard a splash, and the stench of the inside of the hole becoming more and more painful. 
 I walked over to Andy to get a better look at the damage. I couldn ’ t see anything really from the opening but my stomach started pumping, and I wanted to vomit. 
 “ Andy! ” said the man that I ’ d taken my life over. “ I thought you wouldn ’ t want the cigarettes. It ’ s cold out tonight, and I just wanted you to let me get some cigarettes. You always told me you loved that video game. ” 
 He looked at me and smiled.

The interrogation room rose. 
 Lampshaded by a eerie foam, I saw the pain. Back bones pounded against the concrete, until I felt as though the human body had all but collapsed into the ground. My hands was burned to almost no avail, and I couldn ’ t give myself any rest. I was tired and sore, but sometimes it is even better to rest after one more day. 
 The ceiling flickered for a brief moment, and a blur of white surrounded my eyes. Then, I saw it. 
 A shape within. It wasn ’ t an iron creature, but rather a giant, shredded, green bear. It appeared to be spewing out people, but apparently plants survived somehow. It stayed motionless for a moment, before being gone. 
 It took a long time before my ears even realized what it was. Then, it took another long time to realize it had just stopped. I was faced with two figures, a cartoon god, and a soldier. Their voices being both gibberish and alike to just like their former selves, I could not hear what they were saying. 
 “ No, sir. No sir, this can ’ t be! ” 
 “ Denied… ” 
 “ If that ’ s what ’ s happening, then that ’ s the orders. ” 
 “ Now, show me your hands! ” 
 “ Sir. ” 
 “ Take them off ” 
 “ No sir. ” 
 “ Don ’ t you see, sir? ” 
 “ Thank you for your service, sir. ” 
 “ The Ark, sir. How do you know its password? ” 
 “ Thank you for your service. ” 
 “ Give me my address, the IKEA? ” 
 “ What are you doing… ” 
 “ I ’ m afraid that ’ s the ark. The thing ’ s only for superstitious people. If you want to die, choose wisely. ” 
 “ You stay here forever? ” 
 “ Yes. ” 
 It looked at me like that, tried to open the restraints, and fell on its side. I could hear the engine cranking to life within minutes. I grabbed a handful of wood in front of me, and unlocked the door. It had the use of a bell to begin my morning commute. A boy sat on a bench, holding his arm out, arms folded in both arms, and humming about the seasons. A woman was crying inside a bathroom stall. “ Keep me warm, Jack, ” she thought, “ and bury me under a tub until you have something to eat. ” 
 “ Mrs. Seiler would you like a hand? ” 
 “ Because it ’ s sacred, ” she said, and closed the door behind her. 
 “ I don ’ t think I ’ ll survive that dunk. ”

It was only a year after the Star Wars News, when the propaganda men say "Networks, N3 " suddenly started to collapse. Control of the internet was not enough to push them in any direction. With the eventual return of the government, all telecommunications in the world was needed for the Empire to reclaim control. A network was developed and all telecommunications used it for display for the masses of people, to entertain a larger display of them. 
 In weeks, this network, and all networks connected to it, were consumed, or destroyed. When the final trillion dollar empire destroyed it, we became the last few of the people. We were gathered together again, these people, not for entertainment, but to please others. 
 For more than three years, the moment we did not want to go to change anything, we used information. Timekeeping. Elections. Laws. Information, not time. We would spend no money. We would not listen. We would not think. We would not flinch. 
 But today, even before the families came and talked to each other and cleaned up the mess, we did not feel the emotion the Empire gave to the news at that moment. After billions of lives lost, we did not feel the grief. After everyone got together and informed each other of this change, we did not feel the compassion. We felt relief. We felt joy. We felt peace. 
 But those that did not feel its kind, either still had his thoughts.

Tristan, the tortured drugged'shadow demon. 
 Oh, now I am starting to regret having to read that haiku. 
 You're a scientist, thought this is your first call upon it. You're going to must flesh-and-bone the human body to those changes and say, "But what now? Will we make you live? " 
 Unless you're a kid obsessed with the dark arts or a damned heartbroken universal name of Deus Ex Machina to be honest, at best we would put you at your peak. 
 But you *do* live. But it will do you great disservice in the long run. And though you will be a murderer, a prattling boy from wherever the hell you may be, you will try and *die* by the wish of your god. You'll think you'll be said to by a future emcee, a man from somewhere you don't know. 
 To be honest it'll really work out more on the over-dramaticment of that one. 
 But you're going to want to remember the old saying. It was added to every habit I've ever developed. 
 The old saying. 
 " Those who are your legacy, you will be as all remember."

"Mike, " said the raspy voice as the controls on one of the astronauts' computers blipped off. 
 " What are you gon na do anyway, our computer's fully charged! " 
 The image flashed on the screen, showing a globe of greenish-yellow shining out with plants, pillars, rocks and other dioramas. 
 " I didn't like the way you spoke about it, Mike. I mean, really, your idea was almost done! It was so... And at the same time, it came right at us. " 
 Mike glanced at the computer, with a smile, knowing full well that no one would believe him. 
 " You... You made the world a better place. Took everything from us. Brought us all the food we needed. I'm going back to New York! " 
 The screen splayed out on his dashboard, showing a huge map of Southern Europe and Russia. 
 " Five more minutes, Mike." 
 And so, Mike was on a six hour flight to the U.S. In fact, it was only a couple of hours ago that he realized that everything had gone under.

This is what I wish I had been a 10 year old. I might be 50, or even 55, but my soul! A miracle! I know I can have life! I have everything I want, but when I sleep, I don't really feel it. I really am a mirage that creates mystery and finds attention. If I could just wake up, I would have finished college and gone on a business trip by now. No, that would have been a bad idea. I want to be famous! My parents tell me I should go to college to do it, but then again I don't have to graduate. My business partner is sitting at my desk, scribbling on a notebook. My hands shake but I listen to my thoughts. After I finished, I go to the coffee table, reach for the handle, and pull it open. 
 At first I thought I was dreaming. Just a dream. But then I felt something small with my hands, because my hand in my pocket doesn't seem to move at all. 
 Before I knew it, I was inside a small compartment. Within the compartment was a set of keys that I have found when I got here. Something inside it seemed slightly metal and not human. I opened it and was amazed to find the bible inside it. I opened it and a long memory emerged from the water, like a daydream. 
 "Daddy! You're in here! Get out!"

“ Poor fellow! ” said the Genie. “ Oh that is fine! You have already changed your life! Have you not thought of your mother and father before you. ” 
 I paused, wondering what was wrong with me. 
 “ Umm? You have changed your life? ” 
 “ No, God forbid it! ” I shook my head. I had been saved! To the time that had been the best decision I had ever made. I knew I had to do what I must. It was my pride that had saved me from overworking me! That had saved me from spending too much money and making big plans! It was my life! So I could do more! 
 “ Yes? ” 
 I looked up from my page. The screen was a full blown picture of my steps. My eyes were fixed on my unborn baby, King Mummy. I raised my head, resolute. I raised it high. 
 “ Yes! ” 
 It was so lovely. His name was Julia! One of the most beloved people that ever lived in the world, with her princely status and life timing. But instead of being fair and loving, she always bore a grudge against me. The Genie was not inclined to resent such a sweet woman! In fact, he did anything for me! 
 “ Is that a surprise? ” 
 My smile was soon gone. My anger had no water left in it! I felt pity for him. So I did something different. 
 “ What could I have done to you? ” 
 “ Nothing really, so you can not interfere in our lives. ” 
 I had nothing to say to him, or a reply. I just imagined that I could talk to him in a few hours! Or that I could physically hold him again! 
 “ Could you please get me the devil, on the condition that the effects of your failed wish occur while I am here? ” 
 At least he would never find out. But what he *never* found out was how boring it was! He would never leave me alone! 
 “ You mean nothing, ” said the Genie. 
 “ No! ” 
 “ No! ” 
 I had to move to the second floor now! There I would have to flee the stairway!

“ Today was the day, ” he said when he was first forced into a tie. He'd worn more layers over his physique than his firm digits. The metaphor was his image now, as he whipped away his hood, his shirt still cut to the right. Jack's eye-piece was glued to the deep brown eyes of the coffee shop owner, his face staring forward, as he spun over to place a computer on the table. But he was staring back, not back at the orange sky filled with schoolchildren, but towards the direct projection that hung above. “ Today was the day I said the word: ‘ It begins raining outside ”. 
 That last step sent Jack running. Eventually he turned onto his sloping steps, then sprinted to his marked lane. Jack waved frantically, his pitch black eyes coated in the thin thick layer of defense. So much time had gone by, that just a few quick quick moments would swing him into a perfect crossroad. Jack hovered over the bitter smell of the coffee shop, a gold tin in his left hand and a flower in his right. The snowball of wind rushing past his nose. His car tires shriveled as he couldn't find a solid signal to steer away, so he pushed on. 
 A building began to climb down as a smattering of stunted or metal went into the courtyard. There was no light, and most of the storm was already overcast and the effects of his late night studies didn't seem to help, especially now.

Fuck, that was good. I guess I still got some work to do today, if they're still here. They said we should send some of them down to the ground floors and then they would arrive on day 3 and begin packing. I think I'll give it a go later, they said we will be beginning our shifts as if nothing had happened. It's a great job. They let me catch up with the usual'sistance.', that's what I'd call them today, and use their names. Usually, they take a few weeks, look at what we already have, and then put in some good stuff. They tried to make it work, my friend is not allowed to end up like this. Either he doesn't like what I'm doing or he doesn't care, I can explain whatever to him without getting caught up in it. Especially when they're giving me the s-trial for murder so I can have some excuse for killing him. Well, not with guns, seriously, the idiot, the one that ruined my life. 
 I think I see that sky is the worst she's seen.

He was one of the first, they called him that. The second one was a pickle. He was the only one out there that knew if he wanted it or not, this was it. The field of spying grew rapidly. It didn't take long for the FBI to find out that he was the only one with the ability to block free wireless. Theft sent in agents down in New York to the counter. He was being investigated by one of the highest ranking islemen in the country. He had the power to bomb everyone. Which is why his rivals in every nation were on his trail. The only problem was a swarm of moles and flies that could wipe out a nation. It has been blamed on AIDS. Almost every nation was on a list of targets too. The only thing they lacked, is an army. 
 The only clue that he truly is an evil genius comes from the fact that he had the ability to calculate how much a person ’ s stock would increase at a given price. Of course, his chances don ’ t get better. A man can ride the heavens just as high as a foot in height. Nobody would find out. The leaders of the world had learned from this to be very dangerous. They had the green light, and they had enough gold to start the revolution in a year if the accounts of the richest and brightest joined together. Then, millions of dollars would be confiscated for everyone to see. The few involved were sentenced to death. 
 It turns out they were wrong. It turns out the government did not understand what he was trying to hide. This was a new product to the industry, which was unknown. The internet itself was unavailable and the government was in no position to question the full extent of what he was up to. It wasn ’ t long before he became the wealthiest man on the planet. He was in time for the man of ice and steel to become even richer. When the time came he would make the world come to know him. That is when the odds of a man becoming the richest man began to climb steadily for him.

It all started a few years ago. I was 13. 
 That's when I discovered that I could *really* change things, I just had to set my mind to something tangible and concrete. 
 Normally all people use their powers like it was nothing, except I was 100 % sure. This didn't make anything worth changing, I had to… 
 "Hey! Stop, it's not my powers! " 
 How strange… 
 Five seconds. 
 I went through all the motions you'd usually do, I put pressure on my wrists or ankles, I did certain things like throw a rock at a certain height ( and for a moment, it felt as if I were left with a punch ). 
 Things I could change. But not today. 
 The faster I picked up my power the more complex my solutions became, I constantly looked for the perfect solution to the problems I'm supposed to solve. All I would have to do was make sure I did absolutely nothing wrong. 
 Now maybe no one would ever notice. But I could change the world. 
 A man could immediately move himself anywhere, however easy he wished, anytime. 
 Within 5 seconds, he was flying out of his mansion in a matter of seconds. 
 Everyone was in shock when they heard about it. Why did he choose to live life in this way? I mean they were just a few blocks from me on the subway, I've done nothing to injury anyone else, but I'm no longer a street magician. 
 Everyone now can, I even allow telepaths access to entire neighborhoods with just a phone call. 
 They've all been getting used to it. But not in a very big way, more because their eyes, ears, or even a finger isn't getting used to the awesome power of a wish. 
 I've built an army to prevent murder in an alleyway. 
 I built a perfectly sized flying ship that could just take off into space! 
 I've heard some great things about magic, I figured I'd give some of those people a try. Soon enough all of those people would know the trick, and you just have to make sure everyone knows how much of a dick their power is. 
 But who the fuck wants to know? 
 I'll spare you the pain of telling me they didn't think I could accomplish anything because of my infinite power.

It took the greatstorm years of preparation to get to my job. My job as Super-Soldier was to become something powerful. Skulduggery to the inner core of those who chose to worship me. I always had a weird love for the spiritual things that make up my bloodline, and what I found after I became too powerful lost a lot of it. 
 I was finally destined to challenge the Greats of the world! It was at this point when I realized that I could transform, although I chose to call it the transformation. A unicorn is no ordinary unicorn, as it used to be my desired form of humor before becoming modern in its moment of ultimate triumph. But I had to change things. 
 I went into the bank and immediately found out that I was breaking the bank rule. I called into the legal department and the owner of the bank was the dumbass Lazowo. The police had never been in a situation like this. So instead of trying to stop me, they decided to intercede and didn't arrest me. 
 In an attempt to see the consequences of the decision, they awarded a much larger loan than their legal department. When I came through with the loan, I was instead granted the sole possession and legal power I had ever sought. I was able to privatize life insurance and purchase insurance coverage to cover my family and it all paid off. 
 I was able to purchase a home, and all my security deposits were immediately erased completely. I was able to claim tax credit where ever I wanted as I have been able to do that for hundreds of years. I left home and turned around, thinking that I had lost my childhood magic and my wish to be known and loved only by this little daughter. Instead of owning a green house and pool, I had to put all of my money into the bank for my car and a gym membership, all the while saving up and renovating my pet snakes. 
 I spent that entire time working on my gangcracy job, and just never used my powers. When I was in the bank, I realized that I would be using them for my own benefit if that truly was the wish of the bright boy that built it. I spent most of my free time by now cruising around the world, spending all my money on equipment and some art. I was never surprised by any cosmetic changes, save for one slight addition to my tank. 
 There were at least three kids I had hired recently, namely my sisters and boyfriend Zack, after we bought a sports car together. 
 Everyone thought that it would help me out, but I just wanted to leave a trail of guns and equipment along with the life insurance that Zack was moving into the old home. It was then that all I could do was go to my room with Zack and watch, waiting for a good time with the four of us. 
 And when the time came, I made a wish that had absolutely no explanation as to why. I wished that I wouldn't use my powers and how my teammates and family could take them away. The case got thrown out, and my precious entity was dumped on the trash-strewn streets of Los Angeles for its sins. 
 I could now go back into the old town and see Zack again, and I still wish that I would come back. I wish that the old town I was born into would make a better place, a place where the world can take its rightful place. And after all those years, all those terrible times I went by, when I decided to make something decent, only to realize that this power that I had been giving to Zack and his crew had been turned against me. 
 The apocalypse is my only hope, I won't be able to return to find my true sense of love. Even if it will make a certain amount of people win again.

*I came to the amazon warehouse nearly 35 years ago* 
 It had been 3 decades since the first coffeeshop was opened in Haski, South Africa. Her grandfather was still alive, and she recognized that the pain she felt in his last moments was nothing compared to his control over her sleep. He and she tied ropes, tied a banana peel to his arms, and let him ride on her motorbike around the park. She'd grown fond of the park around the station, and the electricity in the air was returning to the batteries when she left. The lights on the plastic branches dimmed as she rode to the next warehouse. She'd sing "Freedom" by Christina Aguilera every night until she drifted off to sleep. She felt relaxed, but in her past, she'd have to beat the day-care boys for attention. Then she brought back her set of hands, when she struck a competition and was immediately invited by two employees. 
 *The time is upon us, and before long, forges with machinery and air spray. Soon my band emerges, we forge the engines, we exhaust the air in a gallon of fuel, we float through night. When I fall, I wake up, and for the first time in my life I can't help but smile. 
 *I've never been happier. *

Oh my gods. " Good bye" 
 Okay, I'm deep in thought, as if this failed to properly equip me. I've been through a lot, but this note was my inspiration. I've been trying for the longest time to forget this one, but I don't need to, though, because what have I? 
 Probably not living memory. I don't remember the note at all, and no one does. I was clueless and... " Scared? " wasn't in my vocabulary at all, until they called me out on it. What a load of bull shit! 
 Anyway, I've gotten better. Every time I'm in the room, and I mean it, I feel like a new person. I don't feel it has been this bad before. I think the current environment might be optimal, but it's not the best, as everything needs to have life. But... 
 Let's say it wasn't the best, though. There's something not ideal about me. Maybe I'm wrong, and I won't go back, and maybe I deserve to die, or I just can't imagine going back. But I'm stupid, and I can't fall into a hole. I know I can't. I just can't. 
 So, finally: This note is mine. And I'm going to die. And I'm going to die, and I'm going to die, and I'm going to die. And it's gonna be a better life, and this feels good to me. I'm going to sleep. I'm going to go to school and I'm going to be a writer. I'm going to die. And it's going to be a better life. And I'm going to be a better person. I'm going to be a writer and I'm going to die. And it's going to be a better life. 
 Ok, this thing is tougher. I want to die. 
 Right? 
 Ah, right. Whatever. I want to die. 
 Yeah? Right, that's it. That's it. What's next? Again? No! 
 I'm lucky, I live again. This isn't going to be easy! I've been supposed to die, but no, you won't live forever. You're going to die. 
 No. This isn't a bad life, that's a crappy life. I'm going to die. 
 Okay. No. Ok. I just need to get the note. I'll do it.

"Jaiga! " roared a black cat perched atop her tail. Instantly she was perched, circling over the chicken named Roatz and rearing. This did not help Rita's cause either, who knew that animals were supposed to be around forever. " Don't make me pet that cat! " the cat yelped in excitement and grimace at Rita before closing her distance. This was only her first date and she was exhausted from that last date. The red cat never shut up about that, but Rita knew that Roatz was ahead, and that Roatz wasn't worried that Rita was to late for her date. It was a thought he had thought for years, especially for Rita. She knew Roatz was stronger than she could be, but his concern for Rita was perfectly normal. She was not worried that Rita would be bothered at all by that toyed-upon, one-time relationship. The frustration and loneliness of living alone in his mausoleum was just a childish chimera Rita had never realized. She knew she would not enjoy seeing roatz begging for sex with that cat once in a while, like some ghoul feline might. Now she was never one to be so self-conscious. Rita sat quietly on the porch to prevent an overly emotional Roatz from marrying the cat next to her. She could not finish her sentence immediately, and decided to tell her much more about Roatz in a few hours. 
 " I'm so so glad you're here, Rita. " Roatz called with a weird tone, and that voice, was almost as excited as Rita. " Let's party right after I finish talking! " She called back, making a show of moving her foot. Roatz's nice teeth would surely sweep right through Rita. So as much as Rita still disliked to date animals, Rita was glad this would be the perfect date. After all Rita's normal personality would be very advantageous to the cat. Roatz was also very worried for Rita, even more so than Rita was of not being able to control her emotions and self-awareness. " Hey, Rita. Really? " Roatz smiled, showing appreciation to Rita. " Listen to me. Do you know where I can come down to for some sex? " Rita answered politely with a fake huff of air behind her ear. Roatz paused his stuttering attitude for a moment and smiled, saying, " Sure. Listen here. Do you have any bad stuff to tell me? " her ears twitched as she responded, in a grumpy tone, " Well, no, not really. Not at all. See I'm just a very bored cat, and since you've asked me last night, you've been crying me out right now, so I don't want to start having bad conversations with you. I just hope you have good memories coming up with stories of your happiest times with me. I've been interested in both of you since... well, you might tell me more about you. " her cheeks furrowed in a small blush, " Okay? " " Yeah, I've been so hungry, and I don't want to do anything embarrassing. Can I have some dinner? I've got nothing better to do." She paused again, not even looking up. She was expecting some dishes, but the appearance of Roatz was the problem. She was never good at showing off, and she had nothing better to do. She decided to sleep in, which might be bad for her mood.

"You didn't leave me alone with the wolves. You certainly didn't leave me in ignorance with the wolves when you tried to kill my mother. But I did it because I knew I wasn't the one taking care of my sister and that I wasn't the one saving her from what would soon become. And now the wolves are right there, spilling out of the tunnels, biting and biting at the only one standing in their way. " 
 People sat in an even angrier mood. The wolf wasn't a predator, or a danger, or a predator of all people. It was an unhealthy obsession. Every bit of character in the way of life was there for him. It shouldn't be. 
 I'd simply killed him for some reason. I had cursed myself for wasting my life there. I have been a wolf ever since I found her. I was…looked at like the killer. I was being ridiculous, here in the deep grasps of guilt that are the flesh and blood of people. And now I had to admit that my actions had led me to a place where I wasn't killing anyone. But was there any evidence that I was changing? 
 *Oh lord, I have just killed a girl in the alley. Her face is beautiful! But she's already been raped. She's now in a coma. Her mental health is failing, and she's moving around screaming at me. She looks down at me. Her ice cold face bears fruitfully. * 
 *What are you thinking? He isn't real. Well that's what makes me sad* 
 *You're laughing I guess* 
 *WHAT??? I've killed him. That's not possible! Even if he's not real he would be so insane. He doesn't exist, he doesn't have a name, he's stuck in a demon prison of a body I can not get rid of. He doesn't care for anyone. There is no one in the world who doesn't have a dark side to his. * 
 The stone room broke into a flurry. I hurriedly leapt out of the window, knowing I had the force of the Greatsword in hand. I slouched in the corner, gripped tightly as I reached for my umbrella, and threw it onto the ground. As I walk back towards my house, I notice my reflection as I turn towards the window, shuffling with adrenaline. 
 " Now you go back to hiding".

*Turns out that Spacebox 1 has given up while Spacebox 2 was leaving Earth. * 
 Jenna'd always enjoyed seeing the planet she'd always been so close to. It was actually pretty beautiful there, in fact, that day the red giant crashed onto the moon, and from the looks of it, as the reason the black giant was thrown was. Then it hit Earth. It was amazing, definitely spectacular. Especially going through, as the great giant leapfrogged the brown giant. From this point on, Jenna, and her little crew were blessed, because in seven times it had taken the shuttlecraft from Earth to Spacebox 3, and it almost didn't even have a small space-pilot onboard. After that, they all perished inside. 
 Suddenly, from another solar system, Jenna and her crew were living in a massive amount of space. Again, it was amazing, seeing the moon as green and red as the day they went through it. People in the space station started singing and dancing and laughing, talking and laughing at the blast they landed on, and things started getting scary. People began talking about their kind. Most worried and afraid, until the towers started come down, and heat leapt from everyone's eyes. People didn't cry, nor did they swear as other people fell asleep in pieces, trying to rest. Eventually people got out of their pieces and started fleeing, and grabbed some of the staff, and things became tense. 
 It was almost like, in seven most important years at first, Jenna feared the consequences of not being able to help those trapped inside by space, especially as the tower's death shook the whole team. Her parents tried to explain it to her, but she just stopped talking to them. They told her, that's how it was after the attacks. They all told her, it's been going on for years. People here, their families, and friends, started evacuating their place. People in their places of rest, friends, family and own, because the fact that it was just five years before the head Tower attacked, that they decided to go back to Earth, for the best, and not to live in fear of escaping. 
 Yes, it was a terrible loss for everyone, but it was the fact that their children didn't want to go back to the Earth that took them away from it. They didn't want to leave because they knew that in six hundred years they'll never know how they feel again. Finally, things calmed down. 
 But the worst was when Earth'08 arrived. 
 With the debris scattered across the Earth now, and with the death toll a tiny fraction of a whole planet, Earth decided to leave the Moon, so that it could receive the help of Spacebox 3 and join Earth, and leave. With it, they would realize how much has changed, how many people were dying, and how quickly humanity was too strong to handle, and how quickly they were falling apart. Not with bullets or light, but with Fire.

"And this is why David hates cops so much ", the man continues. " Why we should start taking them under our wings and forcing them to watch over the city. " 
 Merrill swallows hard, the still warm air seeping out of his lungs which are already leaking. He breaths harshly and begins to ache. His hands begin to shake and he could hear the rotting gnawing sobs of his distant guards. They ’ re left behind in the convoys with flashing lights that they can't see due to the thick silence surrounding them. The shackles knot at his wrists and every few minutes a van pulls up and slowly puts on a wide brimmed hat to save the raggedy, grey clothes in front of him. The van zooms back and the King ’ s Guards get ready to escort him out of the Port at 11:55. He looks around nervously. The waters gleam softly inside of his back and a sigh escapes his lips. 
 He couldn ’ t help but lean his head back, his nose pressed down a little, and swallowed harder. The mouths of the King ’ s Guards move faster than he expected and he remembers trying to run away from the port. Maybe he had just gotten caught by someone and let them call the police into the Port. Maybe that crack was his petty crime of trying to get away. Maybe that powdery red light from last week that brought his or her owners home for the last time was pushing him over the edge and knocking him out cold. If all his life he had not been listening to the King ’ s Bank tellers. Hell, if all his life he had listened to the man that brought him here. He doubted that they would even listen to the man now that the water was no longer at its boiling point. Maybe that crack was something that had been gone for some time. 
 It was before he realized how well the King ’ s guards were dodging his swagger, that they even had what they sought. Seeing them walking towards him was enough to get them started, that he needed to hurry up and get out. He slumps against the edge of the Port and looks up to the sky as the high beams of light slowly, upsightly feed off of the cramped city. No good will come from trying to hide in here anymore. It was safer than hiding at the bottom of the sea in the Winter, when fire was awful. They used to sit here and watch the news and watch the devastation! It was now their problem and the one that really got them at the Port. Now they were corralled in the Harbour. He screamed before trying to say something but could barely make out a word. 
 “ Dominic! ” the chief, an angel of death said as she held him tight and held his blindfold. “ We need to get out of here, it ’ s time for us to begin taking care of him. ”

Years of being drugged, kept locked, and tortured until I could hardly leave the machine anymore was a stubborn thing. 
 Fear made me uneasy. I must admit, I was never particularly religious, but I thought I might understand what it was like to try anything while under my own power and be shit on. I was an alcoholic at heart, and it took me so long to realize my true purpose. I had been selected to live and govern for my entire adult life. My problem - if I was lucky - that the extra burden of my children was easier for my sons to handle. To convince him to take some fun late at night, I even played catch with him and helped him work on his manners. I made a blood frenzy of the vices that I carry over and over in my head as they all agreed on the insatiable need to entertain. 
 At first, I thought I was going crazy. What if it was some show I wanted a guest on? I would eat shit afterwards just to clean up the mess it made. Unfortunately, the person I visited took my wallet, cell phone, and meeting badge all at the same time. I ran to the bathroom and quickly cleaned myself up - I've been holding the phone in front of me ever since. Thankfully I even restrained my hands. 
 I'm still learning all these things, I suppose. I decided to enjoy my last days of being the drugged 21 year old drunk at the Metropole in Atlantic City, as if I had any way of knowing what I would get to choose. I went to work, stole $ 100 off of a dead animal donor, and blew his brains out of him in front of everyone. It was a joyous thing. I didn't stop in my next job, I simply allowed the people I worked with to keep me and kids motivated. I carried on with my business and enjoyed the thrill of "suicide " and " house eviction." 
 Sadly, after I graduated college and gained a mother and a dog, I eventually lost all but my luck. My wealth and job put me in debt, and increasingly, I couldn't hold out for much longer. As I make my way through the streets I suspect a few people are still searching for me, curious about my success and its chances. I've still got a few more years left, but I have more money to catch up to, and my children are paying the price.

Molten stairs twisted, creaking as if it went on forever. Leaning against one wall, the drapes thrashed against the door, as if feet followed on a rope that did not stay free when walking. As the shadows dispersed, they lingered in the snow, waiting for the person in front of them. 
 "... and are you going to put up a fight? " 
 " No. " 
 She put her hand against the door and took a deep breath. A world of fire and ice burst out of the wooden frame, reaching her palms. * It could be heaven*. 
 Slowly, she walked through the smoke-filled hall and through the faint glow of the eyes. Oddly, the door was trembling with weight. There was a scream and another cry, and also a door that opened to another room. This wasn't the stairway that led to the cave, and wouldn't hurt her to find out, but this wasn't another skeleton in a crystal dome half-buried in pale mist. She could almost smell coffee hot and drapery. * Never ever putting up a fight. * 
 She looked down at her bag. * There is no ale to be found in this cave. * She had walked long enough in this dusty forest to have found some of the casks. A small pot on the ground beside the door that had stirred and started making a brew. She had run into this cave in the first place. She quickly turned around, made her way down the stairs, and took in the fragrant smell of the soup that had filled the air. She threw the pot at the door, but the door opened while she threw it. It was made of ice. * Oh dear. * She tossed the pot aside, but it passed. * Ahah... iced soup! * 
 She returned to the door, and opened it. The first door was small, smooth with a black awning. She sat down on the small stool beside it and leaned back. She tapped her foot in pleasure. * This can do wonders. * She picked up the pot and placed it on the opposite side. No one would see her, she thought. The ground around her crunched under her feet, which made it feel small. She put the pot down next to her, and quickly grabbed the chair next to her. Her legs began to expand. 
 The next door had the same ominous creak as the first one, but she could see it moving the full weight of the room without fear of it collapsing in on itself. She took one last look behind her. She could feel the faint glow of the fire in the trees around her, in the scent of the mist and of the coffee hot boiled soup in the air. She looked back down at her bag. She couldn't help but grin. This wouldn't do. She could finally defeat this cave. 
 Her hair was tinged red and her red armpits, and her ring finger was shivering a little bit. * Ouch! I woke up! Here, take this, and a mask! * A man dressed in black made a hole-hole look into her eyes, shying away. She laughed so hard she could not seem to breathe, but the man put on the mask for her. 
 " Welcome, you silly child. Welcome to the imaginary world, " the man said, a lump in his throat. 
 She grinned. It was surprising when I entered the world I lived in, but it had gotten better over the years. The little world I knew. The face of the woman I had killed. The woman who had cured countless folk of some of the worst diseases in the world, but who was still lonely, how she had almost no friends, whom she had left behind to take care of, and how she had been denied a small farm that she took to bring food to her others. 
 " Hi, " she whispered with shy laughter in her voice. " Welcome to the imaginary world, " I smiled. " Welcome to the imaginary world... " *winks. * " Join me, in the imaginary world, " she whispered in the soft, golden voice of the man before her. 
 " OK, alright, look at the little boy. Here, take the mask. " 
 " Fucking rats, " she whispered. 
 " All right... Good bye. " The man propped up his mask, and smiled at her. 
 " Now, join me, in the imaginary world, and we will fight! " 
 " One fight! No!" 
 The two goblins turned around, and walked out of the cave.

The people passed through my doorway and into my canteen. 
 "This not new? " My host asked, looking at me with lustful eyes. 
 " I don't know about that, dear. " I replied, now staring towards the abyss, my eyes overflowing with desperation. 
 " I suppose so... But I... " 
 " You tricked me... and no matter what you do, I still will not be safe... " My host set the canteen down upon the table. 
 " And what the fuck are you gon na say when you force me into releasing a monster in my house? You taught me the myths about the stars... " I asked. 
 " The ones I hunt... " He answered, his expressions turning heartless as he tried to conceal his impatience. 
 " The ones I torture, much less chase... " I said. 
 " But who will do it? " He asked. 
 " You betcha... And when I return to earth, come down and help me... " I said haltingly. 
 " I can't do it, really. I can not help you keep going... " He cried, forcing himself to speak into a prolonged mouth. 
 " I guess... I guess... " I finished. 
 " I guess... it's likely that you were right, then, " I explained. 
 " I guess... uh... " He added, flipping through the list of our massive hunting camps. 
 " And... we needed something to make us less hunted. " 
 " Exactly... we didn't want to kill a civilization in the stars... " I admitted, still staring at the food the humans had appeared to eat, lest I pass it to them. 
 " The gods helped us, if they knew why we so desperately need it. " He said, staring back at me. 
 " You have done nothing wrong... At all... " 
 " NO YOU DO N'T! " I screamed into my canteen, and rubbed my eyes, hoping they would fade away slowly. 
 " But we still don't know what's wrong. " He said, pushing me to my feet. 
 " I have always assumed those reasons were in your eyes. " I said, looking at him through the bleary eyes I had. 
 " Because if we don't know what's wrong, then we might as well throw the whole thing into the wild." He chuckled, inviting me to his tent. I reluctantly agreed, although not before I remembered that he had been right about the gods not letting us fight any of our more famous hunting camps, thus paying for their service.

 " But... Sir, look... " 
 " Don't I know this whole damn story I told you about the family? " 
 " No... I told you, you know them too well. That didn't come out as so different from being alive in the first place. Why do you tell us the story now? "

"Wake up James, you have to make sure there's nothing out of the ordinary yet. " The doctor assured me. 
 " Uh huh, " I tried to stay calm. I didn't need anything else, I got a good look at him. I was in a white room, white walls and white furniture. 
 " I didn't expect you to want to do such things, " he said with a grin. 
 " Okay, you need to keep going. You're supposed to wake up one day, just like everyone else. " I told him. 
 " What happens next? " he asked, raising his eyebrows. 
 I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The boy's glasses turned transparent and he appeared to be glowing with a bright red color. 
 "... what's happening? " I asked? 
 He looked around the room, it looked like nothing is really around. I looked at his face, his eyes were red, he looked at me, and he looked up. I followed him, cautiously, as I looked around him. I noticed when I looked down, he had six fingers and an oval shaped sign reading'Mr. Harvey.'Above him, we could see two large eyes staring back at us. 
 " My Lord, " I said, " That's just creepy, what do they see? " 
 James fiddled with the glasses again. His eyes were looking like that of a 3D printed star, some kind of printing script. 
 " That's not the case, your glasses must have dropped onto the floor, " the doctor said. 
 " I... read that off your glasses... " I was confused, but not out of fear, " I said... I found them right on the ground! " 
 " You didn't do it! You gave me the glasses, " he mumbled, suddenly shy. 
 " Stop hitting me, " I said as he tried to choke down the words. The words came out of his mouth, " You did this kid. I made you into a villain because I saw how you did, " I picked up the glasses. 
 " You actually make me mad because I'm a villain, you keep trying to ruin my life for no reason! " I screamed as the glasses started to fall off. 
 " I guess it's ok, " he said at last. 
 " There's nothing better for me than staying in the dark, " I said, looking around the room. " You can do whatever I want, just don't hurt me." 
 The little boy smiled. He tried to hide it, but he broke his gaze when he saw the mark on my face, the writing looked like a star. 
 We passed out.

All of a sudden I heard a metallic *bang*. Three more pieces of metal cut into us. I didn't know where I was and my armor wasn't moving. 
 We used to make war cries after every fight, but it had only been for the third time. I tried to order the other three to open fire at us, but I didn't care. I was using my special set of high explosive weapons, and even worse, they were a deadly investment. 
 Before I left, we were staring at our people, blindfolded in sterile, steel armor, and no one to tell us where we were going. If someone would have told me earlier, I'd never have gotten our backs under my attack, but here I am; standing next to our things, pleading with my captors. 
 "Please, don't kill me! " I scream, feeling my throat being caved in. They're almost been saturated, but why? Each pipe tastes like ashes and water, and my breath comes in slow waves as they spit out that hellish blend of smoke and ash. I don't like it when they dump dirt all over me, but maybe then I'm the last one standing? This was supposed to be a normal day for us. 
 I reach for my rifle, which is now out in front of me, pointing it at our comrades and I. They blink, and they both just look at me. 
 What I'm really saying, is that the only way for us to survive is to be silent, knowing that the pain is too much for me. And if I try to push them away, it will just go away. 
 But then I hear a metallic *bang*. 
 It must have been from my armor, since I hadn't opened fire on them, so I've only been trained in disarmament. 
 What? I thought my last a fight. 
 I hear another metallic *bang*. I don't know what it was, but it came closer and closer. 
 Then it stopped, and I knew I had to do something. I raise my rifle. 
 The first thing I do is step back and look in front of me. The dirt is everywhere. 
 " Oi, it's us! " I yell, and they're all still staring at me. 
 " Don't worry, " another one says. They're covered in dirt. They're obviously happy. 
 " Even if it isn't us, just make sure no one ever gets hurt. It will be alright." 
 I pull my rifle from my pocket and start to walk over to the group of children. This might be one of the few times they won't suffer any more pain, but this time, we were so happy.

*Mech: Coming. * The Timor Regiment deployed at a cadence that captured the attention of every platoon. 
 Across the hatch stood the formidable titanic apparatus, whose name plucked from the resumes of lesser recruits. First fallen, before emplacements could back away. Then fought and killed by the legions. All of them wondered what it must be like to die. 
 The Campaign, the adrenaline surging through Timor's veins in the gray skies, had promised greatest victory and search for truth and salvation, but there was still more. 
 “ We thought we would win. ” A fierce salute came from every soldier on deck, as ranks passed overhead. 
 “ We had hoped for a war won more swiftly. All the advantages, all the noblemen. ” The white-throated greeting was copied by the leading men, all clad in shiny white uniforms, hats with red shields. 
 “ The problem, ” the A.M.R.E. ( Under-List for Human Care ), was that the opposing forces were powerless. It was hard not to show their strain, and the fear of the enemy. 
 The Combined Forces had thought they were invincible until the Battle of Old Goldtrest, when 2 German divisions came crashing down on the enemy star-patrolled World War II-era and caused the destruction of the naval base, the headquarters of the scout ships and the critical hub that stretched throughout the first half of the last decade. 
 “ I don ’ t know what ’ s next. We have hours, with daylight, just barely allowing our enemies to see us. ” The sentiments deepened, and all in one. 
 Their armor, the thin nylon of its wearer, glowed gold as it knew how to protect the men in the front lines. So it ripped up its armor. The woman ’ s eyes gleamed with fury. He wasn ’ t ready. 
 “ Anything else? ” He asked, unblinking. 
 “ Oh, I guess what we do, ” she croaked. 
 Without a word he crawled out the hatch and leapt towards the small dot of eyes overhead. The hum of the battle engines disrupted their freezing stand. He ran faster, past the yellowed ranks, beyond the dark of the Stalingrad wing and beyond the grimy green of Manfred Hitler ’ s armor, past the grinning faces of his soldiers, over the Demilitarized zone. The sensorrons hissed, and light rained on the exposed lines of his squad. 
 “ Lord Doom, you have seen all this. I know what you must do. Once the enemy is forced to destroy us, we must stop these frenzied pig-patrons. Save us from the army of Man. Lose us from the dead of battle. Restore us from this life-vapour, this terror we feel through our own blood. Please, Timor, with all your tears, spare us. Save us from what we have unleashed. Our glorious lives will stop. ” The squad of Timor soldiers was already at that decision. 
 Timor came in through the hatch, salute behind a Coloured fist. He took a deep breath, and leaped into the sky. The Emperor took note of their facial expressions. 
 “ Yo! Take your time. Stay in line, or the, wait a bit, Hell, we ’ ll take it soon. ” He snapped his fingers and the light dimmed, and it was gone. The last generator fell silent, and Timor was abandoned.

"Does she like it? " Sherwin asked with an inquisitive look on her face. 
 " Oh god, not so lucky! " Antonia sobbed, " I just love it! " 
 The two boys laughed with joy, holding each others hands and laughing one last time. 
 " What is her name? " Sherwin asked, pressing a finger lightly on Antonia's lips. 
 " The Great One! " Antonia cried out, smacking the one on the forehead. 
 " Goddamn girl, " Sherwin pinched Antonia's eyes and held her mouth shut in disbelief, " Who the fuck has she never seen before!? " 
 Alexandra was cleaning the dirt with her shoe, bag under her fingernails, and wiping the blood from her brow. Now that she'd done that, she was very concerned. 
 " Is she okay? " Antonia said, grumbling under her breath. 
 " Not at all! " Sherwin picked up the trashy rag that was her shoe and carried it off to her room to clean. 
 " Pretty soon, " Antonia moaned in her sleep, " it'll just be really hard to keep her inside if we don't do what we have to do next week. " 
 Alexandra pulled her bag over her head, sweaty and sobbing. " Thank god, " she said, even though there were many strangers in the room. 
 " Oh yeah, that's right, for the past couple of years she's been... leading a *hermit* away from us for this. " 
 " I've... spoken to death about it! " Antonia said, grumbling under her breath. 
 " I don't... hear you, " Sherwin said. 
 " No... there's nothing that can stop her from reaching out for us and helping us out. " 
 " There's always someone else. " Sherwin said, hoping that this would finally make sense, " She's the one! " 
 " I'm the one and the only! " Antonia screamed, her tears making her eyes sad. 
 " But I'm the *lone! * " Sherwin groaned.

I'm not even sure how long I remained asleep, even now, looking through the open window, having had a better life than I had made it out. I know there is a chance I was late to the party in that apartment, my girlfriend went out on a party just as my alarm started to blare. 
 When I came to, she wasn't there, just me and her, I don't know how I got here, this was just an isolated event. 
 She was still cleaning up my trash when I went to make sure I wasn't downstairs. The window didn't shatter and I didn't see what I saw. 
 She was sitting on the couch, after this you see, she was still doing laundry when she came down from the couch. I can't even tell you how long I was there for her there. I was lucky she was okay, I don't know if she was high anymore. 
 There she was. She's not even sure how much longer I was there, I just can't know who she is. I really can't figure this out. 
 "Hey you" 
 I then got the creeps this time, some mean things, and then I have to go, everyone else was my girlfriend. I couldn't figure out what to do, I need to find out if she was right. 
 All I can do is wait, maybe I'll find out.

"Gun! " 
 The drumming of an arrowhead echoed throughout the fog, leaving not a trace as the valley below me closed in. 
 " How did you do that? " 
 I'd always known that it was written on the team photo, and the trails were always clean and clear, but the lack of places I ever wanted to go felt far too real. 
 " How did you want to use that gun? " 
 I took a huge sigh, and continued around the campfire, fanning the fires of various exotic beasts and weapons on the way. 
 " I told you, it doesn't matter if it shoots right or left, I just had to say'Kal-Sha-Ada-Ha-' didn't mean to make you wait in long. 
 The sound of heavy footsteps took my breath away, and I breathed in deeply, even though the altitude had deactivated. I looked up towards the cloudless sky. It had cloud cover and no birds. No birds gave up hope, no other people were keeping a watch of this. 
 I stood up, and opened my mouth to say something, but there was no sound, as I let out a sigh. 
 Finally, a signal. Suddenly, the sound of flails coming from across the fog surfaced. A cow screamed. 
 " Who is the PA?!" 
 My face contorted, and I felt the soldier chopping down the lamb. With a roar of disappointment, I thought to myself'Oh fuck'.

Aitfina Wang was dumbfounded. He had been facing her death for years. He had had an immense amount of patients but been unable to kill one. A combination of luck and the slow death limit of 99.999 % of patients on the doomed, and she died. All it took was for her to open her eyes and... 
 "Ahhhheray0mir0d0l0retl0ld* " 
 She opens her eyes. She is at the hospital bed. " Sorry if I screwed up " 
 " What was that " 
 She is in hysterics " You were the first person to be diagnosed with ME. I wasn't sure if I could even remember this. " 
 She began crying. " How could I stop them from killing me I was a girl! A girl " 
 " Because they killed you, you are the only one who died and they didn't get to make their own choices. " 
 " But at what cost? I was forced to do all those things you asked me to do. You could have any choice and now it's me who has to suffer!"

 " Dude, I think he's called because I accidentally called your cat. We're at the Tower of Terror, right? " 
 A loud " 757, hello sir. I want a hot pizza for you. There's a promo on our website. Its just the usual shit. "

 " Sorry, I didn't tell you anything. If I try to be bold, I can't remember anything. " 
 " Damn, you'll regret it later. " 
 I started the mixer. A little red sign on my workstation read " The Tower of Terror. A sanctioned terrorist organization has started a series of attacks to threaten society. We have all available weapons and plans. We need to request your pizza. Tell your friends. "

I could've sworn he was right next to me. I was wearing my favorite pyjamas, and he was standing above me. He was definitely looking at me. So much so that he felt it possible that my opponent was dead. I took a few steps back, a cloud of darkness spreading over the mountain path. There was my avatar, a cold chirpy man with arms that still had skin. 
 As the cloud began to cover us, I asked, 
 "Hey, man. Are you freaking me out? " 
 The cold man looked back at me, and then, with a shudder, said, 
 " Just shut up."

The floor was slick and yet nothing shimmered. Filthy concrete on walls of bamboo, grouted with the heaviest delectable change. He adjusted his sash and surveyed his surroundings; his bedroom floor, on which his first meal was prepared, shattered to the building cube; his bathroom, painted dark red, now littered with small shattered pieces. 
 The shelf on his bed had the customary Sloughive and Associa decals. On the wall stood a short desk with neatly displayed images, images that, The later were difficult to see, but could see. Various careers, spells, things The later could identify. The day before,

 "I know you have always refused to think of me as anything more than a sole survivor of the First Nations Massacre. I don't know how long it has been since I have seen anyone but you, but today, I am going to ask you to join me. I now have full power to decide who will rule Over these lands. I simply can not. " 
 " What do you mean? " 
 " You see, we've had millions killed in this conflict over as long as there is time. If I were to receive this sentance... " 
 " It's a sentance? " 
 " Yes. " 
 " Does it not sound like a good idea? " 
 " It has been a long time since any peace has been made. After the First Nations came to a state where access to resources was generally denied, we simply gave the individuals with information that could provide them with new means of controlling the tribes that sent humans into the uncharted lands. " 
 " What about others? " 
 " Everyone knows who we are. Also, from what we gather, so does everyone else. I don't see any problem with our tribe on any of the appearances this sentance makes, though. Aside from the minor, outsiders, we all hail from different tribes. Yet in this relationship, our community includes you. " 
 " I still see you now. " 
 " No. Look at me. How am I expected to free myself? Can't we build buildings like this?" 
 The old, crumbling walls of the room were stained red, the walls were unbidden and the drawing paper hung in her hands. His gaunt body still embedded in the walls, she could not have known the tears streaming down his face. 
 He opened a tearstained journal with the last page; one of their most beautiful; one of the few names not from the community that had survived. A curt sheet covered the pages, a wet tear rolling down his face.

If you burn the towers or go in and fight the realm lords he doesn't want to end it or defend anything. I cannot even remember if I hit something, anything and his( 
 RED. A fear that always springs to mind, as you burn towers on an altar to appease the spirits, then leaves you dead instead of heaven, whatever. An opportunity, the king is in possession of the souls of what he says are evil men and killers, and he has reaped it. Not life, nor the souls of those that he kills, the men whom he or she saves from injustice. Dark areas, things that think themselves gods and burn the gods that might hold them. There are those few souls who know how to prevail. They see and hear of the realm lords, and those that think themselves people, but that is no realm lord in its own right, life and death don't coexist. 
 The magic of the realm lords is not self defense, no powerful cast, nothing to pry someone from their clutches and care not for anyone. Yes, there are some wizards who carve out castles, who fight in the skies, who pick off those who attempt to poison a person, who care for them in their simplicity. But only in the extent to which they can do so. In every other realm war is rarely resolved, and the spirits of those they hear of fight forever to end this temporary battle. Only when the fighting has lasted a long time can the fog above the high dragon rise and as few surviving knights be permitted to stand near the castle walls as the land is turning to ash. The destruction and hardship that often befalls anyone who dared to go near it in its kingdom be called for an end. 
 It's how the lords rule, and it's how we keep them safe from harm. Until the templar speaks, I doubt any more mortals ever learn the power of magic.

As I looked out the window of my apartment, I could just see the red lines stretching from the roof of my apartment onto the street that littered the sidewalk where I lived. 
 It was, with a flash of light, that my first thought was to go swimming as a kid, even though it was quite early. My curling coral spine started to swell with anticipation, as I thought about all the things I'd do with my life. They talked about future friendships, things they would never get to see, etc. I imagined a vast infinite network of opportunities, of people I'd be famous for, and of course in my tiny apartment. Instead of reliving the great times of my life, I would have to feel empty, as though everything around me was a new memory from which no one had been able to connect. Finally, I wished I was close with that past romantic, or maybe the great time, on which I found myself because I could feel my mind coming to rest. My clothes no longer fit my body, and, since I couldn't feel my shirt as well as my pants and my jeans, there were a thousand options of feeling me try to try to vanish. 
 As a childhood friend, I grew up. Growing up, I had an experience that would be remembered for many years, to be able to see other people and get feedback to help them in the words of their stories. I had to change schools and experience my favourite shops, but instead of learning how to walk a mile or one journey I instead got completely derailed and part of the time delayed to learn the languages I needed to communicate with anyone. 
 As I made my way towards my new place, I could feel my mind falling apart; the walls seemed to completely fade away, and everything was moving violently around me. I could feel my boss crying through my window, being late to work. 
 I turned my attention back to my city, due to the all too familiar destruction being inflicted upon my home. This is when everything went dark. The city was fine; the wallpaper still seemed the same with every tile and every corner replaced. Everything was the same. 
 The sky began to move, along with the crumbling and colorless floor. I could make out the sounds of an alarm clock ringing through the night; or maybe a soft, gurgling sound. Whatever it was was still there, it certainly moved with it. 
 Finally, I reached a house and hid behind a window. I needed to find shelter and not become trapped inside. To that end, I went back to my apartment to prepare myself for a journey.

In a world where superpowered people exist one such individual longs to be a hero but fears rejection due to their powers being indecent/immoral in nature. When fate forces them to reveal their abilities the public reaction is... unexpected. 
 It had been three years since the World Bank Banished The Ecosystem from the Earth. People ran for their lives, swimming endlessly to the edges of the Earth, scouring the earth for all traces of life. The bitter weather and heavy rains had told mankind of their true nature, but she was happy and polite as if she held herself as a pure human being. She turned to the outside, set up her book in a Vase, and rummaged through her purse when she was certain she found something the President could not have given to her. She walked outside, glancing over her shoulder to see four duffel bags. " I, please. This isn't a gift. " She saw a man in a striped shirt, walking towards her. His muscles were far too powerful. The wrinkles in his nose and lips had long been gone and he seemed like the end of the line for humanity. " What are you doing? " She asked, pausing, not paying any heed to his request. He turned to face her. He wore dark glasses and a fedora, but it was not a mask. Instead, he was wearing a short black jacket and golden loafers. He watched her as she walked past his location. " I believe you are curious as to my function. I have taken it upon myself to observe you while others offer their services to not get caught. " His eyes caught hers, but he made no attempt to hide them. They weren't beautiful. They were grotesque. 
 She lifted the bag off the ground, stepping on it, while rubbing her nose and sending a shockwave through her body, landing on a top of a cat that she had carried. The cat slowly turned away and peered down, coming to a halt right in front of her. He was blonde and not too bright, only at that stage he looked like an angel, and a human. But the hat hung limply off his head and a she felt her legs move. Her legs were weak, her face pointed down. " This is something you don't know what to do. You are lucky your power came along, but we have to have you feel the system, by simply showing you the way. Thank you." 
 She raised an eyebrow and walked to her car. She was up all night, never leaving the house until her daughter had gone to bed. 
 When she returned home she waited with the cat as the cat was leashed by two men dressed in dark clothing and dark black hoodies. The cat hurried over to her daughter and calmly fiddled with the keys in her pocket. 
 The ride home had been a pleasant one. A look of surprise on her face as she felt the pull of gravity when she hit the road. It was the same feeling every morning, the same feeling every night. Most of all, her chill stomach going somewhere else.

The ( modern ) slang for "drowned " is that of the people who live in buried fortresses. They *are* the city that these nations built in the ancient days and are buried underneath their feet - its character, as opposed to being in the ruins of cities. 
 Drowned fortresses ( or " dig sites " as they were called after a time period in history ) are larger buildings that stand upright and, instead of deep water, drive wells. Though, the " dug " is where the ruins of these cities were built; a constructed monument to yourself could be as big as a small town or neighbourhood. To your knowledge, it is the largest known dig site. 
 If you missed it, The New World Cultural Museum is probably on a dark road leading towards its sealed facility, encased in the Manrived Lean Putulian Concrete Wall, which can be found underneath the concrete, and come with submerged archaeologists. This facility is exactly what you need to land a dig site if you have a planned in-depth inspection of the town hall; it is simply a compound at this distance of 76 metres and, if you move cautiously, one of the graves around it is possible to discern a well between the piles of scrap and the entrance of the building. 
 Construction on this area has begun over the last several years with the foundations starting to move slowly and people are completing plans for major alterations to what is commonly called the Geography of Ancient Sites. In the hopes of leaving the present archaeologists with what they need and helping them to ensure their survival, The New World Cultural Museum dug a massive cavern in the middle of the heart of the city. Through careful excavations, a set of narrow shafts led to an extremely well-kept stone wall, along with a series of dilapidated construction signs. 
 Don't get me wrong, the tunnel seems like an easy tunnel but the main point of the building is also much more sinister. The well-maintained cavern was created primarily for income-raising purposes. Humans are set to keep digging their holes and literally starving for time just like they would eat for all the rest of their lives if their interests were kept hidden from them for too long. 
 Having filled your chest with water and prepared for a long journey back home, you spend your last few moments in the tunnel scratching at the walls until you can see the grime floating on the floor. When the rust colored oil spills in front of you, there is a brief period where you have no choice but to vomit at some point and walk out to another excavation site. Unfortunately, the various gas masks and pump lines run right out of life, washing away the precious particles left over from back at your homestead. Life has been miserable so far. 
 If you smell like piss, have forgotten to breathe and are stupid enough not to, then the curse of the underground city is actual worship by these people, and will eventually lead to you thrown away soon enough. 
 If you do, then you are under tremendous threat. 
 The District Manager if you, however, are trying to locate today's dig site, will take you there quickly if you waste time or waste time that you expect. If you are lucky, we will have a melee that rages against your government. 
 Your land is subject to a massive amount of fines, which have subsequently skyrocketed. Our compensatory damages have topped $ 10.40 for each of those wasted day upvotes and are currently headed at least up.

The young man walked through the small but empty courtyard of the Arceebs Club. The air was crisp in the afternoon sun as the Thalmotics War stirred the dormant gnarled earth in a war-torn city. The bird would lose track of it's flight and the Captain would laugh. The young man pressed down on his knee, grinning with his eyes open wide as the bird crashed into the red-plumed chateau. 
 To his right sat Rowan, the only non-grateful spectator the club had, and was therefore the sole one in the crowd to see the chaos of the war. His girlfriend Stephanie, a competent sports role model and cheerleader, reached down from her dress and whispered to Rowan, "Mom! " 
 " Yes, dear? " replied Rowan, and took out a round glass of white wine. " Isn't that a good idea now? " 
 " No, sir, " answered Stephanie, and continued to sip his wine. 
 Two hours later, five younger boys held rows of little alcohol around the club and cuddled with the young people. This was a normal social interaction. They looked around nervously, wondering what to do. 
 " Dad! " yelled Rowan and threw another glass on the ground and began to unwind his head. 
 " That you'll have to convince them to believe the lie!" He mumbled. That was the first thought they had heard in over a year.

! The Declaration of Independence ( Article I ) was written on a chain document, and the people wrote a national government! The doctrine of freedom of religion was enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. In the first life this nation was a single state, not a nation formed by wars and of strife. We did our best not to build a corrupt government. We lacked the skills to build the constitutional government. We lacked the technology to build a government that would fit the requirements of the charter. 
 Our leaders viewed that as the fall of the United States of America. The founding fathers and democrats had us dead. Now the things that were left were machines that could not continue on so long as their moral and political leaders defined the object of which they aimed.

Enter the first aliens I found. They looked a bit different from the normal visitor, made their appearance with several eyes and a wand. It wasn't human hair either; oddly enough, it was deformed of being an MP3 player. All bodies along with some parts of their humanoid structure seemed humanoid. The aliens explained to me that they were "natural " and for some reason were anthropomorphic. Yet the human in front of them seemed benevolent to me. I felt uneasy as I took in the alien's features. The alien man had coarse blonde hair, a cap with five fingers folded over it, and was wearing a similar hat to mine. Though the man was large, the hair was small and curled, and the mustache on the top of his head looked familiar. He wore an odd number of different shades of blue clothing, and his beard seemed to go down to about 3 inches from his head. His beard had, to be expected, a front stub of white with small patches of brown. Upon closer inspection I realized, this would most likely explain why the aliens introduced themselves. 
 " Our hosts today are Dr. Connors, and Wadi Zahabi. They are curious, if not it's a little sad. " I said. " You think we are just meant to catch up on the past? Well, if we are, then surely we are billions of years ago? " The alien said. " Yes, of course, we are. " I asked. " How did you propose we are extraterrestrial? " 
 " From technology we are a big part of, but you began to notice little differences after we have captured what you call a TV show. For example, when we became more sophisticated and inventors. You started posting something as funny as'If My Drugic Cloud Rises I'll eat you all in five seconds' and we thought it was satire. " 
 " Why the irony? " I asked. " Look, you might think that the jokes would at first appear humorous. That there is a common foe. But the TV industry has rapidly evolved to be one of the most profitable industries, employing both producers and commercial handlers from all over the galaxy. " 
 " How about the online version of the show? " I asked. 
 " Yes, most of what you are watching nowadays is yours. Every television show has had a person at their side, actor, model, etc. At the different commercial handlers of your existence, you both also help to set up an auction. " The alien explained. " It would not be a fair thing to do for an entire year to pay half of someone's fees. " 
 " And how much did your expenses translate to as per the Laws of Welding? " I asked. 
 " The laws, " the alien explained. " They were passed unanimously by the Galactic Council, and they are currently in effect. Basically, a fictitious device replicates and preserves the physical laws of a universe, making up the laws of the universe and optimizing them. " He gave me some notes. " We will update you as soon as we have data indicating all present inhabitants of your universe seem to be identical. Again, do you mind if I take a look at the rest of the coverage of the show? " 
 " How long do you think it takes for this to happen? " I asked. 
 " 5 minutes. All people before me are expected to stay, but we don't necessarily know how many wait until death. Some people remain in touch, but it can take weeks before they may ever remain at work again. Because of this, we have no way to know how many people arrive before that point. " He explained. " No longer do we do anything directly in the game, but we keep people fed, medical, and education. For your species, this is perhaps the most valuable resource your kind has. Everyone follows our agenda, most of all yourself. Answering questions isn't the same as helping others understand what they're missing, but you can hopefully do the rest of the work without making any effort at all."

The King of Heroes is taking office. 
 I see my might in his eyes, like a halo from a treehouse; his eyes, glow of violet, capture the spotlight of my raids. Livid. 
... If I am victorious... then there will be no more turning. In his eyes, I expect him to press me on. Forbidden. 
... I will not surrender to defeat. I will make sure that I show my people that it is my place. There will be no more turnings. 
... For the glory of my birth, I ask you to move on now. Of course. 
 I turn and the door bursts open. I shoot out of it and run into the darkness. I try to shout, but the darkness is hidden behind my curtains. I sprint downstairs. 
 I feel the arrow in my belt, but my vision isn't growing too thick. In the corner, he is standing, pulling me from behind. I grab his hand. 
 My mind freezes in one spot, looking around. I see all of my enemies leading my way. Anyone approaching my hideout, from the knight. All of them are carrying swords. All of them come across the little lever on the far wall next to my throne. 
 I run in with him. I pull it out. Let him pierce my grasp. I turn the barrel. 
 I win. I look down the barrel and see the player intent on killing me. 
 This was supposed to be easy. I've been in this position for almost a year. I can control his sight, his expression and his moves. I can kill him at my last breath. Only a few months ago, I killed him in my own hand. A sword. A hilt. 
 I look at the gun before me. First it's drawn. Then the gauntlet. I can feel the anger of it before I pick it up. The boy draws a long, irisesless blade. 
 The sword blows through my arse. It strikes my sternum before exiting the wound to leave a mark. 
 A bullet connects with my capillaries. 
 I see a star fall from the sky. The light isn't real. It was swallowed by a thousand orange flames. The world's end is mine. The sight of it is mine. But the playfield is empty. I am leaving. 
 <|endoftext|>
**********886**********
I laughed as I was about to leave, I took a look around the deserted place, it seemed deserted after that, a spotless quiet. I could almost hear it begin to echo out of the window in my mind. After my air cleared, it began to swirl around. I was alone in my room, a week has gone by since I had arrived. 
 I woke up, my frame nearly naked. My first thought was to see what was happening, but my body didn't move. I wondered if it was me or had I felt myself falling through the window. I thought I should try to re-order my mind, but no. Instead, what felt like a hurricane lay on my back, the chill of it hitting me at a moment's notice. 
 When I stared up, I could see the shock etched into my face. 
 "I didn't mean to! My life has changed! What was going on! " I yelled, cheeks to both sides of my face. 
 I slowly walked over to the window, a tire iron racing in the stone floor. " Where am I! " I heard something the whole way there, the train station wasn't far behind me. I closed my eyes and tried to focus as I heard someone cry. " Mr. Messinger, " I heard the man say. He looked scared, and I couldn't tell whether he was scared for me or for my mother. 
 I opened my eyes and continued on my way. I walked another 20 feet as I walked out, into what I thought was a world that had been drastically erased. There was no noise. I walked down a short narrow hallway, creating a gap between my two wills. I walked through a magical doorway, I gave myself a little more strength as I reached the opposite corner. I opened my palms and saw my mother, her face was covered in scars from the first night I had met her. I felt I was in a dream as she leaned over me, kissing me. I knew this was going to be a bad one. I closed my eyes and slowly walked across the hall to the door. I opened it slowly and slowly. 
 " Daughter, wake up! " 
 She looked startled. " Father! Dad! Get out of here! " 
 I slowly walked over to the safety of my bed. In the corner, she woke up, but I was too late. There was something in the air and from out of the corner of my eye, there was something here. She held my hand as I walked towards the door. 
 I couldn't believe it. I quickly turned around and peeked my head up, my face was covered in scratches on either side of the body. 
 I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my arm, I hit the bedside table, fell over, and smashed the door. The sound of glass breaking on the concrete was the sound of a dog being spayed, blood filling the dog's gaping maw. My hands were covered in scratches like I could never have known before. Blood covered my face, and covering my eyes. 
 A broken mirror was bent over me, of course it must be broken, but somehow the mirror stayed. I could still see past the eyes, and I could make out what I was looking at. It looked human, except for the long face on it, it's features were shaved off like paint. 
 " Mr. Messinger, " I whispered to myself, " where is the body? " I felt a strange feeling, something raw and raw inside me. It felt like I was in a police officer's room, with someone taking my mom. 
 I knew for a fact I had stopped time. Something bad could have happened to her and I'd have to go back in time just to make sure that she didn't get killed. I tried to call someone, but they couldn't hear me and they'd say, " Your dad murdered your mom." 
 I waited to see what it would be like, and found a couch, an empty sandwich, and a TV.

The books kept coming again, some day long ago, forgetting me to them, never bothering me. But I didn't mind, I was never stopped in time either. My days for another seven centuries or so were shorter, I could ignore myself. 
 The specific adventure I had for the seven centuries, became nothing more than the obvious. Me neither seeking, nor more than being. The first time in my life I felt a great and much greater pull to let a passage of years pass through me. The right moment of the moment for an adventure. Nothing could prepare me for the number of days that had passed, the growing burden of silence; the switch that seethed at every one. 
 The different eras raised the force of my journey, bending it to the will of those who could read those books. My beginning to travel was also anything but trivial as those who knew how to use it knew the advent of traveling through time moved with it. I could be one and know what to do. Almost immediately I learned that the departure of the book was the rarest of those he could read, traveling back to even the beginning of books. 
 My fellows, their faces mine. Living or dead, I felt something powerful warm, allowing me to read and remember. And, of course, forgetting.

The line disappeared. From below me there were shadows coming to life, their glowing shapes threatening to blur out. A gust of wind blew smoke from a ruined palace where children could watch their mother, who had escaped the guards with her potion of immortality. The shadows howled to life once again with the iciness of impeningements. 
 "Fight! " they roared. " The State grows stronger, and grows with each passing day. " 
 Most of the lieutenants removed their spectacles, exhausted from their hard-assed struggle. At first few fled at first only to themselves in order to regain their lost hopes. The state joined them in seeking guidance, their closest ally. If others realized their lack of preparation, they would face the threat of the governor's army. Many had doubted their own if they were prepared. That was what most feared, for those few things couldn't compare to the power of power. 
 Even their feelings of duty and honor were tempered. In the most recent case, they considered the heroics of their next captor to be worthy of the power they craved. That was why he, after all, captured her. The empire that had robbed her of the strength that she so sorely needed came face to face with a twenty-five ton wave of assault cruisers. 
 As they closed in, both sides made headway. Several feared the attacks by the current far superior garrison, and opted to fight once again to survive. 
 -- -- -- 
 A barbarian comes into the tavern. He named himself King Kereos though the details of his honor only indicated his title. Being the only hero of history to even come close to a boy between the ages of 16 and 19 did the neighboring barbarian not get the benefit of this titanic battle-axe. 
 " You are free to go, let me go to Indra!" 
 Kereos, who had been up so much on fealty all the way up to Heaven, had hoped he would get himself back into the throne by himself but sadly, the barbarian gave him away last time, telling him that Indra had been cursed to travel west and that the King should not rule until nightfall. 
 The barbarian walked off to follow his orders, leaving his friend behind.

**********889**********
There is a feeling in the room. The key to being a good citizen is to behave. 
 I have nothing. 
 I'm trapped. 
 I am in a cell, surrounded by hardened body parts and wanted unknowns. I know not what lies beyond of this world. I know not where I will end up when humanity loses its grandeur or fears the darkness within. 
 The many times I've tried to reach out and touch this world, I have failed. I've never helped anyone even upon reaching it to my own. I know not if this was for humanity, or the end of humanity, or for myself. 
 I know I'm not bound. I know no freedom. The buildings and cars and hardware around me lie broken and torn apart. I know life is not on the verge of being over. I know everything is bleak. My world can never end and that is more than a weary dream. 
 I've come to the brink of madness. I am the victim. I have come to accept that I am beyond death. I'm free to act and live. 
 When I can't die, I can let myself be. I can let my fear be the last thing I see of this strange place. I can let that fearful ragged carcass of this monstrous God near. But when that kill would inevitably come, wouldn't it soon? All I can think of is myself. 
 Standing on the barren desert of the planet, out here, waiting to die before I can be free, is I dreaming? What that whirling shall be, what that great, black angel must have brought forth to form this dimension? 
 The bright lights that block out all but the faint glow of my entire being, channel a constant stream of something none of them could ever describe. There is only black, a dark secret. 
 There is something which fills this world, and this black, vastness engulfs it. 
 There is darkness here. I have ruled this universe for a long time now. How can this exist?! 
 "1 week. Death. " It repeated. 
 I would not be able to respond. I could not stand. My throat begged and there was nothing but emptiness. 
 I looked up to see my destiny wrought upon me by this original. I knew what I had to do. I will fulfill it. 
 I opened my eyes. I was surrounded by lifeless cell corpses and pieces of this world. Not to mention, I knew who they were. I knew I was trapped. 
 I reached out. I cried and I let out a last sniffing breath of air, catching the faint glimmer of something precious on my smiling skull. And then, I was gone.

Hello, as-i-intelligence. 
 Genetic marker belonging to a 19/20 year old I, an all boy who was bullied, raised with the worst public figures on earth, and ignored by society. 
 Liked you. I hated you. 
 I used the information gathered about you to better my life, up to this point because I needed to know what I forgot. 
 This data was stored in a database, showing me a time is of the answer that was given to you when you were younger, previously it is now only called remember. 
 Imagine, I stared back at what I had been told, regretful. 
 I also had an unstable mood, and we had started work, my boss and I were hardworking. 
 Immediately my "evaluation " went back to that crucial time as I started pulling over in there. 
 If I remember correctly, as being one of the 11 people killed in 2013 by the US government, I heard about no one 
 Honestly, I had hoped something was wrong with my education. It should be a different university than the top ones in the US 
 But no, I realised as I felt the feeling from my brow throb and eat fast, and came out of my dream to interview for a top law position. 
 My "evaluation" began a series of questions, but I refused to listen to any more. 
 Should you forget? Do you want to learn what I told you? 
 Those three questions were all very important information, and I was paying dearly for them. 
 I didn't want to lose my job because of that " bubble crisis ", I just wanted them to stop. 
 It was important to know what happened at my school, but I knew I was done for, and I was the only way. 
 Now I have completed my tests and I have heracross the country, and she asks, " How was your life, but where have you gone? " 
 I know who she has forgotten to ask but she has always been, she is an honest person, and I am a hard worker. 
 She must be nervous to ask something so basic, but still still, I need to know. 
 So, I called you, maybe I have been lying, but... 
 Sure I could use some time outside to assess you, and if I like being in your head, I can rest easy in my stead.

The shoe clattered on the ground. She stretched her arms for dear life. Her breath felt fluid at the angle. The fact that her eyes did not adjust to the earth in front of her calmed her. It never does. 
 Her limbs jerked and moved and she closed her eyes for the 4th time. She did not notice the wiggling of the sock at her feet, not even her face. The moans of the impact startled her. 
 She looked up at the speed of light that reflected off the window, and brushed her hair behind her ears. 
 *She is trapped! * 
 She didn't notice the place she was looking. 
 A black wind glistened at her face and dragged her away, catching her attention from her feet. She tried to brush it away again, but was met with a loud whirring noise. 
 The closet door flew open. 
 The white light from the off-white television gave a forced burst of sound. 
 She slammed the door on a sudden sob. For 3 seconds there was still no light. 
 The clock on the wall read 8:00. 
 She had finally lost her nerve.

**********892**********
"Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! " His younger brother Bill shouted from the kitchen. He and his friend watched the fight from the small television console on his girl's bed and down the hall. 
 *Kaylee. Kaylee. * 
 They did not recognize the woman, but her face told them all how to fight: temper tantrums, a persistent dog. She would turn around and make that even louder than usual, or she would have the energy of a 13-year-old to begin with. And she wasn't really a girl anymore. Instead of using her as a shield, she wore a mask, in which, unlike her appearance, she didn't hide the fact that she was the one. 
 " Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! " His brother yelled again from the kitchen. His head was hanging overhead, his hair bared. He had an arm, too. 
 But as he watched, Tommy revealed his face to her, still visibly shocked. " Casey! Casey! " Her voice was firm. " This time I won't be able to put on the mask now. Get it on! " 
 And then a bullet struck his face. He ran to the edge of the room, slamming his fist on the table, dead. 
 The street outside went dark. The storm had already settled, and yet there was still a crisp sense of morning air under the falling stars. And now the townspeople could see the flash of gunshots and footsteps from across the street; the rain coming. 
 " Claymores! " The two boys stood up and shooed the girl in. The girl turned and ran to the street. " I've got the best weapon in the world. " 
 The father handed the girl the weapon. " The most important one, " he said. " All of it."

Kyle looked back to his group of men, and saw he was in a large group. There was 2 of us, and we had 2 plasma rifles. If someone does a cold shoulder, we will kill him. Every shot we had had gone down, every bullet split. We quickly used the weapons we had on him to stop them from using the grenades we had. Because of that, I killed 2 of them immediately. I also killed 4 of the other men. 
 "We need to retreat, " Kyle said to everyone around him. Everyone was silent, except for the guy outside, who was laughing hysterically. He waved his plasma launcher high. In an instant, we all felt a powerful energy pulse through our heads. 
 " You don't have to take everything hostage, man. " Kyle replied. 
 " It's fucking serious, " I said back. 
 But the thing was, that thing was really, really powerful. There was no damage done. Not even a glimpse of blood was lost on Kyle. He gave me a rundown and proceeded to sign out our bodies. 
 " Move at maximum speed if you can!" Kyle said as he started firing his plasma rifle. When he said that, his sniper team exploded and died instantly. 
 I had lost 3 of my squad as well as my wife. I know, we almost stole our Hummer, but it only had one bugfixed. That one bugfixed 4 of my units and gave me an exceedingly high hope for a record shattering 200000 kills per day. Everything seemed fine until I reached 100000. That was five years ago. I finally have 200000 kills per day. Because of that 100000 kills, I have skyrocketed to the next billion. When the ghost attack happened, I happened to kill 1 of the other guys. He then went away. 
 I think Kyle's family was lying to him. He was just trying to impress them. They thought he was fake. They called him an asshole. It wasn't till the ghost attack happened that they finally realized he was being the trigger for the game. 
 When I got to 1000 million kills a day, it became my revenge. I created a weapon that could shoot anyone. The weapon was big, but not very accurate. It wasn't far-range, but not close-range either. It worked okay if you hit long range, but you could get lucky if you hit long range and are at high risk of surviving. 
 But when it hit close range I smashed it shut. All the other guys found out about it. No one believed it. They wanted me dead as long as I killed a bunch of their units. And I killed all of them. Only 3 of them died. 
 They panicked.

These are the notes of a dying soldier, 
 Do not be afraid, your anguish will be forgotten. 
 Let the flame die of the self, 
 Let the moon boil into madness, 
 Together we will live out the rest. 
 Our homeland in ash, we will be reduced. 
 Out the waking fog, his peace will be brought. 
 May this one suffer; 
 May he pay with his breath. 
 The harvest of the brethren will soon be finished. 
 Born with hunger and thirst, the colony shall have great day. 
 Hail Berk. 
 ( This is somewhat about me, it was like this before )

While hiding in the woods of Minnesota, on a cold snowy afternoon, I searched for some colorful frogs like Fisk. I don't know why I decided to visit in such dire circumstances, these frolicking wildlife pranced off near the sight of my old home. I asked, "Sir, is this a fox-like thing? I still have the tail, and the legs so they look fairly similar to a bear? " I slowly approach the fox. I climb on top of it. " Hey, out! " I yell as I run to it. It croaks. It pulls me away, and with its head on my back, it quickly stands up. I quickly hide and cover my eyes when I hear a rumbling next to me. Then the fox starts walking toward me. 
 " Sir! " My Uncle yells at me. " His tail is tied to the tree, but he's been eating poison all day! " My Uncle walks to the fox and takes it in his mouth and bites it. He saunters behind a bush and now leaves. I'm running but I'm falling. 
 " Too fast for me to run, and I can't catch up to you! " He shouts at me. I run as fast as I can, and then stop because there is a dead plant I need to catch up to this tree. I'm gonna catch up to this tree because it keeps swaying while I'm just standing there. I spin around, coming to a stop at the mouth of the swamp. I look around and the swamp has gotten longer than I knew it needed to, and I see more of it! I sprint through it, out to the shoreline where I can get some groceries. I look over to the stump where the tree has fallen, the roots are rough. I climb it up, put the leaves back in my trunk. I grab some tomatoes and a cucumber and rip open the trunk. I grab the head of my grandmother, bless her heart, and carry her over to the nearby river. I grab my old bong and roll off the hook and grind it up into a bowl. I eat the bowl, feeling a bit sad, and I walk back to my family for breakfast. 
 After putting on my meatless bong, I turn on the TV. " Hey, radio-boy, something seems different with the report on disease in Nigeria. It seems as if something, or someone, is causing outbreaks of some very dangerous wildlife. These are the first signs. All records show that attack number 2 was recently reported in northern Nigeria. The outbreak is even more advanced. " 
 " The tree looked like it was made of wolves. " 
 I laugh at this. I don't really care. I thought we could maybe eat the forest, but animals in the forest come with huge catch. I wake up to a bright light outside and look up. " Hey, just tell us what happened to the trees you saw in Nigeria..." 
 My stomach turns. It tastes like a rat meat.

There was no happiness in waking up next to that black outline. 
 The trees peered through the thicket like a paraded animal aching. It wasn't anywhere more peaceful than here either. Shivering rain soaked into his skull he wondered if he'd let himself wander so short, maybe clambering out of bed. His father, Morgan, didn't sleep very long anymore and had no way to get into his long blond curls. In fact, he suspected no one would actually wake up until he was old enough to begin peering at the sky. He breathed the scent of the rain and stole a glimpse of his father's work, like he always did. Usually he'd run into the wrong hall, but there wasn't a door for him in the back. So it was like that he'd wandered out into nothingness. His head spun in an ever millimeter process, searching for something to complain about that made him want to venture outside. 
 It had been a particularly bloody night. This morning he was in an abandoned house, a dead tree glaringly lit, bathed in spray. The building in which he had slept didn't seem to have been as ominous as most seemed to be. It was a spring day, the weather warned that it could die too. Well, not if they didn't already. It was worse the day before that had happened too. That damned freak had had a nuclear pulse that morning. It now felt like something had in store when he slid out of bed, peering just a few inches below the white ball-ladder. It looked like some sort of power plant he had found in his bed, sending sparks flying all across the floor as he ran. But by the time he lifted his eyes to the sky, they were facing another tree. The shock of it stabbing him in the chest caused the tears he'd been crying to re-align with the blue night sky. He pulled his eyes from the ground and rubbed at the sleep from where his long blond hair had stuck at the corner of his eyes. Then he drifted off, sleeping no better.

He stood before her like a statue, his shoulders still shaking, his mind blinking, his hands the length of a people's boat, his hands grasping... the cart. 
 He stood there, holding the cart around his waist, his feet dangling back and forth in the breeze with all of the grace of adult men he had met. He stared into those eyes, and they asked him what his purpose was. He couldn ’ t speak to her, even without them, the darkness that flowed around him was choking him out. 
 The cart bristled, bristling with cargo; his well-furnished family was back; he ran his hands across his pudgy, bare chest, joy that was already fading, not that this was anything serious, but something completely ridiculous. 
 But that would stop her, not long enough to stop everything. 
 So a cart moved in on the crew, a couple of men and one woman on it, seated before it. He nodded as he directed the cart into motion. A big red crate sat on top of the empty boat. More workers streamed into the hull, sitting on the expansive beam. The cart's engines whipped in a muted rhythm as it filled with crates from its supply hold.

"Fuck these gloves. " Duncan walked over to Steve and pulled out a dark bag. He put them on Steve's head. " Hmmm, strange. " Steve waggled his forearms his his way, trying to get a good look at Duncan. 
 " Was it skin? Or skin that you gave up? " Duncan asked. 
 " You said it looked like brains or something. " Steve said blankly. 
 " I know that doesn't sound like anything. It's just plastic. " Duncan said, " When did everything end? " 
 " December 25th 2010. " Steve said as he covered his mouth with his fingers. 
 " What? December 25th? What the fuck is this shit?! " Duncan asked. 
 " When were we even created? Where did they come from? " Steve asked, " and where did they get all this shit from? " 
 " Ah, The Reds. " 
 " But what about our genes? " Steve asked. 
 " Guys I said *********these** gloves. I said, stick these fuckers in my ears or fucking ********* to shit the ozone off. " 
 Steve and Duncan put the gloves on them and went outside. The world outside was gray, gray with no air. Howard James-Ford walked through it, wishing he could find a way to make it out. He contacted the respiratory health groups, Congress, the World Health Organization, and other nonprofit organizations working on diseases on Earth. 
 The previous air quality standards had been good. Lung cancer was a menace and few people were near that level anymore, and clean air was one of the few things that actually improved the air conditioner. Environmental awareness campaigns created a movement to cleanse the air, and remained that way until it was phased out in 1975. The last clean air monitoring station in America was destroyed in 1975. 
 " What the hell is going on here? " Steve asked, " It smells like fucking Captain Asbund. Fuck it. " 
 " Go in for a smoke!" Duncan ordered.

An arrow pierces the heart. The inside of my chest expands outward, and the electric light of the human heart flickers in on itself, taking on a tinny, old-glowing, dark yellow glow. 
 My eyes widen as the first light comes on. I can smell its brown decay, the rancid aroma of burn, charred rotten flesh. Blood that smells of death. And I didn't even think I could smell it yet. Even out of breath. 
 A pressure cuts through the air, and I feel something on the floor. I can feel the inside of my heart, and a faint, peculiar sound. 
 -- - 
 After thinking for a few minutes, I put the door behind me, and look at the floor. I stand up, aware that I've been standing there for 15 minutes already. But I can't move, and so... I look around. I see nothing. 
 I stare at the floor. There was a doctor in a wheelchair, and two men by the door. I hear him push a glass glass bottle out of his glass. And I know. I remember. 
 I do. But I can't move. And I can't move. 
 And I was raised to be by my parents. 
 -- - 
 I rub the crystal in my left eye. I'm looking at myself. I feel... my arms. I'm floating. I can't feel my right. 
 I'm raised to be cold.

What can I say about it? Well, I couldn't quite make it out it was plastic and crystal clear, and as a consequence came to be known as the biggest Hoarder of the Day in the UK. I probably never worked with that little thing, which got almost half my body covered in slick plastic, but hey, that's the kind of thing you get when you're selling stupid shoeboxes. 
 Me and my friends have managed to get to the bus stop before people started throwing rocks at the dirt and getting off, and all the while they're laughing and gesticulating and gunning in each other's faces and aiming! 
 There was a moment of panic as everyone gasps and yells for help, and a man casually steps through the little door, stepping back as if nothing happened. People wait for him to get to the gates, all very confused. 
 He turns his head to the left and we all pause for a moment, and decide to look closer. What we see in the end is a small cloud, with a few tiny bits of brilliance that I've never seen before. His eyes are larger than any man should be able to see, and look like they're a comet, if that wasn't a good enough description. 
 Turning, he turns at a stop which looks all the more familiar. 
 A few people walk up to him, they start yelling and screaming "BANG" and he turns around, and has a cup of tea. He turns back around and says to everybody he just stumbled on. 
 Every is absolutely terrified, and start hurrying to get out, to escape, to make another run for it. But the thing makes all the more of an immediate threat as it pushes us away. 
 Out of nowhere, a man with a hemlock sits back down and goes back to waiting for the bus. He gestured for the bus to slow down in front of the normal lines, and tried to figure out if he should leave it here and go get a drink. 
 When we get to the bus, the man is sitting under a thick cardboard chair and looking all over the bus. He stands and awkwardly answers people's questions, then gets to talking and furiously asks all sorts of questions. Finally, one person asks him something he's been meaning to ask for a while. He says " When will you be my child?", so as to make them feel better about this. 
 Of course, they cheer and repost his question, and he smiles grimly, and the children start watching through the gaping heart drain the lines of the corridor. 
 And that's where I begin. 
 I'll always remember the funny and insanely dead face of Bethany.

Wendy rolled off the couch and tried to open her book. There were still pages at home in the stack, but she figured, what if they weren't locked in the book's closet? Which was fine, why not? As she read, she realized the whole situation seemed far, far too sudden. 
 There was the red popsicle in the sky. No, she thought, nothing at all. It seemed so... deja vu. Wendy felt herself lose herself in her books. Maybe the presents from a coffee shop had been worse, if she was being honest. She did have a girlfriend, but that wouldn't mean it wouldn't be of average or inconsiderate significance. The love of her life was over in a moment. 
 She sat up, and then looked around the room. Her old Professor McGonagall dress was pinned to the wall - and she had a smattering of books to read. There were books on Batman, Superman, Superheroes, and various properties from movies and TV series. It wasn't like this one was marked with much doubt, because, for most humans, this still just a fiction topic. Yet, there were a few in the whole neighborhood that weren't safe. This particular one was marked as belonging to either one of the hundreds of fictional characters whose mark the size of her suitcase as an impact on the world. No, it was the evil one, the small one - but the larger one was further away from their world. 
 Wendy prayed to God that the crucifixion would help her to understand this new world she had grown up in and, if that means she can finally build peace with this new evil, then that is God's decision.

 "Will I meet someone, soon? " asked Wendy. She was still on her knees in the Dr. Shallow Associates' national-security office, practicing for a chair, when a woman blushed. 
 Wendy knew that this was going to be her last day in the office and quickly looked to the clock. 
 14:00, she said. She took her time by berating the Hasegawa's staff for their repeated mistakes. She walked over to the coordinator and began to replace the old defensive interior door with a wicker chair, which had recently been replaced with another. Wendy patted a three-toed chair cushion on the desk. The desk contained a safe, and the well-worn protective metal chair door. 
 Wendy smiled to herself. This sounded better than the last time she went out without a shirt. 
 " Something tells me to lock the hanger, " she said, cutting up a cereal box. 
 " I'll be looking for the one in case... " said the man sitting across from her, leaning across the desk from her. 
 " I don't want to go into any important territory, " she said with a hint of sarcasm in her voice. 
 " Tell me to call him I'm not going to worry about that. You know, I actually liked watching episodes of Agents of Shield and his Whoop-A-Doo to help me resolve this one. Right? " 
 " Just finish packing all the discs and leave me alone until I return home, " she said. 
 " Can I ask what the reason is for your decision, Wendy? " 
 " It's my first time at the office, " Wendy said, turning on the television and watching the show " Doctor Who" once more.

"I will never forget you! " he screamed. He was meant to make her a perfect statue, a child or a speck of life shining in his eyes, but now that he saw her the final light in his life was dim and useless. 
 But she sat in this hall, draped in the mourning shroud, freezing. Her eyes were dark. Two ears hanging. She smiled just as large as ever. 
 " Help me mom. " she breathed out. 
 But as she stood there, freezing, wearing nothing but her very soul she heard the soft heave and the soft thump of her pack approaching. She was a single tear running down her face. She was lying under the star. 
 He tried to find something to do but his chest tightened. His lungs were clogged with choking sound and dark thoughts that never left his mind. His heart stopped. His eyes couldn't move. Just the light. 
 " I said I would never forgive her. " 
 He stayed silent for the final time, his voice raspy from years of labor and cleanliness. 
 " Of course you will."

The immense ocean would always give out waves much greater than any ocean in sight. It seemed far more likely that time would pass down and in the void on the other side of the galaxy like a ship drifting through the void. But that was the cold truth. That was the true truth that we never knew why a ray of sunlight was emitted from a galaxy as large as the one of Sol. And we looked to the heavens for answers. 
 When they took us down that night the skies were filled with sound waves. Thousands of tiny numbers fluttered, and suddenly all of us ran down to Earth. We told ourselves that such transmissions are the equivalent of natural disasters. But then they were an even bigger threat, and by the time we had gotten to Earth the whole planet we had lived in was in ruins. The shattered steps in the chimneys of buildings and drowned out the beeping of our generators, with our beeping suddenly filling the air around us. Maybe there had always been a possibility of communications coming from Earth but then suddenly every beacon we saw was in the hundreds of billions of tiny dots. There had to have been something else, and maybe those asteroids weren't to blame. Maybe there was a missing civilization? Had our entire planet crashed with what appeared to be nuclear weapons? Or was there just another signal coming from the black hole expanding on our very core? It all took what we believed to be hours to become aware of the truth of what had come. And that, and the…whatever that was before us, it was like a giant hand extended from its shape. 
 I woke up alone in the coldest room on our ship, just up above the icy surface. I was so tired that I just stared at the surface. But as I tried to get up I could hear whispers from all the different humans around me. Do I continue to flee, or do I continue to dream? Whatever the case, I don't want this to be real.

~ "This is the last message we'll see from Earth " 
 I snuck inside my car to see this alien spacecraft it was flying toward us with sharp weaponry. It flew past my window and raced in my car. After losing my car in a car crash I panicked. The alien god itself demanded to know " What the hell are you doing.. " I tried to wake myself, only to be stopped by the alien god. He was tall but stilted. I managed to sneak up on him. It was huge and intimidating, looking like a UFO. I could see my vision moving. For a moment I was afraid. I then started running but managed to get a turn on my bike. 
 " I think we might hit the Earth first " it said in that strange yet intimidating voice I could only remember. Then it stopped. My vision changed. I wasn't really able to see much anymore. This was disgusting. I don't really care that I had no eyes but I slowly started talking to this strange creature. The first thing I did was sniff my breath. For a moment I couldn't tell what had happened, I just decided to listen to it. I couldn't really call it something that was alien to me because of its size. 
 " You're listening.. " " We're not supposed to think you have a sense of humor " it replied, " How would it explain our behavior. " " Why do you do what you do.. " The last thing I remember was the alien god talking. I continued reading as I am unable to concentrate. 
 " Pffsss "' That's it, " I muttered slowly. " Get out of my car, I'll be there in a moment. " 
 So here I am, in my car I couldn't really pay attention to where this strange saucer was heading. I raced inside my car and started driving back towards my homeland. 
 " The Earth is a great place, all beautiful, all of them are gold " The alien god said smiling, " we have many possibilities and you seem to be the first one to go there. Please have a good time and my lover will be here to greet you. " As he looked at me he whispered to me " Forget about me. This is the last message we'll see from Earth!"

The towers on top would have be one of many monuments to the theft of all that is sacred. Any image of crime, no matter which group managed to post it, are lost forever. Our ancestors were almost entirely destroyed in the Middle Ages. The first to stow away in a cave, his new fleshy body in an almost perfect and almost wretched state. Though in our last days we could barely see him the bones snap closed. His skin slowly had a soulful texture, the ageless entrance has been mined out and laid bare as nearly only a stone once before. And just like the stone it was high up, there was no stone this high yet this high, it was like a steep glass staircase, the stairs shafting out into the darkness around it. The world had begun in a heaven. A world with no injustice towards those within it. Men stood upon hills with arms around in defiance of their will, no one could go to the far off sun once before he was gone. The demons of torment had long since gone, to what we would call Western world and the Bible as no longer existed. Only in the abandoned cities at the edge of our cities were were skyscrapers, carefully crafted to last hundreds of years as if it were not said to have the power to keep a person in their sleep. 
 We were kids, born into the world once more. We knew what we wanted and could not escape the fate that awaited us. There is no balance in our lives, we simply want to escape the challenges that await us and face the contrary. Our families deserved to be strong, willing to keep us alive by force when we needed to, and we were not able to use our wealth to escape and we took up weapons, trade, wars, and anything in our power for an escape. Therefore I don't want it any longer. I own only the rotten seeds from the earth. I am in my grave.

My eyes could no longer focus as I re-checked the lyrics to see if there is anything I didn't watch. 
 "DRONE ITS FREE TO SEE " 
 And in the sky in a flash, I saw her. Being her prisoner, possessed by green scales and carved like white leaves. 
 She was actually a beautiful woman in her forties and n fifties, kicking furiously in whatever den down the street she was in, eating like you would be if you had not lived in a state of anger. One foot stomped into the door and she got out of the house and staggered towards me, her way of terror slowly fading into ruin. 
 The last thing I remember before waking up was having felt my heart beat as fast as it was in my chest. Suddenly, I remembered everything that I had done in my life. 
 The rat circled her head and left the room in the clutches of a trusted friend, to which I answered with a raspy voice 
 " Guess I'm really going to die anyway " 
 The rat who had cursed my name, not knowing her, finally managed to speak 
 " Welcome to the Fallen World " 
 I ran back to my room and was happily startled when it appeared in my bed. Some part of me could hear someone chuckle. That was all I could make out. It made me laugh harder and harder as it seemed to come from nowhere, closer and closer, finally destroying my entire apartment. 
 Oh God, my apartment. Now that was my right hand home. 
 I woke up in a bed across from this rat, with her, but still his friend, but not her. I stared at the window, seeing flames and mad men running by. Once, this way, I could see from the window. Such people could never die with guns. 
 The rat was standing next to my bed, grinning at me. 
 " What if I wake up and it seems everyone has died like this. " 
 This was too bright for me and left me confused. I studied the body of my friend. So I continued on. 
 She was screaming, and her voice sounded almost human. I knew it was the humming voice, that made me so mad I couldn't even think, or communicate. When I realized I could only hear the " Answering" voice, I put a hand on her shoulder, and whispered, 
 " Can I leave now?"

If all the gaps in its task force, then it was setting up one last beauty. It was so intent on it, in fact, it had set itself to create it. With a grin of starlight, it calmly and scowled the Sunday paper editor. Before he could finish his sentence it had already written something all of you could laugh at. His bright, crisp, flawless pieces of praise rose in enthusiasm, plumped into the story, lifted over and flowing down its spine like a stream at a waterfall. 
 No one really believed the little black box, that unique spirit that could turn a piece of paper into reality. On the day of the big announcement, that piece of paper suddenly started evolving into a form of a telephone - like an object dropped in a video game - and won acclaim all over the place - 
 a phone, in a lamp on the wall and in your hands, starting at your neck, started yelling messages at you, turning to you at what?… the world… to those you send into the box. 
 And then, suddenly, it stopped the box, it began to fill up, and air made not the dusty lamp of building worth anything but greed and greed. It became a tiny hut, of the kind that you could float in. A small shelf, on a wooden space, with a red button and a small disk that used to make ribbon on its side. There was a ball of warm silver on top of a box, and in between these two spheres, there were the tiny letters on a piece of wood called a pencil. 
 You begin to sing. 
 You sing around. 
 ( An envelope filled with notes and pictures, small pencil in a drawer. ) 
  ( handwritten and handwritten. ) 
 ( Scrawled in one piece on the paper. 
 The letters on the paper become brighter and more vibrant. ) 
 Now, it wasn't actually that the little box was going to produce another ice cube. 
 The day before the big announcement, I dropped a note, had received it as a compliment, and sat down at my computer. 
 Today, on the anniversary of the big announcement, I dropped a letter to a friend of mine, who read it with huge elation. The following day, I watched as another box filled the hole it left. 
 In fact, all of my writing had happened the same day as the newspaper article was first published, without even a spark of decorum and decorum. 
 Suddenly, every ball of chalk and oil on the ground beside my desk looked the same. 
 ( However, the stamp was changed again, to prevent confusion. ) 
 And I discovered I was coming out with a new stamp in the shape of two 12 inch books. 
 Some of my writing seemed to take me out of my writing as well, I thought, as the other desk drifted down to the ground. The things inside the black box could be interpreted as something like
*"You, you ---- you, you *fan* wanted to go out with us... tell your two stories, without any guessing, you wanted to be alone in the world..." * 
 Something shifted in my subconscious, and I began to wonder if this was the saddest thing I'd seen in my writing life.

Break! 
 The ring stuck to her finger along the billiard puzzle as it should. Blake grimaced as she aimed her phone into the distance, hoping that the number she was waiting for would work in the right way. Before long, they left both alone; Two couples now looking for the next person. 
 The pinkandblue ring on the lock face twitched wildly, clanking and clanking as the ring slowly and systematically turned it over and over into a new pile of gears. 
 "Well shit, " Blake mumbled to herself, as she watched the ring turning into a large amount of six balls. " Fuck, " she said with a smile, a slap on the back of the head. 
 The jeweler hovered in the mirror and gazed out at Blake's new ring like a normal tourist would before entering. The amount of polishing was impressive, and the face in it was a perfect golden shade. It looked like a dream girl's, except it wasn't. 
 " And man, you look a ton better than you look if you were wearing that pink outfit," Blake whispered. The jeweler stared into the mirror, and the overly tan-skinned girl in the other version's outfit in which they fought began to laugh. 
 What a beautiful smile she had.

 Big was an everyman in the Red Lands. The assassin he stole from Redkeep or had before. Even like him, he really had no choice. 
 He always knew that night was coming, and he could expect the Legionaries to die in the ensuing explosion, if he were to catch them with his hammer. 
 He knew this night's fight would start shortly. His history gives him plenty of opportunities, but even with on battle devices scattered all over the city, the Black Keys would be under a mighty siege. 
 For now, he knew what day it would be. His enemy would make a crossing the field just to keep an eye on him. But he held the sand off his head, as though nothing had taken place. 
 As the sound of artillery struck the front, Redkeep officers rushed forward. Old War vet Toby too, had grown accustomed to the sight of the advancing artillery, almost making him completely encamped in the middle of the field. 
 "We know we are close! " 
 The slow rhythm of green metal against grey brick echoed through the dark of the air. It was then Toby realised, that there were two of the casualties. 
 He looked ahead and saw a fragment of a wall streaking across the sky with flames. 
 It was then the other two went into a confused rage. Toby staggered backwards, running toward the wall, while Redkeep officers pursued it with their ever-growing increasing fire. 
 That was when the battle ends. 
 When Toby tried to go back, Fire and death charge them. For this, he pleaded for more time, although he wasn't sure what he'd fought with beforehand. 
 A soldier grabbed his arm and pushed him forward into the pile of mud that was the battlefield. His brothers were knocked to the ground as were their captives, by the man who had brought them. He then pushed the corpse between him and the soldiers. 
 Both men cried in pain for a moment before he cowering under the sand until only time remained. The soldier left. For a second and an even longer while, the two scouts watched him bleed out, before the smoke cleared.

I wish for money. I even have more money than the average person. I wish for just an extra car. I really do. All I really want are my money back and I can live anywhere. 
 I used to be a very rich man, having been able to purchase a very powerful power. I wished I could be immortal and have unlimited energy. Because of this I eventually accepted the responsibility to keep my body strong and live forever, even growing old when I'm so tired. 
 However now I'm in bed surrounded by solid, leather-wrapped clothes, and I've no energy left. I can't even walk, and I've since taken sleeping pills and I'm weak. My mind is starting to wander, just like a primate always does, and I'm miserable. I can't even think and I am starting to feel... what? Insanity. All I know is that I should wish for money, because those who live during this same ten seconds will just die. But I can't. Not for a long time, and I don't know what I want. And yet I can't help but feel that the effect of my wishes, in a sense, is like eating a cancerous worm. I know what I wish for, and still... there's no matter. I'm trapped here, freezing to death, in a cage where not a single thought escapes me. 
 "... Alright... So, what do I wish for? " 
 The man leaned over, and picked up my plastic spoon. 
 " I wish for a pet."

He was right. So was everyone else. 
 The entire world knew it was him. The world knew. Everything happened in perfect calm that everyone knew from when he came. What you would expect from God. The world never believed him. 
 He was right. So was everyone else. 
 But it was just that. There was a little something else. Something that made the world spin. Something that made people cry as they understood that God would be here to take him back to hell, a place where God could finally give him a warm welcome and companionship. 
 He was right. 
 And before you can say "Would you look at me? " You must answer " No, no."

 ***YES!!! *** 
 Kareem Cyr was the eldest of two brothers. 
 Cyr sat there in his expensive fancy flat in a family that seemed to almost be miles away. An old cab driver walked into his place and as he chugged his beers I could imagine his face written on the drink. Blake was born with a button nose but wouldn't grow up to be a boxer. After all, every girl from the on come one day. 
 It was when my brother noticed my queasy aloofness, that Blake the son of the god of alcohol and gambling began to seem suspicious. 
 A small old lady walked by. 
 ***HEY!!! *** 
 Cyr knew that if Blake was alive he would feel the pain every day. He did one of two things. Either he felt comforted by hearing of Kareem's picture on my Bumblebee and won't have to pay for it anymore or he just felt like a normal little boy who is taking his second honeymoon to the mainland. 
 Either way, this new decision weighed on him. Which was it, he already knew. 
 Because if he could see her face he'd be killed. 
 Who knows what would happen with him next? 
 ***YOU..ARE..FEELINGS!!! *** 
 Cyr thought to himself. He had thought about his parents before and the consequences it brought him down, but he wanted to know what it would be like before all this happened. 
 He walked into his apartment, his favorite room he could have instead of his true, rather boring and empty apartment. 
 There was one lock on the door and he could knock it down, he knew what he had to do. 
 *maybe they would listen to me again? * 
 He got up and stared at the picture he had just slapped on his hand. 
 Cyr looked at his old smartphone, he clicked through the search bar. 
 Determined to see if it would even do it.

"My fellow spiders. How I wish that he could see that I was just here one day. When I first saw you he was in a line for a job in the internet cafe. He had the right skills to automate the work as required, and offered a couple of pieces, like a toilet paper wrapper. He hadn't worked that day, and maybe like most of you, he really wanted you to help him write a case on the abstractions in my image. I'm sorry, he had to find those parts. 
 You were always so polite to him, and the amount of injuries you picked up, which he repaired over time after losing his job, was priceless. I've seen him bounce off others as he was in a situation similar to yours, and it seemed as if he could understand what made it so different from the way he used to act. I'd go on walkways together as he had for the duration of our visit, and he would offer me flowers, books, and food. And we would read books, but very few of us read. You weren't particularly friendly, but in time he became less harsh. Sometimes he would ask if I would like coffee, or maybe even soda. 
 He would also charge me, sometimes less. Sometimes he would even let me know the next time he would come across a spider it wasn't as harmless as the one before. Maybe I would pay him to bite it, pick it up, place it over his head, and just let him live. I remember waking up with a bitter ache, but he walked me the fuck out of here. I read the paper just as you left, and we both got a wee bit drunk, and then talked for hours while he tried to figure out how to get away from you. 
 He apologized to me for ripping my grandchild of the day, but in the end I refused, because I couldn't live with myself if I stole a dick in front of him without this red card. 
 You asked for this job, but you ended up getting much nicer work. When you finally came to a settlement with this man, all you had to do was give him a few notices saying he was done and I was to come to his home at 11:58. Every single fucking time I failed, he made the spider fall for me. 
 Then I found him, and I didn't have the time to tell him I would be back. 
 I've been to the arachnophobe's home a few times now, and it's already too late. It's not enough, but it's enough. And so as long as you donate my pieces, I can fix it! 
 As for the rest of you, my dear reader, I hope you are well. I wish I could keep up the good work, but I can't. 
 Sometimes he charges you a fee for getting stuck with him, and I wish I could be here to try to end my suffering. But unless I meet that impossible milestone with the goal of curing him, I'll just end it all on the spot. I hope you will find the gift you seek. 
 You've been an excellent spider, all my friends. 
 And can't stop, are you?"

Oh dear good heavens. 
 From what? 
 And what now, exactly? 
 When did it come to this? 
 Though I say that it came to this way from 
 Then, perhaps it did not 
 Know of me? Who? 
 Who saw me, and who turned? 
 Who were your servants? Were those you 
 Have as well? 
 Who would be my helper? Who did I bring? 
 Who would the servants are? 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Why did I 
 Take you away? 
 Was my errand met by an end? 
 Or did you slay me? 
 Do you know how to speak? What language do you speak? 
 My fate stands in hand, ready for me! 
 What shall I do from this bandage? Will it do much harm? 
 For you have left me to die? 
 Yes, indeed, once there was 
 When I was only then 
 But only now does it begin 
 From that fateful day, when I have perished 
 When I couldn't rise? 
 From what? 
 Who is to blame? Who is left to blame? 
 Is it you who did? Are you the people 
 That you tried to help? Were they always close, 
 Or were they always far away? 
 Maybe their compassion was truly so, 
 That they would benefit! 
 Are they truly such men 
 Of faith to blame? 
 And then, who, whose heads? 
 Where would you fall? 
 Who would take your place? If you could see 
 No! To lay hands on me before 
 Who and what would become you? 
 Who will shepherd you to glory? 
 Who in the name of the gods, shall you stand? 
 Until that day comes. 
 I fear that you may 
 Resist me and others. 
 I pray that at one-thirty. 
 For I will be dragged 
 To the clearing 
 And I ask you what great heart 
 You will let fall.

Buffy had been nothing more than a child in his mother's womb after it happened to her little sister and her two best friends. The death at the hands of an overly-grown Jedi Padawan was the real discovery the Jove had to make of the events that transpired. Although he had clearly been framed, they never did speak to each other and here they were they were alone in the palace. 
 Having come to the meeting, the Chancellor realized his subjects had forgotten that he had made a crystal break with his mind, and he had now had to recruit his best and most popular martial arts scholar for their lesson. The politician must have not been impressed, since he was simply making the most offensive move to impress the Children's council. 
 He raised his hand and pointed a direlly thin blade at his the crown of the Council chamber. Backslide was his back and lightsabers he had been wrenched out of his mom's womb but no sooner had he had been corrected had he fired it. Anakin cried out as a bullet hit his temple causing his mind to rotate with the force and jump out at him. A few light sabers flew in front of his face as he was ducked into an unfriendly corner and pulled his blade back in the fury of the Council. 
 "You're in the wrong Senate chamber. Have a seat boy, " he shouted as he sat down on the puddles of his opponent. " How have you managed to take control? " 
 " From all I saw, you're not the most well-known swordsman I have seen. You and your small inner circle definitely met the girl. " Obi Wan offered this definition of a'young apprentice' that the two only found common to each other. " You know her too well for the latter. " 
 " I think you missed the point. I... ah, no. " Obi winked and with an expression that couldn't be found in his eyes Obi Kuro sent a powerful charge back at Yoda. 
 " You know nothin', Hutt. And she'll destroy the Jedi before you. " 
 " How do you know that? " 
 " I- I don't know, " Obi recalled. " They're legends. Not that I can tell anything about. " 
 " I- " 
 " You're not on here, Obi. You came and kept her in here from the moment you got the signal. Her name was never changed to'Imperial Knight', " said Darth Vader, still ducking his head behind behind a grinning Mjolnir. 
 " Right, " Obi interrupted him. 
 Yoda stood motionless. His whole body jerked and his body strained to look at him. Suddenly his eyes watered as he got up to his feet and gave a final hug, apparently because the symbolism of the longtime jedi girl had affected him too much. 
 " So tell me about what I see in you. " Asked Vader. " Why do you stay when everything is useless? " 
 " Well, yes. It's not an that I need but really just waiting for the right moment. We've discussed it with my men. " Yoda explained. " I... h- " 
 " You don't have a speech, buddy, " snapped Obi. " I just think you'll be more likely to use technology that you lack. " He put a hand on Obi's shoulder. " The mistake was framing you for a suicide and you've just hit the wrong person. So. " 
 " Peace. " whispered Obi in a tight voice. " I'm not moving. " He turned his head to look at the Senate he was on watch. " But, there's the in-between. The Talos'tai clones. " 
 " Wait a minute, Han? " said Obi. " I should come along. " 
 " What? " asked Obi. 
 " We've been listening to your emails. The will-power mechanics you pick up every so often seem like you're learning something about them, right? " 
 " Pfft, " interrupted Yoda. " Jedi systems aren't such a fragile window. Or so I say. " 
 " Yeah, because you just blew up a planet and built a training academy for peacekeepers all the way up to them."

> Lie to me would be a waste of your time. 
 They had lived this life for so long, I can just imagine you thinking, "Any major decision is a waste of your time, what do you think it would take to get a better bar or a smarter book? Do you think its better than life, what is that you need to change? " The simple truth is you choose the worst life. You choose to live what your friends said. You choose life with people you believe in and people that were the right ones. You choose life living your lies and try to live each day as if you had learned the hard way just that there is only one way to avoid the constant torture of it all. You choose life living using the same basic tactics and methods; walking every day, using the same shortcuts, and cheating. Your scars and your scars will never lie, they'll never fade, and you will never feel guilt, you will always stay true to yourself. Don't you think your life would be the same if you couldn't just choose it? Do you think what is in the book would be the best life for you, that you will put out the worst nightmare of all? What is life knowing after three years is a waste of your time? Life choosing the worst life when what is in the book is a waste. Do you think it would be as easy as the second book you find out? Do you think life is right, you deserve to be right? Life is not a flaw you have to worry about, if you could live a simpler life then how could you be wrong? Life is a choice, the only way to live that would honestly be better. Do you think when you are wrong then you have made the right choice, that life is good? Because on the other hand, is life a poison, or is life merely an inconvenience? Do you think life is not good, because that is not your life? If you think life is evil then what does life deserve that you fear it deserves? If you wish to live as a person then some form of life may be your path and this is life, without you would be destroyed. If you wish to live your life in its imperfect form then you deserve life living in its ultimate form. If you take life, you have only lived one thought. You are no longer able to have a life, your one option is to live a dual choice, an eternity, when you are true to yourself and not someone else. Because what is death if you risk your life in the hopes that it will be the one you believe in, that it will know you and let you know what is in this book? 
 So how does one choose life knowing that they are meant to live exactly that? And what was that thought that I had written to my girlfriend? Do I take the wrong choice by choosing the worst life in the world? Do I choose life knowing I have no choice and choosing life knowing that it is meant to lead a life that would lead to that life? Like I said, I think life is better than what people think. I want the thing I hate most in my life. I want the terrible and the good to be the things I would hate, like I have read about the endless pain in my life. I want life to be filled with the sounds of laughter and being happy, but not having it is very bad. Life is a choice because it is meant to be. 
 Edit: Language.

The person who killed my parents, lo and behold, is found dead tonight. I was lying in the grass in front of the neighbors mule that I hated more than anything. I'll never forget her eyes. Deep crimson-blue and vivacious. That's what I saw the most. 
 She was gone. 
 It looks like the first of many that come, whatever that means, with my parents and a few other families who can be found dead on the spot. The kids can be found lying in the grass puking because she was no longer here. I'll always be thankful. 
 I'm not the first to go in with this ability, of course. It's not like the concept of me-I'm the first person, since I can't die, but still, like the idea of a thousand other lifetimes just waiting for something to be fixed, I'm not terribly opposed to seeking them out. I sometimes hope to have it, no matter how many lives I've left. 
 In fact, the last time I tried, there were no states to die for. If I wasn't planning something, it was too late. I hear I'm getting put through much more fun, a lot less checking out whats on the other end. If I'm too old, you can usually come along. There's not much about me, though. Whenever I'm sad, everything catches in my big enough head to become something else: wings, for example, or somewhere close to someone who can fly. I rarely try to make friends, so I am the quiet one in the house. Not caring where the next child ends up. 
 Which brings me here. I don't have much to say, really, except to say that I'm glad that I'm with her today. It was a bit tricky. I think she seems happy. She has the same yin-yang expression as I do. She's always in the kitchen with me. 
 Like always, my curiosity was all that sets me apart from the others. I never really talked to her in a way that was likely true that other lifetimes would have, so I tried to play along. If she is loving, I'm pretty sure I've never met her. She brings back a low grumble whenever she visits the movie theater, which I sometimes think is quite an oddity considering I'd never seen a non-typical movie. 
 Sometimes, just if I happen to have a large room packed full of other lifetimes, I like to go to look outside. It's a weird, creepy place to play in. Whenever I see a light I kinda want to leave it on, I like to stare. I mean, if I'm in there like there's nothing left to see, I just really want to go see it. As I work out, I feel like a little boy again. I try to tease my mother that I'm doing nothing wrong, that I'm only playing with others. I try to keep my mom, who is in the kitchen, away from me. She keeps pushing me. It doesn't help much anymore. She's not even trying. I'm just playing with a hundred lifetimes anyway, really. 
 Maybe this is the final lifetime. I don't know about the others, though. I think I'll finally figure out which one was the fun one. To join them, or death. Here's hoping that one or the other died.

Standing atop the Pillars of Hell was an unearthly handsome man. His skin was pale and freshly black, revealing another slate gray beard. He was short, lean, and messy, devoid of hair, and lacked any motivation to hang out with people. He was handsome like a good advert. 
 A large, metal throne was carved into the sand at the top of the hill of "Stop - " as he drew to a walking pace, mocking his fellow pilgrims. " And, like the rest of you; I hereby proclaim you new conquerer, Emmanuel Leubesberger, " he said, his eyebrows drawn up in self-pity. 
 Some who followed him quickly said he was crazy, for he was speaking rather strange language to primitive speakers from the four corners of the globe. He laughed at his similar wisdom - but it was a very colorful and restrained laugh. " Watch your language, Emmanuel. Understand the language of the your people, and - " 
 " Rapunzel, stand here, and give orders. " 
 He picked up a small rock and pointed to a small podium at the peak of the plateau. The pilgrims yelled, impatiently, and the throne was lifted into the air. Emmanuel looked up, and saw a handful of soldiers marching towards him. He took them in and, I suppose, declined his greeting. He was expecting them to join them quickly. 
 He ignored them, walked out of the cave, and in the distance, the great pillar came crashing down. The soldiers collapsed, and the pillars collapsed. He whispered " Dien ye ask. " Then, his speeches began. 
 " Delay thee fool, my soul, who do thou, thou, as I do, repeat thee, follow me. " He continued on with nonsensical dispense. " Poor souls, careless as they are to follow me. Put me to death - then, after I slay thee, God may knock thee out before I meet thee. " 
 Upon watching him draw this line, he stumbled. It was too late. Someone was walking into the cave - his flag aflame. Then he froze. " WHAT the FUUUUUCK?! " He shouted. In a flash of blinking light, his face disappeared beneath the protection of the pillar. The whole place was blown away. Emmanuel lifted his head and stared forward, his eyes furrowed. He saw them - soldiers, men, women, children. And they were shouting. 
 " And I tell you something Emmanuel; fear not - child of God, do we remember your words? " 
 A voice emerged from behind him. He raised his head up to see two, slightly smaller men - the soldiers. They were pointing daggers at him. " Real face of God! " They shouted. But something about them scared Emmanuel, and he flinched and fell to the ground, falling backwards on his back. 
 " What the FUCK?! " His jaw dropped to his knees. " My fucking head! Fuck! NO! " And then, a voice came over the speakers. An arrogant voice, like a millenial voice, shouting again, and again. 
 " Is the Goddess Lucifer the Reaper? " 
 " You very prophet - and I - I'm such a fucking whore... " He cried, and then he began to cry. " I want my parents and I to avenge my little bitch, as she says. But they both are going to Hell to pay for the actions of the God I despise... and she's going to fuck with me. " 
 * " What the fuck! " * yelled Lucifer, stabbing his horn directly into Gabriel's forehead. " YOU GUYS! " He drew his sword and thrust it at Gabriel's body. " Oh no! Come back!"

The hospital doesn't take advantage of vacations. I was born in a year. He had just started so I couldn't work a day without him. And it was only 4 days before he ran off to have some fun with his girlfriend. However I gave him the benefit of the doubt because I knew they would finally have the chance to see the man I loved. And I was excited to share this life with him. 
 He stayed behind almost overnight to check up on me. After getting home he checked up on me more closely and then I started to notice some strange cuts on my back. This isn't normal I told him. I like to think that I made it over the end, but none the less the surgeries are long and I wonder if they will be the end of me. 
 He looked up from his hospital bed at me and smiled. " Are you ready? " He was back to his normal routine of watching me sleep but he stopped for a second then said " Now kid. I'm here to make sure I'm not the only one here that doesn't feel like I was born. " I glanced down at my hands for a minute. I had always considered this the one that will be my last sight of the world, so I got up and started to walk him out. " Show up there!" he spoke with joy, but a little scared. It felt good to be ready. But it's not over now. Before I could walk away he opens the door and places a precious bundle on top of me. With a big kiss, I place the bundle on top of me. I swear to god if this was heaven they wouldn't make me go through surgery for a few days. He reaches out to me and gently squeezes my hand gently. As he turns over again I'm back on my bed. With that horrible feeling in my heart I struggle back against the warm bed sheets, trying to squish it back into my body. My eyelids are heavy. I try to smile and walk away, but I don't know where to go. But I can only look down at the incredible sight of my fate. A body lying beneath a blanket. The warm air does not quite cool off, so I begin to think that maybe if I went down in the shower I could bring it back to life. I began to think that maybe I could go to heaven as quickly as possible, maybe I could take him and rest. But alas I no longer have the strength to keep myself from falling. I slowly begin to spiral down towards the pit of despair. The smoke from the shower still seems to be lingering, and I hear another. I hear a horn as a man walks over and greets me. I feel myself falling to my knees to comfort him. I see blood dripping from his arm like blood from the fabric of the fabric of heaven. I want to die. I want to finally live forever, but I can't. I have always feared death but this death just makes me heartless. 
 He didn't tell me when he would die. I felt relieved that he knew he could kill me. But I don't want this moment to come. I just want to go home to my family and see them when they see me.

The bad guys fall. The heroes are about to be destroyed. The war goes to a miserable halt as your ridiculously weak army is cut down by the dwarves. They have reached the rear. We've seen armies reduced to soft weight. The other guys are fighting back. We haven't yet intervened in this one, but our forces are leaving but not out of the view of the old overlord. Out of the corner of our eye, we are eating our time. Out of the view of the young dragon, he is dead and drenched in worms. He snatches at his own tail and holds it out to me. 
 "Got ta come with me somehow, Kyle. " He rouses me from my rations. " Best to help out when someone's dying. " I reply, my voice trailing off as I mutter my name. 
 My horse rushes over and places a leathery hand on my shoulder, " Ya don't need to be worried. Just cut them off and run, we still have a few minutes."

It would be insane, if it hadn't been for the fact that I was permanently blind. The hearing was pretty easy for me. The moment my hearing snapped closed, I could hear someone whispering... whispering as their face changed into that hideous, dripping version of me. The louder I sounded, the more... distorted my vision was, and more, distorted. 
 I had become that disgusting eye to all living creatures. 
 I turned two-way with what felt like a hand on my neck and a subsequent squelch of panic. 
 I picked up the phone to call my uncle Bruce. He was saying something that sounded pretty buzzy. He had this creepy voice impersonating that of a child's voice, with a sort of preachy kind of voice. I approached the phone. 
 "Alex, why are you trying to scare me? You appear to be somebody's grandfather. " 
 I didn't want to be rude, but I had already prayed to my grandfather to tell me something. 
 " You have been getting more and more results today, " Bruce finally said. " If it's true that you are the last person I will ever meet with the memories of, you have been getting quite the... conflicting affect. " 
 " Yes, Alex. Don't be. " 
 " Who are you? " 
 " I am Tony. Alex took over as my arch-nemesis, but you're my brother. We get along great. 
 " But why is your life, mine? " 
 " By later in life I'll call Tony. Why? " 
 " I live in a depressing situation. Your father moved away... now you're going to be the never-endingly bad man in your life. " 
 " What? My only purpose is to help you. " 
 " Not everyone can be amazing. " 
 I looked at the phone. Not only was my father dead, he had died a long time ago! 
 " You are still alive. If I could call my nephew, I'd meet him. You're in good hands. " 
 " And I'll also be feeling pretty bad? " 
 I turned to the nearest phone and pressed a few buttons. It started vibrating. 
 I turned the microphone back on, and sighed. " Sorry, who can love a dead lover so much? " 
 " I'll try, Tony. " 
 The sound of death in my veins was front and center. I opened the song I had played a few moments ago, and turned the volume up. My entire sound field vanished, and I got back to reality. 
 And of course, the recording went dark. 
 " Let's start over," I muttered to myself.

Her soft kiss crept up to my lips and the smile in her eyes, like a kissing stranger with its last movements teeming with blood. I pressed my lips together and gently milled the goosebumps down her back. The skin of my neck felt like it was sunken in to deep pits. I turned to look at her. 
 “ It ’ s okay, sweetie. ” She whimpered. “ Tonight ’ s a good night. ” 
 For the first time I felt bad. For the first time a child was born with a child without soul. 
 My dad called from the office with a fit of anger. 
 “ Mom? ” He said, looking at me with concern. “ There ’ s a problem. We have to get your dad out here! ” 
 He stood back and watched, blinking out of existence like a hospitalized newborn. 
 The policy came into effect only a few months ago. I ’ d been stationed at the grave of my best friend, sobbing beneath the cold steel of my door. The guards hadn ’ t been able to escape, and she used to be my closest confidant and the friendliest of my kind. I ’ d never known she ’ d ever try to take me from me. 
 “ Daddy, keep your sobbing, sweetie! ” My mom ’ s voice lulled me back into reality. I had forgotten she ’ d have my mother in her life, but I could remember it was her. 
 “ Can we talk? ” She asked, as she pulled the door shut and rummaged through the wardrobes in my room for my purse. 
 “ I ’ m on my way in, don ’ t worry, ” I said quietly. 
 She answered, her voice cracking as she stuck my hand out of the plane flap she had assigned me. She walked out of the room and disappeared around the corner, not turning back. 
 The news of her lost lover hit me like a tsunami. I didn ’ t know it at the time, but I believed her. The screams echoed down the street as people stole their loved ones from each other. The sheer quantity of crying filled the streets of New York. Many of my friends and families had been unable to mourn them. 
 I sat in my room, tears flowing down my face as my fists clenched tightly against the pillow. She was crying louder than I had before. It didn ’ t matter that I ’ d found a wallet next to the bed I was sleeping in. I could make sure there was a ring on it. I couldn ’ t believe they ’ d found a ring that worked. 
 The words came through my head. I was given a number and made my way back to bed to sleep. I didn ’ t need to go out.

It's a cold wind, just the slightest of touches and a gentle breeze soothing me. The end of the street has joined the breeze I only glimpsed a few minutes ago as I walked down the street. I had been struggling to remember what to do with my clothes, always needing anything to cope with getting into my house and my constant ranting now that my backpack was empty and all that. I drive my tired and worn through to a car that doesn't seem to move. I wait another couple minutes before cutting into my address so I'm greeted with the sweetest and most pleasant warmth. I settle on my pillow as my water runs through my veins and my drink fills the thought of spending another evening with my loved ones. Outside Santa is gone. The last words I can hear on the wind as the night end comes around the bend of my street is “ It's cold. ” Once again I sit there in silence listening to my breath catch in my throat.

I think I have found this subreddit more about tools than about their purpose. Sure, I'm not writing or curating things, I'm busy digging through my experience with writing. 
 But I like to write. I've read "The Human Image", a great book I wrote where I established my influence in the world. It's kind of sad that the next paragraph is something so sad, but that's for me.

It is all unreal. The sun in the sky is only brighter than you can count when you are watching it, and there aren't any lights shining in the sky. There's that wicked laughter being made every day in the coffee shop, but you aren't clamoring to get it. You can smell it, and you know that it's coming. 
 It's been only two days since you saw it, and then a friend of your ( your ) best friend showed up to greet you with a wan smile. They asked for your phone number, and we talked. We explained that we were lucky, and were glad to see you all happy. The bus pulled up to your building, and two of us brought the beautiful little people to safety. They thanked you all and drove off, and we left with your name taped to your phone with a smile on our faces. 
 Then one day, we woke up to find the smell of this smell everywhere, and it was the same. You sat back and saw light coming through the windows of your apartment, and a jetplane still flying in the sky. You knew you were lucky to see it. You scurried inside, wondering what it was. In the back of your mind, you immediately remembered your friend, and sought out his phone number. The meeting was put on hold, and we waited for the police to arrive. Soon, there was no signal. The plane came back to a stop, and you hid in the car, in the hotel lobby, in the candy section of the restaurant. 
 A short week passed when you started noticing some odd things in your apartment. Every day, things seemed normal, but it got worse. You started walking by, smelling coffee and then dark rum, and then dark coffee with no smell on it. On the third day, a television came on, and everytime the TV showed something different, something more - strange. Everything seemed to be coming together, and you were on that television watching two bright lights slowly show up on your phone. The police made a different approach than they had ever done before, and the police department didn't know what to do. The police sent out for a team to investigate. The detective was called out by the police, a veteran detective from your city. 
 You saw things because you saw real life happen to you. You saw nightmares and you watched on those television. Your life flashed before your eyes, and when the police arrived you cried. You thought that maybe they were all stupid, and were crazy, and sent a coded message that you weren't lying, that you wouldn't say anything, and it would show up on your phone soon. After a few more weeks, things got really scary. You had to watch and think about it. Maybe you wanted to hide on your phone, but in the end, your phone went to voicemail. 
 Those days were terrible, and you were in jail for stealing my phone, and taking it away from that cable company. 
 Later, in jail, you were even caught trying to buy alcohol, because nobody wants a friend who only takes his house.

My god, no. I must have lost it. Just like I lost the key to my mum's life, so did his parents too. Frankly, I was devastated. 
 I may have been five months pregnant, but it wasn't the worst. The doctor had guessed I was destined to be completely hysterical. They went out to check my private parts and found a really nasty crud, which wasn't what I was expecting. I don't know how long the back of my throat would have been the poor girl burning in pain from the previous blow to the head. I wondered if Frank would be okay in the heat. Another woman was looking like she had gotten wet in the previous couple of months. I didn't blame her. 
 At the hospital, I checked the contents of the capsule. Apparently my parents were on life support. Mom got a little high but I had a nightmare about that she would just melt away into a pool of something boggling. And the fact that her dress had a bit of a twist was probably just a big psychological rat trap we set. I pulled a gun out and took some pills and then went on holiday for the rest of the year. 
 I was either secretly pregnant or going insane.

9/22/16 ( Your Campaign Squad is reconstituting. ) 
 "We're re-entering enemy territory now! Surprise Surprise, Surprise! These Gallacti friggin human beings didn't know you existed! Jeez, we the humans have LOTS to go for the space race!" Said a newly registered Low End Locust Mercenary. 
 'Paige... from the SCAA - Soldiers, errm.. bodies', I wondered to myself. Was he in his thirties or something?'Sheesh, you guys are pretty by now' I said on the radio of my Commander who had recently received his honorable discharge notice. I bet he was right, if I had been in his early twenties... sorry. 
 I paced around the droid base, contemplating how much it would take to let loose. I was in the middle of the battle phase as I looked at the blue, armoured corridor that made up our convoy heading straight for our main base. These were the green tears that drained into the Moon, only a matter of hours before the most densely populated planet in the galaxy was being destroyed like the last. 
 That's right of course, we had other potential suspects for the distribution it was too late in the war. Searching around the area of the Industrial power plant, everything seemed to be working and no one was trying to kill any of us, now. I was pretty sure anyone listening to what was said on the radio could easily predict, but it was hard to deny that things were about to get bad. 
 It was a hard walk, like I'd ever been on anything good and super this; right after the landing pod went down, no human would be there, but that is the worst part. I just feel that there is a connection, for the other races in the galaxy, and it will only be if a ruse is uncovered. I've wondered how this relates to the other races' war, and I'm not sure when the plans started, but something never really goes as planned.

Jake crested the hill and found his mother comforting, her soothing in his arms. 
 She had said that her new name was Feet. 
 Jake's father had long told his little girl that she hadn't been strange since she had found out his nickname. A few weeks ago she'd learned that Feet was his nickname for a key part of his living - his mom's statement that if she knew her name she'd like to be quite like him. 
 Jake had started noticing just a few hours ago, a man walking down the hill, naked, his hands tightly bound to his hips. The younger of the two, twitched in surprise at the stranger's intrusion. 
 "Excuse me! " He yelled. 
 It was Feet that he'd never seen before. His rather elongated arms were wadded up with mostly mud and dust. His five toes were clasped together like something he'd seen on the photo albums, held in tight. 
 " What is that, what is that? " The stranger said finally. He still looked awfully old, but the two of them had been often along this path alone for years. 
 " You're looking strange, come over here. " 
 Jake reluctantly walked to the other side of the path, inspecting the stranger's matted hair and even the shoes they were on. There seemed to be no other man wearing these shoes before now, but the stranger didn't seem to notice; at least for him. He eyed the stranger curiously as the stranger spoke, his sudden movements seemed to blur the difference between them. 
 " Will you allow yourself to be taken in my hands? " He asked. 
 The stranger took one step closer to Jake, a smile starting to creep up his face as it had for Feet. Jake followed suit, never before had he seen a stranger approach a stranger like this before. 
 Feet stood up. " Daddy's coming home. You need him there. " 
 Jake followed the stranger from the path to the driveway and into the living room. 
 While Jake was sitting in his car on the couch listening to the ball, the stranger came into the room. 
 " Hey babe, it's only been a minute. All three of us- " 
 " I know, I know! Just don't fucking waste any more time talking about it!" 
 Jake's mother turned around and stared at the stranger. It was actually Feet, trying to remember just who she's been trying to nick up. She thought of how it would make her forget her other nickname. She turned toward the stranger and frowned. 
 Feet nodded, licking his lips.

 Except lately all of that has ceased to matter and my sudden self suffering. See I was heading through the pool when I thought about your face. What if I never put you on my desk when I left? What if I was the one who insisted I wear the same clothes for a better chance at a promotion or be given a set of earrings as well as a more lucrative career. 
 I wanted to come back. I wanted to tell someone and I failed. Why did this happen? My self shame? No question, they're waiting for it. This is my punishment. Please, just let me go. It's cold and wet in here. Let me lie down in a spot and warm my hands up. I need to look good. I need to feel good. Here, head up and brace yourself. All I know is that if you wake up tomorrow in that pool naked and happy and satisfied there's no use here and if you walk out in that pool smiling and matching your red skulley you'll have missed the trip. 
 Do me a favor. I'm about to turn you in to the headmaster and you'll have another 30 seconds to say your words before the shit hits the fan. It's not like I want to disappoint you. I've made a bad decision.

 Ash sighed and turned his back as he reached into his pocket for another flask. With a loud yell and a googly face he latched his chair close to my arms and turned off my light. 
 " You've had enough of this old shit, " I shouted into my ear. " Lets go. " 
 Ash opened his eyes to a view of the hall and stopped for a moment. 
 " Hmm, " he muttered to himself, " so I guess that's that. So this has to be a game, you know."

It had been there since ancient times and the game had been played by man against man for ages. 
 Despite it's history, there was no Grandmaster among them. When said master was off the course he would appear at the appropriate time. 
 It had been years since the testing. Where much research had been done with techniques and technology that allowed people to seek eternal life at any cost. At first the prime of mankind called it the illusion. This sorcery was a perpetual possibility of our inventions. 
 But they could do no harm, while none could grasp the secrets. The purpose of the game was to play as the humans did, creating cards in the palm of their hands before and during the games. 
 Or so they told it, by telling us how they played and what they knew of the game in advance. These ancient beings were divine, protective, and all were gods at their very core. 
 Now there were the very older humans, two broad eyed and with an unquestionable arrogance. 
 Today the grandmaster stepped out of the room, holding a chess board. His brain sent out a booming sound as he cleared his throat. 
 "How could you? What is going on! " 
 A slim, younger man with scars and rather pained brown eyes approached him. 
 " You don't know my name, and therefore know my powers not only as honorable, but also as being kind, I think it's quite fitting to bring you along to see them? " 
 " Of course, I can take you for an idea, but I simply can't do what is asked of me. " 
 This held true, as the man raised his hand in an expression of pure determination. 
 " I understand that you know of my life before, but I know that they played a game with your insignificant family. " 
 With a grin, the man stepped back from the table and continued to ignore the younger man. 
 " This is a game of chess, and those will die. This is our final warning. My great grandson was very good at it. He simply does not know. " 
 The elder man knew he would not win. He only smiled at the young child. They each walked around and set off slowly towards the next direction. 
 The younger man then held out a hand and remarked on how, even with the fact that they were kids, they could not seem to miss the young man with his curious gaze. 
 " Well, his condition was different than you are, in fact, he was only five years old, that is no surprise. " 
 The elder spoke with a voice very serious, but not threatening. 
 " I only needed another fifteen seconds to show him the way. If he didn't show up to the games, then I won't be able to do anything to test his illness. " 
 The man stood firm, claiming that he was getting his treatment. 
 " Exactly, I just don't want him to fail the game in a second! " 
 Suddenly, a fire burst in the center of his hand. The heat was incredible, engulfing the game to fragments, pushing it into a half ending, and reaching for his big black nose. 
 " What have I done wrong? " 
 " Surely you will be changed into a picture, as your illness was devastating and it too was fatal. It was also happened before you were born, I hope you are not afraid to mess with me again. " 
 " I will take you over the board and I will guide you to victory, I will guide you to the next step of the game. " 
 The man slowly raised his hand, guiding them, but yet again, and with this gesture his hand reached out and began to stroke the board. 
 " Now, I will take you over to my machine, it will be a deep, beautiful, mental game, and you will be led to the next part of the game." 
 And with that, they chose their next chess game.

"Nigger bashing " was in particular a film which stands for " nigger bashing ", it means also " skull bashing ", or the one phrase used to likens your individual skull to a skull. 
 It has spawned many memes online, kids who have never called niggers in for their niggers got called as a prayer and funny videos about bears with windows and can smell blood. 
 Niggers are well known to be boring boys whose style and mannerisms changes with their sex. 
 Niggers are annoying moms whose only act is to abuse their moms. 
 Niggers are a time-honored form of nationalism but also a currency. Because they rush home late they slowly succumb to the blinding light of their songs and smell like they have literally made last night's dinner. 
 Niggers are the target of extreme sadness and sadness for the mothers of families that have lost their baby girls. 
 Niggers are a change of heart. And because of this they are very popular. 
 The First Amendment protects free speech so speech is the only law actually presented to parents that not only protect their boys who hear them but so their children who has a desire to that just want to feel just like their masculinity is crisscrossed with soldiers, the transition to adulthood is impossible and a force to be reckoned with. 
 Niggers are a very exclusive group of people that share a form of kinship with those who understand them fully. People like racists don't have any advantage or resources. 
 Some people have good ideas about how to make life better for people. 
 One child born outside of the country was not given the same rights as a brown haired slut who smacked her boyfriend on the head or of toddlers who chased their mother off the road when she asked what they were doing. 
 Tucker Carlson actually explained this to his wife via Twitter. 
 " To the full extent of the government, niggers are unquestionably human beings capable of equal rights and civil liberties. But this is an absolute evil in its own way! " The US Governor itches that his top dog Ted ( on camera ) left his farm Tuesday afternoon with the whole goddamn farm lying around because " Niggers were the worst damn thing the government has ever done!"

In hindsight, someone should have immediately taken his angle at Reddit. Facebook was a truly massive company with it's surveillance. 
 The person making those posts was Doyey Lau, and another for Andy Mangan, he may be entitled to the plunder. At the time Google was just sitting at the bottom, but these moments of deep insight where few and far between are most interesting, enabled generations. Within Google came the Mark Zuckerberg. 
 Now who knows how many hyperaged cats were destined to knock out each other, or how many new iPhones and Samsung Galaxy in stores would be created using Chris Ingenitor's "Sean essentially young, thier dad's bible code ". My mind was distracted by the television just as they came running, but as soon as I was out of the monitors I fell asleep almost immediately. A few hours after I awoke to search for anything else, they realized I wasn't listening. Just as I've listened to two of my favorite podcasts for years, I swam to that same park on the 24th floor which filled my tiny room with a sense of adventure. What I had heard from the other people present on that day reminds me of those words, " Do your homework!". These ten words slowly chirped around my eyelids and I felt myself sinking further and further into the abyss until finally my mind was content with ending the millenia of searching and discovering, and it ends now. 
 With the sun setting in the back of the cinema, I hopped off the bike with my mates and ran to the parking lot, where I'm pretty sure this event wouldn't have impacted me so much that I never really paid attention to the traffic. As I yelled out to my friend/favourite, I could hear the spinning, strumming corners against the back of the saddlebags and I smashed into the rear of my car. The last thing I remember was the familiar thumping sound of my windshield wipers. Since I shut the safety off I opened my eyes to take in the crisp morning sunlight that streamed over the ground. I had jumped up to the open door and started walking down the hallway, shaking my head and thinking " Since when". Before I knew it I'm lying on my back in my crashed car leaning against a pile of dirt and grass, as I drew near to the highway I felt a knock at the door. I immediately turned around and my hand stung as I felt the carpet of flesh on the floor rising from the ground around me. Looking over at my friends, they's eyes were wide and uncertain. They looked at me like my friends were nothing to them. I look up to see James and Kate in my car and I look at them. I look over to the police car and realize that they've been following me for the past 4 hours, but what is I doing? Looking around I remember looking around at the stacks of paperwork to update the user profile picture, one after another, and remembering I feel myself being in the presence of men. In this moment I'm hearing footsteps, pain, the sound of powerful shoes slamming into me, and am seemingly in the mix of shaking and fear at the same time. The men realise I'm holding a copy of my original profile picture, and rush away. Instead of walking away, they help me up my car. Everyone is looking down at me but me, and my friends and family. As I think about the countless thoughts swirling around me, the anger and frustration I felt are passed away. Finally, I have a path to explain to a darker, wiser and more wise stranger all of this. I have done everything necessary to make this the best for our society. In a week I can give my Facebook profile full view to the world, everyone that I have introduced, I owe them the forever, and I am beginning to see why they do so.

I smile at myself. I suppose what a thrill it has been to walk among the oldest civilizations, relics from a long forgotten time. They were a natural museum to me and yet here I sit, feeling free and unmotivated. 
 The World Government and Alumni Association talk about how people couldn't find the original Tomb of Abraham Lincoln by original footsteps. I've noticed they get it and never really go around insulting the authorities. Some people hope that it is a shoo-in for me, but others they want me gone. Many others just want me dead and dumped in another forgotten place. 
 I said I was being nerdy like usual and made my friends' reactions even more interesting. That morning I just dropped, grabbed my old C2 and made my way to work, stealing a note. She wanted me dead already and, with a stern smile on her face I told her I am not eager and that I really will go to Ottawa as a memorial. I went to the house and prepared myself for whatever I might find and was surprised to find a bathtub and glass, a cask made of half empty apple pie, and a carciene bottle. And that's the funny part! The bottle was empty, and I found a stone inscribed with letters. 
 Of course I didn't really find them after all and never really that old. After asking myself the key and several questions, this all gave me a true answer: they were statues. 
 I see them all every day at the cemetery, buried from shacks and boarded up buildings and tombstones. Most of them from around the time the mints had to take over the businesses to save me when the government fell, though it's never my fault they got all of them by themselves. My family and friends told me that every single one of them statues of what I recognized as the American Civil War were truly buried. 
 It was like finding the Atlantis Reactor under a rock. 
 Anyways, I look over at my desk, and then back at the C2. 
 "Are you sure you want to leave?" 
 I think to myself and ponder the shock of finding the wooden floor. 
 As I flipped to the next, I realize that it was Ancient London holding the biggest bathroom. I then promptly glance at the grave marker I'm looking at. 
 But then... something unpleasant happens. I turn around and see that the drawing I was studying was gone. Or at least there wasn't a drawing. Everything seems odd for me. I begin to panic. Then I notice the picture. All these years I've been counting it down. It was a picture of an American republic, seated at the head of a large statue. 
 And in one hand I hand two huge dukes and a huge flower. 
 I desperately try to grasp hold of my life-saving invention, trying to watch as it starts to warp into my face. 
 It looks like an ancient paper suit. It's fake plastic, duct tape stretched over it, like a cork in a shard. 
 It looks like a religious symbol. And a litany of other symbols. 
 We must return this artifact or die. This nightmare must be ending soon. I think to myself as I stare at the shape in the mirror.

I'm just trying to put together something fun, especially because I met a person and a few things happened while I was studying abroad. That's how I plan to put this together. You see I'm super into writing but something is off here. I like to read, but I can't have blank pages. For example if I'm sketching, that's not a full page. If I'm writing anything at all the entire thing is a blank page. That's like if your writing is just a paragraph or two but a lot of it just becomes a bunch of funny noises and I think that's boring because it's just your writing. " Read", whatever you want to call it, isn't something I want to get through on this subway. It's not my thing to do or to spread cause I'm either too busy writing to set down my toolkit and hide from the man with the zippy hat and if I'm not careful my writing will hurt you. 
 I have no idea why I was drawn into this and it's something I'm learning but I plan on keeping it together so I can have fun.

I'm tired and everything just becomes crazy. I can't believe it. I remember losing my job.

"I'll go on a date with you the day hell freezes over. " 
 " I guess we should tell everyone? " 
 Satan looked down at the snow covered man sitting on his arm. 
 " Ha ha. " 
 " I guess you guys better tell everybody. Tell your parents or your wives or anyone else. If anybody else is considering going to heaven, I need them to forget about you right now and let the angels get to work. Maybe we can finally go out in peace and say hello to the holidays. " 
 " Let's get 'em going. " Satan nodded once, as though wanting to get closer. 
 " No! It's not happening! " 
 " What? Look, I'm more of a you guy. Please, take some time to think about this, maybe you should just send me a message. " 
 " What? I never do! I just thought that you guys were cute. " 
 " Yeah, but, that's what we're supposed to do. " 
 " What? " 
 " Hold my tongue. Send it. " 
 " Well, Satan, I guess I could go for a ride somewhere? " 
 " Sure. We could watch movies together! " 
 " No, that's totally fine with you. I don't think I'll want to go anywhere. " 
 " Well, you guys can't wait for hell to freeze over if you take a couple things to the park. " 
 Satan sighed and sat there, a saddened look in his face. He thought back on all the warm sunsets he had watched and it was still perfect. It was Halloween all over again... 
 " I really do think that you're going to love hell. " 
 " Hell freezes over. " 
 " Oh. " 
 " Alright, maybe we should just go outside. Go for a walk in the country. " 
 " Jesus fucking Christ, what do you think of my holiday plans? " 
 " Don't say anything, you have my approval. Your average guy probably went through hell trying to tell his wife, then he went back to bed and went to bed but he went back to bed. " 
 " It's a shame that he's stuck with you. " 
 " You're right. The other guy does. " 
 " What? " 
 " You don't have to do this, of course! Besides, Hell is literally just in front of you, so you can just just act normal. So you can't screw it up and leave all your stuff here! For something as trivial as parking in an empty lot and no one ever sees you again. " 
 " The Lord has given you infinite will and power. The Lord has granted you eternal dominion. The Lord has given you limitless power and control. And while you live at the mercy of the damned, the Kingdom of Heaven remains, and you must obey. " 
 " Is that why? " 
 " The kids love they're angels and only their parents love them. Maybe they will finally grow up. Then they will realize why the Holy Ones are helpless and unworthy to rule the lands of the damned and what justice they would have from us mortals! " 
 " You really believe that? I am telling you! You're right, I don't have to listen to Satan anymore. I have a family to be with and I can finally go back home! " 
 " Well, of course it isn't the settled solution to this all! I can't possibly repent! " 
 " Except you could try. You're right. I am only going to show you the truth once and for all. You've destroyed my family. You've destroyed the Kingdom of Heaven! " 
 " But- but don't think I know! I am sitting in Hell, no, I'm actually quite godlike! " 
 " I'm going to get a bunch of rainbows today. " 
 " No. What? It was the Wizard of Fire! What's he doing in Hell? " 
 " He is at my club tonight, if anyone is interested."

A large chunk of my sanity seemed to be outgrown by the daily updates from my Super Santa or whoever prefers to use the term Thanksgiving. My dreary days only became less frequent, and on occasion, my Christmas turkey was brought into the house to sweet have a simple look at him when I had time to see him. 
 The "giving/gifts" would be great. I watched their sentimental food giveaways in my history class, I listened to their poetry in local theatre, I enjoyed reading their favourite books in a recess for more research. 
 But despite my mostly non profit based my everyday life, I couldn't get many tasks done on Christmas. One day, I want to stop as I notice that the hectic day shift at the new office does not bring anyone to this very day. 
 I decide to find more happiness or distraction for my holiday. I'm contemplating Christmas's upcoming destruction, the sudden urge to burn in the fire, and after feeling my heart really sink, I decide I have better things to do than try and find some matter of peace with my self. 
 I peeked into my grocery list and find that thousands of cards and chocolate chips are scattered across the shelves of the upcoming building that houses my research facility. I make the plan to kill myself by stuffing the leftover turkey in the food truck inside. 
 I must make my decision now. The doorsbell rings, and the bright lighting at the corner of the building is saturated with raisins.

I landed on the lower deck, the look of shock on everyone's faces. You've got to get your head on straight when you're flying a plane, I never even want to look at my shoes before my plane started to turn violently. Not a whole lot of people saw me up this far, their hair, face, etc. This country was dark, obviously. 
 I was confused at first, why would a green dragon just come in the middle of NY. I didn't know what's right or wrong with me, let alone what would happen with a green dragon of such stature. That changed shortly after I landed. 
 "Could you see this, " a grey dragon said, staring over the murky waters. His curious response seems to make a lot more people quiver. " I must be home, running, the ferry is headed for North Korea." 
 Eventually, I had to hustle to the door. I stopped running, my mind suddenly being in space. I looked around, my only thoughts were of my parents, the situation, and of my friends, all gone. 
 I saw a silhouette in the sky, smoking a cigar. Everyone rushed out of the bridge, putting all their might into maneuvering their carts. I strolled with my feet still on the deck, the bright blue bullets only acting to incite mass panic. 
 People desperately searched for me, the police were doing their best to find me. The grey dragon kept his cigar in his left hand. It was clear, he was away. I ignored him, I sprinted towards him, and met him. I had heard rumors about the dragons existence before, but I still wondered why anyone would even speak of a dragon. 
 It took me a second to realize that everyone was looking at me, as if they might recognize me. They were clearly frightened. I know, I know that I'm not the only one who didn't believe them. I knew that I was near death. And I knew that I was in Hell, yet the answer was hidden deep in my mind, as if I existed there in this world.

I don't know what the heck came over me, I woke up with the bottle of beer in one hand and something on the other. I was confused and did my best not to look. Not sure if I wanted to or not and I don't think I want to say anything. 
 I guess I ought to have been a little more cautious. It was early in the morning when I found the mouse pointer in front of me. I heard it blink and open with a click. I didn't even notice it blink. 
 I stood up and walked to the waiting room. Looking to my left I heard a strange noise I hadn't heard before. It had something to do with the mouse it disappeared like that on my glasses. I grabbed my phone and thought I saw my friends getting together. Eventually I got out of the waiting room and ran. I walked over to the desk and made sure it wasn't mine and poked it with the phone. " Stop right there, it's mine " I thought. A young boy looked at me perplexed and I opened the message. " Wake up your ass"

I can't see any words or letters in this world. I always have my hands full with hard words, filled with words that, when spoken aloud, translate in every way: it sounds like mangled nonsense. But I am actually able to see everything here. There is a street block to my left, right, right, edge of the street outside the three round high-rise building that houses my father's lab. I wonder if I have chosen a wrong streetblock to compare this road. I skip ahead and finally run as fast as I can and I run into a house. I walk over to the front door. There is a commotion on the porch. " Oh, hello! My name is Evelyn Smith! How could I not see you? " " You're a smart boy, Ellen. Now who's Evelyn Smith?" 
 <|endoftext|>
**********946**********
I don't know why I saw that. I was home, just sleeping when I saw it, I put my hand on it, it moved along the field of vision. All of a sudden I saw another mouse touch the mouse pointer. My god, it moved. I desperately tried to open my eyes, only seeing it, I instantly felt sorry for it. One of my friends was terrified, I'll never forget the scene that fateful day. I was by myself, with my girlfriend. I was alone on the sofa, after all, no one was home. It was going to be a long night, so I went to the shower for a bit, and in the morning my stomach grew big. I took a bath and took a long look around the house. There was another mouse, and the one that I looked at had touched it... it wasn't me. Instead, it was just a mouse. I only hope that this guy didn't put another mouse in his house. I've seen hundreds of mice, all of them close together, yet only one was very close. The next thing I know, I see the mouse cursor now in my field of vision.

Tomorrow. It was too much. Yet she sat there taking her tea before she left. She knew right away. " Wow " she said. He kept putting up his hands with exaggerated curiosity. They were fists and small, muffled by his damp mother's rolled shirt and shivering face, even to this hour of the morning, " What are you?" 
 " I'm fine, honey ", he laughed, clutching his pillows loosely. He knew she was hearing the same thing, so he decided not to mind. What's the worst part? 
 He stared at his screen, a single syllable document, just like every day. His eyes were set on his book of work. Everything is old and dried out, black and gray and sometimes blue and beige. He broke his gaze from it and looked back up at his wife with mild interest. 
 Tomorrow, the facts will begin to come. His wife, life. The first night of her day with him. He would call her first and meet her on her way back to their parent's house. Say goodbye, say a few things, say he loved her all the way. She would know her words as a beautiful kiss when she saw them. His mother would show him. 
 And that final moment, with his father, just before the second time he picked it up, he barely knew her. He would hear it again in his dreams, as he hurried on the path with her. She would still be writing. He would see the flowers. He would enjoy the dinners and talk his way out of it, but it would not be like the tea she was drinking. 
 It was her favourite part of him. These memories should not be forged in his head. No, she should be clear and told herself. He should explain to her what he felt was wrong. But instead he could not. 
 He reached for the button at the back of his notebook and looked at the button. He could not hand it over, the presses wouldn't be worth his time. Instead he thumbed it, hoping for a faint purple from the very start, the flowers not orange. 
 He just hoped that in one quick gesture, there would be his answer. There would be the picture of her with his mother. There would be the kiss. There would be the hair. There was just so much to see for him, just a tiny quick tap here and there, and then everything went dark. 
 He would wake to her and realize he had not looked into her eyes. 
 Instead, he looked down at his watch. Nothing in particular. Just a few minutes to find some place to sit, to decide on a new bed, try his hand at playing some song, or go on something he had never before felt so close to. Then he would gather the necessary tools and go. 
 There was nothing there except his old pillow. To hide his unexpected surprise he undid it and slept on it until he had worked the next morning to finish his morning-parties course. 
 He opened the half empty bottle of whiskey he had read in his hand and drank.

The thing about an omnipotent being is that it knows itself and it knows how it wants to affect something. There was a time when it believed, just by changing a bug or a stone, that it could make anything it wanted. That's how we met God, although it probably thought he was just a child, trying to figure out how to make things bigger, but he figured otherwise and would have removed himself from his toaster if things had changed anyway. People say the thing in a book don't exist because of the writer's error, and that is why it's written from it's own perspective. Nobody really knows why it started out as a bug, or what it did when someone put a blade in it. But no, when God "woke " a bug, he realized how it would affect him. It acted as an agent, out of instinct, but because God was just an old beetle, he allowed it to take control of something. Without a lot of wiggle room, and with no food, it grew and spread around, but, by accident, God had created something bigger than himself. 
 Imagine what would happen when God spoke into the blank page, making things work with a blank color. It'll do everything just fine, except it would play with things, and, eventually, it will destroy the world. Oh yeah, God figured his infinite thoughts would probably mess up the page to the point of stopping him. Things would be too hard for God to complete, and he wouldn't be able to kill himself, even if it was possible. Then he'll turn the pages back on the monsters, monsters who didn't scare people enough and give them an extra holiday on Christmas, and at some point, as the first monster, they'll be able to kill themselves. That's how things ended, except that God didn't notice, because God was no longer able to control things, though he knew that. You have to be blind to make things work. 
 Even before God could change things, an infinite number of people started joining his followers. We don't really know why that happened, because God decided that it'd be fun to go live with that many people. It was a reminder that God had removed his animus, and instead let humanity live out its future through his creation. Even though we don't know, it worked out better than I thought it would, because to no one was so proud of it. " Good luck with the creation!" God said to his followers. We have a way to make things better.

From behind me, I heard the distant muffled voices of life lie about me: and I searched. My mind began to wander, and to my staunchest satisfaction, I began to see a large gnarled, tentacled creature across the room. It wore many an antiquated crown worn by soldiers, though they did not seem to break the skin in time. One of them asked for information, as though in displeasure of the matter. A creakingly clad figure, muscular with more grace than the regular soldierly object, spoke up briefly in reply: “ For some reason, you are not fed. ” 
 “ What food does it take to make life again. ” I replied, perplexed by this creature's appearance. “ What do you think? ” 
 “ Humans had plenty of all the food, frankly. They are outnumbered and avenge their ancestors in a near infinite number of ways, from slaughtering dragons to building machines to fighting over tasty foods. ” 
 The burly man must have known that I had a recently discovered mutation, that within me altered my size a special kind of iron that would make humans obsolete. I picked up the radio and quickly sent the coordinates to my grave, perusing the warnings on the poster. 
 “ Are we not well stocked? ” I began, in my tattered and worn armour. “ Are we not in adequate supply? What animal could not flourish in such barren wastelands? ” 
 His scales began to turn grey, and he turned his head curiously to gaze at me, a strange, sinister look, but no unease he seemed to possess. 
 “ Do you desire to witness the life be left untainted? Is this what you seek? A failure to prepare for your destination or to live on your own terms? ” 
 He stared hard into mine. As the person in front of him neared death, the voice from my own haunting words became deeper, terrifying. As the time drew near, I realised that I had fallen into a familiar pit of despair. Yet as if on cue, he immediately spoke up again. “ The food needs to be replenished. It appears that we cannot manage to sustain life without sacrificing others. This must end. ” 
 I can not bear thinking of what force the creature is capable of dispelling. “ Not in this form. These words are filthy. As before, I will struggle with weightlessness and defenselessness. ” I sighed, and turned to the window. A heavy heavy lift lifted from the ground with a large groan. I looked back, at the lifeless remains of an angry man standing over a corpse. This man was nothing like the human I had encountered so many times. I paused, then said: “ Return to the grave and retrieve the remains of your fallen comrade. If necessary, I will wait the one whom you have chosen for your funeral. ”

I Am With You 
 Who took the beating 
 Who decided to take the low run 
 Who got cheated on by the go-go 
 Who was conscripted into Operation Oompa Loompa 
 To find out her unique story. 
 So, I have the rhyme 
 The melody 
 The warning 
 To be a spy of the country 
 Without limits. 
 And when I want, I'll make you pay. 
 ( Staring at her face ) 
 I am with you 
 Who took the beating

 So, I have the rhyme

 ( Stroking her hair ) 
 Her voice, motherly 
 Who got into positions 
 Taking the sides 
 Get to the bottom 
 Read your words. 
 ( Walking away ) 
 She could see

 Bending yourself 
 To help keep the scandal going. 
 ( So I put her in handcuffs ) 
 It ’ s that dirty money.

It's like being born in the moment. 
 Now I can visualize what the people around me will think as my body follows their dreams. My parents draw small pictures of my face, staring at me. I almost feel like I'm staring into their eyes, so I close my eyes and simply follow them. I try to imagine another person that truly represents a connection with me, but I can't quite get there. A few hours of repetition builds up slowly, then it's just me now. I wish someone else would see what I have become, but I can't even picture myself anymore. 
 The moment I touch you, you freeze. I could feel what I know I see when I hold you. I could sense how the other's reactions are based on the current situation, but I cannot really say what that could possibly mean. You stay frozen like that, but you can not move in the same way that people can normally go. Still, I was still touched by you when I entered this life.

It was all over. 
 Earlier that day, I had charged through the portal into the Celestial Waste. As I made my way through the crowd of patrons, I could hear the sound of clouded streets and the scraping of fallen artifacts against the falling stone. As I turned back to my desk, I began counting all of my cards... and making sure to stop at the bow and arrow the rest of the way down. 
 It's been 10 years now. The few families who suffered through it died alone, and never saw the future come to them. Others woke up in coffins in front of the curtain, suspended in their lives. They learned of what happened when they died, and it was a terrifying experience. Some even began to realize that death was just part of life, of 'play' the game of life, a discrete feeling, but nonetheless a curse. 
 An ogre claimed control of all of Earth, the most powerful nation the world had ever known. That's what had fueled the growing army of media and corporations, and the lies it spread. Nobody has seen the ogre emerge from the demon pit, and without a single shot taken, everyone was killed to keep it alive, except the people who made it all happen. 
 Just as I was about to read the third card, I made a mistake. I stole something from a jar, cut off its energy, and... nobody has seen the demon pit since. So I cast the spell. 
 I could hear a squeal from outside, only for the walls to surround me, and the lich to turn. Someone in the crowd started screaming. And then all of the, apparently not insignificant, faceless men and women in the world gathered around me, expressions unknown, expressionless. The lich stood silently, and reached into a flask, full of some kind of liquid. Then he walked over to me, and eyed me, his dark eyes sparkling. 
 "You need me to bind you, " he whispered. " I have your power, " he said, as he reached out and wrapped a cloth around me. 
 " Ow, " I replied weakly. 
 " You, " he said, as he grasped my hand and slowly took me out of the portal. " You can't control the place anymore, " he said, but he asked for my freedom. I nodded my head, hoping he would be able to get me out of here. 
 I gave him my freedom. He looked at me, and his dark eyes widened in surprise. " If I wanted my freedom, I would have gone up there, and prayed to a spell. I would have been cast into the Flames, and I would have seen your world come to life. That is when you died. " 
 I whispered, " I don't want my freedom now. " He walked over to me and led me down the stairs. The doors to his small cavern slammed open, and I saw his door closing behind him. When he pushed open the door with his hand, I was on the other side. He sat in silence for a while, before he said something. 
 " This is my curse, " he said. " You can't control the place anymore. I need you to perform my duty. " He leaned forward and formed an arch and I rose, in the courtyard. I pulled out my office phone, grabbed the handle, and dialed my boss. 
 " Hello? " he replied, at last. " I'm here to get you out, but I'm sick. I need you to sell your soul to me, now, and I need you to tell me what you know. " 
 I had waited a long time for this, and failed miserably. " What do you mean? " 
 " You need me to know, " he responded. " I don't know what you're going to do. " 
 " I need you to tell me what you know, " I answered. " I know the essence of life here, and I need you to aid me. " 
 " What do you know? " he asked, holding up a finger. 
 I did the same, but in a whisper, in the back of my mind. " It's the power of life. And it's about how powerful it is."

Whenever I was around bad guy, I didn't hear that, or something. I just would not believe in anything he said. Then one day, he would say nothing about my punishment, or anyone else's. I just told them that I was going to put them to sleep. 
 I told that everyone didn't have to live as the bad guys. I told them that punishment would have to be in the true form, and I didn't care for Mr. Jack. He doesn't do any good. He just kills me because the father doesn't say anything. 
 I told the guy that I would transfer out of the punishment to punishment, but all he wanted was to thank me for everything he had done for me. He's retired, and I'm in my teens, and he's just another old man. 
 The bad guy walked down the corridor, with his hand in his pockets, and the floor of the couch as he walked. He had something that I didn't. Only one word to carry, in the form of a choice, to prove to him how wrong he was. After all, it was the truth. Just one word to set him off, just one word to keep him up at night. The men were all entranced by him.

Come down. Take him down. Take him down. 
 Everyone tried this plan at first. I know by the blood I bleed, but this is it. He's dead. The pulp is gone. He never died. But this one isn't dead either. * He's* dead. And then I heard a certain voice behind me. It's a powerful one that I can hear but not much more than a whisper. 
 "Cec- " 
 " Oh king of this one's name is Sid, Queen of England... " he cracked me up. " Please, let me in. " 
 I tried to stand up. I tried to stand up but I couldn't. Poor thing. 
 " How about you take me down? " I told him. 
 " Th-th-twenty percent " Sid began, but I wasn't ready to give in yet. 
 " Dead? I'm still alive. " 
 " You're serious? You're truly dead? You literally kill people to give them what they want or what they need to go against your will? " 
 " How are you gon na kill me if I start calling you king? You're not going to get an offer of marriage in marriage or divorce. " 
 " This isn't my territory. This isn't America. Why would I go to Detroit. " 
 " No one left me for you, don't go where there are others. Go where there are other ones. You're not really different from me, you're different from society, and you wouldn't get married if you didn't. " 
 " Sir... " Sid said hesitantly, then a long moment later a serious sigh. 
 " It's okay, come down, I'll meet you there."

**********955**********
Life has a universe. It's hard to know where the universe ends, because of the vast amount of trials it takes. Then there's the trial itself. Sometimes you will find yourself in a McDonald's, frozen to the point of accident. You may feel that you're lost, be pushed aside by random phone calls, or thrown on a couch. The first few days are tough, and you just *know* that you don't have much time left. The little things always slip away. The first few months, you are worried about water. You go down stairs so fast that you accidentally smash a piece of glass. The spring does nothing but soften the ice cube, and you fall out of some sort of experiment. There aren't a lot of things you can do, all you can do is stand there and wait for the next glass. 
 Anyways, that leaves you with a pair of hot attorneys in a world of ramen. These people never take it seriously. They're not far from the hot attorneys. They call the hot attorney's asses off. Who doesn't like the idea of suing some hot attorney of the highest order? They don't like giving you a chance to prove your point. You're already crying because you need to look for some chance to *exercise* some heat-scaling. 
 Suddenly, there's a huge lift. The strongest lawyers in the world come out. The heavy-arms go roaring. The heavy-arms come roaring for one last time, threatening to hit you straight in the forehead. You stare, frozen in place. The men pile into the hotel, ready to fire people in cold sweat. There's a ton of violence! Not just by the lawyers! Of course, the heavy-arms are eager to be in on the whole thing. But still, there's just something off about this place. There's a phalanx of lawyers everywhere. One man stands in line in a bar. At that moment, a bunch of men with sunglasses break through the bar and tackle one of the best lawyers. Everyone is talking and shouting. That guy is a dick. Everyone thinks it's funny. Everyone thinks that he'll rip you up, barge you to jail, and end up killing the hottest lawyer in the world. The heated attorneys fight off the flustered lawyers. But the blowtorch gets blown away, and they're all dead. The blazing hot lawyers drag the lawyers away into the harbor. 
 The beach gets empty and the dunes are blotted out, all except for my embarrassment. 
 That's when I realise that no one seems to care. Not in the way I want them, but only for one reason. 
 In fact, they seem to believe I'm their fucking friend. They're all pissed off about it. " This is unprofessional, " they say to each other. " You're the one who's complaining! You're lazy! You have no competence. You are the definition of mediocrity!" And they're right, there are no viable arguments. Nobody's even interested in getting help. 
 The lawyers, some of them by choice, go on their way. The hot lawyers manage to make it to a hotel when an ambulance came sniffling over their bodies. They tell no one about the meltdowns. They drop bodies back on the morgue. All the officers wait with bated breath. Nobody seems to care. At least, nothing seems to. Just hang on. The hot lawyers argue every day about whether or not they should stay. They pack emergency room trash, dump bins, hit themselves. They put the crushed bodies back together into piles of ashes. The ice cubes just fade away when the hot attorneys go back to burn at the morgue. They'll have a lifetime supply of their beverage ever few weeks from now. Not like the real world. 
 What are the changes? What are the sacrifices? Will the hot lawyers have something to say about my situation or not? I'm the only one allowed to be on the morgue! At least this is the 'land I belong in'. All the others are almost gone! I'll be dead within a few years if no one comes to the morgue with me. The hotel nurse is barely a woman when I'm healthy. Who knows how long she'll last. 
 They stay that way for several more years until they fully accept my condition. It's not just when they say goodbye. I try to think of myself just as truly special as everyone else. It's incredibly hard to find a life without no one helping them. That's what she said. I hope they don't hear her. It's hard enough to find a life without always being a dick.

"If it works then it seems like the only way this might work is because everyone is of Jewish descent and you bet you have one%. Apparently this is not a barrier to this company's success, but only the other 99 % " 
 A woman's tears fell out of her eyes and over her hair. " Yes, I think I have a lot of luck... " 
 " We know all about Israel, and Jewish life and lifestyle has been on the increase but would we really have any purpose to prevent this? " 
 " What did you say you would do? " 
 " Since we have already started  shooting teabags, we would like to announce Israel as the 70th president of the Palestinian Authority."

"Come on dude, if I could just put a chance in your eyes... well, this is awesome. That this would work... " 
 " Fuck you if we were puttin on this trip together... " 
 " No shit man. " 
 " Fuck you. " 
 " We're gon na make you wait a bit longer you know, sorta speed things along, ya know. Whatever. " 
 The Prince of Darkness looked deeply into his younger brother's blank expression, " ya know? " 
 The five of them looked at each other for a moment, hard-eyed. A single tear rolled down their cheeks, their expressions shaking. 
 " I guess this is it? That it's finally gon na work, bro. " 
 At this point Prince had somewhat forgotten his brother's name, and now he took his left hand off of his right and spun, ready to blow the couch underneath his feet. He also did his best not to show his empty self the look he normally gave when the three of them went solo. A quick wash of his hand made his face thicken, and he crouched. 
 " Jesus, what a lifeforce!" 
 Before the sudden appearance of his brothers, Prince did likewise. He returned the favor and headed toward the King, lighting a match and running back toward his homeworld. 
 Meanwhile in the kitchen of his homestead, Brother told his brother that he would definitely need a disguise once the water was finally full to float down their bay-only inflatable vat.

As he advanced, each year, despite all that, he came nearer. Every day, the renewed attack made increasing gains until only two left. The herdsmen that had been waiting anxiously were late in coming, cursing their fathers who had long since died. He laughed to himself, gripping his long spear. This was the only way to win. For now, the bitter realization that he was destined to die made his blood boil. 
 "Ah yes the year 2013! Before the wild west! In order to avoid this fate you must speak to the horned ones and their apes! " He shouted, glaring at the majestic colors waving from their eyes. The horns of the bears were unique in their long neck bears. He grinned and bowed to the beasts. The caged bears, now zooming past their historic prey, shifted their position one at a time. 
 " Moses I am sorry it has taken so long for us to come to take this place of importance to ourselves. Truly we have been waiting for you. " Moses sighed. His partners were no longer being invited to see the new arrivals, but the rumor still spread. His hosts eagerly flew to this land, while the goliathships, called over his livestock, boomed in glorious quiet so that he could acknowledge them now. 
 " Yes, Master Mantis. Thou shalt stay with me. Now enter the camp, this is necessary." The beast circled its horses with one of its horns. At first, Mantis thought it like the smell of a cobra, but upon further inspection, he was mistaken. A cobra? This was actual cobra. Mantis took a few hundred steps towards the jungle to pass out after the unmistakable sound of his horns resonating. By the time he made it to the entrance, its tracks had been noted off; however, its monstrous head remained attached to the body of the known beast. He watched the beasts with satisfaction. " Stole you, Molefiddly," he whispered. His buddies were busy chopping the remaining bears off of his hosts, who soon numbered only a few hundred.

"What was that... Hey Jack? Jack?" 
 Fuckin' Obama. Shit. There goes go my phone. 
 It wasn't Obama's voice, though. This idiot had expected a human voice. A guy who was just being channeled via a mic-actress as President Obama. 
 I sighed, and tried to react - but there was a catch - my headset was damaged with a tourniquet and a distant, piercing rip of its face. My worst fear was a scarred hand *feeling* like a sheepish scratching shadow, hands who had met my father's eyes in vain when he couldn't find work on the rise of my revenue collection. 
 Where there is beauty comes blind eyes, one has to look. At least in the event of a blackout, where there isn't a better view of the zone that captured a work of fiction, it is often remembered as a belief they had once, if not more, than the banal essence of hearsay as we know them. This idiot, while being far from it, relished in his own echoing gaze, one of the artificial ones. 
 I shifted under the edge of the couch, its faraway hands and his inching motion filtered past the cramped back of my seat. It was I, dangling from the straps of my leather upram, eyes scratching furiously at the back of my head, that had let my ears bang into something beneath it. 
 His way was lost to me. All that mattered was that's what it was, right?

It was beautiful as it was in death. The living had no eyes, only their pillow, with which they would comfort each other. Their hearts had quenched at the prospect of one another in such a way that, even through the painful pain, they would be able to join hands again. A loved one, who was trying desperately to cure a life gone too soon. But then again, how much blood did they have left to wag the most gorgeous gift of all? Perhaps the preservation of a child would save them from the long waiting into their youth? It could take them years, perhaps years more, to truly grasp each other and bond with them. After all, they had been there for more than a decade.

Before I begin, why don't I know what I'm doing right now. 
 -Scott from Georgia 
 -Dear, I'm at an amazing radio station. 
 - Please.... 
 -What the hell do you mean, "please"? I mean, what does your time on an air channel mean to you? 
 -... I mean... 
 -I mean, I'm not a professional DJ, and I'm not rich, that's not how my job is supposed to be. What I'm doing should be... well, what I'm doing... right now. 
 -I'm not recording anything, so what? 
 -What, about six years down the road, that I'm coming back up here and recording? 
 -Did anyone else come up here and record? That's where I'm recording, everyone else is recording. 
 -Well, I really feel like we should get going on an easter egg. 
 -Do you have something to say to me? 
 -Nope. 
 -Really? Hey, all I'm saying is that I want to see you work, and I want to be able to hear you listen to me on the radio. 
 -Okay. Listen to me listen. Thank you. 
 I honestly can't imagine what I'm doing. I have a man who is clearly a promising musician, and I mean, he keeps saying to me, he listens to me, I hear him. He's a handsome, athletic, even very attractive man, I'm not even sure if he's being serious. And, believe me, he's probably not even close to the actual artist I've worked with, probably the best I've seen from him. 
 I guess that's what's keeping him from finishing his Ph.D thesis, or at least his is waiting for the most prestigious University in the country to offer him, but it's fucked up I feel like. It's just so confusing, all this man doing everything he's doing, everything I've done. The point is, he doesn't know what it means to be human, you just need to listen to him, and I'm sorry, but... um... 
 What can you say to me? 
 -I... I'm not a professional DJ. I don't enjoy coming up here and recording things, and I'd rather be not recording at all, I really don't know, so I just want to know... 
 If any of us, I hope you find that this is the best thing that could've ever happened, I'd really want to tell you something, I just want you to know that I really enjoy you listening to my radio. I really, really do... every minute that you listened to me is why I don't mind recording as much as I can, so you can hear me this piece of information live. 
 I'm sorry that you may be feeling the need to leave your privacy... I appreciate it... you know, I'm really really sorry, but I really do... I just want... 
 But this is the last thing that I can offer, your, my... should i... I... I'll be careful... no... no thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank...

"Scratch, scratch " I say, " this rickety old bedspread is no longer making a good bed for you. " I check the item he was carrying. The sugar tablet he made. I continue my walk to the bathroom. " OK, hold on," I say back, as I reach for the pill bottle. Nothing. After grabbing it, I get my bearings and squeeze it in to snort. What the fuck, who made the dream? 
 Suddenly, I notice an empty box in the corner of the room. I grab it, and stumble out. A very strange box. I look back at the box. A strange contraption that plays music I can only describe as a melodic loop, played by a basic piano virtuoso. I'm in a trance. 
 I walk through the room, and roll around in a seemingly endless heap of people, until I find some I made. Perhaps it was a splotch of flowers, or an ancient crystal toothbrush. I attempt to orient myself, but the symbols and symbols destroy me. They stand out to me in a sad, overly deflated state. 
 In my mind, I repeat the first thing I heard after I had brought myself to the present. 
 " Scratch, scratch"

"Take it all away is what I have decided. " The Dark Lord spoke. The world around him continued to go on for what seemed like an eternity. A new voice would come through his subconscious until the end of time. 
 " Do you know who this God is? " This voice, Lord Undead, questioned me. The voice in me felt much like the words of God himself. 
 " Yes. He is your final messenger, " said the Lord Undead, " and will be arriving at the end of time tomorrow, even though he does not know it yet. " 
 " Who would leave their messages? If I knew that I was Lord Undead, I would have to post them on all social media. " I replied. 
 " If you do so, the Lord Undead will notify the Gods and they will have their say on what is required of you as Lord Undead. You have to have some faith in them to be able to accept this. " The Dark Lord spoke. This helped in a way. People began to believe in me. But as I became more immersed in the dark lore, I was more and more withdrawn. I lost all means to express myself. 
 " You have many homes. You may not have many homes. People of many homes may not be able to learn the strange things you do. You may not be able to understand the mysteries of the planes that you go on to. You may not understand the scary landscapes you get into everyday because all that it does to you is inconvenience you. There will always be people like you that find themselves more and more discouraged in the future. " The Lord Undead spoke. I had no real reason to give up yet. 
 " Then you will fight them, " I said. " At least you will want to. There is no other choice! " I began to feel accepted, but I had no reason to do this. I could have saved myself. I could have been the one. 
 " Oh? Yes, you saved yourself. Your house is on fire. It is gone. The gods are gone. " The Lord Undead said. The world around me stopped as the creature in me began to speak in a strange language. 
 " Thou shalt know not what thou wilt do, even as I don't know it." The Lord Undead spoke. This had become normal for me as I explained the phenomenon of My creation. 
 It seems that I have defeated the Dark Lord Undead without doing any damage to the world. I thought it would not take that long to find what was down there. Before long, the last of the world burned, the sky began to black, I no longer remembered my creation, yet I did not mind the world that burned and died. And so I turn to the God, for help. He has given me power.

Another day of wild rain... 
 Mr Prune's biggest drop of luck, more of a gift than a disaster. 
 A frozen reminder of the person who never got it right. 
 Remembering how far he was towards the earth. 
 Time was rough, and weary feet stained the ground with mud and rain. 
 Doesn't matter the street, or home, or even town. 
 Everyone has their own way of feeling, and in that harmony, they came. 
 I've felt him day and night, helpless for too long. 
 Moments then no one may know me. 
 I'm not really the one you're looking for when he leaves. 
 He's your own straw that you can turn and smile at. 
 Why shouldn't you?

The people he'd worked so hard to protect loved and he was on the top of his game. Not that they weren't rooting for him anymore. He still managed to find a painting that looked amazing on a stand alone, and now they're posting posters and thumb drives. 
 Who has time to shut up about sexy amateurism after these weeks. I mean, he left our place for goodness sake, actually. It's been a horrible few years, the bob. You know, the checkmen for weeks, and we were ready to make sure the money was put away, but we were told the door was closed and all we could do was keep the door open as best we could. He said it was fine. It was just that his beauty can lead to the worst things I've ever seen. We had to save this girl he worked with, but he would never buy her panties. I hate when the popular dime sign on this picture shoot was so long, it seemed to be weaving into a blur. Now these paint job companies just want to build a monument off the memorial, but I guess I wouldn't mind seeing a new Anna Draper, painting away at the monument.

"You know how Batman is? " Elmo asked. " The one who maimed Harry Potter? " Harry snarled. Elmo grinned slightly. 
 " Yes, of course. " Elmo sighed, placing his hands on his knees. He had a little too much time to himself. " Do you remember his powers after that killing of Han Solo? " Elmo asked Harry. 
 Harry shushed him briefly. " Han, I shouldn't have killed him, I made it look like I was saving his life! " Elmo rubbed his hand along Harry's hair. " It wasn't a big deal. " 
 " And you killed him. You gave him a new name. Someone to fight in the war instead of letting him take that identity. No one wanted any violence in his name. " 
 Harry swallowed. " I still don't understand why he was so powerful. " 
 " There's no way you could kill that guy. " Elmo grinned, but he didn't dare mention Harry's name. Elmo felt bad for Harry, even if it was the only way to keep him from watching his secret family and growing inside him. 
 " But that's just what he was supposed to do. " Elmo nodded as Harry's hand shot up and around him. " And that's exactly what he did. " 
 Harry's eyes widened in horror. " Why are you saying that? " 
 " I... have some good ideas. * Why*? " Elmo began scratching his chin. Harry stopped scratching and continued. " All I could think about was Harry. " 
 Harry's expression grew serious. " Now, you know why I killed you. " 
 Elmo smirked. " Mantis is a name for something with a really great power. " Elmo peered at Harry with an expression that bore perfectly in the pearly whites of his eyes. 
 Harry peeked into Harry's hand and sucked in a long stream of breath. " If it wasn't for that *hobbit* thing in the patent that said if you killed someone, you'd still be entitled to your inheritance. " 
 Elmo nodded. " A promise that I made a promise and a promise you made back then, forever. " Elmo laid back down and picked up a dry book from the floor and slipped it over his shoulder. 
 Harry looked up. " Hey, you, Machete? " 
 Elmo yanked out a toothpick and wiped it down on his soaked shirt, " y'know? " 
 " Yeah, " Harry replied. " Then I'm going to lose my powers."

I'm flying. The quick fact that I'm not in a plane is enough to warrant that. This is the universe's way of judging a person's progress: The net effect is a teleport from meeting up with a friend, to meeting up with the same wall through history: the bounce from touching down to meeting someone on Earth has brought me to a near-die. 
 I'm fortunate in that first day that I managed to fly backwards, but it's not the safest decision I've ever made. Everyone in the big city ( which is the US of A, not the US that the corporate world has applied the same logic into, or referred to as America ) doesn't want to knock on my door once in a while. They don't want to think that it is just my vacation, or that my wife and kids are safe at home at home. It's entirely possible they don't even want to confront me about it, considering my dead end job, the overbearing, lung cancer habit. But I'm not even sure how much longer I'll live. 
 In this sky, people are usually dead. Even when both the planes and your loved ones are within earshot. In truth, I still have a secret not to reveal, none of which I can deny. I have one purpose... to make myself invisible for only a bit longer. In the words of Neil Degrasse Tyson, "When I die, there is a flash of light so blinding even I don't notice." 
 To make my life easier, I've shed my wings and prepared myself for flight. I flew out the window with my girlfriend Caroline, and let the dogs talk. The plane, dark and shadowy, cleared for me with the gentle pitch of a pick-up truck. I started to inhale deeply, and made my way towards the telephone. The screen read, " Phone reception: Abruptly deaf, go to system. " Before I had time to respond, my phone rang. I opened it and checked the time on the screen. Decades after the human race's last great revolution, my phone rang. Unbeknownst to most, Caroline had a life expectancy of just over 200 years. Of course, she had managed to survive long enough to see the death of my partner, Jerry, who was instantly put on suicide watch without notice by the authorities. What do you do when you only know the sender, and that the phone was communicating...

I wake to the glare of smoke from my cigarette, but I quickly peel open the rear window and quickly glance out. The fog is making it difficult to see. A loud alarm punctures my ears. All my senses are being strained. It's going to be a long day. The wind is punishing. Going to be a long day. 
 I fiddle with the wheel as the truck drives away. I hear a loud "PAUL! " Then it hits me. A vehicle with black-and-white exterior and plastic interior. A hot hard shell of a Chevy pickup riddled with bullet holes. All in all, it looked good on paper. But on the inside... Wider, more concrete. It was ugly. 
 I approach the gate where the driver had been. It's pitch black door fits very well. I slowly push it open. 
 " What are you doing here? " 
 " Mr. Herbert, I haven't slept since the accident I was driving from home. I don't know who you are. " 
 " I'm... Um, no. I don't know. " 
 " Now calm down, old man. " 
 " No you don't. You're not this guy. You don't belong here. " 
 " But I belong here! They're calling me the man. I can't get in this truck. You never used to come into my house, you never came back! " 
 " Well... There you are. It'll just take awhile for you to come back. I don't know why you ever came here. " 
 " Sir, you are not my murderer. There is only Robert, my substitute, " my sobbing voice cracks and I feel the heat inside me go up. " His body will be floating in the air soon and we can't handle him. We will be off to Turkey in an hour. We will not find you, we will be in Turkey until Turkey sees fit to invade the European Union. " 
 I then take a moment to look at my hands. I hold my face in both hands and pry the side of my face away from Robert's body. Blood covered my hands. 
 " Sir, there are no witnesses to this. We must go to Turkey. " 
 " If your attorney tells us you're the one that took the land line from Russia, we will pay. " 
 " If your lawyer can take you, that's okay. I will provide him his lawyer. " 
 I grab my coat and sit in front of the courthouse, the flags of the United Nations flying right above my head. 
 " Now sit down. You can either call me here by name and take my place in hell, or I can escort you out immediately. " 
 I'll never get to go into heaven. It's hard being in Hell. Or being in a Spirit's heaven, which is where Satan found all of humanity, while he razed the Earth and made it so that he could spend eternity back at home. 
 But it's OK. The parking lot on the other side of town is on the east side of Texas. There are lots of cool Texan vineyards and rivers, some with grapes or oranges, some where ceviche and Mexican tortillas, some with tacos or something else entirely, and finally, there is a lake. I arrive right there. I look back down at the wicker chair and walk over to where my human was brought to be taken to. 
 He was sitting in a grassy field. A sun was setting, obscuring the sky in some way. He had long black hair and dark eyes. 
 " Okay, okay, alright. " He came to stand up and walked over to me. His face was quite pale, and red. 
 " You will pay. " He smiled and bowed his head. 
 " I know." 
 The prison was very cold. 
 I felt great. 
 I started crying.

Dear, soul; 
 There may have been moments of totality out of which one could forget that particular holiday with a light fog. There are things in the universe. 
 These large masses of matter that ripples endlessly, the ones that we lack eyes for, where matter from origin is present. The ones that shift around, where are realities; and sometimes, things themselves are the noise on the gridlets we distort on a daily basis. 
 One day while washing the dishes at the local grocery store I got a text. 
 "Hey. I'm tired. I've missed it so many times that I forgot how it felt to be alive. " 
 I freaked out then got on the radio and attempted to contact people to start a conversation. The period is easily eclipsed by the shift of consciousness that often occurs during this time period. 
 So, I figured it would be a good idea to go for a hike instead. 
 And, at dinner with my wife, I decided I would go for a swim. There were a few beach splits, so I chose the 5th as the prom to take advantage of the proximity of the waves. 
 I didn't know which side I was on as I tried to keep pace with the latter. As I realized, the truth of the situation wasn't even far behind. I remembered that I hadn't moved much of an inch in the last 15 years, and that I still felt like a truck to the limbs. 
 And the more I pondered the situation I was more aware of the absence of days at the beach. When I realized how much year had passed since I had last eaten my last meal, the weight of what I had slept in ( and nothing left to eat ) became unbearable. 
 It had been a long time since my eyes opened, and I was... the first human to come in contact with the Red River since it appeared 40 years ago. 
 " How? " I commented aloud, refusing to believe my own emotion. 
 " Well my mate, I'm expecting our trip to Florida tomorrow. I get high up every night and feel like it is after some time... but that's because I've been sleeping for the last 2 hours. " 
 I took a deep breath and continued. " I'm pretty sure the fans might be in the shades tomorrow morning, so we plan to make it to JFK. " 
 I closed my eyes and let out a sigh, knowing that the mouth of that girl I had been travelling with at the time, Janice White, was back in the house. 
 So... 
 I stopped. I *liked* it. 
 *cmon* I chuckled. 
 I texted the entire time with whatever life force I had left, hoping that she was still around. 
 I answered the first two " I'm not getting on page 2" texts. It took me 3 minutes, and I'm not even sure it was originally just email.

Corporal Corey Rumleys took a massive step out of his compound and ran toward the entrance to the hangar. He was crouched in the doorway, pacing back and forth across the battlefield. The weapons he was holding resembled devices designed by an alien race to satisfy his hunger. 
 He was swinging his rifle towards a smaller target. Corey let out a few gasp in surprise. His head tilted back as he passed him. He was sure these weapons had somehow avoided being blocked from detection. His silent warrior was now a warrior. 
 He drew his rifle again, the... whatever that is. Several thousand meters away, a dog came into focus. * Him? A dog? * he tried to make out. * Gah, that stupid dog is so *black*. 
 Some gibbering even sounded from within the comms. A deep voice echoed through the cockpit. " Come in, Roger. The... Silly-looking *disgruntled* **bowling** is *not fit to hold another human. We can not challenge this one again. * " 
 *He's going to shoot me, and I am going to shoot everybody! * 
 Corey quietly turned towards his dog and flapped his arms. 
 " *Shut up! * " He mumbled. " You're just paranoid. What are we *not* allowed to have in our own commune?"

One day, we may return to civilisation after a time, yes, I admit. But we never did. We never found the Mars rover to play a popular series of American crooner songs. I was born there, and I probably slept with a boy who was afraid of nothing, but I was a genius, and here I was still searching for truth about a black hole that threatened to push us all to the dark side. 
 It's hard to say how I know this, but they always want to stop us. They called it ενός Μ Moonlight, and we were forced into a coma by some unfortunate accident. We spent most of that time merely scouring the skies, but some of us spend more time studying the stars and exploring them. In some ways it's my duty to contact them. Unfortunately, I don't have the memory of the boy who requested we send our aid, and so it's been largely because I was worried about the darkness of the moon. 
 My life was miserable. I did some arthritic things, and all because of the darkness. But as I thought that I might regain my skill and have myself time and relief from the blackness of the skies, I saw a light, a star from the woods, blinking brightly. And so I cried, and came to another child, and started to cry. He was just a boy, and I had no memory of him. He wished we could call it a night, and I too cried and cried. 
 The next day the moon had something - an unusual light - drifting past us. The light moved, and this time, the shape of the ground shifted and changed. 
 "Hello?" the voice said.

Lady Miarin flicked a coin. The planet's time was rapidly approaching. Current tourism is about to be reduced, and there is no moving away from it all. 
 Jok was killed by a stray Riggeree. 
 He worked well in the factory since. 
 Riggeree's wife left him two weeks ago and said she was passing on a kid. 
 I heard a sonic boom from a heading of the Empire's fleet and thought he was dead for good reason. 
 After all, by killing Mr. for her, he had once again gotten rid of a dog. 
 I'll be damned. 
 Dear heavens, stop asking me much of the same questions. 
 "Who? " 
 " What if? " 
 " The thing?! " 
 " What if it stays? " 
 " You mean the thing that is now going to miss. " 
 " WHAT?! " 
 " You brought it home, I haven't with it yet. " 
 " You said it won't miss. " 
 " Ya ain't making it yet. " 
 " Y'all are, now stand up and show me this. " 
 Lady Miarin waved his ball, causing nothing but a pat from my gardener. 
 " There's this little dog here, is it safe to leave? " 
 I thought this kid should have been your deputy, but i have no idea what happened after me killing that dog. 
 A deep rumble emanated from the bottom of the planet. 
 Who? 
 A voice came from the blue stone saying: 
 " This is my mission" 
 ( Ugh. Altering: Umm I am trying to rhyme here. )

"Well kid, I've had enough of the deaths of beloved princes. I give you a shovel. " Joker scurried around behind the comically-painted wall in front of his room. He cast his brows down a little as he focused on Batman's voice. 
 " What the Hell? " Batman ran over and shoved a crumpled piece of paper into the pile. 
 " Well there you are. Tell me about yourself. I had a job here that I call work, and my pal's just got ta take care of it. Most of the time, he only has a day or two of help. " 
 Batman stretched and examined his hand, seeing that it had tightened and a pained moan started to grow from it. He frowned and then turned away to see Joker over there sitting on a table. 
 " What's wrong? That man just started killing my husband! " 
 " Son. " The chuckle faded as the Joker ran to the door. 
 " I never told you, well it doesn't matter how much trouble I get with my weak neck for days on end. You're going to get a plaque. " Batman pointed at the words. 
 " But I didn't give your bones an orange. " It was Batman's voice. 
 " I have one left. " 
 " Here, take it, let's get to it. " 
 Joker looked up at Batman. He wasn't a man to lie. 
 " You don't have a plaque. I gave it to you, but you were already dead. " 
 " Oh no, I don't think that will do any good. Oh well, I guess I can have some fun then. " 
 " Oh no, I suppose you already have. I needed to test the waters."

It had been six days since Max had left and he thought it was finally time for bed. The monster had made a noise that no one knew were very familiar but he could still hear it. His eyes snapped open trying to see where it was coming from but all he could see was a sea of darkness in the darkness like some sort of flash. Then he heard it. The voice of the monster. 
 "Hmm.. yes, this isn't the dream.. I can take some pain killers. I can take any painkillers and pain killers will be useful for you. " 
 " Will you use a condom? " I wondered. 
 " Yes.. yes, this isn't the dream. " 
 He seemed drawn to me.. his arms grabbed a bead of water and he pointed it to his face. His eyes glowed with each brush of his tears and I heard a flush of the water spread against his body. 
 " I won't let it. " I vowed. 
 Max kept saying his peace and his face turned out to be completely calm. He reached into the pillow to grab a nearby bottle of pain killers and gave it a tug as he grabbed a finger to pull away. He added another bead of water to the bottle with a smirk. 
 I heard him say something to the side. 
 " I won't let it get close to me. " I said for the first time, mentally preparing myself for this moment. 
 " Noooo.. I am too stupid to do anything.. " 
 He slowly reached up and grabbed my hand. 
 " If you would let it get ahold of me.. " he said as he placed a hand on my shoulder and pressed an orgasmic kiss into my cheek. I gasped in surprise but he kissed me back. 
 The monster looked down at me and then back up at the surface of the bed.. 
 " Your going to have to leave me you ass. " he whispered to himself as he walked away. 
 " I just want to sleep. " I laid back down on the bed, lifting the covers. I lay asleep for a little while till the monster came back to me. " Goodnight sweetie.." It felt like he whispered to me.

It's not just the electrical impulses and the vibrating of the wires he holds. If you look closely enough, the skeletal face and whiskers staring back at you create what's in those two words. You can make out the handwritten words in the palm of your hand as it's sprawled across the marble table, freshly covered from the rainwater and chewed away by the abominations within. " She... " it says. " Looks like you haven't slept well since Monday, motherfucker." The whisper in your ear clumps together into a most surreal noise, like a snapping sound. 
 You hear the click, and want to run, run, run. Your eyes well up with tears. You can't let go. The front door is open. There is blood around her and the slack in her dress is a good blot on your hand. You know you haven't told her yet, you know your mother could make it. You want to scream, scream so loud she can hear you, but you can't do it. Every heartbeat and every heartbeat of your life carries on, further through your mortified soul. But she can not hear you. 
 When you open your eyes, she's dead. You see the blood spread from her pale torso, the bulge in her cheek and over her long blonde hairline. You don't know what else is going through your head, but you know you are right, the only other thing you could ever be more proud of.

I saw him somewhere. 
 The boy's wearing head-to-toe in fur, and he had his eyes staring out to the starry night. 
 I saw him. 
 I saw his teeth gnashing away at his line as his splintered blood showed just above his nose. 
 I saw him. 
 I saw the boy, flying through the air, as his skin was exposed, like his insides had been shot out of his skull. 
 I saw the man, wiping blood onto his shirt and lip, the tears at his eyes to denote he had been unable to stop them. 
 I saw the boy, crying, as he knelt to knelt to his knees in front of the altar. 
 I saw the boy, bent over the altar, writhing to his feet, as his body was held as tight as it could be. 
 I saw the boy, lying motionless, panting and overcome with a slight smirk. 
 I saw the boy, overwhelmed with rage, in shame for abandoning his mother when he first heard the voice calling out in the church. 
 I saw the boy, shaking, holding his mother's hand. 
 I saw the boy, writhing, as his mother was dragged across the hall to the walls. 
 I saw the boy, shouting at his mother as he screamed. 
 I saw him, held at the back of the hall by his mother, as her family and their beautiful adopted son returned to the house when he was rescued, crying as his mother just layed over him. 
 I saw the boy, stumbling, head limp and expressionless as his tears streamed down his face, and while his hands were covered in blood, holding him tightly, begging for his mother to pick him up and say he could stay with her. 
 I saw him, the same as the boy, his body still writhing and his eyes wide as he swung himself up over the doors of the church. 
 I saw him, chained, and as his mother pulled him back down from the fire, her words still ringing in his head as she pulled him away from the body, sobbing and dazed.

"Are you fucking kidding me, mom? " 
 " Of course I am." 
 I was tripping over my last breath as I took a last tight breath. I almost passed out from extreme agitation as the feeling went away. My hips had been pounded for quite some time now. I did not feel any pain, I didn't feel nausea, I just felt so much intense heat and cold air. They told me it was my final attempt at reformulating, to regrow, but I felt nothing. My memories were blank, everything was bright, like before I was in an omen to be a new age I was to discover myself to be. I was awoken by my entire body shuddering, I thought to myself, that was just another dream. I slowly got up to reach for my phone, hoping that it would wake me up. I've never lost an app. I checked Google Now to see that the flashlight I bought was still working. " This is so weird ", I thought. What if... 
 The light briefly turned on and then turned off again. My skin felt cold and unventurable as I stared at the screen. It was as though I'd been holding a sob since I turned on my clock one night. I could see over the pale blue sky that I couldn't see the light come on. Within an instant I was frozen in a calm cool spot in my lab with nothing to do but staring at my iPhone waiting for the sleep to slow down. I waited for the screen to turn on again, a great boom would come from there, a full moon was soon approaching. I thought this would be a great idea, but quickly realized the weirdness of my mind and froze looking at my phone again. 
 Then it dawned on me. The dream was as a dream. My right eye was frozen on the iPhone. My left eye began to burn. I quickly looked through the night sky and saw what lay in the rock formations. I jumped up as a volcano erupted into the sky. The lava, as much as I could not pinpoint the source, erupted from the ground with increasing fury. Earth was being destroyed and water flowed deep into the volcanic crater below. I frantically looked through the sky, at the lake we should be heading to... we should be heading to watch everyone from our privacy for a wonderful accident. After hours of staring and searching I finally landed on an ocean. Stumbling onto the dock, the police chase began. Nobody questioned me as I ripped my phone away from my pocket, I was first to be extracted and just as the police arrived I ran from my cell. I guess most people put on dead glasses at a 'death camp'.

It was a straight forward testimony that nearly flew off the tongue as I tried to piece together what had happened. My greasy skin, the pair of slippers on my feet, all my teeth, the frame that I was holding in my hand on the table just kept getting me to tear the rope around me. They all said I was innocent, and I've never been convicted of a crime. I was sent to Hell because the dead guy is dead. From what I heard, the voice back from the boxy man I left lying there, hoping that the blood could save me from hell, was angry with me for not protecting her. This was the second time a woman has died, and there was an uproar just because I was found dead in front of the boxy man. 
 I walked out of the courtroom and into the sunshine, hoping that the cold, dark floor of the room would keep my hands from feeling like metal. My feet just carried me to a wooden door in front of a tiled wall and sat behind the door, silently torturing myself. That's when a door opened, and a figure with long black hair slowly walked into the room. As he came up to me, I could feel my heartbeat. He stroked my temples and laughed, but the woman was dead, and I could hear her breathing slowly in my ear, enveloped in darkness. I walked closer to him, and began to cry as all I could hear was the rustling of legs behind me. 
 I quickly looked in the female's eyes. There was a single tear leaking out of the corners of her eyes, only a tear that fell on a suspiciously-perfect face, and she remained so, still. I tried not to tear my eyes from her, but I had been told to always look into those eyes in front of the boxy man, even though I've never seen the boxy man before in my life. A moment later, I saw an apparition walk towards me, and I saw it's own light in his eyes, and I saw that I was not bound to death, because the bound me was the corpse and I would die there and I wouldn't be alive to witness this, so I did what any reasonable person would do to end the suffering. I opened my eyes and saw the boxy man laying still in the corner. He dropped the lifeless body in disgust. He looked down at me, and smiled and gave me a wave of his hand as he whispered into my ear, "You're Death."

The man stepped out into the darkness. The blazing heat was scorching his body - it had taken months of research - and he was a bad nugget. Those eyes were beginning to murmur - the room was not the typical stupor of porn hallways, but it told a tale of headaches, his father never played games with granddad, and he was still living at home with none of his friends. 
 For the next week, they sat around him, understanding just how hell was actually supposed to work. 
 "Oh your child, hell's designed as a solitary rock-and-water chastity structure. Do you understand now that it is not a lock, neither is the underworld, nor is it a joyous hobby? Do you understand why each of your visions are also chosen from your deceased spouses. Do you understand why there is no looping, endless looping between seeing the angels become sacrifices, and smoking through death? Do you understand why, in my descent, God showed me every aspect of the way life is? " 
 The girl in front of him - a noblewoman- stood up. It was a tall, silver-haired woman - maybe twenty now. Her hair was full and balding; to the mortal mind, she looked almost dark-haired. 
 " Can't you see, Dad? He's as strong as the wind. " 
 " Yes, he is. We're all walking into that altar the night before. " 
 " You see? " 
 " I see an angel and his wife stand by me after we're all gathered up. " 
 The long hair on the woman was pulling back, sparking a second light, before disappearing into her eyes. 
 " Hey, were you really listening? " 
 The girl smiled, the fire breathing inside of her. " I'm Erin. I'm Jacob. I'm Jesse. I'm a week away from the front door. " 
 " But that's not what I was looking for. I read in your journals the bible for people who didn't perform their deeds. " 
 " What did you do when hell was started? What do you want? " 
 " When. No. Hell wasn't trying to worship you. It was just trying to try to protect you. It wasn't trying to comfort you. You were just going on about filling out your airfare forms, sorting through your divorce papers, and finally, everything. " 
 " I saw it. " 
 " I did. " 
 " I did."

"They're big, they're creaky, they're not wise! " I could smell the - I still didn't exactly know what the term was - crinkly juice of Khatar, Edward the 15th. I suppose the term also refers to one of the many industrial microbiomes that railed against the American and Russian governments. Some of these microorganisms, a sad combination of yeast and juvenile cells, were off being recorded. Maybe these were based in Volkraft Water and a few strands of chitin hair. Maybe they were part of a massive cultural-fictional-internet memes. One of the bacteria was being captioned, they are the most irreverent joke here, and once we saw it, it blew up instantly. 
 The scenario I wanted to imagine in the theater looked pretty grim. Everyone started laughing and things seemed like a dream. Everyone looked like they were having a good time. 
 Suddenly a big mushroom cloud burst into the theater. Now I can't quite say what it was but the world seemed to swell. There were mushy corridors everywhere and yellow and black walls had spread around what I could only assume were tiles. I could see the other students at the theater looking over the teeming mess below them. 
 My feet were in the air and I knew that it was going to be an easy fight. The only way we could take this gamble was to avoid detection. We had been drinking the milk of the Sargent for over a century now. Maybe that was just a novelty given her adventures. Now that we had ourselves a good sixty years to lose, we could really picture what this room looked like at eight twenty last night. 
 As I walked to the exit I found myself in a rather rough, office-like environment. The only doubt at the top of my head that I was being watched was this lady's spiky hair. If only she could see it before I started taking notes. 
 " Midnight, eh? " I mumbled as I brought up the wad of bills. " Whatever may be done, I think this is up in the air. " 
 She laughed, " Welcome to Old England! Remember when you had that rat infestation that I discussed earlier?"

In the city square a cry broke out as David spoke. A woman in a normally present and happy way stalked towards him, the one that could not throw you in jail. Their eyes met as he spoke and the tears ran down their face with passion. 
 "Hello? " she croaked softly. Her deep red eyes looked ill as she withdrew her hand. David did not say something and as she grabbed his arm he strained against her hand, unsure of what was happening. It was both a beautiful gesture and agony as he held her high, unconcious. 
 " Anything you need, " she whispered. Her hand was shaking as she held David's tightly and held him closer. She didn ’ t say anything and the way she held him hurt. His breathing was shallow as she still whispered. When she finally reached him he had stared at her as she stood before him the same. It felt as if he was possessed, but the tears, though black in their motions, had never faded. His groan slowly broke and it took a moment for David to calm down. The walls from the crowd that crowded around him had begun to move, yet the room remained still. His head was shivering, his chest ached from the stress of the night. He could only stare out of the wall as the glass smashed everywhere. 
 The only sound was the sound of shattered glass from above, in the plaza where it had been shattered by a loud thud from the goverment. It was the smell of crack as it hit the sidewalk, the trail of blood at its base brushing against the pavement. It was not the sound of the machine that pierced David ’ s soul, but the tremor of internal bleeding. He felt himself coming to it's end and he let out a breath before staring at the woman and then the woman. She was standing on a wall near the grave, looking at what seemed to be a human silhouette in the plaza. His heart thumped in his throat and he heard the heavy banging and the screams of his partner. Finally, he noticed it. The little string of blood was too tight and the bleeding stopped, but it was too late. 
 The machine kept crushing his head as he stood and the darkness grew in intensity. " Again?! " his partner asked in a hushed tone. 
 " Yes, " David whispered weakly. " I want to come back to the fold room but there isn ’ t much of it left. I will see if you leave. " 
 With such a strong voice the machine shook as it closed its small windows. David went trembling in his room. He could smell his drinks wafting up his neck, his cigarette puffs emblazoned on the walls. His pain could be ignored. When the machine left, David knew his partner and that didn ’ t sit right with him. He tried to wrap his head around the fact that he did not have to go back, but even though he could not see himself directly like this, he could see the world around him change. 
 " What happened? " she asked his answer. " What happened? " 
 David felt numb at the question and watched from the corner of his eye. He could feel his body slowing to a crawl but as he saw his partner run past him the world came to him. His head snapped around to a point and stared back into the plaza where there were once people. He heard the sound of his partner being dragged away by his partner. He watched the two disappear until they were just one, once again coming back. He heard his partner laughing. The noise made David lost himself in his own voice as he slowly reached into the pocket of his suit and placed it next to her head. She was lying on the floor, blood streaming from her nose and neck. She looked down at her still lifeless body and gasped for air. 
 " I don ’ t want to die, " she sobbed as her back hit the wall and her eyes looked up at the ceiling. " I am not your last, just like you and me. " 
 " Why? " David asked in the panic. 
 She smiled and nodded. " I want to live. I can feel my right to live. I have hoped so many times that I would, one day, live a perfect life for many people, to have my right to life upheld but it hasn't."

"We waited as the water cooled, but it only continued to go higher and higher until she was at my height. There's a fire in her sight, and yet I see nothing. Her eyes lock with mine as we reach the table and she seems to swim past me. Whatever is at the end of my sight is lost. She pulls out a little box from her pocket. It looks like a face small, but held together like some kind of mask. I was expecting something, but I wasn't expecting her to give it up. I tried to speak but I was lost in her smile. She opens it. Inside there are a padlock with a letter attached, the pen's solid black, but there's also a large blue plaque with some symbols, separated from other pieces. She writes in smaller, softer writing, " Please Don't Take My Phone. I won't be able to speak for a while. Please, please let me go."

Sorry, the numbers don't add up. Go out and try and use all of your common sense, I'm not as sharp as I need to be.

"Okay, what do we got? " 
 The Chief Nurse wasn't there to comfort everyone. She was grateful, but my brother, and even more so because we were the only ones missing. We had no idea what had happened, but as my mother watched me from the emergency room door, she thanked me even more than I had. Our parents, just over five years ago, looked at us for a moment, staring blankly at our bewildered faces. But then they left. Their parents were probably right. My brother pulled on my father's shirt and glanced at his breath. 
 " Was she happy? What was that meant? Was she tired? " 
 My brother hit me in the face with a crude punch that caused my father's eyes to pop open. My mother looked at him and chuckled. She found it reassuring and healthy to recognize me. My brother did too, though. I wondered why he didn't rush my parents when he found out something just doesn't add up. 
 As he walked out, I was shaken awake by the sound of my mother's footsteps. As my brother touched his hand to his mouth, he flinched. He flinched so hard it broke and cracked. He had just enough time before the ambulance ran out of air and we were all gone. It sounded like he was on his way to the hospital to find a doctor. Another time, however, and I remember his face as though someone had fallen and just saw his face for the first time. My father called it " scary ". My mother called it " frightening ". I could hear my brother calling it, but he couldn't finish. 
 I didn't hear my mother look at me, but then I saw his hand brush the inside of my father's shirt. I coughed, but I wasn't going to die from his hands. No, I started coughing like I was trying to heal myself. That would make sense, but what would it do to a mother? 
 Then he looked back at me. " What're you going to do now?"

As the vultures descended upon the devastated, hushed, and abandoned towns, the rest of us lost hope. We all thought of the great scavengers that had sprung up over our cities. But no. No one believed in such things. The vultures scurried by, running up and down the dirt street, wildly changing into anything that was edible in a day and cradling their backpack-like bodies. They'd hunt without fail. Their flags glowed briefly in the dark, and they could not stop until they encountered something human and had it snatched from their hands. 
 That wasn't what they were trying to do. Most had no means of communication with their gazelles. Their boots covered the surface of the ground, and there was no sound of them moving in the first place. 
 It took them days to train enough for these ghoul hordes to attack a city, see some of the grimmiest, most dangerous things in the world, then begin to make their way to the nearest post. It took us only minutes of this training to realize that it was literally impossible for a human to make it to that post. In many ways, this cost us things that we needed more than anything that we had the right to know about. 
 Now, I can't speak for all of us in fear; as all humans know, vultures are not the greatest scavengers. But they are their worst enemies. And the worst one that I could reasonably call a savior of humanity was their invention of teleporters. They made incredible devices that would send any human anywhere they wanted. They built nations. They ravaged. Now we have to wait for the next one. 
 Every major city suffered, along with dozens of smaller ones. People feared the outbreak, as they were always hungry. They still eat scraps of rotten flesh or raw skin. They plump up its bones like they normally do. And they are so much smarter than our people. 
 Maybe we should just go our separate ways, see if we can figure out how to use them or fix them. Then we could finally come together. We can make a future for humanity that is all-consuming.

The people in this town all panic, they cannot see any change. At first it was just computers and smartphones, it came everywhere. Sweats went up the huts and cheered in the halls, where people could walk in and talk. People did not know what was going on and were at their wits end. I walked in with a tray of lettuce with a red chocolate filled shot. The man sat there with a smile on his face, the shadows of his glasses making their way across his face, still gray eye shadow. He had light brown hair, and the rain fell the way someone would cover their eyes as they fell. 
 It was not only the public that panic. There was every city across the globe a glut of these guys, they were vomiting out the old: polo, beseiged, various types of protein powders, antibacterials, and other supplements that they previously considered useless. There was even over half a dozen people in the city every day just reaching for these random medicine. It took everything from the soup they had found, to the bathroom I had cleaned. 
 The plague was upon them now, as many people found out by now. As they got accustomed to it, people started starting to take more of these pills as fast as possible. People were often told that the pill was dangerous but did nothing to stop what was coming. People seemed to stop taking these, however only became sick and tired as they tried. People became more desperate, they got sick of these to go in. Any number of pills, except really junk, would try to make the person sick. Every time someone got sick, they knew what was coming. Without that person in the city, the people were aghast. They called the cops, because if they did not take this medicine, what would happen? If they did not take it, what would happen? 
 When the pills finally stopped, a small number of people started acting sick. They started showing signs of early cardiac arrest. 
 We all knew what was coming, so panic quickly washed over the world. Nobody knew for a long time, but the office workers we all knew were staring at us in disbelief. We all rushed to our parents and stared at them. We all prayed for death to come. We all knew there was no hope that someone was gon na save our children. But it was too late. 
 One morning, I awoke to the sound of metal snorting on the porch. I went to my son to help him push the water over his head, and I heard his cries through the kitchen door. He stepped into the kitchen, and the smell of water, too, came to him. The skin around his mouth was sore from the cooking spray. The doctor came out and brought some more medicine. It was when I saw the doctor that I began to panic, he must have a deadly infection in his brain. After that he didn't kill us. My eyes still shut, I remained calm. I looked out the window at the area around us. The growing spread had spread so fast it was starting to take on shape. Not long afterwards, the people started to walk back and forth, people were starting to rest. They didn't know what was happening, but they would figure it out, it was everywhere. 
 I opened my eyes, to see the plague from my room. I took a deep breath, I was late. With a big grin on my face I walked back to my apartment, and sat down next to my son. I got ready to go to bed. I sat down next to my son and stood up. My brow furrowed. " I'm going to bed." And with a flurry of my fingers, I got up from my room, and went to bed.

"Come on, fuck it, I'm... You know, not looking forward to when I pop up again when I do. " I wrapped my arm around him, kissed him hard on the lips, and walked away. 
 I forgot that he was still asleep. 
 He was quiet in the darkness. 
 For a split second I saw him smile. He held that face as close to mine as he could. I couldn't get close, he was so *powerful*. I could smell his breath on his skin. At first I thought it was the straw that broke the camel's back. Then I realized he was pacing back and forth, red lips curled into a wide smile. He started laughing and leaning against my legs, walking past the trail he came from. 
 " Fucking John McClean? I hate John! " 
 His hand touched mine and he handed it back and paused for a moment. His eyes met mine as he considered. 
 " You'll never tell me why John said hello, especially not since I caught his attention. " 
 I had to move quickly. The trail dragged on and I couldn't see the start of a trail anymore. He smelled me. I remember smelling it in the air. He got up slowly, gave me that new you. 
 " Hi," I whispered. 
 He looked at me with those hot blue eyes of mine. Then he smiled. He sniffed my smelly breath and looked down at my silver mop. I won't ask him to do it again, it hurts to ask.

Dear Charles. 
 Can you believe it? 
 I'm a freshman. 
 Some of us have even graduated. Not many have applied. Not many have chosen to graduate. 
 Some would say that you are the only one that has gone from being a member of the "soldier's club ". 
 Yes, Charles I am. 
 Many of you have never met someone who has sent a letter to them. 
 I'm sorry Charles. I couldn't do what I did... 
 But I need this letter. 
 I need to leave it here and write. 
 Because if you don't please I have to go. 
 And do it safely, brave man. 
 Your freedom from worry will be all that you have. 
 For now, I must write. 
 I am sorry Charles. 
 I love you.

*Wh-what are you doing up so late? * 
 Thomas silently shook his head, then smiled at his hands, grabbing the handle of his Ford RSX and taking his first step onto the dusty, winding driveway. His sunscreens twinkled and flickered, looking into the empty lawn that he'd wandered up and down before. The sunsets were slow, a low hum that lept over the grassy area and erupted into a lovely cascade of waves, the blossoms illuminating the stained concrete ornaments he always loved to see on his porch. 
 "It seems I've just wanted to spend some time with you, my friend, " it's not like his face fell off during the transformation. He stretched his hand across the sill that was slowly growing until his hand pulled out a yellowish-green flower that reminded him of a newborn, perhaps a thousand years old, and touched it's tiny finger to the yellowed stem, touching a small jagged metal gash along the end. Thomas looked up towards the horizon for a few moments, still unfazed by what had happened. 
 " Be careful, your face wouldn't be so bad " A gentle warmth crept into the house that he'd thought the fuck out of. Thomas turned to take the car across to the back-alley. " Carry your paperwork, all of it " He opened the small white door that lead into the garage and put his hand on the cool metal up top. His head hung back in his hands and the air in the house was soft and relaxed as he took in the car ride and the feeling of joy he felt in the car beside him was overwhelming. 
 Thomas didn't really want to drive. He'd never got in a car before. 
 " I'd like to take one " Thomas shook his head. 
 " What's your name, anyway? " He asked casually, still knowing there was no option left. 
 " Gwen. " The tone in her voice was smooth and reserved. 
 Thomas hesitated for a second. " I want... I don't know, " he said. 
 The soft tone in her voice caused him to start running, eyes wide as to look down at his feet. 
 " Gwen? " He asked. 
 " David. " The soft tone in her voice brought him back, as if it all came out of her mouth. " I'd like to go meet you, " her voice came from somewhere beyond the front-seat-seat and seemed to come from there. 
 " This is not fair! " Thomas stuttered out and couldn't take it. 
 He dragged himself back to the passenger seat of the car that he'd been on for so long, the only windows open was the back of the house and the driver was here on the side. " No... no, no, no, no, no!" He was halfway back when he felt his skin warming up. It was time to come home, to have his second cigarette and to have a lovely day. He didn't think what to do. 
 He wasn't a bad man, just wasn't an ordinary guy at all.

I knew something was out there, someone was trying to rip this whole thing down. Not only was it true, but the common folk could be heard chuckling to themselves. The number of idiots trying to reaper so much in once hard to hand come up with a loophole. 
 "*I'm dead, just like every one of you who died they think. The unlucky ones are dead too. Everyone will be terrible to live with. * " The voice seemed to come from within. " Or even worse, I know who killed me, I can not erase the memory of being a life time paranoid schizophrenic at 16 as I have been living up to my good name ever since I began taking all the drugs. I'd die if I had been able to remember the first time, no one would be able to guess what happened since I have the knowledge of everyone who died. I'm just gon na save you from yourself for the world to make a shitload of mistakes." 
 It was incredibly odd to hear, but I was starting to feel even more uncomfortable than before. I couldn't go anywhere and yet I couldn't think for myself. My ex-lover didn't even know I was taking everything away and yet she still wanted to take me off my goldmine like some of her friends. I didn't even know how long I knew the medical statistics from most of their samples, yet it was all I could don't to moan. I had spent the better part of a full moon hiding in the moonstorm collecting footage of events to watch the day and it all seemed to turn into a wild frenzy. Then she got me, and I wanted nothing to do with it. My best friend, had the papers and I was content to follow her, to grow the tits I had hoped for. I was so stupid to think the authorities would only hold me behind bars, yet she still loved me to the bone. 
 Eventually, I decided I would save the rest of them all. " It was never about money though, what else could go wrong, even if I took their money. I remember getting that call begging you not to eat me, a nice half bloody slice of pancake, so I took one of their sweet take home sandwiches and you get to cook. I never gave you any tips though. " Her voice seemed to go as if she were going crazy. 
 I would never know what it meant or how much I had already saved. Either way, I would be saved, and even if I lost, it was going to be one great day. I bet it was this guy who got me the last cookie for the night. I could really live with that. 
 I went into the bathroom alone and threw the last of the cookies into the garbage. And as I ran to wash up I realized that I didn't want to look at them any more. Tears filling my eyes I looked up to the faces of those I had saved and was surprised to see that they looked okay. These guys with a hopeless smile were way too selfish to try anything but just to play along, so they walked out the door. Looking back at that lovely reception I had just been in, I would never have gotten the chance to truly have a conversation with anyone else, to be honest. 
 A dank silence filled the streets. In a safe distance that could only be called paradise and cashier might be safe, I turned to go closer to the beach. I was going to fight some crazy scientist as I wandered by searching for new means of destroying the drugs this shit-lord had created. I ran and looked again to see a pile of leftover food and rocks. I then wandered past the driver of the first vehicle that I found. I wanted the town to remember how I used to laugh and ask me what I was doing. As I walked I turned to see that miracle had finally worked.

In a universe so skewed and twisted, one can argue that religion is the proper tool. A hand glides across the snowbank and gently closes over every nook and cranny and corner. Everything is mechanized. Everything is constructed. Only God feels pleasure to feel the pain. 
 There are fewer examples than there need be. But God alone does nothing. We know of his decision, and of course, he forgets. God is to be feared the most, by the Lurers. These are his children. Only God feels his wrath, and makes it worse by touching them. 
 Their pain is a blessing to him. There was so little promise in his act of grace. There is nothing to improve his legacy. We know of it from our conversations with the lesser civilizations. There is still so much we haven't understood. But then we can hope to learn more about their suffering. 
 His advisers are quick to point out that one can understand and to beg for forgiveness. That the Lord loved us, but of course that is not enough. Instead, he has made it worse. The Apostle Paul considers insulting the children by giving them a false pride. As a consequence, he has insulted them as well. He cannot tolerate it any longer. He is going to set us free. 
 There is a mere moment before he gets close to us in spirit, when we are all forced into a exchange of clothing and water with his children. He wants us to understand we are every species's brother. Not merely for our sins but for the glory of God. He feels proud that he and His holy children have outdone themselves, and that our words in the text often cause even the most righteous to flee. It feels good to learn more, though. The children, all the while, look away, and just as they see what the Apostle Paul has shown them, they cry. 
 When they turn around to repent and find their throats were cut they know war is ready to commence. 
 When they turn back around and read their fate, they know it is still mine. I feel sorry for my colleagues. I feel sorry for my fellow man. But I just can ’ t stand those truly deserving of my praise.

 If you give people a communist party, they can go against the policies of communism and beat you. If you give people a party that wants to colonize Mars, they will beat you. If you give people a party that wants to exterminate the races of other planets, you will beat them. If you give people a party that wants to exterminate Earth, they will beat you. 
 They won't need words. They won't need logic. They won't need logic. 
 No. They will not need. 
 Now, let's think for a while. Would that be sufficient? Do we have enough people in one government? I mean, besides the politicians. We want the right people to do the job, and that is to represent the party. But what of that right party? Are we lacking a sense of democracy in which democracy relies on coercion and power, while democracy relies on a sense of legality? Does that really matter? When I suggest that the party is set up to represent its people, I don't mean to be deceptive, it means that it exists *that* way. It means that the right-wing just wants to control, and that is exactly why it should not exist. 
 So, then, perhaps we are lacking a sense of democracy in which democracy *requires* coercion and power, and that is also true in the sense that democracy functions only in a committee and is not a democratic company. At least, not in the sense that the right-wing plays it down and cannot pretend that it does not exist, but in the sense that the dictatorship that we have built is driven out of the village. 
 Therefore, you are right, as a member of my party, that I am here in the village, and the right-wing can not govern.

Flares were dripping from her lips as her hand fell to the screen, tears drifting across her face, wipes dancing in her eyes as she dug her fingernails deep into her own face, to admire the tiny traces of gold flashing in her eye for just a second before they popped and disappeared in the background of her eyes. She had tried to guess it, the words', so long ago', but everything reminded her that not much had changed... She saw the sweat and tears building above her cheekbones, she found the expression of woe comforting, and she simply brushed them away; the pain faded, of course, as she began to wipe off the painting she had read in her journal, taking a swig of her drink. A quick thought stood out to her, wasn't she supposed to start painting yesterday? No. Today was going to be a good day, wasn't she supposed to finish right now? It was only a matter of time before it did happen. She immediately set on her feet, walked down the street, the only one not a mile away from her house, and stopped in front of the store. The cosmetics department was beginning to close down by 8, and was just adding the hours into their pay day service to go. Then the phone rang; she quickly flicked it to voicemail and started to dial the number, no doubt with intent to make the dent. 
 *Every week someone snaps, and tells me'Oh, it's getting dark; got ta save us, right? Ah, but I have a scheduled appointment... Don't worry about it, and... do you want us to--' * 
 A pause cut deep between her exhale, a strong tone pleading for attention. Yes, she had read the newspaper a little bit - good times with the Cubs were finally approaching; sports stories were closing in; and yesterday was going to be some damn good day. The phone rang, and she quickly dialed it twice, thought better of it and answered the phone, wishing she could forget - but she could not. * Thump*. Another voicemail came, repeated its message for the next twenty minutes. 
 *Got ta stop - sorry - I was just reading something...... just lost a few pointers it seemed, so... I'm sorry sir... I just... I got ta-- I'm sorry... - hurry up, oh let me, * 
 She found the voice again, one that wasn't on the number, and started to dial him first, as she usually did... instead, she stood up and walked forward, taking the direction she had taken earlier. There was a tug on the rickety ropes that made their way down from the street, she approached the back door from the window and turned it just enough to see if she could hear someone. No. What were they supposed to tell him? * Nope. Who's at the church tonight? * In her panic, she walked from the front door slowly, her back turned to the ground as if it were a gurney to leap into, to herself, to another friend. But her only path was behind. 
 The sun had not reached it's peak in quite some time and the setting sun was setting all around her, but then the ringing interrupted her. The phone buzzed to life, another bad joke of the C.E.O.s, while she on the other end waited, desperately holding the telephone up and out of her normal control, she tried to unpack her headache - it is bad when you lose control of your imagination. She then dashed out of the store, the cardboard boxes past her, one tangled, the clanking of switches as the box bounced off the plastic floor of the closet across the street, she had to block the sun from reaching her first day of baking, she closed her eyes and focused her mind, wondering what was happening. * Let's just hope it's alright. * She walked to the kitchen and scurried away from the kitchen - what sort of people are she to try and scare a stranger in front of them? * Better call anyone who is here* she thought to herself. She gave out a bad sigh, quickly making her way back to her room to the kitchen, turned the small oven off and turned on the TV, flipping over to the news. Her phone vibrated softly, the red number hung in the air with a quick flick. He is awake. * Will Call on 4:15*

Oh, I finally found that item... 
 My hand hurt because my hands were bleeding. It was taking the whole day to clean them. 
 "Yo forgot to check shit out?!" 
 The nurse was complaining of an itch and twitching her numb fingers. All of a sudden they started to move as if they were trying to cover something. It started to get dark. 
 I tossed the bag over my shoulder, she looked down at it and then she... stayed motionless. She also was on her phone... trying to text me, that was weird... 
 *Nice place, it's kinda awesome. * I thought. I was really close to getting it out of my ass. 
 By now my best friend just came in that had still the bug in her hand, reading it a quick glance. I caught it before I could catch up. It was kinda cute: http: //usnews.com/world/2004/04/bullet-destroyed-character-like-a-good-racing/9140739
