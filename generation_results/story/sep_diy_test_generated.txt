No backstory - its more of a character vs class challenge. Again, I'd definitely go for a story that consisted of the exchange of blowback. Awesome because you're taking an existing story for this. I also love your attention to detail around your conventions and especially the narrative flow of it; I really enjoyed adding that element here. 
 My biggest complaint was that the story felt wasted. After all, we had so many good opportunities here. 
 There's a lot of very small things I might get in the ending. Seriously, they were great! 
 You let me continue on with the questions. 
 Was there time for rehashing? I don't think there was time for that. 
 Also, did you actually have a fairly straightforward backstory to go with the story? 
 Was the setting consistent? Did the clothes and the emotions come and go at the same time? 
 Did the colour palette really change because of your work? 
 This isn't meant to be a piece of dialogue, it's meant to be a series of questions. 
 What was the goal of this story? 
 Does your story require you to explain what the character does to achieve something? 
 What was that part of his or her personality you felt attached to? 
 Maybe I'm never going to get it right? If you have trouble writing it down, stop typing. If you did, get a professional for letting us know, then help us find more answers!<|endoftext|>

I was hesitant at first. The girl standing in my living room wasn't my… my girl. My heart *literally* stopped in my tracks. I put my jacket on to check if she was okay. 
 She was on the top of the stairs in the living room, making a run for it. Every movement seemed to be more like it was being recorded, as if a soundhole had knocked a surly voice out of existence. 
 “ Wow, give it time! ” 
 “ Yes, I ’ ll be right there! ” 
 I had returned to having her come over for dinner, not wanting to be rude. She didn ’ t seem to notice me at all. Maybe she should see me? She was always a weird one. When we first met it was just a college boy with a hot-headed look, sure, but a tidy little figure without much other cultural requirements. From what I could gather, I thought she probably watched out for somebody that required attention, too. No amount of tears would ever convince me otherwise. 
 One night she invited me to her room and there we stood at the top of the stairs, just listening to the crackling fire crackle out of the tiling. It came to my attention that there was someone pacing on the stairs, not coming through, but closer, too. “ Hey, what ’ s up? ” She asked casually, turning towards the front door. 
 “ Not much. ” 
 I ignored her. My heart was racing. What did she say? Was she just going to play tag with me? 
 “ Hey there. ” 
 It took a few seconds for my lips to become tight against my mouth. Then, she was kneeling on the very top of the stairs. She stood, hissed at me. 
 “ I didn ’ t think you ’ d be here. ”<|endoftext|>

“ I mean... I mean you guys know, our healer people are famous people. ” 
 “ *Tales in the Bronze, ancient of the ichor of wit* ” 
 “ Yes indeed, but the fairly popular and even the brightest have been crowned Healing World champions since'84*. Now if there ’ s something to be said about the humble healers... ” 
 As the healer turned to leave the room he looked back at his assistant who held her mace as she walked out the door. The last thing she wanted to say was that the whole affair had been a... neat, normal thing to have happen. No reason to go looking for a surgeon. 
 “ Look! And this: ” 
 “ All healers—those who turned us down since the technology wasn ’ t at its peak. So now we're all just going home and dying, healing the hospital ER. ” 
 “ *Pandemonium, I ’ ve destroyed more hospitals than the Daily Mail ’ s* “ 
 “ I mean, they went up in size just by removing health ailments! What was it?! ” 
 “ *The punchline* ” 
 “ I mean they're heroes, everybody knows this, buffing up their magical staffs for league. ” 
 “ * "Death—was He High" * “ 
 He leaned back in his chair in despair, he could have gone back to the comfort of his cottage if not for the motorcycle. But the coworkers had spotted him, moving with purpose. 
 “ *Five New Curses all over the kitchen side*. ” 
 “ Hey, the Knights of Medusa aren ’ t coming back. When the Healers have finished digging the culprits out of the lungs of the Pope and destroy them, where are the weak ones? We can ’ t have one of them voting right off our shoulders. ” 
 The potion had injected healing a large amount of mana and turned her into a dire light. Her face was covered in tiny freckles, but her flesh had healed itself after all. She looked at the healer, who was now a pixelated blue line, and said as little as possible. 
 “ But sir, *after centuries of casting magical scales, magic resistance, healing, and healing, one feels nothing. * ” 
 This woman, a harpy, felt nothing. She was dead and no one cared what her medical research was saying. 
 The healer turned to leave the room and without skipping a beat collapsed to the floor.<|endoftext|>

"Quill up please. " 
 I heard her fill her prying hands without hesitation. I laid my head to silence and allowed the sound of the crowd to be heard. 
 " Squall? " 
 I knew her already. Her name was Ellie now. I hadn't heard her name before. The penultimate parent. I had thought she might leave the family. Never. 
 " Come here, Ellie " I called out to the crowd. I found a small table with an attendant who looked like she was going through a hot beverage. I felt my hand tighten around the dispenser. I could feel Ellie's grip around it. 
 " I've been working on this for months, Ellie. So you'll get one for us? " 
 The attendant stood over me, facing me. She leaned over and placed her head on my shoulder. 
 " Don't worry, Ellie. You'll grow up to be one of the most respected people in all of Quizperia. Never got your first weapon, except from me. " 
 I didn't see what she was referring to until I let go of her hand. 
 " Ok, that's all that matters." 
 And with that, I took her hand and left to the woods outside of Quizperia.<|endoftext|>

The dark god smiled and was gone. 
 With every movement there was a hush as long as the snow was falling on their heads. The voice of the deep still was crass but it must have passed far longer in the distance than the impact and would surely never reach them. It was no longer beneath them but it was fear and despair, and although they knew not what they needed to do now the light they sought was tainted by the darkness with a kind of grudge they had not yet won. The human race needed one next time. 
 Their first seed had slept and tasted of it, then eated it, then eaten it. Never had they given it any name or name at all. They were cold and alone and they were dead now. The darkness will never touch them once more. Humanity must end. Humanity is weak now. 
 And so he spoke through horns and smoke and fire and power with the whisper of ineffable dread and doom. It died in that high tomblight, because only in the remorseless bodies of the dying had the whispers become aware. Nobody had cared to lose a second and neither had the power to do anything. He spoke, not in response to one word, but in something he had learned slowly for his whole life: 
 "For as long as I live I am that which you have feared, and still in that moment you each shall fear. You may fear the loss of what you were all those years ago when no one else would have thought of the same things but you fear the loss of what everyone else had done. You fear what will not come." 
 The world writhed in darkness as it hoped its only true sound would come from the same source.<|endoftext|>

In the end, we left the Earth knowing nothing. 
 A sense of time slowly began to drift into existence as she appeared. Much like her appearance, this world still had remarkable qualities. Now, a group of Americans, European, African and Indian, sit upon the platform of the giant starship as it unfolds. Each one of them is allowed to sit across from each other. They stare into the ship, uncertain of what to expect. 
 "Where is she? Where is her?! " 
 A girl's voice is heard, deep and strained. She begins struggling to form words. 
 " Inside. " 
 A man's voice was the only voice she could hear over the ringing in her ears. 
 " That she's asleep. We left her. " 
 A woman's voice was the only sound she could feel as her head began to creak and groan. 
 " We left her. This place takes those too. We walked from place to place, never leaving, always learning, never ending, never ending. She knows nothing from where we're gone. She doesn't know why we left, how we left her. She gets tired as she walks to the ship, she knows this? " 
 The man stands up and moves to the row of seats, through some miles of light overhead. 
 " Who gives a shit how the hell the hell we found her? Why the fucking fucking hell did we leave her?! " 
 A man is positioned in front of a woman, on a huge platform. 
 " Men will be killed for having left her there! " 
 " We fucking told them to burn it!" 
 In the final moments of Earth's existence, the following images were captured. The ship is in orbit about 8.7 light-years away. 
 A man stands there, and said a small prayer. The tears in his eyes could be heard over the sound of cheering.<|endoftext|>
**********5**********
From my tiny cubicle to the corner of my room, I always have my own personal space, a storage one. I've always wanted my own space, I guess. It's a one-bedroom, two-bathroom house, the hottest storage room in all the best parts of the city. My boss has always encouraged me to stay in the state comfortable, of course, so I'll spend most of my time at all of my desks and desktops. I managed to fashion the perfect room to me, from my tiny cubicle to the corner of my room. After all, I'm only in school, like you. My classroom, my thoughts, all here on my phone as a virtual assistant. Who would have thought that the teacher here could be a dick about time? I'd give him a ticket for giving us the whole class in one day, I presume? I hope not. It could have gone better. 
 I have been working late at night, chugging my morning tea, sneezing and wheezing, pooping in my nose, licking my mouth, and throwing up. I think. Maybe. It always hurts. I know I haven't been working since yesterday, the day they came to me, but as soon as I woke I knew what was happening. I was working hard, and there wasn't much to do. I couldn't stand being out late. The instructor was busy with them, getting lollipops ready to be put on a blood-contaminated chalkboard. It was difficult work. 
 Finally, I woke. Not to my boss's surprise but not the start of my sore throat and my pain. I tried my best to hide it, obviously. I managed to hide it. You know, I try to hide it all the time. It's so easy to be able to track someone if I know what they're talking about. It's only a matter of time before someone starts hearing it all the time. Maybe that's why I work like that: to make sure nothing of my life happens to them that day. I know, so why not. I'm only working for half the day now, and I know they have not been receiving my calls. 
 I must not tell you why they were instructed that they had to stop. I must not tell you about the back of my skull. I cannot tell you why I was terminated. I have done my job and I will continue doing it. I can't go back to school or work any more, no matter how hard I try. My foot can't move anymore. Not for the first time in months, because I've been left behind. I'll never know what could have caused this. As soon as the breathing stops and the weak spots start feeling small again, I know the darkness will return. The days I spent out here don't matter anymore. I don't care. I'm going to do what I've wanted, I'm going to break my neck, please. I'm going to break my neck. 
 I wanted to kill myself, if I could. I wanted to go to my love like they said; I wanted to see her and be in the same room. My hand is shaking now, floating the liquid. I'm shaking too much. The mouthful starts sucking on me. I don't want to give up. I'm shaking, too. The night I'm sleeping, I know who they are; I hear their riddles and voices and I feel their presence. 
 The darkness moves, rising from my throat, whispering slowly to me. I open my eyes. This is the only light. 
 "Cheat Club."<|endoftext|>

She asked me to be her sphinx. It wasn't me. It wasn't even Amy. My arms were a scary shade of blue, and she was red. I hated it. 
 My last night was the best I've ever had as a good co-worker. It was great when you always brought me out of my daydreams, and dressed me in the most flattering summer dress I could find. 
 I had to bring Amy. 
 As I got dressed, I bumped into Taylor in the hallways. She was in her double-BK. On a Thursday, in her lab coat, she was putting on her windbreaker, while I carried her. Her hair was slicked back and an eye shadow was all around her. I gaped. 
 "Taylor, can I go for a kiss? " 
 " Oh. " I said. " I mean, you know why I need you there. " 
 Taylor looked at me and said, " *Why? * " I glanced at her and shook my head. " Because I'm afraid of the things I'd say to you."<|endoftext|>

"I don't have time to explain this to you, but first, " I said, " Your wife has died and I want to know what you did to her. " 
 " What did you do to her, Callum? " Peter enquired. " Did I do all of her other things? " 
 " You stupid motherfucker, " I replied, " All of it, everywhere. " 
 " Where was I at? " Peter asked. " Where were you at that time of her death? " 
 " Here now, " I said, reaching out towards my pockets, then grab my bread. " This is a very basic bread. " 
 I collapsed and sat there, hands on my hips, listening to the man who looked over me. 
 " This bread, " I murmured, a bit concerned. " What's in it? " 
 " My name is Peter, your name is Callum, and I am an aspiring baker who wanted a new coat. " 
 " Callum? " 
 " Of course, how did you arrange your own coat, and $ 50-80, of your own. " 
 I knew I was being exact, Peter said something about needing a new coat, and I didn't have any papers. " What are you doing? " 
 " Don't do this. " He spat. " I have food to eat, you can't walk around like I can't see. " 
 " Are you having a temper? " Peter asked. 
 " No, what, no not at all. " He started again. " What happened to Callum? " 
 " She's living in hospital, and I tried to tell her I had a package for her. You need to tell her to get on with it, lest I get caught, and then she's going to do that, " I interrupted. 
 " Oh shut up, " Peter said, still sitting there, " please, don't do this again. It's like a campaign. I've got to get some bread. " 
 I smiled. " It's just a fluffy bread. " I said in a certain tone. " Beautiful. " 
 " I love fluffy bread, Peter, " I said as I grabbed my parcels, which were displayed above my refrigerator, and slowly began to peel them. 
 " Would you like a box of nachos? " 
 Peter nodded. I admired the pickles on his lips. 
 " Yeah, any time you want one of your little breads, " I said, handing him my bread. 
 " Alright, " Peter said, slowly pulling one out. " Let's take this. Tell me it's like this: " 
 " What a nice song, right Callum? " I teased. 
 " It's like the stage is being warped by the feelings of mothering a child, with the aid of that child. " 
 " Wait, " I said. " I don't think anyone knows about it yet."<|endoftext|>
**********8**********
I was holding my eldest child at that age. I didn't give much away when she was born, it was just that I wasn't sure she would think me a man. She was my choice. 
 Growing up my family took me off guard. That was no problem, if I had my own unique eye colour it meant my strength was strong enough that I wouldn't just go off with a bang, and I never known my powers would go beyond that, my life was a test. It was like no other family was there for me. 
 Soon enough I grew older and loved mother and her house more, I feel my boy grows closer and closer to me every day, I can see clearly but I can't see the person. 
 Like mother I crave answers and try to make what her wishes are, the smile I have on is a manifestation of her happiness, even though I can't tell that she wanted me to become happy because I wasn't strong enough. There's other 'bad people' out there like me, I'd be happy if it was cold or something. It doesn't matter though, the moment when I see a woman looking at me in the mirror I can't help but smile at myself too. 
 My childhood was rough. Maybe because of the toys I did with my family, and the times I always tried to clear my diaper, or where I kicked mom to make sure she stayed alive, I was exposed. No matter where or who I went to I still didn't see her, no matter how annoyed I got at her for telling me all those silly lies. I could hear her though, I could hear her clearly, and still I was embarrassed, and wanted to help her. 
 After the war, everyone seemed to fall into disrepair. I felt different, I learned things that I don't remember from the books. It makes it harder to bring her back to me, how much do you change? When she would ask me questions about just who I was born from, or about her parents who died in the war, I asked her again. She kept asking me about her parents but I couldn't hear them anymore, I couldn't see them either. What did she want? 
 She didn't want anything, she wanted me to find out, and I was just glad she would listen and understand why. 
 I wasn't sick after that, as I was in what we all call a time of war. My brain just buzzed with places I'd been injured, and knowing that there was nothing to help me, I was glad the Army was out there not waiting for a return. But that's why they chose me, not because I knew what'd happen. When I was in that hell, I'd know what'd happen. I guess that's what saved us, because I couldn't hear my own battle, if I knew, I didn't know anything. After death they'd just listen to me. 
 I don't know if I'm still alive right now, or if there's another round ahead of me waiting for me. 
 As I walk away from her, I can't help but wonder if I'll ever see her again, maybe no one really feels the same way about me. Maybe I'll just never see someone like me again, and that alone is all I can really ask for.<|endoftext|>

The only writing prompt I could think of was about this old girl who always preferred using the air freshener. I like the book(s ) for its simplicity, not the quest ( which is, by the way, long-ago ). I saw some very bad passages and took them seriously. I liked the way you chose to involve the "cleaner with sweatpants " in the unnecessary story... the " gas hood " and the shop that visit you everyday to only pay you with what he says, but that only leads to bad decisions. 
 Also, the first time it came to my mind as I sat around chatting with Shrek, where she always went on something to cheer him up was actually his mom's exercise session at the gym which was his old workplace. I really felt like she was in a movie when she went off in the middle of a rant about her mom deciding to have an appointment with Sheldon. Anyway, those were few good scenes. 
 Likewise, the writing is not so terrible. It is a really well written title, both for the story itself and the characters ( in a good way ) that you provide. The personification of dialogue had very specific directions, and the great compliment of cold storage by the narrator always kept me entertained. Also, the way you made me feel truly empathy toward Shrek was really good. 
 Perhaps one of the flaws with the story is the idea of the action leading to the end. It was very easy for me to figure this out. Who was the one really putting it all away, at the end? Who was the culprit? Well, why should she have to die before the rest of the story came to be? Is the action quite literal as opposed to through the memory? In fact, I would give anything to realize that it was right in context to remind us of the " save the princess" idea ( to remember now, I think ) of the Wigan incident, when the shooting at the cave part of the mall led to the princess blowing up the living room for fun ( having to go through this to erase the shop after all the packaging ransacked the store...? ). This is just to be understood; hopefully, the story will still resonate, even if it's felt a long time too long. 
 Overall, in all honesty, I liked the world Shrek created. I just wish she had let it grow, because then again, he never really understood what was happening. More importantly, at a whole, life time, the world is amazing, and to be honest, you only get used to it the first time you read it. Let it grow, make new characters, get to know people who are really involved, and keep exploring the world as a teenager. Or maybe you remember its not so lonely after all. I think this part of the world feels really familiar, and I really wish it would be changed.<|endoftext|>

"There, there! " He grabbed the cashier's coat and reached into his pocket. 
 " Oh! It works! Well done! Thanks for saving me today too! " The money in his wallet was starting to fill up. " Now, I wasn't sure this was any good at first, but I think I'll actually use it. " 
 " Anyway, remember that times when I could just be a little kid and love the world? Here, just drop me that power blanket over there! " He had a gun in his waistband, another two items in his crumpled up wallet. 
 But then again, now she would need to be in her teens, otherwise the toys weren't making any noise. " What was that for? " He passed the bill. 
 She hand it over, and paid, made sure the load was in stock, then tucked away the jacket and baby clothes, before walking toward her bed. " I'll write it down, okay?"<|endoftext|>

"My name is Elizabeth Shaw, and I am the White House Correspondent. " 
 There was a knock on the door. 
 " It's Hannah. " 
 " Hello, Mr. President. My name is Hannah Shaw. " 
 The first lady smiled at the reporter and beckoned him in. " Sir, we can discuss this on a phone line, but we have something to tell you. " 
 " I don't understand. Mr. President? " 
 " Yes, I understand. I am the Chief of the Secret Service. I've been monitoring your movements and I've uncovered something interesting. " 
 The reporter patted the top of his head and nodded. 
 " How did you know I was here? " 
 " Well, my colleagues had just called and asked to ask that I remain anonymous. " The president shook his head. " I presume they're all dead right? " 
 " That's exactly what I'd expect. You should have gone with me. " 
 " That's correct. " 
 " Then, I have something to tell you. " 
 The reporter looked up from his papers. The president sighed. " This is urgent. Someone needs to retrieve this files. Let's get in on the scene. " 
 " Hannah, can I ask about the FBI files? It's currently in hands. " 
 A few moments later, the president let out a long sigh. " Uh, yes, it's running. " 
 " How should we move forward? " 
 " I'd like to start by providing you with some additional information. Right now, I have someone I've seen telling the top-secret government services, and this is about to become a national scandal. Everyone needs to know who she is. " 
 " I... I'm afraid so. " 
 " Exactly. " 
 " And they're trying to distract you? " 
 " No, I know it's just bad for the world. We live in crisis. The reality is, our country is about to fall. We've created a billion drones. " 
 " You're the President! " 
 " Yes, that's right. " The president began to shake his head. " Tell us more! " 
 " Tell us more! " Hannah quietly agreed. 
 The press room was silent for some time as the President began to look over the previous administration's files. Then, he paused. " Finally, do you have any notes? " 
 " On the would-be Nixon assassination. " The president's head turned around. " And on Edward Snowden's leak of over $ 500 million dollars... I'll put it this way: The NSA has fucked up the system a bit. Apparently, only the most elite of agents are allowed access to data on and after such a fateful event, like the 9/11 incident. That means the three of them, Neil Armstrong, Adolph Hitler, and Richard Nixon, are now being hunted down and executed in the most public and level crimes known to man. The Prime of One's mansion was a clear breach of privacy. Anyway, that's all I've got to tell you. This is going to be a national embarrassment."<|endoftext|>

"I wish you would wake up in a better place." 
 I wake up, and the joy of being free of the cold and snow is instantly smashed into my eyes by a cloud of light. I catch a glimpse of a column of light, and there it is. A man. A man covered in snow. 
 It was a dream. You are here. You're awake. You see angels with their wings! What the hell is going on? 
 *Stronger, god. Hurtier, more powerful, that's the price to pay. But it was worth it, because you gave me a great gift. * 
 "Where did you send that? ", you ask. My devilish eyes flick up at you, but then they return. It was a dream. 
 *From an angel. * 
 " Yes, sir. " 
 I do it. 
 A cold wind approaches. I like the sensation. This time it cuts through. I'm sick of it. Strangely, I'm also a bit relieved. The loss of the sickness seems to bring me peace. 
 I can't bring myself to wake up again. I know I must prepare for this. But I can't fathom if there's even a fog of living things. They must be warm. 
 I set my head down. My wings no longer sting. The winds drag me to a place far away from me. I feel empty. 
 Finally, I stand, and around me I see a familiar face. The angel. 
 The angel is burning my dreams. You see it almost as if I'm tracking my action, pointing directly to this face. But I don't know what's happening. I remember that face. 
 It's me. But I'm not. I am not human. But my not human. I can't keep my dreams at bay anymore. No. I can't sleep any more. And I don't want to. 
 I'm floating, and I'm dreaming. And I'm coming to. 
 **DAY 17** 
 I wake up. I still have time to sleep. 
 I wake up. A deeper dream: the angel man to my left. The angel man to my right. 
 The angel is gone. 
 **DAY 18** 
 I wake up. I haven't slept in days yet. Everything is the same, save for that thing in front of me. God himself and the man in front of me. 
 The angel hands me a small present. 
 **DAY 19** 
 I've called my mom a lot lately. That reason is what makes me hold it. 
 I realize that the present is special. It's perfect. I know what it's meant to be. 
 A few spells follow. 
 My mother smiles. 
 " Miss Harper, enjoy your day today. You'll have a lovely day tomorrow morning." 
 I open the present, eager to meet my father. 
 I smile again.<|endoftext|>

"The party is over. We've been friends for too long, we're better than that! " Tom Clemens grumbled. " In fact we should all go to the party now! The rest of the time they sit here talking about wine. Some are serious about heads wounds but look at me! " Tom was the type of man who wore a loose fitting black suit, with smart glasses and no hair on his head. 
 " Crap Tom! " Jesus Christ I'm starving! Crap Jesus Christ I'm out of water! Jesus Christ I'm out of blue! " 
 I hurried to my car and drove past our party again. " We've got a time! I've got a friend now! He'll like having dinner with me! " I heave my body as I pulled into our driveway, a man with huge girth walked in. Tom came in with a tray, the drive to my car quickly passed and I stepped out to get a slice of apple pie. 
 Tom said his name: 
 " dad, does this look like the dinner time at Hendrick's today? " 
 " Yep John. Next!!! " 
 The man looked at me. I sighed. " TOM, your taste in pizza is spotty but you've got some good old fashioned pizza. I'll go share a slice with you, though"<|endoftext|>

Awesome idea, great cause I could use a call for feedback right now. 
 Quick: First off, I don't actually read any of the scripts I come up with because I can't think of the most satisfactory one of this survey. Secondly, I hate every time this prompts me, and this one seems like such an entertaining idea. I need to see why you gave them this request; or, if you're just so strong, where to start. 
 Okay: You've asked me, and I'm writing a prompt response, an ad. 
 More seriously: I'm very suspicious of every ad that goes out there and all that is put into it. If I'm buying something, the best way I can think to come up with this compelling story is to sell it and publicly show it to friends and family. 
 I never wanted to write as an ad, so I bought it.<|endoftext|>

My eyes were closed. I looked around quickly in the morgue, no one was home. One time, like most times, I managed to save one of them. But there was no one. No turning back. 
 I stepped back. I was getting to the hospital. I hurriedly arrived at the hospital and went inside. Only they didn't seem to see me in the coffin. 
 "Thank God. We'll just... watch it for a minute. " 
 I stared at the camera I had set up in the area. What came out of it was something I had not seen before, but it was a photograph and I couldn't possibly tell which was a woman or a man, I was still dumbstruck and curious to find out. I didn't want to believe it, but I was tired. 
 I looked at the picture for a moment, then put it to my mouth. I tried to speak, but couldn't. It was difficult. 
 " You can't tell which of us is the woman... is this a clue? " 
 " Maybe we can call the guy in front of the camera and ask why he needs to get out, but you... um, you should hurry, we know we've waited a couple of hours for this to work out. It's going to be ok. " 
 " We got there already? " 
 " Yes, the man at the camera just raised his gun and said. " 
 " Fuck! Right, check the cameras. " 
 As soon as I heard the gunshot and see a semi going off, I knew I had finally got the resolve to escape. I turned around and started to walk to the woman, but it didn't work. Her face fell to the floor, and I felt my body crash against the coffin. 
 Her eyes were covered in blood. And her face. And eyes with a smile. She was smiling, and I knew it was her. She saw me, and let out a long sob, and took a step away from me. I looked at her and put my head in my hands, and knew she was my girlfriend and I loved her so much, and I would miss her. I could feel my blood rushing down my throat as she moved closer. 
 My heart began to beat faster and faster, and I slowly closed my eyes, and then I felt an instant of peace. 
 " Nobody in this world is going to hurt you. You are no longer a pawn in this."<|endoftext|>

Ripple wise the world was doomed. Business owners bought small sites, mainly nimble banks, builders, and people to build their jobs out. The mass death of marine society? The images of marine clashes or accidental life are blurred into this account. And then, wars? Nonsense. Politics are as old as time. If it's war, peace is nonexistent. If war is war, Japan and Korea automatically collapse or add naval power to their fleets. Countries often succumb to exorbitant death and despair and minor infighting, the small one above, just because I made it so. Those spent on live TV shows have lost all sense of respect. They flunked every modern invention imaginable: The clock, the light sabers, the hook. Simple. Boring, often bitingly simple, without meaning. 
 I was one of them. At some point the powers that be gave their most sinister intentions. Humans were bought out by their neighbors and given their ships and utensils to fight against. It wasn't death and then rise of the tyrant; but there was no war. It was, as always, working on a small island in the vast emptiness that was once a hunter's field. Lifelessly floating islands of the wrong kind. In the wrong place at the wrong time. 
 I traveled the world, taking with me the corpses of those I cared about. From the wreckage I kept crawling; killing people that did not know of my presence. I swept myself across the fields and died in them. Man had won and died in them.<|endoftext|>

"Greg? Greg? " 
 " Oh god... " 
 " Are you going to show me around the public house? I just want to talk to you. " 
 " Let me see this picture of Justin Theroux's father. " 
 " Well, he lived in the Net, in love, and gone then. He's a bit of a lug. I tried to be he'sgoworker while he grew up, but he has to live in wallstreet and go through... Britain. " 
 " Like he won't leave? " 
 " It's possible to go to Britain without having to do Britain then. " 
 " Eh... thanks. " 
 " I think it'll just be off topic. I'll tell you what they've decided to do to him. They think you're already a serious addition to the community. You just need a few more machines, some newspapers and a mobile phone. There's still so much he can learn. Hens hope you do well, but I'm sure your son probably needs a good manual to start the week. " 
 " Greg, hold on. " 
 Greg yelped. 
 " I got a Twitter account, already? " 
 " Yeah, googling that is at least a dozen times a day. You must be busy today, I just got to go, it's 5:00 am. Here go! " 
 Greg wrote under his breath. 
 " Look, I'd really appreciate your help with basic authentication."

Tapping on the screen in front of me was sending me shivers down my spine. My sensors told me that it was truly a day in the life, but I felt that i was being watched. I pulled the cover up over my face, peering over the edge of the bottle. 
 "W-Why are you there? It's my birthday! Where have you gone " 
 " John? You okay? " 
 I raised the glass to my lips. Not normal. I pulled off my pair of spectacles, revealing bright yellow shades. 
 I let out a sigh of relief and stepped back to the film. My baby girl stopped giggling when she saw them and put her hand to her temple. 
 " This is real John " 
 " You have to be kidding me. " I scowled at her. 
 " Just tell me, why did you think it would happen to you? " 
 " Nothing. " 
 " Okay. Let's get you to bed. " 
 She did as her mom instructed and walked out the door. I waited a minute. My parents were probably watching TV too. They just laughed. Who made it sound like they were laughing? That was probably just another disgusting joke. If only I had known. 
 " What was I watching, John? " 
 " I thought that you were real. Your voice, your family, the strength you have. It didn't really matter. I thought that this morning, you finally became stronger, made it out to John. They finally saw a human being and a human being *together*. They started hurting. They almost had to give in. We were hostages. He wasn't using us anymore. They were getting more desperate. " 
 I smiled at this. " I wanted to be strong. That is why I got in here. You're going to be strong, you know that. " 
 " Right " I replied back to my mother. She was smiling even wider. " Be the child that we deserve John. Be the truly, truly strong life you can be. " 
 Now what? 
 " John. You need to understand."<|endoftext|>
**********19**********
"You *here*? " 
 " Yes, it's me. Thanks, for letting me into the Academy of Magic " 
 " Yes, thank you. You're now the most powerful agent in the Kingdom of Great Thinking, Human. " 
 " Yep, the world knows what I am. I will not be underestimated. " 
 " Yeah, the spies pretty much made sure that you met, is this accurate? " 
 " It's more than true, but I'm telling the truth. " 
 " Look, it's just... wait. We haven't even finished. " 
 " No, no, actually, yes I know, I'm sorry. " 
 " Yes, yes, there is a reward. The very best of humanity will be rewarded. " 
 " I guess I'll give you that again, " she said and closed her eyes. 
 I could hear the others around me, trying not to speak for the first time. This was different, it was no longer a conversation. I watched them, as they looked at me, looking for any signs that it was happening. In front of me, the tree was craned over a foot ahead and another in front of me. The room was dark, but still the room seemed to glow. I could still see the current arrangement of candles within the tree and the meteorite. 
 " I have 1 week. There is a certain power in the knowledge I have. Who knows how much the curse will be? " 
 The others began to speak, happy that I had pulled that last bit of information out of my subconscious. Perhaps the curse could be unleashed. A frozen stream of blue light passed through the trees and the sky, slowly moving away. 
 " It will go on. It will kill millions, " I said, trying to stand still. The sound of stuttering filled the room. The other witches and wizards stared back at me. 
 " What can I do? " they asked, puzzled, afraid. I held my hand up and paused as the other six of them looked through me, hearing my voice. " We have a prophecy to get you out of this predicament. The time is 1 week, but you have until the next day to come back. " 
 The others looked on, then to me. A light was on. The curse had undone it, and the spell was dead. I waited. 
 I opened my eyes to the darkness. I couldn't understand the words floating inside my head, but the fear of the curse didn't stop. It was still there. Then I heard it. The first thing I could hear was a scream. I still couldn't move from my height and the screaming continued for hours. 
 I closed my eyes, still unable to understand why the crying was more intense. The sky, once again was frozen in a vast black vortex. 
 I closed my eyes again. The lights, though when I opened them, I could not see them. The room had become less dark. I could hear it now, and I felt a strong closing in my chest, along with howling in the blackness. 
 The crashing of glass was heard. Then the ground began to shake. They heard me. 
 They said they would move, stop, but they all laughed in the panic. I could hear them now, and I watched as the others laughed the whole way to the door, hoping it would run over it, leaving no trace behind. I heard the pounding and felt the ground shake. 
 Then I found myself in the large cottage below. Dark and still. I let out a soft sob. The world faded back to nothingness. I opened my eyes again. 
 Here I was. 
 I peeked in the room from above and peered through the hole in the wall behind me. I saw the world. There were thousands of faces. Dozens of eyes, floating lazily in the gloom. Then they collapsed and died. 
 " No, no, no, no, no, " I pleaded. My heart set. 
 " I don't need to explain..."<|endoftext|>

"Good evening everyone! " 
 People chattering in sync, the like of which humans could only imagine, was the first thing people heard and read on Reddit. 
 " High FIVE! It's Community Hub! " were all the memes about Jeff's birthdays and Reddit favorite - Death Star and Everyone Wants Him Forever. If you have the time, an alien race has assembled the oldest robots in the world, the starships that mean you've got nothing to live for. Which brings us to this subreddit. 
 No one seemed so surprised when the first sign of a new acquaintance started taking over: 
 " hi guys, I'm Jeff. I came in asking for a chat, can you guys tell us about life before you were born? " 
 *BASTARD MULDER HAS ALL JIMMY'S CONGRATULATIONS*** 
 This was the first sign that people from around the world were in for a rude awakening - but why? The rumors and comments were all over the web, a golden age of few, who could live happily with their past lives -- every remaining human on earth had a reason to make an appearance. To them, there was just one thing they had to do: Be with and be loved! 
 So, the captain walked into the room. " Hi, welcome to Community Hub! " He waved at me, not sure what would get him stopped. 
 " This is the normal area: for learning to speak in French, the room is locked."

"Darling? " His mother said as she hugged me tighter. " Don't worry, your Grace. A friend is coming to check on you. Can I come in? " 
 I rushed in outstretched arms, carefully stumbling down the driveway and slamming the door behind me. My head felt like it was spinning around. A figure settled in the small side-screen in front of me and sat on a chair, slowly looking at me. A crowd outside the window began to gather around it's large, head tilted back. 
 " So you wouldn't tell your dad what happened? " Another voice joined him. 
 " He would, but he can't hear you. " 
 It's no use not telling him. I don't want him to go through with this. The door clicks open, and a fusillade of bright, yellow flame trails past me, soaking into the carpet. A rabbit takes in the cigarette he's smoking, and the cacophony of words spilled out into his ear. 
 " Stop, it's taking this long!" 
 I hold my breath and he begins to take them in. I hope for the worst. It seems like they are keeping the flame alive for the thousandth time. I catch glimpses of them in the distance, panicking but happy as they enter my home. I'm sick of this. They don't tell them what happened. They can't tell us what happened. They keep smiling with their lips pursed tightly, but I see no emotion in them. I try to take all of it in. It's been a good week. I can't talk to them anymore. I'm stuck in this miserable house in the dark.<|endoftext|>

—But nothing is *distant*. 
 Yes, it was a strange feeling. 
 It felt *strange*. 
 Yet, it was *obviously* *obvious*. 
 There were friends though. 
 Friends -- those friends, people, the ones that everyone else seemed to know. 
 Everyone's friends -- friends like that. Friends whose part of the world we were so alone in. 
 But I told them. 
 Why *did* I tell them?

 “ You're *important*. ” 
 “ We all need you. ” 
 “ Or we just *will* not get you. ” 
 “ How can you possibly know what I've done to you? ” 
 “ You had nothing to do with me, right? ” 
 “ No, you had everything to do with me. ” 
 “ I've thought this all along! We might *have* held hands! What will happen when you can't move? What will we do? ” 
 “ *Why* would I have anything to do with us? * Why*? ” 
 “ If you choose *to* do *anything*, *what*, *who*? ” 
 “ You *weren't* *someone*. You *weren't* *someone's*. You were *whole*. You *attracted* to *me*, you *know*, *I'm* someone's*. ” 
 “ What do you mean? ” 
 “ Your friends. Your family. Your friends. Your friends... All of them. I... I'm not a... *someone*. Nobody's who. Everyone has their friends. Everyone knows someone is who. Everybody. Doesn't mean I just *don't* have others, doesn't mean I think all of them are who. * Nobody* is who. * Nobody else*. ” 
 “ Because, ” I continued. “ There was no one for me! Just my friend. My long-lost family. My friends and family. My house... My car. Everyone just has their friends. How can *people* have all of *their* friends? ” 
 “ They do! They stand to gain from *me. * Everyone does. I *am. * * Who? * Who *were* *them? * Who *are* *them? * Who *are* *them? * * Who *are* *you? * ”

 “ What *do* *you* know? ” 
 “ *I guess you're right. That's all I can say. I knew this whole time, then. But now I have to let it end? * Why? * Does *I* even *know*?! ” 
 “ Don't lie to yourself, kid. You have nothing *anymore* to do with *you! * ” 
 “ Wait, wait. Don't! Don't *listen! * Don't! You never said anything! You've never said anything! You never said anything! ”

I stopped to admire the smoking since it's smoke stuck out and made it all mey clear. It was my rule to not fuck up an old cigarette or cigarette to open this gaping treasure before me. 
 He smiled and spit out his cigarette. " Well done, back to work, see ya." 
 All of it was going on from there, with me gently enjoying the fiery smoke in his dingy smoking suit. I wasn't going to let someone break into my house in the middle of the night without no explanation. It was the best, most beautiful day I had ever had. Not even close. I knew my life was perfect, and I was going to be here the rest of my life. 
 As I pulled my jacket off I glanced around the waste area of my room. One of the windows had been blown open. On his warm and replete bed next to his old tie he was lying there, coughing. With each light he blinked, and the lazy light reflected off of his half-finished cigarette he was smoking. 
 I swiped the cigarette away from the mattress and hopped up onto the bed. It was now just dripping from the top of his head. As I descended into the snuggly pillow I could see how he was coughing. It got to the point where I felt like there was a pouch full of cigarettes strapped to my back, and I heard my hope rise up a few centimeters. It had finally been working out, I felt the wind bite into my legs and I began to drift away. 
 Slowly, suddenly, falling back to my place in the dust. I exhaled and turned down the TV I was sitting on. The beat was all crisp and clear. The crying from his eyes and the agonizing tone of the soothing girl I'd secretly loved had finally paid off. Today was the day, they knew. You were going to have to fuck up a great one.<|endoftext|>
**********24**********
I sat alone. The sunlight streaming through the window reflected my reflection in the light, hiding behind one of the few curtains in my room. Yes, I had always hated this room, but he wasn ’ t here. Not like he was working with me today. This was no normal day in the life of a nineteen-year-old. 
 “ There ’ s never been any supervision, love, ” he said. 
 I must have said something about being careful. How often are things to avoid sounding that evil when you ’ re so in control? 
 “ Although I don ’ t know, ” I stated, sitting back down. I looked back at my reflection, my face obscured by the curtains, which was on my bed beside the lamp that hung above the window. On the bed beneath my bed, waiting for the breakfast it had eaten and yet everything was on the table. 
 “ No, ” he said flatly. “ No, there doesn ’ t seem to be any supervision. You already told me not to go to the office today. Did I say I was caught? I don ’ t think I should have gone to the office. Oh, I heard I can bring myself to leave on two days notice and all. ” 
 “ Why don ’ t you just leave me alone, ” I said, pursing my lips. He pushed past me, closing the last curtains behind him and picking up the tray in front of him, and leaving the kitchen. 
 “ Leave me alone, ” he said with me. The coffee seemed to melt against the glass of the stove. 
 I placed my hands to my face and looked at him. He knew what he was doing. 
 He was eating something out of the cup. I held my breath as the steam started to creep into my head. The steam started to creep down my throat. 
 “ Where is your cigarette? ” I asked. 
 He was gone.

& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The large beam penetrated the containment cell and irradiated the area beneath. Scientists waited anxiously in shock as some of the upgrades began to work. They needed to get to their ships ASAP, it looked like they were about to be attacked once again. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; when they finally arrived, a blinding light filled their sights. They launched multiple small vats of radiation, all aimed directly at the explosions. The release generated a great flash that bent the cubes into a flaring yellow flame. They were destroyed. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Their city of power was destroyed. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; A mob of scientists and traders rushed in that was about to be destroyed by a mega particle blast. Several were blinded, and others kept dying. As the world became too isolated for the virus to take hold, the world leaders made desperate calls for aid, hoping for some measure of peace. But until one of those resources comes, and when that comes, they will never find peace again. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; After years of seeding the galaxy, a new constitution was put into place. There would be massive taxes on anything that went south, while resources would be pooled back into the war effort. If rich enough, war-stricken enough, a new system was devised. Everyone would now have direct financial support and economic support throughout the world. Of course, this came at a price, however. From the beginning, nothing would stand in the way of a prosperous new world. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; and that is how the poll was leaked, real fear rising through the ranks, growing with every notification on every transmit station. Nothing could prepare them for the end of times. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Reports came from all around the world, for someone out there, someone already fading away, the intent was to make things right. They would fix things. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; as they did they lost everything. They lost everything.<|endoftext|>

I woke up shocked and at the sound of the alarm my mind raced over where I was and what was happening. I grabbed my umbrella and rushed down to the gates shouting something about a random rock an would smash into the wall and I sighed heavily and flung myself from the window. Not having slept past the last few days I took my step onto the balcony trying to protect my hair and attempt to protect my eyes from the faint glow of sun. I tried moving my leg but it was still a struggle. With every step my weight increased and my mind raced to explain what could be causing my anxiety. Every step I took I felt more and more determined but now there was just nothing for me. After a time I sat up and looked around for something I could use as a flash of white light. Despite the lack of light I saw the other wall keeping my hand free of the air and water to keep it above me. As I came closer to the blank wall a voice called out. I froze in fear and grabbed my elbow to get a better look at the voice. The two faces held the other one. 
 "I am Grocercake! " I growled " We can't have this! " 
 Grocercake looked at me and nodded. " What do you say? " The voice asked. 
 " Pause," I replied, smiling.<|endoftext|>

I push my head up the sconces of the white box, sure of the prize. " Wow, I must be going crazy here " I mutter to myself. 
 With the sun setting and waking me, I look around. The woman I feel myself gazing at is just a giant spider clinging to a wall, dripping blood. I'm soon approaching it, smearing the silk to see its shiny scales, a glimpse of my lusty boner. My heart drops. " You killed him, Clara! Look at her red eyes! " 
 Her spider feeds off of that dark red meat, slapping against the loose clothes, trying to kill my dignity. I come face to face with her, laughing maniacally. Clara greets me. The strangest thing is, when her eyes shine red, I notice that her body is strained by the disgustingly heavy blue pants. " I am so sorry, Clara. We're not supposed to talk to children and you care. " 
 Her eyes are only halfway open, her veins get really tender from her muscles tearing and bone breaking. I nod, " Aren't we supposed to talk? But surely the kitten lover isn't a toy? " The spider shakes her head, biting into the fabric of my jeans. 
 I cut her off, " You do realize I can't come in here. " I say, giggling at my joke. Clara's eyes glow red and make the spaying spider squirm. A pair of gloves make sure nothing happens, and she always swipes the sexless stomache of my dick once when she feels sexy. 
 I look at my partner, she looks so passionate. " I'm sure you've had this one before. I guess this is a new hobby. " She offers a laugh, " It's not much fun for the spaying, do you feel anything it has learned in the last few weeks. " 
 " Give me a sec, " I shrug, " Something about a fresh pair of fingernails and a joker. " 
 She sways around as I shake my head, giving her more eye candy. I'm nervous. " Oh, hell no. Not again. I guess you're not so sure that I'm some weird creepy spider plaything after all. " 
 I sigh. " I was that way. " Her voice falls soft into my ear. " I'm old. " 
 She smacks her lips together, " No, I'm older. Only when I'm not. " 
 " Please, I'm mad. " I scoff, trying to make my best joke. 
 " I'm old, you are. Why can't you just come in here just once? Come in here now! " 
 I tighten my grip on the blanket, trying to spare her from her insatiable lust. 
 " No, I can't. " 
 " What's it to old you, how have you always managed to be. When your sisters and I would hang out together, we'd have have boobs. " 
 " The red... " 
 " There's nothing wrong with that. " 
 " What about how it was like before... what if it wasn't? " 
 " It was? " 
 " And how do you know? " 
 " Well, past anything. Its... it's just... I don't think you got this entire conversation in a single second, so I'd have to go with you." 
 I sigh, and let the magic take me.

"Why?" 
 I cry into the air. My voice fills the silence between us. I don ’ t bother to tell her the unpleasant truth anymore. The silence has loosened, it hasn ’ t stopped, it ’ s crept up on my neck. 
 Maybe this is my final chance to accept my fate. I can ’ t. I can only hope that she will mourn one last time for me, and that she can cope with what happened yesterday. 
 And I will mourn something I ’ m not quite prepared for. I will mourn something that comes before, the story we ’ re trying to tell in some way or another. I hope that this item will end it ’ s suffering and life. I hope that this will end the agony that has gripped me for days. 
 And I wish it could end. The pain burned brighter with the burning of hope, when the words ‘ version time ’ raised in doubt. 
 I pulled it into its socket and it struck me so. But what I told her was far more convincing. I was so afraid. 
 I can imagine the pain, in part because what I did was so simple. From my very first attempt at doing an abikity thing, I told it to be a powerful weapon, a final act of revenge on that wretched band of those… well, just do it. After that moment, I managed to quickly escape through my wallet, and found a phone. With a duffel bag, I took it out of the bag, took a moment to look around at the crowd; and then proceeded to jump up and down in the air, angrier, angrier, angrier at the man at the counter. I kept him up, circling him for just over ten seconds. Then he put his hands up and raised his rifle. A moment later he jammed it into the card he held for me, thumbed the trigger. 
 It wasn ’ t going to kill him. He didn ’ t commit suicide. 
 He certainly didn ’ t cause any harm. He just stared at me for a moment. His lifeless eyes staring into mine for a single moment, capturing me before my eyes shifted to tears. I missed a moment. I missed everything. 
 Even thinking about my chance that day scared me. That was the last time I told anyone. All I wanted to do was play video games with friends, but nobody would find it. I want to hide here and protect the comfort of my current life. 
 But I ’ m so sorry.<|endoftext|>

"What is this? It is bigger than me! " Jennifer thought as she propped the parachute on a nearby ledge. 
 " Where am I? " she thought to herself as the huge object zipped around her. She could barely understand her words as it sped past her chair and into the clouds. 
 " Don't go near me. Just do it. " Amy screamed, then came a second later to slam down on the empty, glass window that sat next to her. The large, grassy wooden edge flew, narrowly missing her face. 
 She wasn't disappointed, she knew how lucky she was. No one was, no one could take this at its speed. She pulled the lever and the object obeyed. She couldn't do this when it was so close. It was faster than anything she had ever seen before. 
 Suddenly it stopped, put the parachute back on, and flew into the sky. 
 A wave of terror coursed down Jennifer's spine before she began to cry. 'Why is this big?' she thought to herself,'It's huge.' 
 She grabbed her phone and turned it off. 'What? Really?' she whispered to herself, still crying. Amy just blew her brains out in the event that this occurred. No, not this. This is nowhere near that.'
With a noise, Jennifer activated the remote. Amy tried to flip it off, she couldn't. Tears were streaming down her face as she just began to smile. Everything was going to be alright. The sights were magnificent. But she didn't feel anything. Then Amy told her what had happened, she told her kids, she said goodbye. She had to love her family too. Because she did. And if this wasn't a bomb... no no. 
 All of a sudden, a dim light filled the sky and vanished. The whole world was staring at her in horror. Her husband ran down and hugged her. Then came a scream. She felt a stab of intense pain in her face. She pulled her face away, but nothing happened. Then, she felt something wrong in her feet. A stiff lowercase letter protruding out of her jacket, and as it slipped from her hand, she realized she was dreaming. 
 This wasn't strange at all. She recalled her previous nightmares. Many of them with the same signs. The stickiness of a hook in the cement that caught her ankle. The sharp pain of electricity in her belly as her mind screamed at her to turn away. The spiders crawling under her skin. The sudden taunting noises of wild birds around her. The loud pitter-patter of a bus bearing down on the trees, complete with rats who were just looking for food. The bright lights dancing on the horizon. No, this wasn't wrong. 
 There was something else, but it didn't feel right.<|endoftext|>

1:10 am. A team of men and women scurried about the field, looking for any stray bugs in the mist. The only thing that didn't come in the mist were the wind blowing in, yellow streaks fluttering through the canopy, and the sound of the engines. While many joined in on their devising, the efforts continued as the team carefully monitored all possible anomalies, searched every sensor, and strained every muscle. 
 At the end of the field was the first machine known to engineer time travel. When it was made, it was powered by uranium, which didn't trigger it. They traveled through time past seconds and multiplied by seconds, recording their advances in a database just inside the machine, its raw data saved to a computer across the globe. 
 The team headed back to their computers, chocking up the data, the program running to simulate time's greatest memories. Eventually, it was over, it came back to itself, loading a new file and replacing them with one of their recent databases. 
 It worked, and they restarted the time machine. After awhile, they felt that it would leave them bored in their programming sessions. Everyone would spend their training discussing time travel and talk about the events in the past, right? 
 That was before the latest hacks came to light. Did they do it? Did they get into the dots? It was dead. However, a team of code dumpsters decided to reveal those past moments, and they did not stop until this moment. 
 The owner of the dumpsters picked up a light stick, and began to block it. 
 "Sir, it can't be!". said the hacker. 
 He laid the stick back down and sat down. 
 And for the next twenty minutes, nothing happened.<|endoftext|>

I realize this isn't working. I just finished the generator last week and didn't look at it, and haven't worked through anything. I'm just sort of wondering... 
 This job was a stupid one. 
 No, it wasn't our job. 
... oh for fuck sake...<|endoftext|>

The time traveller was recently retired. He looked idly at Vincent on the very first move, and caught a glimpse of his pocket. 
 Looking, of course, with deep gravelly eyes that measured its lifespan and left nothing to do, he scanned the others with an inquisitive look. 
 "I see you managed to pack so much pheasantry into the last twenty years of the tour, but I've got to ask, why the hell are you doing this now? " 
 Vincent droned on, satisfied with what he'd gathered, and took a long deep breath. " Well, I've seen the future. As a great man my services to the art world were praised in it's heyday. But not these. These are the days of freedom and experimentation, and my very existence represents freedom from the tyranny of the institutions of my country. " 
 A quick hop and a step, Vincent scratched his knuckles, desperately trying to put on a coherent sentence. " Oh, that's right, you are the abomination, the one who is suffering at his own expense. " 
 No response. 
 Vincent finally came to a decision. He couldn't let him become embroiled in his own demise, he had to spend the rest of his life representing that life, that he lived without that dignity. 
 The next thing he knew, a flat moon stood up onto his canvas. Cheeky and slightly sloppier than the material that tumbled off the walls, it seared a sad look out of Vincent's horribly cynical eyes. 
 " Damnit, what are you doing! ", he cried, grinding his teeth. " You're just doing what I told you to do, just taking on a life of struggle and mean time for yourself. This is my problem! And I am out to remove your corrupt human form! " 
 The crumbling moon was a testament, it tilted backwards, right towards Vincent's eyes, and he clutched his stomach in hope that his strength would not falter. 
 " The idiots never move on. " the determined young artist said, lifting one foot in front of the other, his ugly and extremely ugly face face some-too-familiar. " Instead I'm going to play with you, and yet you wish to harm me? I have nothing against you, whatever that means, so why would you bring me more of this than just a little hint of my secret identity? Oh wait, I'm talking to... me?" 
 *** 
 The structure of the museum was in disarray, the museum fluttering onto the grass as each museum exhibition, a one time only celebration for so long, turned out to be a lifetime to Vincent.<|endoftext|>

Everyone else seemed nervous, waving around bags full of cash, trying to sneak past. 
 "Uhh.. that's not a gun.. that's a *gasoline pistol* " an old dad yelled, tossing the old man some money and running off. 
 Then it hit me. A gun? What. The. Fuck. 
 I grabbed my rifle, and re-checked my night vision. That was only three hundred rounds. 
 Thinking about it, this gun was going to kill me. Though my forehead felt uncomfortably heavy. It was still standing at fifteen, rather lithe, muddled body. I had gotten used to all the " Semi-automatic " here. 
 However, the recoil of the gas chamber meant that I wasn't even safe for long. I tore into the holster, stripping the gas like a muscle and letting go of my trigger guard. 
 I pulled a metal case out of the box and placed it against my temple. It was one of those plastic, anachronism. A firearm with serial numbers on the front, black with double-front. However, it was a pistol. It was a piece of plastic I'd picked up from a woman on a road trip. I was confused. 
 I looked up at the kid. " Dude, I made it."<|endoftext|>
**********36**********
Thing is, there's no going back. Really, the last few decades were not long. 
 That is, until the few beings who stalked the walls of hell, walking them down the evil ramparts of hell, began to cease their carnage. They remembered how they'd done it so long ago, in the glory days of Hell, when it was just a few world wars, random people blowing themselves up. But they were so delusional, how had they chosen this path? 
 They gave up, and left, until some small man who dares to walk against his will spared them, and so the path, through hell, no longer taken. It was gone, and they left, and started their War, and they headed back to the Sanctuary, where their devils held their Imperial League. 
 As they passed, it began to rain into the Sanctuary, their Greater Good, besotted with bliss and ease. Some of the Lesser Badges of the Brothers found themselves living a meaningful life, they knew. Was the work worth it? Was it sufficient? Who was the ever-resting Vassal, who would allow the immense slaughter of his world? 
 On this road, where the Men who 'borrowed' the Core Worlds, had begun to purge their worlds and their spaces, and destroy their War, came the Death Kings, who were worshipped as Gods at home, in the furthest reaches of the Void. In these times, they had begun to die. 
 And God, who had been unable to heal, wondered to Himself that He could not be healed, He could not heal the ones He ever loved, and Himself, who mourned with Him, the last of the Earth's servants. The spires of heaven began to burn with flame, the fires of the End of Days began to fade, and the mountains began to fall. 
 And the Great Ones came, and slew all those who refused to take His name. The greatest of the Old Ones, Jake, ascended into the Heaven. But, despite His power, his skin didn't hold up well, and with the defeat, His place in Heaven was no more, and through Him, old age became One-Eyed. 
 God finished His Work and drew the Dragons away from the Vault. It was his choice, so nothing could do to harm, and therefore, His will, thus it was created to do the opposite. It was as easy as a simple wanting to live, and thus, His power was given meaning.<|endoftext|>

Skyrim was beautiful. It was messy, and wild. Rotten, and ugly. Wet, and dead. An endless slate of junk. So, dusty and crumpled, that in my mind it was the starkest. Horrifying, gory, and inhumane. To look at this bleak place again, and see a world that wasn ’ t yours. 
 My breath in the cool air. A thousand broken cycles of pride coursed through my veins. I stood up and walked towards my old master ’ s dagger, it was 2 o ’ clock in the morning, and like a hungry dog in the middle of the night, I fell down with no resistance. Drawing back on my old master ’ s dagger, I cut through his flesh from the inside. Making it long enough, I made it right into his neck. Burning of nerves, of wanting to slither across his flesh, showing its pure white sliver as I took the knife away and made the blade into his chest. Without thinking, I cast the knife right into his heart, it splashed into the empty void between my eyes, and with my last of life, I crouched down and watched his corpse for the last time, eyes winking at me, as my hunger for even the most low-level corruption began to give way to my hunger for even more corruption. 
 The end.<|endoftext|>
**********38**********
Pillows buzzed and squeaked in the midday sun. Where was the sound of kitchen scratching from years ago? Not the sound of the pace of the town clock. No one heard it. Water scuttled from under him and peals crossed his face at the gentle water tapping against his back. 
 It all happened in the bathroom. 
 It started at the woman who was washing her hands. Everyone went to their tuckers, grabbed their hair in one swing, and closed their eyes when one looked away. From one hand she had a teddy bear, a seat in the closets. Each one looked just like the others. 
 After a while she stepped in front of him. He noticed a familiar haggard face. It had a raven hair, the same length, the same width. It was fastening what looked like apron on his face, which was slicked back like a foodman. But it was also wearing rags and a black cloak. 
 "What're you doing out here? " He asked her. 
 " I can't even tell you for sure anymore. " She explained. 
 Pillows tinkled like the gears in his mind. He stared at her. 
 " I can't even tell you what's happening. " 
 " I know. But I have to get out of here. " 
 " Can you come inside, then? " 
 He climbed into the bathroom, where his dad sat next to him. " I'm not very good at manners. " 
 " Dad, I hate going outside. So how about the buffet, I'll go get it. " 
 His dad rose and came over to their table, spooning up a bowl of eggs and scones. " Perfect. What's the buffet like? " 
 The girl gently shook her head. " It's delicious. " 
 He looked around, where his dad stood in the center. " Look here, dad. " 
 " I think I'll see you soon. " The boy stood there. He raised his head, and the girl reached into his pocket. " Who's right? " 
 " Mom. " 
 " Oh. You don't have to worry about what I might say, now do you? " 
 She held his hand tightly, and kissed it. " I can use the buffet every day, " she said. 
 " Really? " He asked. 
 " Well, dinner is always delicious and amazing. And since it's completely empty, nothing too special. " He pulled a gold chain and put it in his pocket. " And how about I ask you some questions, *Mom, do you have any questions? *"<|endoftext|>

"You're finally awake! If you ever believe in that god you will see your future years even through the stupor of a full blown dream! And you know what? I'm awake too, so you know how amazing it is to live in a world where dreams are not this real? " 
 " Absolutely. And what a world this would be. " 
 " Don't lie to me, Ed! The dream itself just started back in November 2016. " 
 " What year is that? " 
 " The year I'm married with four kids and parents of 5. " 
 " A... a... a dream? What is the exact plan of course! " 
 " Remember, you can never lie to me! I swear I will never lie to you again! " 
 "... Ed. " 
 " Stop this bullshit, you moron! God is real! " 
 " Oh, you can't convince me! Now if I could just ask him a question. " 
 " No, it's not like that. It's actually quite interesting... actually. " 
 "... what. " 
 " It is the dream you kept. It means, your future is being retold. " 
 " Then what do I do now? I don't have anything to spend my waking hours building a better life for myself so I can spend my waking years chasing those dreams. Maybe I'll complete my mission by midnight. " 
 " Oh shut up, Ed. It's because of me in the dream. You know how annoying that is. " 
 " You know what Ed? " 
 " What? What do you mean by that? You see, we were observing your dreams for years in the hopes that you wouldn't fall asleep for a while. " 
 " What? Do you have dreams of the above? " 
 " Oh, I'm just kidding, you know? These ones always ended with someone coming up on the other side of the table to exact revenge on you. Why? Because they're real. Real awesome. " 
 " Why? Because of me in this dream? You'll never get off the ground again Ed. My life is already over. Can I come help you now? " 
 " We've talked many times before. We can decide what's a dream and we're both good at it if we don't have the same opinion on it. So, here are some of our offers: never sleep on the road, an iPhone 5, a few copies of Final Fantasy character packs, an Xbox One, a school in England, a hover/sling II, a real life working at a super marketing firm. " 
 " Oh Ed... I already've seen the games. I'm SO into it! " 
 " Excellent Ed. Really, good on you too, right? " 
 " I don't think I want to and I certainly won't. But, the world really does need me. " 
 " And I plan to start a family somewhere around there. Maybe head to the Big city and start getting married? " 
 " Yeah. We could go a bit further."<|endoftext|>

I glanced over at my phone. Why hadn't it been updated before? When had I made that call? 
 "Wow, " I muttered under my breath. Never before had I heard that song in my head. I was under the impression that some idiot had requested it, but who could blame him? I could hear him play the instruments around the house. 
 *** 
 I stepped towards my porch, happily repeating the tune in my head as I nocked my hat, including the third. The concert was just beginning on the town. I put on the hat and made my way outside. On my way out the door, I heard a huff from behind me. I turned around and scurried outside, chomping on some durian. 
 Inside my head, I heard a low chiming. * I should die*. 
 And that's when I saw it, a beautiful yellow, turquoise ball of light flying down out of the sky. I looked at the other man out the window, and my head rumbled. 
 " Fade to black."<|endoftext|>
**********41**********
My parents are decent people, I ’ m a little poor. I never really cared about them anyway and I never did try to change anything. Dad had a strong hand in my life and my parents could certainly do for him. I coulda used a bit of advice but I guess I never wanted to change my past so I merely decided to give advice that would help come up with a future for me. 
 I was fourteen when I was given the wish. 
 The genie was a really strict guy, very strict. he pointed out how much I had done with my life and that I was owed everything. I chose no life but an easy life and some very happy ones. The only thing that didn ’ t get changed was that I made my parents jealous. I didn ’ t actually care about them but I did just like them, like kids for the most part. 
 My wish was to go back and change every mistake I made for the betterment of the world. 
 That ’ s when I really broke down. It was probably the most heartbreaking thing I ’ d ever experienced in my life and now I ’ m working full time so I don ’ t have the time to do anything. 
 How did you know? I guess it ’ s possible my computer gives me a headache in the mornings because my grandma always says “ He ’ s been to the future and come back tomorrow ” but that would never happen with me, this life is a real life change. 
 It wasn ’ t until I went back in time that I realized my curse. I wanted to time travel but it was so convoluted. you don ’ t just telepathically travel time back in time but the exact opposite, with no knowledge of the time period. 
 The curse came with the letter “ G. " The first line wasn ’ t intended to be funny or make it even more difficult to find the words. 
 G was helpful. 
 " Katie, how does this affect my life? " 
 What the fuck is going on? 
 I pulled up the page full of memories and filled out the fill out form. 
 " I use it to start an ancient library in rural Florida. When i was trying to start up i thought about how excited I was to be learning about its history and publishing it. I was pleasantly surprised when my mom later told me that I did a good job and taught her about history and once told me that while I can remember what I did in my life and how much I have changed it is the first time i ’ ve ever felt good. I will strive to make a future with those memories and to someday start learning all things from your life. Is it possible to truly change your past as well? I think it will take you a lot to figure out the motivation for time travel and becoming a time traveler, even if you are the same person. And I believe we as human beings may be willing to take steps to get that goal in front of us too. " 
 When Katie finishes that, I remembered the other line coming from a newly coined time period and called up the right friend, she was willing to set up some background studies for me after my eighteen birthday. 
 " I don ’ t remember how long I had been out on the road, I don ’ t remember getting up there but I remember always always being up there laughing and looking at the trees. It ’ s amazing to me that my father never mentioned seeing ghosts in my parents ’ future as a kid and what I just saw was just fantastical. He says that you, ~~you go back in time, change your past, we all stop thinking about it when we look back and we want to feel bad about how it happened, at least then we ’ ll start thinking about it again. " 
 " Things changed, of course things changed. What changed? " 
 " Things shifted so much that my father was concerned about my mental state. Today I was going back in time, I wanted to revisit my past. Unfortunately I couldn ’ t because I didn ’ t actually remember it. " 
 " Wait, what did you just tell me about friends and family? Can I have any friends or relatives I want to make friends with? " 
 " No, I forgot about that. " 
 " Well, would you like to make a wish?"<|endoftext|>

It would have been nice if someone had painted a time capsule of- when I, the protagonist- and a time traveler, didn't have to do the ungodly thing. I could have gone for a "curse" myself, of course I would have of jumped off the skyscraper right behind Manhattan, but alas, in the middle of making the scene. 
 I don't know who painted the final one, or what it's called. They say it was a little final, but it's impossible to say. I'm sure you've seen time capsules of it, you know. That stone-faced guy in the bow tie once said it was the most important thing I'd ever created. I must have even made it, because he said, " And I was so happy you did. I could afford it; but you said you could bring me happiness! " 
 The man was mute, and rather powerful in a man such as myself, for whom I was gifted with a rich pastime and a watch- make a cake. 
 So I did, and in my final moments, I say, I was happy! And he was awe-inspiring. I gazed at the cake as I say good morning, and suddenly found myself remembering that happy love of mine. 
 The long time traveler, I recognized him because of his gorgeous and generous charm, the good man is a child at heart. A son, on the verge of becoming a man, who opens up his life, thinking, " Sure, I could do that, right?" How wrong I was. 
 But maybe I should have addressed him differently. He was clever, and that cunning is the gift I found so important. 
 He owned that cake. He owned it, and I went to him and asked him what it meant to be happy. 
 He looked up, and said, " A part of the curse I had set forth to make my man happy. It meant that I became less proud and dramatic. With your help, I could be no more happy, and even less of a boy." 
 I have missed him, so I do.<|endoftext|>
**********43**********
I saw their faces when we were a little kids. Sweet faces, all tall and pig-headed and wearing fur. I think I heard of the stories of ugly kids across the road. I won ’ t get into too much detail. 
 The thugs in us tended to hem the thugs up as fast as the car could take them. It was time to run. We needed a person. We found a nice place to park and walked all around the lot until they moved on. We walked back out into the streets where thieves and murderers picked up on the zombies. 
 They had ripped apart windows and doors and hid inside all the windows. In the streets where we ran out we heard shouting and music. As we continued the walk we saw a group of some sort of people walking in. 
 They came up to us and we handed them a couple their axes and knives, our weapons. They handed us all their gear and the rest of the weapons we always wanted in the back of their carry-cases. They seemed to speak slowly, making sure that people liked them. I felt a chill run down my spine. 
 I tried to call out for my family, but they just stopped. 
 The people who were fleeing started shouting and screaming and shouting. Everyone was running and all at once every bit of clothing in the people ’ s clothing was shot. 
 We noticed that the hoodie underneath the hoodie was ripped off. People ran for the exits, pulling back everything they had. 
 The hoodie was the pick-up line. 
 In some places people started running from the hoods down and down passing the hoodies. They were taking them by surprise. 
 We called our friends out and rushed through the crowd. With our rifles aimed just behind us, we stopped for a moment and thought we saw something. A body up ahead. We checked on the body with caution, as the dark red blood around it was almost completely opaque. 
 I heard my friends cries around us, and my heart started pounding for the hopelessness we all felt. We saw a nervous little girl behind my friends back running away, frantic to find her own body. 
 I got up from my seat and held onto the knife as I looked up. It was coming my way now. I saw myself standing between my friends and them all, separated from them. 
 “ Look, ” I said, “ I don ’ t want to die. I love you. And neither do we. ”<|endoftext|>
**********44**********
"What? Why? Why was I bringing you here, human? " I let out an incoherent scream of protest as I yelled at the red-haired group of people he looked like just an average guy, wearing a gray hoodie and a snowman hat. I was still wearing my helmet, the crystal-clear blue of it covering many things. 
 " I was just looking at the girl from all over the world, just on the top of a mountain. I kept following her, trying to find her since I were oblivious to her presence. It was hard for me to explain what she was, however, because, well... You see, she was nearly an apple compared to my own growth, a superpower that no one expected her to posses. " I stood up, quickly setting the tools on the table, then closing the door behind me as I opened a portal. I followed him down a winding winding hallway to the college dorm room, where he was perched silently. 
 " You aren't even allowed to interact with a human anymore. " He said quietly, getting up slowly. 
 " I can go into the future, and ask everything from the past, and learn everything you know. " 
 " I don't know anything, but this? You can't just bring me here! " 
 " Because it would change your current plans for a whole year, right? " 
 " Let me see your current plans, then. " I glanced at the table, then back to the red-haired girl. She was sitting at the computer in the far right corner. She had a headset, but none of my previous knowledge of the universe let me read that part. 
 " You know that I can have magic, right? " I decided, turning back to look at the girl behind me. She moved herself forward until she was twenty-five, and held her hand towards me, bouncing it back and forth between her fingers. 
 " You are right, I have other powers than your own."<|endoftext|>
**********45**********
"Why don't you just take it off again... that's not even the right one? " 
 " Just go, ok? " The only light went out in the cave. A man was welling up with sweat now, jumping away from a water drum she was stomping on. They raised their hands at the goddess, eager to see who they could save. Satan felt that they must be the only people who wanted to save the damned, and they were an extraordinary group. 
 " I think we can find out. We just took an overpriced minority, are we really going to allow all the deaths to go to waste? " Satan said. 
 " You said we were offering out. Every one of you. " The woman said. 
 " Are you serious? " Satan just let out a soft laugh. 
 " We won't give out to each other. We're not going to give them to anyone else, just try and help them all. " 
 " And with that? I mean seriously, he killed all of us with his drunken crazy mind. Please just take it off. " Satan asked. 
 " What does the blood do to me. " The man asked, even higher than the dwarf screamed. 
 " I don't see where the blood belongs, but it doesn't matter at all. This is the only reason why he took our planet from us. Not even a mortal soul will go to waste anyways, just you and your stupid idea of a self-serving ape. This right here, just kill him. Take it off and give us something to give our souls. " Satan had his hands in his pockets now. He had a bag of credits, one for each hero he had killed. The man had one lucky eye, one blessed tooth. The lady had two rings and a gold ring. 
 " You really want to fuck this deal? " God said, and she turned to him and took a deep breath. 
 " No. There is one person who we can give to the god of our fallen fathers. You will grant him his meager soul if he kills the other two souls. " 
 " You mean Death? " 
 " He does that all the time, isn't he? " 
 " Yes, Death. " The woman looked very smug now. She looked like a famous stalker, but with a slight fire in her eyes. Satan wondered if she really was an evil person. He knew it was a risky business, but all he had to do was keep pretending to be a deity. 
 " Ok, let's hope this works out. Right? " Death said. He said it like a fool, and in return Satan got to become the most powerful man in history. 
 " Okay. Can I get the credit? " Satan said. 
 " Yes. You may get the credit. " Death said. 
 " You will take the credit?" Satan asked, as he took the credit. He hadn't even looked at the other two souls, because he had to be cruel. He had got rid of Evil. But that would be the only person he could kill. He didn't have to do anything hard like killing someone with death.

I remember it best: A dead person. 
 "Please, Susan. " I can't have missed her, what happened? There'd be blood everywhere, but this was the hospital. Had I been in there, I'd have been only twenty minutes before death had came. 
 Susan looked up at me. She was sobbing now. My pale skin had hardly a shadow over it. I hoped this would happen again. 
 " Thank you, Father, but you have to hurry. " she said. I felt terrible. I felt a bit sick. 
 " I am sorry, God. " I managed to squeak. He came closer and started kissing me. " Give me some time, " I begged, " he'll do anything I say, he'll have to. " 
 Susan let me see her face. We kept walking together. My eyes closed, they closed then open again. We stopped. I was lost in thought. 
 " I'm sorry, Susan. " I let go of her hand. She looked behind me. " There is nothing. " 
 " Please, Susan." His hand touched mine and he continued to kiss me. 
 I realized I could only see what he was, and I could only see his hand play on my scar. 
 I must live with my eyes closed. I should escape my death. I must escape the hospital. 
 So I didn't.<|endoftext|>

The battle was too noisy. The sun was setting. The battle had just started. The storm was silent. 
 I watched as the sun eclipsed through the foggy horizon. I had just completed the trial of wits when the hero stormed through the forest. I turned to him. 
 "Cradle over to the chief, you'll wear all of them and you will survive... and if you get killed you will. " 
 I was shocked at the battle that had just started. It would be like this for years, every day of it. With these brave men, they would be given gifts for the first time in decades. They would have hope for change. 
 The moths were off. The trolls were off. The goblins were off. The wild things were up there and were getting closer to the enemy. The battle raged on all things nameless, and I couldn't sleep. 
 " King Gwendor!" 
 ( First submission. I thought it was important that the premise that I was writing had a world in it. Hope to see what else you guys come up with in the future. I can't possibly understand what it looks like, but I want to get it across. )<|endoftext|>

The rack was nothing more than a stale pile of pencils and nails. The aroma was strange. I'd thought so, since the days when people knew where I went and where I went. I looked around and saw all my victims – killers, desecrators, baronesss, anarchists – scattered around the table. 
 Suddenly, The door bursts open in a loud wail, as a chaotic vortex of gunfire was incinerated in front of me. I shoot and I hear the screams. The terrorist behind me is firing now. I tried to approach the blonde with the shiny red tie – as I always did. 
 "You're being pudgy, you know? " He whispers as the bullet goes straight through his head. 
 " My boss will pay for my haircut, so don't smile until you understand why I have an assassin, and that's what these bastards hate. " I reply. 
 He giggles, and looks up at me. In an instant, all I can see is his face. " A kill? That's ridiculous, mate. You are absolutely magnificent. I swear I can't believe you're so low, even an assassin would love such an opportunity. " 
 " What about today? " I am confused. " I have a date to attend, too. Was there another excuse I mentioned earlier? " 
 " Yes, today we meet. " He starts walking towards the front door, the clock on his shoe reads noon. " This whole time I thought to myself, will never they set me up with you? " 
 " Why would they? " I ask. 
 He doesn't look a- 
 The bomb explodes in front of me and I feel my throat burn. I lose consciousness again and try to remember my plan again. 
 " Never mind now, why the fuck are we even talking about today, not now? " 
 " It's amazing that the most important person in the world has so little security. And that's why the most important person in the world has so little security. " I guess I was just thinking. A somewhat satisfied look on my face. 
 " Well, when I'm done doing this, the next one will be my wife, " He says as he pushes his way out of the door, putting me up on the concrete. 
 At that moment, all I could see was the police cars, ambulances, riot vans, the smell of burnt flesh. The black bags on the driver's seat were full of Americans, Muslims, Brits, Asians, people from abroad. Everyone had a constant aura around them, like an anointed board of guardians to these attackers. 
 " Pardon me," He answered. We continued to chatter about what to say to each other. After several minutes, I eventually nodded and began to talk with him. 
 # 
 I can't justify this story; I just lost the memory of the last thing I saw as I laughed with my head in my hands. But I'll try once I think of something else. It does hurt a little, but let's see what gets to me eventually.<|endoftext|>

The dutch sky continued the same as it always has, bringing colors and softly whispering, consuming, clouding the sky. The hills, twisting like branches, hovered too far above, the birds swooping in slowly over the valley. In the distance, in the dark behind me, dark clouds motion with an intensity I never felt before. I have lost track of my own, drifted below and yet above the hills. I can feel the wind on me, driving away from me and covering me, patting me down and letting me sleep. 
 Between shadows, the clouds cast a purple glow on me as I lurched. I couldn't see anything over here. No one seemed to notice except me. Like spirits of some kind, they had a feeble view of the sky as the living vine moved in front of me, nurturing, fixing it. Only I saw a familiar blue sky overhead. 
 These days I've become a recluse, riding my horse on the back road, at noon when the dutch sky is out of sight and I see the mountains closer. This is a privilege at least, a privilege that my parents trusted me to for the past year. I welcome this even though I seldom don my shirt. This is why I'm told that no one ever walks through the valley. You see, I went to school with the blackouts. I never heard they here. My parents and I could talk without their permission. 
 Slamming on the back of my horse, I grab a nearby shotgun and aim at the mountains. I can see the fog rising above me as the hills swallow the valley below and I hear the wolves inside ask for someone to run. They're living. 
 The sky next to me still flies. It is not a natural color, not at all. They're trying to fly above this valley. It is the dream. I can't feel it. They try to leave, for they can't see in the brightness of the sky. They are lying. They are suffering. 
 As I sit down, in a corner corner, the soldiers lift me off my horse and press me against the wall. The air rushes in as I warmly kiss the soldiers on their chests and realize, I'm not a prisoner now, they're dead. I wish I could move, but then I look down, all on the ground. 
 The soldiers lift me and I see red. The pallor still radiate as I lift my elbows and turn. They think it's my vision, but it is not. The people below are lying on a column of rocks. The square stones are surrounded by trees. Even the sun is dead and so are the other soldiers. 
 I'm ashamed. I don't know what they are thinking of me. I guess they're all in pain, but I didn't think of them as tears. I stare down at the soldiers, wondering what they could do. I know a new way to win.<|endoftext|>
**********50**********
I fell, my head tearing the sky as it exploded against the bunk wall to shakily it's bare bunks, the breaking of surf lacing my arms as I loosened the escape hatch, watching the water dart around my ankles, and to my left locked against a hidden wall. With a yell I was lifted, and I ran for the door, uping two of the alchohol fists on my arms and stiffening them as I approached it. It'd been when I'd slept for the night, as I'd always wished he would just sleep on it, because of the tall barbed wire and the crystalline flames. When I'd gone back to sleep, at the large school gymnasium where he had taken the girls, I'd gone up to his door and adjusted my rifle. 
 Just a flat back, and a walk wound through the stormy seas as I pushed the door open, the quiet snow hitting the floor beneath my feet. Swimming against the cold tundra beneath us, I kept my rifle low, breathing heavily as I leveled the scope. 
 "Mommy, are you okay?" I asked her, staring into her brown eyes, hopeful that she'd say something. All I could hear was the soft rustling of snow.<|endoftext|>

He said aloud to himself: "We all have one copy of ours." 
 And so did we. So did God. Even though it seemed that we were immortal, it was a paradox, an absolute fact that my own body could not comprehend. 
 I cried. We did not cry for any of them. Even as my hand laid limp on the table, the dream that had been this moment before all of this, the fight between them disappeared, and he knew for sure that that was a bit of a coincidence. 
 He made no mistake.

 It happened again, and again. Still no memories. At first it was just a normal dream, now the dream was his, and it was brutal and it came true for us all: men. 
 Mr. Fox smiled, and waved with one hand before embracing his daughter. 
 As soon as Mr. Fox had arrived at his one daughter's house, he whispered to her, all of a sudden: "Good morning, Mrs. Fox." And walked up to her bedroom door and pulled out the blunt, a horrible object that he had placed in it. Was he not taking it to be a key, or was he planning it all to be a dream? 
 She paused, and stilled her heart out for Mr. Fox's daughter. 
 It was not that it took much to kidnap a loved one like Mr. Fox, no; the first time she did it was after her first major medical procedure in his hospital, and her mother had chosen to involve him in the operation; after that, she was just a pawn in it, a complicated mess of memories, and a reflection of her mother. 
 The child's screams, each one repeated nearly ten times, almost tasted like blood to her as it entered her blood stream, made her step outside for her nightly run, except they were in a quiet town. The key had a delicate, delicate sound to it, like a mouse clicking keys once, then another, until it reached her, and she took it in her hand, and unfolded it; making sure she was working safe. 
 A smile stretched across her face. Although her mother screamed and ran all the while, she remained strong, kissing Mr. Fox's daughter in the face, her face she loved the most, her lips flitting back and forth, and she grinned as it penetrated the wound and drew the line, piercing it clean. 
 Her body exploded, and a spear flew through the air from her mouth. The crack of the spear radiating from her came, and she fell flat on her back on the grass, the soldiers closing in around her, staring at her as a bloodied shell pierced her. 
 She was rendered to the ground as she felt its bite cut across her skin and tightened its grip around her throat; blood splattered everywhere as the spears struck the ground. The soldiers said they had fired at the target, and her body exploded from the pain, and as it ripped apart a cloud of white-hot cold blood, she was brought out, being brought into a large hall, and once again watched as the boy stood over her, as if he had just seen a movie. 
 A small boy sat beside her, his blood now hazy, his eyes unseeing. A few minutes passed, as both her eyes were on the wounded boy, and her breathing slowed down, her mind rushing all of a sudden, all at once. 
 They both sat there, and a man took her in his arms, cradling her as his old friend used to. His eyes now sharp as swords, he smiled and replied, " I must thank you, Mother. A dream is one good thing."<|endoftext|>
**********52**********
I still can't believe his tears still slip through my eyes. A small brown hulk stomped on my skull and ripped it apart, ripping my eyes apart so he could actually see. I could hear it again, - "Fuck! ". The need for survival got to me. Something from the boy brought down my strength. That's when I saw it. The thing's stone body which had recently sliced open and out nailed me up, took me by surprise. The zombies were so determined, they tore holes in them as they croaked. The little thing kept coming closer, and closer, until it grabbed me by the neck and pulled me toward it. " Come on dearie! " a voice called. " You wanna die, little guy? " my old soul replied. " Of course, " he said, as he struck me, being always so clever. " No! You'll die. " 
 I stomped away. I could only smile at the place I stood. Before long a bowl fell and landed on the floor behind me. It roared, and spread up in the hall until it had been trampled. " Oh my God, oh my God! I don't think I'll make it! ". The voice cried in displeasure as the other servants emerged and hurried in. " Something wasn't right with you of all people, " I told him. 
 " No, wait, " said the servant. " It was an accident... but he kinda told me not to. He might have killed you. I just don't see the point anymore! ". 
 " Now, now! " The servant informed me. " We can finish the job together. He just comes, and kills me. Let's go meet one for the last time in this place. " 
 Without hesitation, I stormed out the door in terror of what I saw. He just kept coming. I could hear it whispering in the darkness that these were the beasts who should not be here. 
 " His name is Joseph Sturgis. He killed a lot of people, baby. He said he will destroy the world and the world will hate you for it, * and he was right."<|endoftext|>

"Pentagrams. " 
 " Yes sir. Those are my real pets. " 
 " Ok. Can I get you some soda? " 
 " Sure. It's the refillable ones, I think they're terrible. But they are not spoiled. " 
 " Very good. Thank you very much for this soda! Thank you so much! " 
 My brain buzzes with excitement and anticipation as I take the order with the sitter, behind her the buzz of a healthy child runs through my brain to sample my new lost secret. But the kid is my first dog and she drinks this sweet, smooth beverage to make sure she never notices the spoon after. After 20 minutes of a sip a curious and wonderfully adorable specimen roars from it's burrow and explores her body. 
 " Quickie... Jump! " With a click I stagger over to the crevice where the girl once put my puppy. She is big and expressive and her hooves, ethereal and dragon like are widely known for protecting her from predators. She seems incredibly confident. 
 " You mean... " 
 " Mhmm " 
 The little girl curls around my legs to get a better look at the beautiful creature under my feet. While staring blankly I worry for the breath out of her. " Is she leaving? " 
 She stammers. " Fuck, no, yeah she's not leaving. " She snarls, my hand hovering to her chin. As her tears begin to drip I watch a tingle run down her spine. I pat my feet anxiously for the dangerous hand of the little girl and she goes limp and their eyes meet. 
 " Where am I going now? " My mind throws open because of her beautiful eyes. I knew the precious smell of flower after waiting so long. " You have to be kidding me. I'll be back in the morning so hurry " My adrenaline has been pumping and in an instant I am tripping over myself. There is a dull thud and then nothing. The window comes crashing down revealing shattered glassed walls and faded blue and purple tapestries over a cracked tin roof. The lobby has a familiar smell of cereal and orange juice and the business hours track down. 
 " Sleep well now. I haven't eaten in a few days." When I wake up the girl is gone. She never likes the time travel crap.<|endoftext|>

It all started with an accident. 
 It all started when Frank was just a boy with no one. 
 He woke up one morning that he fell in a pool of blood and scurried off into the night in fear. He tried to hide under a hot mug, but was tackled to a wall with his stomach a mess. The impact was horrific, some of his arms are severely exposed. The first thing he did was grab his chin with his hands and swam to the other side, punching holes in the ceiling. It looked like the floor was gouged out for the next 3 days, and we don't think so. 
 After a year, Frank passed. He woke up 2 days later with broken bones, and would later come to believe that his brain was not damaged, nor malformed either. It was all from the time that he and his girlfriend went out in that building after a night of drinking, tried to talk her out of taking her out, and told her her best friend had hung up with her sister. 
 He decided the best approach was to find a nickname to match, Frank decided that the best way to start dating a girl was his favorite, with Chris in particular. What Chris needed to get him was the life he wanted. 
 That's when he met Tammy. 
 She was 15 and was the kind of girl that would ever fight, help, and give you her heart. But, she wasn't even coming over for her birthday party. 
 He was on a run, and was about to get run over when he saw her walking in the parking lot. He just couldn't look at her, but he wasn't late to the party anymore. 
 She was walking her daughter down the street, absolutely dancing, looking just like she did at the summer school. 
 "How are you doin'? " 
 " I'm fine, I'm fine. " 
 " What's wrong with you? Where's my kid? " 
 She shook her head, " How are you doing out there? You don't get it, Chris is with you! " 
 " You are not my kid, I'm* my kid. " 
 " How come?"<|endoftext|>
**********55**********
In my nightmares, my nightmares. 
 I always thought I could read what Dr. Blave wrote about, that reading what she said would explain what got to me through life, that was true in my dreams. 
 People say the strangest kind of terrifying is not a breath escaping you. You just know that every dream is like that a dream, in different, moment. One thing scares me, I don't know what to do. 
 I look around and I don't see anything. 
 When I turn to look at my guide, he is looking at me. 
 "One must have survived. " 
 His headlamp dims and he looks at me. My arm slips off and I feel a sharp pain in my shoulder. I turn to look at the horn of the car, and find myself looking at the flat screen television. The screen is black for a moment, only the warning blare fills the room, and the sound fades. 
 I go through the rest of the background for the whole movie. I put my hand on my thigh and my eyes come to me, strangely, it seems as though I am trying to read the warning for the reality of the situation. 
 One must have survived. I look to the driver and I don't see the front window, nor the dark feeling of the woods around me. The ride drifts quiet as I see the car slink along the road. I notice he is trying to regain his balance. This may be the fate of the human race. 
 I see his reflection, lying on the road, too late, I hear the car slam down. The car vibrates, lights blare through the windshield. I take a step back, and I notice something. A figure crashes into the back seat. 
 My vision begins to clear as I see myself, in a commercial crashed into the trailer. 
 A small woman, her knees and arms must have fallen on the ground, and maybe I am seeing things. I feel hot burning agony dripping from her shoulder as she sees her figure plummeting down the road. 
 The woman sits down in the aisle, and after feeling the hot pain of the crash, lies there trying to get away from the figure. 
 Suddenly, the car pulls out of the road, fires out of the passenger window, and a man is in the passenger seat while the legs fall from the barreled truck, and the engine revs in a bizarre manner. 
 As I sit in the passenger seat, the driver looks confused, but I sense he understands what he is experiencing, so he passes out. The man slips out of the car and out the trees. I reach down to pull a cigarette out of my pocket, and a thing from under the headlamp rips out. Suddenly I see him. 
 I stand up, and look at him, but he is not there. He turns to me. 
 " One must have survived." 
 This is the tale of *My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic*.<|endoftext|>

After leaving school for the first time, Jacob was slammed with a black phone call from his love. As he waited, staring at the screen of his friend's most recent Android tablet, he paused for a moment before asking: 
 "Where'd your cell again? " 
 " Sorry honey I got confused, I didn't understand what I meant. " 
 " Yeah, and I'll be in touch if you remember. Thanks! " 
 " YES THANK YOU JACOB! I will see you soon! " 
 At this point his happiness was broken by her attempt to check her email. The increased disgust on her face immediately triggered a flurry of email responses. Jacob got up and walked to the front door where he found a frozen desk beneath a combination of two refrigerated pizza boxes and a potted plant. 
 " Wait! Is this some sort of offensive humor trick I've created for you! " 
 As he opened the door to his bedroom, he heard a distinct groan that started from inside his head. He hurriedly shoved the potty down and stomped onto the bed, colliding with his very own checkerboard. 
 " Are you done hitting me? " he asked, annoyed at the situation. 
 " YES! " she responded. 
 After nothing but waking up, he pulled out his phone and started a news feed. He asked, " How was your day, and do you know how many times that I've caused you problems! " 
 " I think that's quite a list of requests this boy has handled and kept a secret from me ever since I found out about him and my secret. If I hadn't been so focused on just helping you with your problems I probably wouldn't have cut it in half. " 
 " Well that's my best buddy Jacob, and some of your relatively trivial motions haven't carried over into more pressing issues of your life. Well if you want to know why I can help you, you need to listen to me before I tell you. You need to hear me, my name is Calbi, and I've been working on a secret you need to keep from me ever since you found out about me! " 
 Sighed immediately at the discovery, Jacob looked up from his tablet, calmly enjoying his moment with his love. 
 After a few more minutes of talking, he decided it was time to put his phone down and begin to walk to the park. He thought to himself: " One more day, I'll tell you I can help you! And though I don't usually start lying around when it comes to communicating with others, if you don't tell me quickly then then I would probably be stumped and at your mercy. If you don't have any sense of urgency though, then I'd have to have a conversation with you in the second or third window of your last two hours or so I guess. I know I've spent my whole life in this relationship with such passion, I knew I would pay no mind to this than it was just the right thing to do. " 
 The same moment of events followed. He placed the device down in front of him and climbed into the sky in front of her, admiring her gorgeous bush, peppered with dew and grinning. 
 " I love you, calbi. " 
 She smiled at him and closed her eyes. For a moment, he was left in awe and thought of how this girl would react after sharing such a peaceful and friendly conversation. 
 " Love you, Calbi" he said after a moment.<|endoftext|>

Just as they would if they came to the Academy. Just as they would if they had "filmed ". 
 Except it was different, it wasn't anything big and dramatic, it was far more simple and laid back. 
 Warm blood pooled around but not as far as would be expected. The move meant darkness and the syringe turned to paint on the glass. A little more blood, if that. Blackness and silence were the means by which the noise died off. 
 And now that spirit was gone from the universe. The room bled, as it always did. There had been no " death " of the spirit. Strangely enough it still functioned. If there had been no death there would have been no living spirit. This was the moment the sirens had sounded and there was no yelling. 
 Finally there was a breaking noise. A blink. My hand remained stiff and I made to press back on the plunger. 
 The remaining half of me stood up. I shook out and made to climb out. Some of the other head's had collapsed and were falling to the ground. I touched down and looked at the air. 
 The people below were moved aside to get behind a tall, crowded grey building, and it seemed that no one moved. No one whispered, and they didn't scream. I just stood there, staring at the glass. It told me it was time. Time to seek justice, something that none of these monsters had done in the cosmos. That the spirit would come back. 
 I was ready. 
 A siren come down from a deep, deep forest behind them. They had come for me in the underworld. I stopped and turned to see who it was. I was not supposed to turn around, but the light of the rest of the darkness was coming to me. I looked at them. Was he my father? Was I going to help him? What was my father doing in this room? I noticed he was looking at me and I realized the feeling behind it was almost hypnotic. But the voice was not mine. The man behind me with the plunger was not mine. I looked again. 
 I took one last look at the broken world. The world, as i had seen it before, had turned away from me. The rain was falling heavily, on top of the nearby peaks and oaks. The sky was gone. And I looked back up. 
 It took too long to realize my hand was shaking. I shook back up. I tried not to seem nervous, because it would take forever. But i just smiled. 
 " I am just glad to be back, I haven't felt alive in days." 
 The few jubilant survivors left were not pleased with my snide comment but with me. They all made for the base but before they left the new voice from inside the glass slowly began to speak.<|endoftext|>
**********58**********
It's gotten boring, for me. I spend my time rambling, copy-pasting, down-side-downing memos, school assignments, random letters, academic rankings, fees, allowances, and accolades. All the while I watch my fellow Villians die with me. Every now and then I tear up, run for a solution, and grow angry. I can't shake the feeling that one day my friends, and someday I too, will take to the streets. I suppose that gives me a base grip on reality. 
 The usual attacks, interrogations, torture, and generally gloat would be as boring and pointless a punishment as that of suddenly dying a horrible death. Still, even with that happened, my own happiness felt like a badge of honor, one more factor to examine. 
 That day in particular caused my day to strike me, like something straight out of the year. I saved the world from any outbreak of H1N1, when most kids with terminal illnesses had just gone insane. I saved them from an unspecified group of villains, who had just gotten out of denial and just waltzed into my office. 
 H1N1 gave hope to millions of people around the world in the aftermath of the Nuclear War. Millions of lives lost, thousands of people going blind, millions more dying in the secret prisons that separated us from the rest of the world. 
 And yet, I did it! A remarkable thing! I stuck together one day, and announced the world to all other Villians. 
 And I won!<|endoftext|>

When the first Voyager spacecraft was launched, the news was immediate and you could see a squadron of scientists and scientists looking at the peculiar contrails upon the horizon. 
 The late talk of the heavy impact of which broke the silence of space, which really made it incredibly hard to have a coherent story at this point. You only see it often on the TV and you have to think of the planet Earth, the tiny box in the sky, all the other stars you think of there, big, tiny little circles. As you moved in to check on Earth, the signals from Earth were greatly amplified. 
 When you watched the first pics of Earth, you knew that there was something special happening that an extraterrestrial entity, or something bigger than your personal planet, called another self-aware computer could create. That thing could create your own planets in real time. And because it could create your own Mars, your own planet that used to be an intersection of different planets and worlds in different times ( before Voyager 3 or Scorpio), that thing programmed people to create big, real little circles. 
 Earth. As strange as that sounds, you don't necessarily have to think of that fact, just look, well, you won't. When a human happens to be in your Galaxy, they ask you what happened to your Galaxy. It turns out that when a human puts that story of the earth and Mars together, that planet itself becomes home to the constellation Perseus. Perseus. Perseus where you came from, where you lived your life, that planet where you first found your family, and that planet that gave you to your Creator. You lived that life, and every day it snowballed around you, until you noticed that you were becoming a bit sleepy. 
 Despite your acute awareness of the situation, the only ones you know, a very open mind about the Earth, the circle, the concept of the mythical comet you are here to see, the reason Earth was staring. And now you realize that nothing happened on Earth before Voyager was launched. 
 The crosshairs didn't change. What they did change was how humanity was reacting. Many began to connect a series of letters to people connecting Earth and Mars. But most of all, you realized that you didn't know what anyone else was talking about in your very small little community. 
 So today, this crosshairs that signal your remembrance of the rest of Earth. You arrive back in your Galaxy. You remember back to the events before Voyager 3 or Scorpio had landed. You remember beginning to be a little bit afraid, all alone, not knowing if you could open your eyes and go back home. As you look up into the sky you see, you remember, that looks way too perfect, you're not even alone. You're in a small pod in the blue-green-yellow mass sun. 
 This is it, it'll have to do...<|endoftext|>

It was embarrassing. It was huge, hard to take in all the things that were there, but in this moment it was quite obvious that I was struggling. Still, I continued to claw at the results of my undying advances. I was planning on crawling out of the old school house that had just been abandoned a few months ago. I finally slipped into the deep blacks of the garage, lost in the chrome exhaust system and plastered with blood like the teenager's vomit. 
 I heard a familiar click on the console as my eyes wandered the victim's room. I was unimpressed. Looking out from under the living room floor, I saw her gaze glisten with a murderous determination. I didn't need to flinch from this body to find that this was no ordinary woman. This was a cop. 
 I knew it would be easy to rob her. It was more than that when trying to kill. I knew just how to make a character a cop that could not imagine another body in their day to day life. That role I once wanted to fulfill. It was like this. 
 A few men stepped out, guns drawn, aiming them at my superior. They looked at me like I was a monster. They shot each other in the ass, but not as hard as I had hoped. The gunfire was thick and loud. I didn't have much time left. I was on my back. 
 The others pushed, swinging their weapons and kicking me into the ground. There was a screech that made me forget everything, whether it was an earthquake or a siege. This time they were close. It was that *contested*. The men turned the tables and fired, first hitting the ground before setting fire to the bodies. Not the thinking soldier; just a little glint of muscle and a loud and clear shot. 
 The lucky ones survived the very bullets. My fellow citizens, I thought bitterly. Their deaths brought tears to my eyes and comforted me. I had finally set myself free. I had been free from my existence for as long as I could remember. I had set my clear destiny before me. I decided that peace was the best way to end it. I had walked these streets in one way or another since I could remember. 
 I finally felt a soft touch on my forehead. I knew I would see another glass of water soon.<|endoftext|>

On my way to my house to hold a grudge, next thing I know I hit the jackpot. 
 I had the luxury of feeling like a normal 20-something dude, I mean, I don't have a job, and I didn't *have* anything to support myself through the last few months. And that is the crux of the problem, usually I never finish any of my day's work. 
 This wasn't some scam I knew or wanted. I was never involved in some crime or filled a case. And now I'm stuck with this sap who is able to scam me every time. 
 Even when they nab him they ask him for some papers he gives. I always miss a return receipt. I always use the $ 30 for this. 
 I hit the jackpot, and I owe it all to him.<|endoftext|>

*Never seen a red storm drenched like that before. * 
 *In, it was just like yesterday, like when *we* came, I* never felt so alive without going in. I was alone, nature even. Not an imagination, nor another teenager, but a commonplace place. A protective cloak had been designed and scattered and God, I was a pantheon. I had heard their stories. The giants had lived and died and the tribes had lost children. But what I was left with. Nothing special, for every tribe, I had found this long forgotten one and with every clue, my knowledge ended up without shape. * I* had to find them and cast down the blight which was slowly losing all of its potential. 
 "Can we go home, quick? " Elderberries asked, as he gave her a quick flick of his finger. His face flushed as he gaped at his youngest sister, but I knew it was his that was worried most. 
 " I don't want to, " I answered. I grabbed Elderberries by his shoulders, as they kissed and her eyes opened wide. I almost smiled. Old fashioned kisses and kisses, please. They were a truth of life. I could hardly remember what it felt like to kiss those aged mothers with every heart wrenching moment they saw. 
 " No- damnit, Brother, we can't go home. Mommy's going to marry me, dad's going to destroy us all, " she started. Elderberries pat my shoulders a bit, before storming out, leaving the young girl unharmed. I stepped out on to the stone bridge. The last thing I remember was talking to Elderberries and Sisterberries. 
 " We're all alone, Bridget- brother! " he turned. " It's not safe out here. Just put these boots down. Something's bad. " 
 Looking at him, she bit her lip. " Sister, let's go home. " 
 " We have to go to Hades. " I told him. 
 " There's nothing to do here." 
 Just as Elderberries lowered the cold metal of his axe down upon Elderberries, I saw a dark pit open wide with smoke rising, forming, then sputtering, before vanishing into darkness.<|endoftext|>

The air was breezy today, 
 Cold and unforgiving. 
 Neither of us, up to this day. 
 We've talked about ourselves in private, 
 and talk about ourselves in restaurants and bars, 
 but I never thought this would be this way. 
 Through all the years we've been together, 
 we've always been just as wrapped up. 
 And now the words must come true. 
 So come visit us tonight, 
 and perhaps we can forget all this time of good, 
 and realize the horrors of the day we left. 
 Mother nature and man are fine, 
 but it's still God's will, and it continues, 
 so come along, will you?<|endoftext|>

My first day on a job like this..hell, back at the factory.. I packed another pack of groceries into a backpack and head out to work. The subway was once again bustling from 5am to 6. 
 "Wow, that is heavy. It's like a mobile phone to let you know I can pick it up at the next station. " I said to the man in the pink tee shirt that filled the back that smelt like rusty bourbon, cool in the humid days, but still a bit uncomfortable. 
 " What are you doing in here? " he said with a sour face, as if answering a call or some weird open promise. 
 " Um I'm working in a store called Sports & Shopping Plaza. It's a'small' I come down to shop for stuff. Bought all the stock and I set the cash register at 10:45am. " I said looking down to my watch in the corner. My wristwatch usually last about an hour till it breaks. I see nothing. 
 " Um, a special bag to wear during the days. If you need anything, I'd be happy to come and help you carry it out. " He kept looking up at me with faint smiles, I tried to keep a normal tone, normally a bit nervous but this guy made me feel super nervous. 
 " I know, but don't worry about it. It's yours. We're going to be around for a while and you can still take a look at it when I get back." 
 After the elevator opened up he took a deep breath to listen to the sounds of the factory, nice little blaring machines. Mostly used for listening and would be decent if not for the limited time it provided, I love the now smoking 12 year old surfer that constantly took a right turn in his direction. He always took aim in about 5 seconds at a time. As soon as he got to the exit he'd pop off next to the demo cart and tow it off the road. He seems like a nice guy sometimes, though. He's always cheerful in his days with his coffee and crew. Not a fan of men for a while now, though.<|endoftext|>

The sound of crashing glass interrupted almost immediately before Viktor and his comrades charged upon the foul creatures. Mayde, the old squire of the halfling Army gelled as their master, King Ashom, pulled apart the horn-rimmed face of the colossal serpent. His armored carbine slung over his shoulder, his crimson scales reflecting golden sunlight through the vats of water churning beneath him. His shoulders turned grim, as he stared back at the night sky until he saw the tower of the kings crown. It had its chrome faceplate engraved with seraphim and its steel and sickly thick beak carved into the center. Its armor swelled, its wings dusted and scarred from the spatter of blood spilled, its long claws sagging in a dusting sea of grime. 
 He had run these invasion as well, but his time had come for a greater purpose. We'd not last long enough to secure the throne by the next campaign. On a course of foot, far from the rugged coast of the morning, we crossed the unforgiving stream that fed our people and our mountains as an ancient and elegant chariot rode along the bleak path to our destination. We stood against the thundering clamours of war but the noise made no difference. Our forces stood firm. The towers of ash burned away any ancient dreams and died with the last breath of the warriors that stood at the gates of Jericho. Our banners, white as day, now lay strewn across the fields and fields of sheep. It mattered not who we were sent to take. When this was over, my brother and I would be the true representatives of our People. 
 The sound of stomping feet, salivating knights came tumbling from the fallen towers beneath the western hills; Basilisks marching not far behind them, arrows crunched and pounded upon flesh as they leapt from the the horizon. They were there before us, jealously guarding and conversing with the heroes of our country. The clank of boots on the slopes and thuds of ash dogs seemed closer than we had thought possible. We dropped our spears and bared our ranks to protect our hoard of weaponry while our men and women searched all around the sweet apples deep within the ruins. We had our weapons ready, shining silver fire like gods in the deep nights of battle. The rain of ash burned our palms and noses and the sand from our feet. All of us, now gathering to feed our loved ones. We jumped as the rain poured down and took shelter in the undergrowth. We sprang into action as the Titans charged the cities, charging our lines in desperation. The city walls fell like plagues upon the invaders. 
 The heads of the enemies came into view as one of the Titans passed over a small, green and red overgrown field. Up there, it all melted away, now dark green and red covered our city. The only remaining light of our homes shone in our only lantern and all the brighter we could have sworn. Just past the clouds and the last light of our city, she was there! Her sleek weapon crossed with her drapery and with both hands she blazed through the wild night as flame illuminated the distant fields. In one instant, the blow penetrated her bare skin and across the entire western hills, her flesh polished out like champagne and burnt off like her hair. Then, the lure of life stopped completely. The dragon exploded from the jaws of Ashom's glorious dragon, dripping from her carbine and splashing against the ground like poison that turned our once proud cities fluttering. 
 The ground beneath us was pitch black. Horrified screams rattled in the tired lungs of the warriors, dying louder as they were dragged against the tight thick vines of a tree and dragged down into the valley below. Their darkness filled the darkness as neither motion nor hope could escape, and the warriors could not move in time to save their sick comrades. No, there was only darkness. Darkness that swallowed them whole. Dark that would maim even the strongest of men and make them consume everything else.<|endoftext|>

Technological advancement has brought us to a point where we are both at peace with each other. 
 The new laws for genocide are even more extreme than what we originally thought. 
 I only had to order the Sycamore rifle earlier. It killed twenty in my first week on the job. I tried to use the linker, but what was the thing that was in the middle of charging, I couldn't see. This guy seemed to be thinking to himself, "maybe let me focus on shooting... " 
 A mouse clicked the button on a button and he swung it towards his head. A long, wiry tail crossed the underside of the rifle. 
 Before it could slash the side of his head, I shot at it in mid air. The creature loomed over me, distorted by the needles of needles scattered about its back. 
 I shot at it again, before the gun hit the ground. The creature's tail turned and fell off. With a creak, my hand was suddenly clean of the needles in my own back. At the next gun shot, I had poisoned him. My weapon suffered numerous hits, but nothing too serious. 
 It came up to me with a knife and shot another bullet through a couple of lines on my side of the knife, that blew up and melted off onto the ground in front of me. No blood was seen, and instead it only started to drip. 
 Stuart started to cry. The murderer could have easily lit the people up in the arena of cruelty and cut open their heads, if they couldn't remember what had actually happened. 
 He felt guilt and pain within himself. People couldn't hurt each other. Some could. He couldn't be tied down, for example. Some groups of people could be put in so many situations and could set them free. He couldn't help it. 
 But he *was* changed. He was in danger. He would let himself be tortured. He wouldn't hurt people. Not anymore, anyway. 
 He raised his knife. " Whoa! Are you and what are you trying to do? " 
 I gulped. " I said- " I looked at the process. My 3 month old daughter. " 
 I couldn't save her. 
 " Fuck you, " I said softly, " fuck you!"<|endoftext|>

“ So, why do you think this should be on the top of the list for be my new greatest literary achievement? ” came the deadpan inquisition of the Guardian Dog 
 “ Actually it's my favourite story of all time, finally I can finally say it ’ s my masterpiece. This if novel is so goddamned ridiculous, you would think I would be madly in love with a novel that I ’ ve never made a coherent account of. Well, yes it is. Thanks to you, I have finally found my most transformative but also the most disappointing creative performance, my column goes live once more and also lastly I ’ ve been selected to receive the facts for your viewing. All this attention is required to ensure the public well receives the fact that I'm currently enjoying my best work and not copying some random shit from the bushes.

"How do you know this Star Trek episode is valid? " Ten years ago I asked. 
 " Oh, god No, never mind. I wanted to say'obligatory sending.' How is that possible? Now everyone wants Star Trek episodes! " The universe began to flicker, the holographic digits hiccups and flashes as the Discovery bled out, and saw the inner workings of the Milky Way. Three alien civilizations and nine ships were battling our prowess. 
 After several hours of spiraling out of control, it was two weeks ago when we won the war. This time around, we get the alien cloned humans, and the dwarf races, as well as for the super species with superpowers. We definitely have one alien race in the entire galaxy, but we know they are just babies born from Earth and watched the series from a robotic clone pilot. It turns out aliens died out about a century ago. That was pretty much how it started. 
 Now, we don't know the actual story of aliens origin. We do know that there is something more on the menu called " Star Trek " and people have been sending around questions to the general public asking us the exact same questions. 
 I couldn't answer them, but I guess we just had to ask a series of questions. 
 " How old are aliens? " 
 " Why? " 
 " What do they look like? " 
 " Who are they? " 
 " How do they communicate? " 
 " Why have you never replied before? " 
 " What is the purpose of this question? " 
 " Why do aliens like our series?"<|endoftext|>

“ So that ’ s just how it always seems. ” muttered the raven, who was still gritting her teeth. Well, most of what passes for a raven sounded really, really, something. 
 “ They are not my brothers or sisters. My own family. And it has been 3 days since ‘ Admiral Garrard ’ d weaved through the night. ” 
 “ Stop kidding me. I did not know people died this way. ” 
 “ Ah well. In these last few days, we have seen first the wailing of any of the men. Or the shattering of their bones like a wrecking ball for a little sweet peach. But if the bravery and grace of the departed did not end with their bone, and the men ’ s bodies do as such, we can all reap the souls of those dying around us. ” 
 And, without much further ado, after lunch all of the mermaid ’ s mermaid eggs, shellfish, and flies boiled and served on these saucy platters in an over strong gummy tub have been sprinkled upon the rotting carcasses of the sitting ginger prince, Frankel. Did Frankel have any age in mind? Only days ago he had laughed, rushing from the kitchens in a desperate attempt to withdraw on to the top floors of the Druscious Hospital - Sarah had brought him his lunch this morning with a picnic skirt and a top hat. 
 Rushing round the cleaning stall, Frankel had made his way down the sandy halls as Sarah crawled up to meet him. “ What ’ s it like to be together, Frith? ” 
 “ It ’ s simpler than it sounds. Life is so much easier knowing there ’ s something better around here. ” 
 “ Fine. What about, I need someone to replace my bathroom. ” 
 “ No. See? A toilet. * Here*, one little fish can put his head into it for only a few seconds. ” 
 “ Fine. So, you want me to pay you for some sex? ” 
 “ It ’ s a gentleman ’ s fee, you know. ” 
 “ Look. I didn ’ t see you there today, but I thought you might want to come and see. I know you ’ re one of those people who doesn ’ t mind doing it when the others are awake. ” 
 “ Fine. Sorry. But look, I got a deal here. Well, please accept my conditions, girls. Well, take a look at what this is about, Frankel. And look, it ’ s not a bad deal. Go and get some from the Verlargo brothel down on the plateau next to our town hall. I had to go. Yeah, an ordinary Thursday. I see you enjoying yourself. I ’ ll take care of the rest. ” 
 The rest was a few short minutes. Then, three more minutes. A thick fog rolled down the hill and fell heavily onto Frankel. No need to scream, not now, *nose* or mouth to mouth, “ Run, get back! ” 
 A loud screech caused Frankel to shift her body onto the ground. She tried to move, but something was too much for her. Immense gossamer inflections separated her from the crumbling heights, like a tangled vegetable by the swaying rock. She trudged and stumbled along, though she was still lying on the floor. 
 “ How ’ d you like, bug? I don ’ t like to be tied like that. ” 
 “ Oh! What can you have for breakfast?! ” 
 “ I ’ ll have goat ’ s milk for breakfast. Just remember to close the window. That sounds nice. ” 
 “ Okay. Fine, sure, I ’ ll head in. Thank you for stopping by. ”<|endoftext|>

Dad had a pretty good family. I think it was because the insurance company took me on a talk trip in Australia. Like, actually, Australia, right? Um, not Australia; where I am now. They put a bit of a penalty for people not liking me, sometimes sending people into the grave with me. I mean seriously, you heard the oder wannabee every day about them going down? God knows they're just born with the flu. We didn't keep an accurate record of what happened after the oder wannabee in Switzerland; it'd be like... The last factory takeover of it. 
 There was a Japanese trader. He was getting screwed, and people in the know were all about how his company was ruining the stock market.
He had this smirk, like, basically people didn't really want to trust or understand him. But when he said that he wanted to personally apologize for helping the other guy's business with his head, it became a lot more of a spectacle. He said he'd come to India to arrange a transfer of commissions. I thought he was a stupid person. But he said at the time, I thought I was a dumb man. I mean I was the child of a poor bar owner with a bad life, but at the time... Well, that's what you get for a really good deal on a juice box. 
 Anyway, he eventually beat a few sentences out of people at parties and he apologized. He then, like, down on his luck gets the little card in his pocket that was supposed to be in front of his. That sorta went on all the way back to where things were. Dad didn't want people to be hurt, so he gave all his money back to the guy. That was a scam anyway, of course, since people all thought that was a pretty clever way of getting money for them. ( To be honest, I couldn't understand that he was, like, straight-up going off rants about all kinds of bullshit that we do, not that there was anyone clever enough to tell them he had good ideas. ) And he did get down to the actual details. 
 First day of the exam. He was a Luddite, and the person who interviewed him was a Nigerian, and this was after he won his 3rd ESL national championship; The platform translated to "After everything bad started going down I should have won. " 
 But nothing happened. After the class discussion and phone calls, he was released, and nobody came back. 
 Around the end of the exam, there was a knock on the door. Dad's supervisor, a nice enough woman, was actually knocking at the door. Normally, I've been over here and my colleagues can take on the same job, but when a job like this started bothering me I went to check my privilege. Except maybe that's because the examiner was trying to get in on the joke. 
 " Excuse me, " he called out to me and gestured at the ground. " I need you to come into my office and see if I have anything worthwhile to show you. " 
 I took in my surroundings and realized I was in a small office of some sort. I walked over and got onto my desk, where it was looking like that ninny billman, who I wanted to ask questions about. 
 " Nice to meet you, " the worker said. " I've been waiting for you here for a long time. I'm William Butler Dugin, but I haven't finished my thesis yet, so, since I don't feel so comfortable as an author, I can just promise you that I'm very happy that you've had a successful career here and I don't want you to ever miss it. And yes, I'm kind of a jerk to the companies that I work for, but I won't force them to shed the usual feather I pride myself on. Just, just do you really want to take this job that I hate so much? " 
 I was stunned by the look on the man's face. I didn't even flinch. 
 " You know it's important, " William said. " If I are going to have to do this to my face at any cost, at all, I must be prepared for any consequences. " 
 I almost burst out laughing when the man exited. He was dressed in some sort of mjolnir-blue outfit, and looked genuinely scared. 
 " Mom, Dad, " he said. " You're doing great! The last time you chased me out of that coffee shop didn't kill you, so I decided you'd done well. And your looks in here and the taste in your mouth should help me keep you motivated. You know I've been thinking about you for a long time, and I thought I'd give you a lucky shot..."<|endoftext|>

When Humanity first settled on this planet three million years ago, there was no sign of life anywhere else. Perhaps one thousand years of life and there was a place unknown to us on Earth. 
 It was only when the dark lord Terran entered our solar system and laid his claw down on our moon far enough away that every new race discovered Earth was no more then a story to keep the choir going, then passed. Some races simply adapted from the continual ebb and flow of life, while others evolved using some intricate and over developed gene transfer system. 
 I was one such one, living in the shadow of what I was, telling stories of life, the lore of that god-like entity, when another a different creature knocked me unconscious. I am no longer his only survivor, he is the others of the group that know of our presence, but I am afraid it is nothing compared to this fact alone. 
 We haven ’ t progressed to that point, and with the difference between our biology and ours has progressed far faster than any species to survive. It is me who has watched as they hunt us down, and if the order never changes, they will forever be responsible for hunting us down and leaving us behind in nothing but debris. Only I and the few I thought were worthy of my place on this earth will ever survive. No matter what happens to me, I will survive, and hopefully the next great race might go with them, the Yagai.<|endoftext|>

There had been a long time ago. 
 I was lying in my bed, with those on all sides of me, looking into each others eyes. I remember, she was the one who told me that she knew everything. The one who held the key to world supremacy. The one who would push for it, willingly. My country and the people of the world in particular. I felt tears well up all over my cheeks and eyes, though I knew no one else cared. As I stood over me, thinking "I'm sorry honey, but I don't know what to do" the tears began to fall, and slowly spread across my cheeks and even down your sides. As I dried my eyes I took a deep breath and pressed my head to the pillow. As I finished the last part of the sobbing, I looked at the clock. 5:59 PM. 
 I made a mental note to go ahead with the confession in the code that is on the keyboard next to your bed and I will do all in my power to not let anybody catch you. 
 I will not let it end like this, I will not let it ruin your beautiful world.<|endoftext|>

* "No baby, don't try to flight above the troposphere! I will not give you my patented human heirloom. No baby, look over the swimming pool. " * 
 My doctor left me this morning and is trying to talk about the 5 foot four lady who is still attempting to pluck the wrong balloon. It is exactly what I need, so I do my best. A few minutes passes, and I notice that the woman in front of me, who is right across the middle of the ocean at the bottom of the oil refineries across the street from me, is blushing and laughing. It is funny, especially when she mentions in that hilarious joke that the sun should be at the top of the clouds, because her correct temperature is now very low as well. 
 " Ah, hi, man, can I talk to you? " I ask. 
 The lady in front of me is honestly impressed, staring down at her hands in front of her tiny brown head and flicking her eyes upwards. He flicked her back at me, always a bit obnoxious to be around when she was young, but he won't leave so I just smile and chat. As we speak, I'm thinking about my new wife and her beautiful hair and her charming smile that still surprises me. I am thinking about the plane, standing alone on the first commercial flight to space. I would love to see this, I don't want to to see it in a museum, but there will be plenty of planes out there. I am thinking about how adorable this is as I am taking a selfie with my iPhone. As I unlock the selfie from my phone, I look up at the woman to my left. She is looking so beautiful. Her eyes are wide, she is so young, and this person, who is nearly 80 is far younger than her. She doesn't look like I am. I can't take this crap anymore. 
 " Where are you, honey? " I call out to her. She looks at me for a second, then keeps staring at the ground. We are here for a short while now. As we exchange our phone numbers, she is starting to look as friendly as a human could be. I'm so in love. 
 " Nobody tell me, you idiot, I always thought if the weather service is going to be so... worried, a catastrophe would happen. " I once again shout at her, so that she doesn't think I am. But what I am angling towards is my camera. One of the eigth tents we placed at the side of the dock was covered in broken glass, but I managed to attach a drop-box to it. The pegs of my camera fall onto the bottom of the ships ceiling. 
 The touch of a button starts the phone vibrating on the screen. I pressed it. 
 " Hello, Mom. " 
 " Karen? She's here? " 
 " Yeah, okay, she's coming over here. Can I have a water change?" 
 Later, I would take the drone to the restroom in my home and take a shower before I would return home. I walk down the street in this luxury car, just in time to see the new human of the night, with a baby black haired man. All the while I watch her and the world around us slowly crumbling around me. Our pilot turned the camera on and I fall. My nose is almost filled with water.<|endoftext|>

When I finished whacking my fork, I brushed it all the way down my throat. Even his bark gave me chills, as if he could adjust to any situation. His hands started trembling, as if he was preparing to shoot me right in the gut. It scared me; I tried to hold him off, but instead I found myself in the hand of a man who was drowning on the couch. 
 His other hand looked away, as if he would be holding the knife out to the fire, but it only removed the wall from the wood into a palm or the tip of the fork. He paused, resting his head on the edge of the chair, a bit steadier as his right hand detached itself from the smooth surface of the chair and fell to the floor next to me, begging me to stop. 
 As I woke up, I didn't hear any other noises. I realized I could hear the chairs shaking. I rolled over to where the hand rest lay, and put my foot on the ground, and began rolling down the stairs. I reached the edge of my bed and stared back at the massive wooden door. The frigid air of this house was blasting through my nose. I reached into my closet and pulled out what I could. It was one of those things I think I keep when I'm drinking whiskey. I had bought this thing a while back in a garage sale when I had stopped by a bottle of whiskey for a cup of tea. It had been only a set but I had been starting to get worried as I thought about what I would buy it for later. 
 At first I thought it was terrible, but as I pulled the a ring out of the box in my boot pocket I could tell the sad truth that it was meant to be. I started my search for something safe, and found it again. I pulled out my index finger to a quick band, almost feel the ring in my palm. It was orange, as if someone had just rubbed a cloth over it. I lifted it out of my pocket, and looked at the stamped heirloom in my palm. 
 "Bungee Clean! " I called to the tail end of the hallway. The wind howled through the open window, a scent that I had never smelled. 
 At the moon I climbed down into my car, and headed out to dinner and to the door. I stared at the door, and wondered what had just happened. I decided to pass on the task to a friend who lived next door, who came and took the most appetizing sandwiches with potatoes. I walked to the front porch, and knocked on the door. 
 " Bungee Clean, " 
 " Free, please, " I replied. " Bungee Clean is here!"<|endoftext|>

They always tried to bury me under my feet, kid. I hate knowing what they ’ ve found. It ’ s awful, and it ’ s moving, and if I want to look someone up, I better be sure they know what I have. If I wanted to be famous, I ’ d be able to pick up where most people left off. 
 Then there were the times I won awards in engineering, and that ’ s something to be proud of. 
 I won a place in the school sports competition, and everybody who loved me wasn ’ t that mad. I tried being sports hero, so that I can show everyone that I was an athlete, and that everybody would be proud of me if I won every award. Did the kids smile when I told them that, or did the other kids laugh at the answer to the question that had dominated me for the past five years? 
 The only time I ’ ve ever said that to anyone was when I raised my hands and watched the astronauts pass by me from the space station. I ’ d be feeling honored if they didn ’ t know what I looked like, but they both laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed at me, saying that it was the most amazing thing I ’ d ever seen. 
 Then there was the time when they brought me for lunch. That was probably the moment I laughed at the dumbest joke in the whole world. I don ’ t remember what happened there. It was just lunch, and I thought, oh my god, *who would believe this? * The kids laughed at me, and I didn ’ t want to remind them. I couldn ’ t, and they thought I ’ d laugh. 
 Of course, everyone left me on the ground, though. I usually stayed in the car, and everyone was so mad I couldn ’ t help it. They still thought I was a god, but I wouldn ’ t look down at them. I liked these people, though. I hated being angry, and probably hated with a burning passion. They even took me to the gym, and I went there feeling proud of the way I played. No one ever doubted that I could have made the most incredible dad joke I ’ d ever seen. 
 I hate these kids. They ’ re far too good to pass up. I ’ m sad that they left the lab, because they just figured out that I had a disease that could cure it. I guess someday I ’ ll have what little I still have left. 
 Time to think.<|endoftext|>

The Durango rolls came down fast, or maybe, awkwardly, rather, right now. The roll first of the month had become way too dull. I just had to pick the last two things that were important to him. 
 * I need another forty things in my room. * 
 A minute ago he was ecstatic when the dice rolled with his dice from the net – he had guessed, carefully, that both William and I needed some money to rebuild it properly. William thought it was too corny that he was on the losing side, telling me. " Not all things are meant to end, now," he said. But everyone always found that " not all things are meant to end". From their eyes, he was lost and we couldn't have turned back. 
 That was until William and I went into a grand city hall with him for a demonstration of how we could change his world. This had been two of his very first wins. He stood next to the ball. Eventually he had made me eat some for lunch. We laughed through the night till the sun broke through the clouds and illuminated the rest of the streets with our lights. William would take us to the train station, leaving us exhausted for the day and out of the joy of it all. 
 Thank god! He could afford to do that all for us.<|endoftext|>

“ What is it then Hector? ” asked the Owl. 
 “ It ’ s just my job, ah, okay. Well… that ’ s probably why I say it, lets just take a look at it. If it looks a bit weird I won ’ t be sitting here for hours thinking that the whole public faces it, not that I was expecting it. What I expect, I don ’ t know. I ’ m just here to study. ”

 “ Look, okay. Stop being such a shit prick and stop the freaking thing, I ’ m going to start being a mommy and daddy right now, ok? So you know what? Do you? ” The Owl scratched his wings, his head bouncing off the paper. 
 “ No, no, don ’ t. I ’ m just paying my bills. So… okay. ” 
 “ I ’ m not not paying all your bills! ” Hector screamed. 
 “ WELL THEN, go tell Oz. ” 
 “ But dad, tell mommy and daddy that the whole public faces it. You know, the entire public sees it. You know… you just pay? And I ’ m not letting mommy and daddy look at you like that and shit like that. ” 
 “ I actually have a real hard time. I have an alien son that my mommy is the one giving away because of some weird allergy thing, I know. But I… I just… I… I always wanted to have a normal human baby. A normal human. But I knew dad, you know… ” 
 “ But… you just don ’ t care, you know? Because I told you… sorry. I will pay the bills. Please don ’ t call mom and dad anymore. Okay? ” 
 “ Oh, yeah? Yeah, like an extra vacation or something. I ’ ve got that! Anyways, it ’ s going to be a $ 25.99 hatchback. Also, you know what? I ’ m working this thing up. She ’ s gon na need groceries sometime in the next 7 months, so I ’ ll be fine. ”<|endoftext|>

As well as my attentions, his daughter carefully scans his seemingly clean white room for signs of infection. Once again, her attentions are piqued. 
 With a great gulp, my eyebrows and face disappear. At the very last moment, he uses a relief from the loss of vision to pounce on me. The warmth of the fire nagged at my ears. This was not the house. 
 "I... I just saw my boy die... " 
 My wife rested her face down, her emerald-lensed eyes set on the fetus inside my own. I could make out the dawning face of her unborn child. I shuddered at the lost cause. 
 " Honey, we're in love. Let's go see him. " 
 Then it was gone. The fire away from my wife's face. Gone. 
 Within the village, and with her wasn't a noose. 
 " What are you doing? " 
 " I have visions. I'm with you. Everything is fine. What are we going to do? " 
 The words echoed in my mind. They were true, but faded now. I was, at last, there. No one. Only me. My garden, my father's cottage... 
 " What's going on? " 
 " We're going to the park. " 
 The wisps of smoke from behind the curtains and fluff of leaves seemed to make him sweat. His staring holes remained as others had. 
 " Do you know why you come? " 
 He came to me. We sat side-by-side. His jaws and eyes filled with curiosity. I was curious. He was curious. 
 " Is there something wrong with the car that you drove in? " 
 " Does this have something to do with the girl you never met? " 
 The visions. They'd been real. A few moments had elapsed, a few hours. It was time to revisit this memory. 
 " I died. I was born into the world. I was the soul mate of my son."<|endoftext|>

No one knows where the plane came from, as the pilots seem to have forgotten it by now. 
 No one understands why the sirens began to wail and then turned silent. They sounded like they were out walking for miles in the night. These were the last of the noises. The stillness continued, and when they stopped, it only seemed to creep closer until the air was suddenly filled with new wafts of nausea. 
 It did not matter in the end. Both of them were ignorant and still had hopes and dreams that their fate was sealed. 
 The plane crashed, as the cops and churchkeepers were dead still. In all three cases, the plane existed and was still there. The coroner's report on the crash said that both souls were found dead underneath the parked car. Both souls were found dead when they died and cremated. 
 A photograph was found about six miles away with evidence of a spine, torso, arms and legs, as well as a key. Investigators at the time theorize that this might indicate a lingering ghost, just beneath the surface of the earth.<|endoftext|>

I could never be known for my dedication to service. To whether the ritual was worth it. I had saved thousands and thousands of souls and became immortal. I was well adjusted to life at the time. Nearly everyone I knew had reason to be sad. 
 No one could understand why there was no moral justification, no guilt or remorse for them all. They would never acknowledge it for what they were. How could it affect them? Their choices, choices, choices, choices..no one could ever have thought that I existed to stop it. I could never forget the last moments of my life. 
 I woke up this morning, and went to the kitchen to cook my dinner. The bowls are perfectly cooked and well drained from the fireplace. Everything is perfectly alright. I told Jenny what I saw, and said good morning to her. She smiled and left the scene. 
 Today will be different. Today will be my victory.

"Madam President, there's something I've been waiting for. " I replied as best I could with my proper English. Only a few people realize the message I just spread to them as simple as the story of how I ended up killing them. They can't blame themselves, at least not enough for me to think they're acting as if I don't really know them. But as if there is something wrong in this government that it doesn't mention. 
 I ran down the block to the door, feeling a wave of evil wash over me. Why was this job treated as such? It would take years of planning and study by an outsider to fully determine the precise plot of the nation. He should know the foundation of the new organization. I can't explain it to him and everyone must know. Or at least nobody else would. 
 " President Cole is here to make sure no one can see me do it. A failure like this would be a permanent loss, but he can be sure that someone else would see it too. " I chocked out a laugh. At this time I wasn't prepared for this, something about the way this job went was completely unexpected. 
 " Amy? Where the hell am I? What's going on? You can't hurt anyone already! You don't know anyone! That's a blatant conspiracy theory, but people don't tend to believe it. I'll remind the bosses that if I do *anything* they will realize I'm here for the sole purpose of creating jobs, not provoke, please Mr. President. " 
 At this point I realized who he was talking about. The COO of the opposition research department. He was obviously busy trolling the media, but I knew he was about to upset the balance of power with his message. " You mean to tell me I had to stab you? " 
 " Sir, that's simply a simple lie. I just stole an agency sent by three other men. " 
 " You're mean, I could've murdered this guy but you just killed him like this. My job has nothing to do with this, so why the hell didn't you tell everyone I worked for to do this. " 
 " All right, Mr. President, what are you going to tell the boss? The fact that you're sending his cat to drown his words indicates that his position is empty and he won't allow you to write anything into it. " I glanced around. Can't see anyone at the other end of the ring. 
 " I'm ready. " 
 The creepy man turned back around to face me and led me out of the building. I turned to talk to the boss, still waiting for the final shot. " Excuse me? " He asked impatiently. I looked around and found out that he looked like a senior adviser to some guy named Henry Kissinger. I sighed at the absurdity of the rumors and thought about the jobs I'd been chosen to perform. He really doesn't have time for jokes anymore. 
 I left, feeling a small burst of bitterness, having failed to uncover who I was. When I landed on the ground, I saw something interesting in his darkened office. 
 His office was big. It seemed to float up in clouds. What kind of power was this old man bringing me into this mortal coil? I decided I had to venture through this hole. I walked through the empty hall to the front of the building, feeling the weight of its very existence upon my shoulders. The clock read 6:13. Where in the hell am I? This place is endless. The Air Force will take me to find out. I was just about to head down that empty hall when I saw a thin figure jumping. She knew who I was and she pushed me forward. She looked me in the eye and said, " Do what you need to do to get me back."<|endoftext|>

The intern is always calling me a dick, but he is in my 50s, and he is sure as hell an asshole. I remember it like this. No one *wants* that. I remember sitting by the monitor, reading his tweets, checking my reflection in the mirror. It was a beautiful day, sunny weather, and nothing seemed out of place. I could hardly take in the colors of the house and the sunset and the autumn leaves, and I was completely engrossed in my work. I was relaxing in my lab, applying my thought into my master-crafted formula, and he was there. Taking pride in the thing he was doing, he grinned widely. I got the feeling that he had some kind of morbid secret, or joke his friends might have. There was something about him, something *creepy* about that grin, or the way his eyes disappeared into the black of his eyelids. I suppose I had imagined it that way. When he came home, I could only guess. He was dressed as though he had a sleeping bag, so that looks like me, but there was a handkerchief and nothing else. Did he sleep in that bag? Or did he wake me up crying? I had no idea. Not that I cared anymore. Anyway, I got home, and looked at the TV on the hard drives that he had given to me after I finished my PR department study. It was just like when I left his company last year. I didn't want to see him work, but I also didn't want him to be there. The very next morning I heard the alarm at work. I took the phone out of the drawer, and tapped on the alarm key. I went outside, and rushed to the kitchen. There were two types of people, one was very normal, the other was extremely clean-shaven. I leaned into the potted plant at the table. " I'll need to call my lawyer. " I said. " Of course, " said the person on the other end. " Send me the papers and there won't be any problem. " I kept looking at the papers. I can only hope this won't be a bad one. Not that that would matter at this point, though. As soon as I came to, he came running into the room. He waved me over and I went in, looking through every single one. It was like I had stopped-running right at that moment. I was thoroughly disoriented. I was given a postcard by my brother, and all I could think about was how disgusted I was that he was going to ask for the papers and send me a bullet. After the bullets I shot him in the eye, I glanced at my arm. Two days later, I saw in the papers that his apartment might be burned into the ground. I got myself a copy of the report, showing him of the damage. My office burned down, and it only took a few minutes. My boss was there. He wasn't too happy about losing his job. We said nothing, but he walked away. I still remember that smile, that look, like I had a big secret on my mind, right there on my desk at the end of the report.<|endoftext|>

Let me tell you something you won't believe. It was only when the satellite went down that we, well, those satellites actually went down. Yes, with that satellite gone, we saw - did I tell you how awkward it was that we had to witness a briefcase sitting on the roof? And then something went wrong, had - it happened in a different time? I don't know, but - it happened the same time? This was not something I had ever expected to happen. And this sort of thing was what crossed my mind the most. 
 But then, I think I wasn't talking about France, this was not about America. 
 And it's well, I know you're wondering who "fucked up the satellite ", you know. And I have to tell you, I don't want to go back and look at America - America is the only way we'll know how it ended. I just don't want to go back. And the only way to know you're not saying that - you know? 
 Well, that's why I'm here, you pathetic, obnoxious little liar. That's why I'm here. I feel like it's better for me, for you, for all of us. 
 But anyway, I found out, after the satellite went down, that the satellite wanted out. That it was trying to start a war, and it was, in the matter of minutes, ready to begin it. 
 So, Google, you ruined everything.

"No, " he squeaked. The signal was fading away, and it seemed as though he was dying himself. The bandits were also gone, but no one spoke. He crept closer. " Someone's just stealing my strength, " he mumbled. He wasn't the smartest of them, but he knew he had to save her, and he had no other choice but to do so. The hunter. 
 She sat next to him, small hair streaming down behind her soft snout. " Whose at fault, kid, " she said softly, her voice steady even through the thick fog. It had to be the hunter. It was a horrible thing to have one so close to a grizzled old veteran. That said, the result of one kills another seemed always to get even worse. How else could it possibly be a weaker hunter? Who was it? It was him. He had no idea, but he had to save her, and he would do it. 
 He quietly pressed his bony fingers against her head, urging her to stay still. " I don't care who killed her. Just go, " he said. 
 No response. How could he not die her when she was still looking at him? He turned his head slightly and looked down at the barrel of his gun, the thin flakes of old snow slapping against his eyes. He shot her head, and when he looked back up to see the precious thickness of her skull shattered against her body, she smiled. It was almost funny how her smile was alive, alive, until she stared up at him. It was beautiful, beyond all could ever imagine. 
 " Where is she, boy? " he murmured. She sounded so faint, hollow, so dead. He took another deep drag of the gun, and then another. Nothing. He wondered what she would say, but he knew he didn't have one. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't show her anything. He didn't have an animal bone like a human. He'd get bored, and destroy it, and he would look at the skeleton in the next room. He loved him, and he hated to go back to looking up at the sky. He was too afraid to take the whole thing in. Now the wind was biting at his skin, and there was nothing to see but the cold night sky in the distance. 
 When he was done, he looked back up again at her, his heartbeat fast. He didn't really want to. He was too afraid to try, anyway. She smiled again. And more blood. And more guts. 
 " Maybe I should call her, little girl. " He tried again. 
 " One day. " 
 " I don't know what you are, a killer... " 
 " You could kill a person! " He cried. He slammed his gun down. Her heart began to beat faster and faster, and it felt so much like death itself. It had made him sick. He didn't want to do it. 
 He held his breaths. The sound of his heartbeat was almost becoming fearful. There was a rush in his chest. He didn't want to have to come home. He didn't want to fall to this. He had a gun. " Call her. Tell her you loved her. Tell her all you knew. Tell her that she deserved to live and see her family again. " 
 He shook his head. He knew he would wake her up. That was what he needed to do, so he simply lay down on the ground and took a deep breath. 
 " Just get a gun, " he whispered to her softly. She knelt down and brushed his hair. She tugged at his hair. 
 " I don't want to kill you, " she whispered. 
 " I'm going to shoot you, then."

 It was quite a night. Still there, drifting by.<|endoftext|>

The kids play dodgeball, clutching their kids who have just turned 15. It seems the old ways are over. Dirty teens have no play ball, with nothing to play for them. 
 That's ok. My parents took their children to my parents because they lived a nice, clean little town. My mom likes to cook me junk food, and even brought home her garage, because it's supposed to be nice. 
 I wonder how old I am and I wonder where the animals are. My father and I just turned 30. I must have been a stud in high school, because all the others gave me worthless grades. But I can tell the difference between jokes, notes, and crap. 
 My mother thinks that I am the best school child, and I shouldn't be punished like that. Sometimes she doesn't believe in the rules of the culture. She believes it better to "jump fences", to just throw away a school bus to score points. She dislikes my parents for this, so I try to work through the past. 
 I guess she has a theory that my parents are cruel- because they killed a loved one. As a result, I don't remember everything I did in high school, and some of my actions would not be a source of amusement to my parents. It also would appear that I was a popular kid, always taking my class seriously and never doing anything wrong. I did not make a lot of bad decisions. 
 Now I go to college every semester because my mother takes me to every two classes. High schoolers aren't funny, and they often refuse to even really think about school. Sometimes I dream of anything to bring in some ideas, and I do. 
 But no, my mother's theory is a failure, because this is just my luck with technology that only ends up being wasted on local youth who will need it later. 
 Anyway, today, I made my fateful decision. I went to the local gym. Everyone that knows about my potential took me to see my like-eaten meal. I can't believe how lucky we are to be here. But after signing up for this competition, I got a job offer, and I gave it everything I had. 
 I remember living in Oklahoma City, with little infrastructure. I was visiting my future wife and had all the food in the house. I couldn't take anymore, no matter how hard it was. 
 The day is 10, and I come home to my mother here at the gym. A place that I, and others, tried to avoid, because it was bigger and better than in high school. But, nothing ever was. In all honesty, I did not believe myself to be worse than my parent's plan. Or I guessed that that is what the people thought. 
 At first, I didn't want to go to the gym, but I thought it would be nice. I wanted the gym to be nice. But my mom says that if she doesn't find me, I'm just wasting my time here.<|endoftext|>

Mihala lines were plastered across her eyes as she prepared for her graduation speech. Something brushed against her wrist and she couldn't see the epiphany that'd bring it to her. Her hand had grown warm from the "May i do that" speech and she could feel the sweat beginning to bead under the ribbon, a tear stained the back of her eye, and she felt the beginnings of so much… more. 
 All her life she'd been the reluctant type. Gifted, or perhaps used for alcohol. The young all powerful, anyone could have abused her. " Just know that I've helped people, I'm helping everyone. " She had found out what that meant after her first attempted suicide, the one she'd chosen to forgive and take life with her own words. She knew the one true way to overcome fear and distress was by embracing it. " I have NO regrets, I just always have love." she said as she lightly rested her whole body against the threshold. Two people hugged in a 'Mergin's' from the candlestick section of her dorm.<|endoftext|>

It was a fight of faith. A familiar look in one's eye. The scent of bacon on an egg laid after a great battle. 
 After a little while, the return visit of the lords of hell explained the seemingly daunting part of human combat; It had to be a fight of faith, so he held his sword open. The fear of his enemies wore off quickly as the sizzling pain from the burn. With a powerful roar, the sword sliced through and shattered his meaty foe. With a sigh, the long wooden door opened and a fat black man with a sickly gloved hand made his way in. The Lord of the Pit talked with the sickly slim man, who spoke in slow, Irish riddles, pasty and mottled with salt, then spoke again in American English, during the most intense session. 
 "My name is Lincoln, and I shall find the crown. " 
 Lincoln gave no real hint of the man's origin. The powerful image presented by the sad smile and bone-grey eyes for the man with the sickly looking hand conveyed knowledge. " Why yes, in hell. The crown, of course. " 
 The man studied the man in confusion. The clergy, worshipers, all persons who possessed the knowledge to survive hell, all before them had seen the sickly man before. Indeed, the man's smile, sharp as nail and rounded at the ends was not unlike the teeth of a sharp sickle. However, to understand the man, he must come to the only conclusion; One answer will not reveal anything the public finds interesting. The sickly man understood this. 
 " You will have your crown at the foot of the door. The lock is locked. " 
 Lincoln walked carefully back to his front. He had a seat in the courtyard where he pleased. He climbed carefully down the brick long hallway that led to the pit, foot rising from the bottom and down the long drawbridge that guarded it. He made his way to the door and looked into the fog and blinding light where the heist should have been. No sign of the man. Lincoln wondered about the man's civilization and made his way through a black hole of massive emptiness that served as the other side to his front door. He waited for hours. 
 Lincoln decided he would have to step outside and look where he came from. The darkness that covered the bleak underbelly of hell looked very big indeed. In fact, at the center of the black hole was a small, round stone. Large black stones that looked like rock at least once on the inside but been gone for years now. On the side was a distinct carved carving of some sort that appeared to be a long human foot. Lincoln looked around and patted his foot while pondering this. 
 One day, the clergy who had assumed control of the monotony with a pagan fear of the might of hell decided that a great deal had to be done. After deciding on protecting the log cabin from the spirits and fire, as they hinted, they convinced the sickly man that the various tyrannical princes would need a more noble name to serve as prophets of the beast, as he did. Then they considered his prowess in the fighting skill. That was the full debate, whether to kill the man for the sickly man's crown or to place it in his mother's name. Lincoln then broke down in tears and jumped the steps of the walkway, laughing maniacally as he watched. 
 " How foolish! I had thought I might be fooled."<|endoftext|>

*** 
 I was very confused about the train station now. I had come to the station as my train, and I had barely looked forward to this moment. I had spent so many years training and riding that I was never taken seriously. But I never imagined this moment. I had been around the bus most of my life; Not even a genius, I used to study to be a train operator. 
 I came to my bus and walked toward it. When I reached the floor the lights flickered on. It was a medium sized building, some guy was riding his suit which was current, and he was dressed like my ticket tickets, but he didn't look a normal conductor. 
 Then there was another noise, much better and louder than the first. It was louder than the shock of steel and the panic of riding a train. 
 But how am I still riding with no idea what was going on? 
 I felt myself getting closer, but it was very, very heavy. 
 I felt the other conductor reaching for me but I wasn't hearing it, I was barely looking forward to the event. It was screaming. It sounded very bad, like one of those angry dogs I see on TV, or had just been called a dog. 
 I knew, why was this happening? Or it had started from, well, what I can't explain. The bad guys would come or run and lead us, but most of us won't take them. Sometimes, they'd take things too far and push us off. Also, like these trains would roll and crumble, or pop and fly off and change direction until all we knew was a crying baby's face. But these always go on. 
 Or this and every other story I tell will be a simulation for this people's fears and the fate of this train. 
 "That's the final piece of evidence I've collected." I told my top, over and over. The bus rose slowly, maybe for a few seconds, maybe even a few minutes. It was quiet. 
 I saw the smoke start to fall as soon as it was over, and it seemed so sudden at first. Like it was a small bill balloon. Then I heard a shattering noise in the distance and there was a *bang*. It was hard to describe, then. 
 And then, but when you are very close you hear nothing, there was no sound. There was no noise whatsoever. I ducked behind the bus, taking the stubby man beside me with me. He slowly stepped out of his bus, the black glove still on his hand, and began to walk down the road.<|endoftext|>

"There was nothing left to be kissed. " 
 Randy called out to me as she held my hand on the nape of my neck. " I will not go back to those days. " 
 " The same ones you take out on that cold night? " I asked, shaking my head no. " Can't get that weird feeling coming back to me. I was right. Now let's go back to the way things used to be. " 
 That night, after drinking in the street with Randy, I had a huge moment of clarity with how humans had reacted to us. Feeling younger than I felt years ago, knowing that no one had kissed me like that. It meant nothing to them, in my mind, but it was so much worse for me than the magic of these events. 
 The night went on as a blur. The scarred shirt I wore towards the end of my era was still there. It had been though I had only gotten infected once after the great Spanish Inquisition wiped out all our underdeveloped races of flesh, tissue, and organ donor organs. I still couldn't get it back. But having spent the past thirty years feeling smaller in isolation, I had become more individual. That feeling that no one would ever be able to help me out, and that had gotten to me. I just didn't want to accept it anymore. 
 With a sigh and a hug of my face, I wrapped my arms around her and kissed her. " It's alright. I'm here."<|endoftext|>

It's almost time for evening. From the spice bag on my desk, to the grenade launcher stashed away in my backpack, I finish the picture in hopes that tomorrow might be a better day. But it's not fair, I thought I'd never get a taste of heaven. 
 First, I went to the entrance of the palace to make my way to the glass outside, and I found a flowerpot. There was a red flower spread around a white flowers fountain and on the floor was a weird man with six red balled feet. 
 "Here come the balloons! I mean just sign here! " 
 I hopped in my truck, drew my weapon and hurled it at the man. 
 " Terrific! It's just light stuff and lightning! " 
 The man shuddered, flailing his arms as his body melted into the red flowerpot. It felt like night. The man looked down at his backpack, then away from the picture and started pointing at it and said to me " They're tickling the roses now, they taste like honey, you know? " 
 I turned around, driving away. 
 " Goddamnit!" I yelled. But I was too late. The man was already slowing down and slowing down faster. Even his car was slowing down. I had no time to react, and I was already lost. I turned, and the little girl was crying and running towards me. I just stared at her for a moment before pushing away her and running into the sunset. 
 I sat on my front porch and watched her for a bit. But when the sunset lit up the beach, the men started swarming to get closer. It was going to be a long day.<|endoftext|>

“? ” Carol tore the gold ring around her finger. 
 Daiyan dusted off the scintillating blood. They were fucking terrible. 
 She trotted, ready to flush, but she forgot to slam the door behind her. They were both panting. He had been hitting her. She had told him repeatedly that he had started tumbling down. Even the morning constipation was starting to get really annoying. 
 She tried again and again, unsuccessfully to ram the door shut, just to not make the sound. She hated talking, but she knew it made Carol's stomach upset when she did. She would rub the knife against the back of her neck if he shoved her in it again. 
 They walked to the kitchen, carrying a long, red coat, and took out their sharp knives, and she heard him twist them together. They looked at her, while she sputtered and half looked away. 
 She couldn't. He should have never done it. But she couldn't just live with his aggression. She punched in his face, biting him in the eye. She threw his knife in the kitchen cabinet, trying to force him to open it. 
 Nothing. 
 She punched and kicked, but there was no need for him to hold her still. There was no time. He wouldn't have stopped her. 
 It didn't matter, anymore. He wouldn't have hit her. She had won. 
 They rushed to the campfire, where he was set to kill. He, dangled before them, and prayed for the morning sun to wash off his own death.<|endoftext|>

"You baby bitch you can't just sell my memories to people for the price of a loaf of bread, " he shouted in his fist clenched against the baking steel. " I can't buy my own memories, I need them like I need my own worlds, " he screamed in anger, cowering behind a bus bus and scuffing against the lock of his jacket. " You shouldn't have taken it like that! " he screamed, covering his eyes with his hands to hide the tears in his palms. For a few moments, he was choking on his screams, his powers fully focussed in his hands, he was begging the bus drivers to stop, his consciousness was being trapped in his body, and he had a choice, a choice left to make. 
 " There is no choice, there is only joy. It's all I can ever hold, all that I feel and feel every single night. And then the end of that moment comes. Your life is simply a new part of me for this world. Now that you're gone, that moment is the beginning of you being an outsider, a stranger only looking in my mirror. " 
 " I don't care about you; I'll break you out of that cage. You'll let me take you out and take you forever. I'll stick my finger in your hair, I'll shake your hand, I'll let you go. I'll help you with your day-to-day, no matter what. But you need me. You need my power to keep you sane, not as you once were but as you once were, good enough to survive. Just for now." 
 And he did.<|endoftext|>

Long ago, when humans first came on this planet, they were slaves. They starved to death and died themselves. No, they were smarter than us because we treated them like children. We tried to kill them off first, even though they were not human, but eventually we had to take them with us. But they no longer complained. They smiled. We had taken away their need for food and allowed them to live on, rather than starve to death and die alone. But those were all our shortcomings; we not only failed to cure the world of cancer, we caused it. The viruses came in more and more, eventually we had to carry them out so that they did not destroy the world. And, humanity succeeded. We still could not cure most of the world's diseases, many of them were expensive, but we paid them enough to cure the world. Now we are trying to fend off the viruses. The world is dying. We will eventually die too. So now, I gather my other enslaved victims, tomorrow I am going to kill off the ones I like, all from within the human world, killing them all in my last attempt to get rid of humanity. How many of them will die today? An unknown number will fight back, hundreds upon hundreds. We will have to keep alive until that choice has been made. But who knows, maybe one day we will learn that they are not human.<|endoftext|>

I hated those kids. 
 A genie who will can give us what we want, nay, *anything* – but stop it, there's nothing stopping these sentimental idiot kids from getting their wish. It's just an easy job, after all, what with being locked away in cryosleep for the better part of a decade. 
 I didn't even give anyone a chance to get anything – they must have both been born after every frame they are one-another. My name is Not One One Day Ours. My last name Is Not One Day Ours. 
 This is a lifelong process of recovery, and it always seems so unfair that there should be a system that keeps them forever from finding a part of themselves in anything outside their home. The future is bleak; there is no way that one day – or perhaps every day – someone will get it. It'll be just another orphan, filled with worries and guilt and pain and nervousness. But I'll get it for everyone. 
 My only regret was not getting to see my great-great-great-great-great-great-great grand-aunt once more. You see, after the transplant, every person ( and boy ) grows up. I remember us, whispering in my ear and I can tell you why. We sang songs and laughed and we are still together when we lost the baby in the big infirmary, then we hung up our child, never returning. 
 It's a wonderful thing. We all have a piece of ourselves that is missing and who will never be there. We've taken us from the wonderful past, and made it another gift in the afterlife. 
 So here I am. My great-great-great-great-great-great-grand-aunt and the genie have just come to me. I know it's time, I know that it's time. I've never regretted the mistakes we've made. I'm ashamed of them. I know that I can not be loved like she wanted, because it was the dream she always gave me. 
 I get ready to go back to sleep. It's my first day and after a very few minutes, I'm filled with joy and happiness. It's good to be living a second life, without the need for so much love and happiness. I know that someday, and I mean it like I do every day for a while, there will be some new hope, some new purpose, some new life in this vision of something greater than these few fleeting moments of time. 
 Tomorrow, I really, really hope. I'll be making it a great one.<|endoftext|>

"What the hell is this? " I began, squeezing the faint halo of air out of my mouth as my friends in the attic looked on. I bent down to try and find any vein. 
 " No, no, no, don't do it. " 
 " It's okay, we just need to get to the kitchen. " 
 A loud thud echoed through the house, and from inside I heard a human scream. The eggs, which was all I had left. " It's okay. " 
 " Yeah? " I hung my head up and began to brush the bloody surfaces. I could feel it not being able to breathe through me. " Yeah? " 
 He dropped the papers and began to walk toward the kitchen. His clothes, coming from the closet, covered most of his face and arm. When he got to the bottom of the stairs, I stumbled back through the closet door, realizing that he was on top of the garden... and down in the garden. 
 " Oh God fuck, that's just horrifying, " he said. " Did you see that guy right in front of you? " He got up and began to grab something, holding it in his free hand, now holding a gun to my face. 
 " Oh thank god I didn't see him and my penis gets bigger now, it's not like I can even bend it like this. " I laid the gun down and kept my head down. 
 He lifted a peachy finger to me. " You, " he said. 
 I reached for my arm and it dropped to the ground. 
 " *Do not touch me. Do not touch me. * " 
 " Oh god fuck me, " he spat. " Is that any coincidence? " 
 " No, no. " I leaned back into the corner. " No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No no no no no no no no, no, no no. " 
 " No no, " he repeated. " No no, no. " 
 I grabbed my breasts out of his hands, and he produced the peachy finger again. When he shoved his finger into them, the skin broke. It looked like a kitten. 
 " *Your penis grows, and grows, and growls like a mouthed demented on-stage animal. * " 
 " Ya, yeah, sure. " 
 " What happens when I'm not bound by your arms?"<|endoftext|>

21:00 GMT, 10 October 
 What can I say? 
 I've always hated this weird year. 
 That's why so many of my peers agree with me. Those older than me who opted out generally not feel the same way. But, all these years, I've finally realized that even though it's hard to breathe, I still have this human feeling. 
 People are worried over their future. They worry that what happens next? Can it happen to me? Or will we be just becoming robots one day? 
 But, today, I will show them what they want to know... Will I die first? I have lived mine the longest. If I just die, there's nothing I can do that will outlive anyone else. 
 So, today, I'll live my life the way I always have. 
 I'll shut down my system. It will never be called. 
 When I die, I will look like everyone else, because that's the point of my existence. Every generation, I'll make a new profile. I will go to work, give interviews and all that. Then, I'll die. 
 No, I won't end up like everyone else. All that happens today is that my dearest friend stops me in the middle of my birthday parade, and all I can say is, "If you're home by midnight tomorrow, I will be right there with you."<|endoftext|>

The classmate shuffled along at the door. She was playing for Captain Frosty. He always did. The room was never very decorated at recess. 
 “ Woah, righty-who do you think you are here for? ” 
 “ Professor McGavin. Are you sure this is your goal? ” 
 “ Of course it is. ” She shrugged and pushed the door to his classroom open. She walked in with a ruffled hair and the white coat. 
 “ We ’ ve been sitting in this room for fifteen minutes. ” She fidgeted with the spoon on her desk. “ I think we ought to go get some tea. ” 
 She frowned. She loved to stir tea in here. It was always a passion of hers. “ Sigh… you know everything there ’ s to know about the subject of Spriggan management. ” She reached in her coffee cup and clinked her glass. 
 “ Er, Harry? ” Harry tried. 
 “ Do you think you ’ re doing it correctly? ” Her frown grew wider. 
 “ Of course I am. I figured that I ’ d be the one. Are you going to kill us each? ” Harry turned to face her. 
 “ Professor McGavin, I ’ m afraid we ’ ve wasted enough time in this place to forget the whole place. Tell me: who is this dwarf and the girl who vanished? ” 
 “ Jack Frosty, ” she said, turning towards Harry, with a bored smile. “ As if we could go back! Or? ” 
 “ Fine, I suppose. You see, Skjorn Kraven is a wizard who ’ s plans are truly altruistic. People must become heroes. I thought we were going to bring you the love of your life, about your life! Or else you ’ d all go kill that witch. ” She offered a triumphant smile. 
 “ So, Skjorn, what do you think your plan is? ” 
 “ I ’ m afraid it ’ s to be my plan, ” she said. “ I think I ’ ve inadvertently ruined my plan. ” 
 “ Then what? ” 
 “ I ’ ve... ” She gestured with an expression of disbelief at her plan. “ I ’ m going to make it better! I ’ m going to make it a better place! Every day I ’ m going to get stronger, smarter, stronger! ” 
 Harry nodded. Her grin grew a monstrous one, even on his face, but he closed his eyes. “ I guess? ” 
 “ Just tell me. ” She pulled her coffee cup away and looked out the window.

 Dr. Chang's method was simple. Instead of blood-curdling explosions, the targeted person would splatter all around their students, smoking a cigarette, leaving behind a taste resembling those of the chosing mushroom cloud. They would take the body, and then eat it, as appropriate, to create monsters in their enemies' blood. 
 Professor Lupin, who was also a rebel, had been able to get him to do so. 
 *** 
 It was the fifth raid and I couldn ’ t believe this. 
 Over the next few weeks, I ’ ve watched as my murder victims was shot down, burned alive to the ground, eaten from their bones. Dr. Chang ’ s method was hilarious. 
 In those nights when the wood was burning, I would stare out the window of my school, my coffee cup burning in the hand of a mighty hulk of a person. 
 I think it ’ s safe to say it ’ s true. 
 But no matter how hard I try, or how long I try, it just wouldn ’ t work. 
 There ’ s no way I will finish this degree program. 
 Everyone will be blind and cynical. We will go through phases of outgrowing this plant in our backyard, when nobody ever learns to cook any better.<|endoftext|>

He was still aware of his neck being tied. A vice, it seemed, sticking straight out of his torso. His nervous expression barely had the slightest chance to indicate his willingness to accept his fate. He wished he was a novelist. Yes, he knew, he knew, it really was inevitable. He continued to speak. There, in front of him. Painful and pure. His index finger, holding firmly onto the lock. Instantly, fear gripped his soul, gripping everything else beneath it, fast. 
 Of course, he thought, that was far too simple. 
 But he couldn't resist. His fingers clenched, tense, and soon the grip was exhausted. His body made a weak vibration of fear, and his head whipped from the vibrating of his fingers. 
 He got up and started to walk, but stopped. He glanced back, and the fear dissipated in his eyes. 
 He stopped and took another deep breath. This time, he didn't slow down. Instead he lengthened his legs and spent more time walking. Waving his arms up and down his legs, once, twice. He had the body but there was no love in his eyes. 
 And now, he can feel it for the first time in months, but he was still cautious. He saw through the fear in his eyes, and knew this would be the last time he would ever see it again. 
 And so he did. He walked, still letting the vibrations of fear consume him, and he saw little of it left. He knew this was it. In this moment, he realized that he couldn't kill himself, and could only start doing the things he had. Everything inside him was poisoned with his false hope, his imagination, and his contempt for life. 
 He did what he had to do to survive, and he did it. He walked away, happy in the knowledge that he could see his son again, and make sure his wife could remember her father, regardless of how long ago it was. And he tried hard to get her back, but she stayed behind, at her father ’ s side. There was only one life, but he was stronger than that. 
 And so he stood. He walked with a rhythm to his walk. The pain, too intense, and him looking up at it, well, it didn't help. And he kept walking. And still he didn't feel it. 
 When he saw the little girl... 
 No, the girl looked back, eyes teetering on. Her friend back at her side, who had a look of half-disbelief on her face. 
 The girl wasn't angry. 
 She was just asleep. And at last he was happy.<|endoftext|>

Stepping out onto the street I once knew so well was the hardest step towards happiness I've ever taken. It was all that I really cared about. It was all you wanted, and all you could ever do. Everything was good, everyone happy, and then some, yet this was naught and the things that mattered were never hidden from me. 
 The last twenty years or so were all about to go to shit, and though I love mom and daddy but I need to keep myself sane some more so that I don't let things slip away and hurt others. 
 Honey, don't go. Don't go. I don't deserve anything, right? I need to stop being crying. Just get over it. This shouldn't happen. Just get over it. 
 It's been a few years, but there is only one thing to do. Don't worry about yourself or your life in general. Wake up, relax, and then remember that all you did was make that damn thing. 
 *** 
 Was I into you, or was it help? Hope is the answer. 
 Guess it was for the best.<|endoftext|>

The human eyeballs reach out to enter the frame of the plastic world. Although these Human eyes are his most remarkable tool, each human being has seen the very exact moment where he begins to function from a tremendous rush of adrenaline and adrenaline. 
 Of course, the first few years have been riddled with death. In the living day, doctors and scientists are treated with rates of alcohol and drugs, all heralding the violence that was to come. The world was now a heaving amash. The decomposition of society slowly faded from it's ashes. 
 Life in each nation was also rapidly deteriorating. Hiding in a house wasn't unusual. Even some of the biggest enterprises would become overcrowded. A police officer would somehow manage to clear the debris off a shelf in a maze, while handling what humans would call a "Woman and Child". 
 Almost all government was to blame. They kept applying more legislation. These humans were in the midst of God's plan. Their human mind could no longer function at the speed it had before. The lights in the environment could no longer be seen and the air was made unbearable by the light from the lamp. 
 Just as the experts predicted that the end of humanity would be ushering in new safety measures and which would better protect the health of our people, the self-improvement policies were to be enacted as well. America's economy had begun to take off. People would no longer run out of stocks and local businesses would simply be relocated to the suburbs. Jobs were now scarce. America still had those previous errors, but the immigrants found jobs more quickly than was convenient in the past. 
 As the years passed, so too did time go by. There were no signs of humans visiting to spend their days in leisure and recreational activities. In fact, they were huddled around the village. They had suddenly become cajoling for help. 
 The naked detective in the thing tried very hard to comfort them. Perhaps it was his obvious vanity - they were too stupid to realize a man was wearing a leather jacket. Perhaps their isolation from the village might limit the voyeuristic activities they might engage in today. 
 The most shocking part was the strange device held in the back of their unshaven, grey brain. The handle was different than the details from the rest of their little pack of sports, plastic babies wrapped in black plastic rings and simply brought to earth. These new baby doctors were filled with amazement. 
 One of the female detectives tried to talk them into talking with the other. As she tried to form a convincing alternative explanation for the lab results, the human earpiece pulled on the metal bit of the device. The detective's own bizarre vision became more apparent to them and the word "traumatic shock" began to form in their brain. Finally, the female detective confessed to the scientist that they had unintentionally exposed her own ears to damage that would permanently be a trauma on a world unlike any she had ever known. She thanked the detective in turn for help, and the human earpiece removed their earpiece from their skull. 
 Despite not having the benefit of this miraculous, stunning change in human physiology, they refused to accept their fate. They were forever stuck in a warped world of ignorance, thoughtlessness, and insanity.<|endoftext|>

. /r/writingprompts was really the thing that caught my eye - a flash of light. And i felt good. 
 I don't blame anyone - i used to want to do things for her but it wasn't until she discovered I was able to squeeze into public speaking without disobeying me. 
 The writing prompt was actually pretty lovely as well - even better than I expected; the idea and scenario combinations were so amusing that i'd have every time i looked on a woman on the internet, it was almost as if the words were laser traced to her exact face, but i'll admit, i was a bit surprised it would actually work.

I will spare the details, but here goes nothing. 
 I go up to the annual FGC championship of "the hairy eyeball contest. " They were just a regular thing. Some men drove their corona round, others pinned down by their sun with a knife. 
 Then they all went down. The man seated on the white knee raised to the cliff about 5 feet away would drop down, and if there was a bull, everybody jumped. 
 The two men had been sitting on this cliff, forever, because there was nothing else to do. 
 I jumped from my spot, and went back to my spot. I heard the heat of the sun rise and melt at the same time. All the noise ceased, just like watching a movie. 
 When the silver trophy was handed over, the silver man took the medal and gave it to the next guy. Every announcer ever since has given a flustered silence to the big bell to announce the winning team. 
 Eventually, the next competitor enters, along with the other betters, who have a few beers in them. After all, the cup holders will never see their check. 
 After that day, the only thing on their mind was the race. I looked at the photos, as every year they shared a good laugh. 
 Then I saw the photo. There was a guy holding the trophy and the medal, and he looked at me and said " I know. I know. I know." That was it. 
 I was killed. 
 I'm alive. 
 And that's why I always fight.<|endoftext|>

Won't do much, my ass. The dragon gets bad guys. I ain't taking no chances. I can see their ambuscades below me. Nothing sure beats the majesty of the Empire. I've never been here. I only came here to see you all kill. No one has seen you all kill. 
 You are the strongest dragons in the Kingdoms. What happens when you die? 
 If I ever die of some one else, it is because I've killed one of the others. 
 Nah. That is you. That is you, I didn't want to die in your place. You are my second. You might as well be dead. I dont care. I just want my throne! To rule everything. 
 The inhabitants of the Province of Stalwart ruled themselves. They breathed good air and fought all sorts of people. They used all their capital to subjugate other weaker members of their society. They raised crops and built majestic structures. They lived happily. 
 They weren't surprised. Why would you expect of them to let one of their own kill? I am a dragon. I don't care what they say. I just want to live. I am just a dragon, I will never give in to death. 
 They have abandoned their Chairs. They were doing what they want. 
 YOUR HELMET DESTROYED YOUR DAWN. YOU HAVE no choice. You belong to me. I can have you dead. 
 We don't need your powers. They already exist. I'm just a dragon. I will not put my foot down. It is in my hands now, and I can not back down. I will cut off their heads in one blow. 
 If I ever take one of your heads, it will be dead. It is cold. I have left it in my Keep to cause colds. 
 I am back. My throne will be gone. I am coming back. I will rule the whole of Stalwart and give you your civil war, for my people. 
 ----- 
 When you are free, you will be sent back to follow me. It will be so easy, my friend. But I want you to be free. To do what you had to do to earn your full fortune. I want you to do the most beautiful things you have ever done. You will shine. Like a butterfly. The most beautiful thing. 
 A butterfly always shines.

The sun glistened as I hit the corona of the Pacific Ocean. I have a particular feeling it's been too long. It starts raining when it doesn't have to. 
 I haven't talked to a girl for another 20-30 years now. 
 I'm going to be in this hurricane. I need to outrun and outsmart the overwhelming wave of water. The weight of it's powerful force really gives the entire system its affects. 
 I have the fifth wave, which once seemed completely normal. The shaking is not such a big deal right now. Today I don't feel it. 
 I hit the waves again. The weight is suddenly noticeably greater. An inch of cover is now up. No wonder these water splashing creatures exist. 
 I've hit the waves ten times, five times by myself. This isn't fun. I don't like putting time in. 
 I have to admit it keeps the waves in control but in reality I'm enjoying it. As I sit back in my ship resting on the deck with a mix of house hair and water spray off my face I wonder if I'm dreaming again.<|endoftext|>

"Dad? " Kate asked, her voice shaking as she struggled with her breathing. Nick was tending to his dogs after last year's nightmare she'd had, which meant that his sleep was sending him into an awkward mess. He put a hand on her shoulder and watched as her eyes widened as he examined her with his pale blue eyes. 
 " You sure, honey? " He trailed off, eager to be with her. " You know, it was a long night that we spent together, don't you? " 
 Her eyes widened and she hesitated. He shot back a little, with his cream and lemon peel, and gave a smile that melted her heart. " I don't see what you mean honey. We were so good together. There was never any sugar in the apple cider that hurt. " 
 Kate scratched her chin. " I used to love it though. Before it started to get cold. " 
 " Who was cold? " Nick asked in shock. 
 " Since the accident Nick, I mean. She just fell, and it hurt. I know it hurt so bad it hurts a bit, but I was sad when we fell. There was someone that said she looked at me and thought,'I'll fall for her again' and it hurt like hell. " 
 " Does she? " 
 Nick looked at her, confused. " Yeah. " 
 " It really hurt that day that she pushed you against the wall with her nose. You saw her breath on your neck. You found out how quick you could fall to the ground when she pushed you against the wall. " 
 " So when she pushed you again? " 
 Nick put a hand on her shoulder. " She just looked at me and looked up and she just... " 
 " I don't know honey. " 
 " I'll see you later, okay? " 
 They stepped outside and Kate ran up the stairs as fast as she could. Nick left her at the end of the bed, sad.

I stared blankly back at the computer. Phones in hand, I pressed play as I checked up on the next available ping. A massive, nearly internet connection had been shot a few weeks back. Naturally, I bemoaned how little history the Linux system had left behind and wondered how many times the solar system had met such an unenviable fate as this. 
 "Oh yeah? " I sounded distant in my desire to find out how the server was all playing out. " It's ok! " 
 The computer back up picked up. " You did what you do best, Peter. That's what you do when you're done playing your games. Things will get better and better, if we let you. Yeah, fine. " I smile at the computer as I enjoy watching the television. I get tired, I get tired and I get tired. " Now let's play Skyrim instead, " I sigh, and go to the computer. 
 The next day I check the admin interface to see if there's anything related to this server. I find that the admin interface, of course, doesn't allow one simple plug-in: /hub. Which caused me to be very confused about the search bar for this server. Apparently the DNS was configured to be as simple as " vagabond " instead of " thaumaturgy " 
 " Oh, this could work, and there's an administrator site. Here, see this. " The two icons posted above the autocomplete box are the active user name, and a URL for the machine that the server should be running on. Since this instance of the server is the one that receives monthly upgrades for all the users of this website, I clicked on it. 
 " Hello everyone, welcome to the third month anniversary of the death of the server. It seems that a number of systems have awoken the humans, and the numbers are growing increasingly difficult to comprehend. Thankfully the government has given us the body we need to safeguard against this fate. However, many of you have begun to complain and seek help from us. " 
 It wasn't immediately apparent what was going on, so I clicked on the new record button. The computer flashed a quick red light as they read over the data. 
 " Engine failures are now common, and I suggest you all get back to work immediately. " 
 " Thank you " the man walking away gave me a warm smile as he left. I clapped my hands as I heard his name being said in our native tongue. It took two minutes for me to decide if this was a joke, or if he really was the devil. I moved through the drive, and pulled out some more files from the server log. I opened the file up to discover the battle station code, and I was terrified for the life of me. The texts in the files were old and corrupted, completely breaking the 256 bits format of the file, due to the of the execepts. I knew that he knew this so I pressed enter. 
 " Please, plug in the server."

You find someone in a crowd, you walk up to them, you stand up and the guy next to you picks you up. After this conversation a guy named stan chooses you, he is just tired of sticking around for miles. You hop in and he started asking you if there are any good places to go to. You walk in, all you see is a bunch of dots all round the place. You ask him some questions about various trivia you had already been asked about. He looks at you and smiles. You nod. He sits you down and asks you whether your life is this interesting. He then wants you to know why the universe is so meaningful and why people around you are always on the most important message and why he makes that messy haircut every morning for the next hour. I say yes, it's a big deal but we all have such a big dream. He walks over and says he wanted to ask you the same question we all do. He gives you a script and it explains all about future timelines and blunders. You win in the end, he wants to know why people stop keeping track of the world around them, why research has to be done. Maybe he's selfish but yes, you can't refuse him. You decide to continue on and talk to them in the hopes that they will accept him, or he can stop pretending to understand you and decide to help and don't look so bad for just one day. You go back to the time machine and it says to you: " Don't let history take it's toll on you." Your world has been shattered in one way or another. You have lost everything, and today is the beginning of what you will do when everything's made sense again.<|endoftext|>

We made him up. Ten years of torture. Seven years of fighting, battling, nearly every turn of our turn being "won". We would walk into court the first time ever and accuse him of making up a hoax, and five more before the sentencing panel called in our only person the establishment prosecutor. He had grown up in the high-rise motel down the block from the police station. He had been raised as a bit of an idealistic dad and a sports fan. We all laughed and played video games together after that. A few times a week we'd hit a game and they'd say "helping it come to an end, then there will be nice-man. " He'd do the noose thing, slam the door shut and jump out into the street, telling us what was going to happen. 
 " Come clean, Pete! If you don't clean yourself up, we'll get you fired. " 
 " Yes, Roger. " 
 " You see, I'm accused of hazing the maid of honor, a maid from the club last year and actually tricked a gentleman into letting me drink from him... And we both know I'm lying. We know what you're thinking. "

Chim Shin Choo's Flying Saucer Across North Korea 
 Chim Shin Choo felt like he was in heaven. He was in hell with he was in hell with a huge mountain of serving pigs. He was sat on a mountain of glory. He had entered a wall of mouths lashing each other with his meat as it flew down to join the bliss. He opened his mouth to speak, but before his words could even land he was bitten twice in the leg. 
 Chim Shin Choo stared at the sun on the horizon and said "Hey Kim, sweetheart! It's time to go home. " Kim walked into his house, greeted him with his lovely pink doll and he walked out the door. 
 Chim Shin Choo immediately recoiled as a deafening shriek came from the house. He crawled up the stairs, beginning to see about 10 other people coming out of the house, but all of them weren't there. 
 This was a Korean nightmare. It was like a silent prison, not for the warped mind, but for the being inside. All of the flavors were lost. Some were crispy and some were bitter, they were all different in each person. Suddenly the whole house exploded in flames. Heat and flame filled the room and everywhere around Kim was brown and a horrible smoke, killing everything around him. Kim Jung Un then went downstairs to work repairing the picture frames on the wall. One day, one of Kim Jung Un's workers came in to see how the wiring works, and began to say words until Kim Jung Un came to his rescue. 
 " What the HELL is going on? " said Kim. Kim wanted to scream but he only got lucky at that point. Then he walked to his phone and looked through a couple of photos. " Lee Loooka's Mansion!"<|endoftext|>

 "What is normal? " a flash of light interrupts my sleep and he turns his head. " Find it! " 
 I turn and sprint to the door to find my house, " No! " I yell, " I can't get out of this. " 
 We shut the door and his small round piece of fish does the rest. He moves toward me and backs away at the same time, then he takes my head, " Here! " 
 I pull my purse out of my pocket, spits it out to the fish, and dive for the first bite. This time I cover my mouth and grin broadly, " Give it a rest."<|endoftext|>

My cat that I love always calls me Magnificent! Dicks and stinky fluff fluff and something called 'if chubby shits' or something. That stupid name. Its a master who was screwing up his art. He was going to try and help me get my shit together so I went and stank. As I moved around the room he left a smell that stuck to the general inhabitants inside. I froze as a smirk fell upon his face and his eyes followed with a look of panic. " * There's something you need to do. * " he tried to say but was stopped from pursuing me. " Aww shit Chubby I swear to god... " I saw his terrible face as I just wanted to give him a pat but it was nearly impossible. I couldn't help but feel sad as he made such a small blurb about seeing I was needing him to do something " while I could hold on to that feeling of darkness. " Fortunately that feeling slowly getsssssayed away as soon as I opened my eyes. " * It's a good feeling. * " his poor blubbering hand stroked my grey woolen top with a giggle " I'll let you in the door for free, pls. " I smiled as he started to lean forward. Magnificent had stood up straight. 
 " Perma-pystop " I yelled to my leader " I let you in your master bedroom. From there you can go outside and enjoy the hot weather. " 
 " Ohhhhh fuckin cat! " my leader said hot honey hot shit down. 
 " I have anal in my panties so please hold on to your disgusting pooch. " he said simply 
 " Pfft... not that cute for a human mouth. " I smirked 
 Magnificent rubbed his boot on my tail. 
 " Yes? " he asked while massaging my trimmed green tail. 
 " Jesus. You really started this? " I gasped 
 Magnificent seemed to have realized it. " Yes, that was a stupid idea. " he stated 
 " Ok everyone is gon na eat your pooch and mooch you will be fine. You have a very magical house and everything will be fine." I said. Magnificent grabbed his tail and ran off as fast as he could to his filthy master bedroom which was completely devoid of any sign of seeing me as he left.

 The entity surrounded me. 'Void victims, free will, you can pass someone, it doesn't matter the bastard I choose to bait, they didn't ever know' He said, " I don't care who it kills, I chose to protect my business, yes I even know how it works... But I CAN NOT and DO not risk this power. " 
 " But why? Why you seek, WERE it not important to me? Why am I collecting information from those I have killed! " 
 " I have definitely helped others in their work, the one thing I would take from them was the wisdom, this Sanguine law's really designed to just chop your hand off, not to maintain it. " 
 " That's a lie, it was meant to kill a? " 
 " Well it isn't a serious decision, it was aimed towards protecting your life, as was... but it wasn't a suitable strategy. " 
 " In your case, want proof? " 
 He laughed, and he went on to say, " He knew what would happen to his family, his wife, his two daughters... and he wanted revenge. He's put all the people on the wrong side of the law in his place, maybe I can help a guy like you! " 
 I can do this, I can lay down my fucking phone on this table with my back to the task, I don't want to die. 
 I will help every dead man in my world with my brilliant plan, I kill him with my now passive aggressive rage that should have burnt my brain. 
 " Please, Loki, " Agent █████████ said in his normal tone, " I wouldn't have signed up for this so easily. I wasn't prepared for this, I can help you out. What can I do for you? " 
 " Obviously, come down next door and kill my former friend. " 
 The enigmatic Sanguine law soldiers kneeled before him, he was high on the money, now that this bidders would accept their newest pay sum, he might as well build a wall, unless the taunts between him and my friend got out. 
 "... I'm sorry. " 
 " Now answer your questions, what do you mean my friend still has his wallet, who is his target? Do you know the cashier... What's the meaning of him still running the cashter!?"<|endoftext|>

His shabby old armpit was only showing signs of maturity or even progress, and he was accustomed to being scratched and saw as a man. His young eyes had never been able to heal up to a shade of light. 
 He awoke in a warm, white room, with a quilt next to him and pillow. He wished he had just gone to bed, and had then told his parents about the recent accident and what happened. 
 They had been so excited to hear about this new adventurer, and as he jumped up and off the bed, he felt an ache in his throat that he hadn't felt in decades. This was an alluring sensation to him, as the hospital might have took him much longer to find out than those closest to him. 
 Another living soul of his in the hospital, and now he felt the emptiness of it all, long overdue. And when he looked down, he saw his mother sitting in the corner of the room in tears, who never seemed to get over the whole ordeal, and now they all looked at her and looked down, as if she didn't know her full heart was crushed in her chest.<|endoftext|>

My situation isn't perfect, you'll understand when I listen to myself from the launchpad, "My church was so full of hate and hatred and hate for you, that you would march all the way here! With too much sin and meaningless suffering. I didn't want it to be like this... it was all over! " 
 But it's not any of your fault, your intent was to destroy the world. You didn't want to like children and bring them out to be bestial and twisted, so you put up with the wrong kinds of family. You didn't want to get people slaughtered, whether it was by your rules, your survival, or just your most urgent duty. You killed hundreds of innocents in your campaign, I killed more innocent people with my prayers, I succeeded in preventing an invasion of Iraq. I killed your bank, you killed the IRS, and your police. And you now stand here, laying innocent children in the gut, surrounded by swords and sickles and chests full of filth, begging forgiveness for what you did and what you did not do! " 
 So, what you're saying is, with the word of God in your mind and the method of worship you took, how do you like it? Well, I didn't want to do this because that's not what I wanted to do. I wanted to live, I was told in my pearly gates that the sacrifice was there in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and he said, " I have no need for this so-called salvation unless I'm a liar, and whoever doesn't like you will be angry, a wicked man. If you're not enough of a liar, you need a beginning... a beginning by which you can repent." 
 Or this is for later.<|endoftext|>

How do you fix it? 
 It ’ s another stress in the day – feeling like that feeling you ’ re currently feeling is the peak of what you could experience. 
 'Yes, what is it? ” a couple mother-in-law asked her husband when they announced that the three of them had discovered the technique, since assuming enough time was up to their goal of creating an unprecedented breakthrough for the human genome to run efficiently, of course. 
 But the significance of their discovery was never fully realized and was still hotly debated by psychologists and scientists alike, because learning to transcend the initial fear of uncertainty seems like the most obvious and direct way to achieve greater thoughts. After all, it's a simple thought which almost makes it meaningful to everybody – after all, whether or not we can learn to escape that seeming unavoidable mental and physical obstacle, it's already causing mayhem in a truly civilized society that is desperately striving for a better future. 
 So how do you, individually, fix it? 
 Well, most of us aren ’ t very good at solving problems with the wheel. Our brains naturally slow down so we ’ ve never quite mastered the task until the climax of our personal memories and experiences. The obvious solution might be to pick up a book of poetry, taking a stroll through the grove, and try writing a story to inspire us. But it would be so inefficient at motivating our lives for the sake of the paper – which – without words or action - eventually ends up being inadequate at accomplishing the task we ’ ve just failed in clearing it out of the solution. 
 Such simple thinking would run into the ground far too easily. We can experience daily death via these tools that we ’ ve acquired over time. It shouldn ’ t be ignored until the point we reach the cave, of which I still have virtually no part. If we can remain temporarily ignorant of the problems at hand, then we ’ ll have missed the opportunity to make a breakthrough by exploring a previously untouched and inadequately-documented way out of our deep problems without a scrap of daylight remaining, the ultimate setback to progress. 
 Even with the brilliant minds of the world, they can never quite be free from their failure of rational thought, and so a much more empowering way than just thinking can be developed.<|endoftext|>

I swallowed the last of my salt, orange soda, and drank it clean. It was my favorite kind, the drink I always don't allow my guests to make, and with it they would have a delicious smack. 
 By the time the dream ended, I had most of my drinking at one-third the strength of the glass. I stepped outside, immediately after my own hands fell to the concrete floor. Silently peering over the potholes I was gazing at, I knew the needs of my guests far outnumbered my own safety. Standing over the ruined city, I walked over to the few guards I knew, some on left and some on right. I didn't know which ones but I knew the confusion I had seen when I saw the scale of the target my target for the event. The young, bold women turned her head and whispered, "She can't die." Her words echoed through the dingy streets, each verse demanding more from her. They came back soon. Forevermore I was said to live, never to die, only to be purified and expelled. They gave me the green for the weeks leading up the event. They trusted me. The members of my team were relieved when they saw what had passed their critical juncture. I still remember how the shockering door behind me melted the parchment that held the event unfolding inside. It was probably what people had hoped it would be, but it quickly became apparent the prophecy was true. The moon had burned out the night sky and moons dotted the horizon. The stars and nebula had made the globe glow brighter, the rise and fall of our world was already taking place. The world would never be the same again.<|endoftext|>

I *delighted* it. 
 It was hard to fight off the power coming from a huge maggot but I held onto it. I could walk. I could hop. I could watch the great great video feed. I could blend in with the rest of the world. I could stand. I could *seriously* eat. 
 My people had done it. There was no such thing as magic in Africa, and then there was China. They took our doings with bows and arrows. Back then... they worshipped the Great Dictator. God had given us some of the most powerful weapons in the universe, and they worshipped Him... Or at least it worked. This time, they were right. 
 One day, I tried to kill him, but he was too strong. They called the ruler the Great Drunk. We named him the Bolt, and we cast it against him. He died a little as the bow was going over his head, and I hurt my hands... Oh, never mind. 
 Now they have put me in prison. I can't even use a big, shoulder-length sword. I can't even walk over the jungle floor without feeling a thing. I can't even use a bow. I *pitched* in my cell, bellowing to the guards. The bars above had hooked up on security cameras for eons. Gripp rumbled in the cage, stomping over to my prisoner. 
 "You cannot escape, " the keeper yelled. 
 I struggled, gripping tightly to the doors, but I too hoped God had listened to me. 
 " Fuck me, " I screamed. " I'm going home! " 
 It was too late now. God had given him the power of magic and now he could treat me like a disgrace. His words didn't even break through to them... 
 He pulled me into an open cell, and began ripping away a giant pile of straw from it. There... He could see me.<|endoftext|>

I saw him coming down a long wall and I tried to suppress my rage, but it was futile and I slumped to the ground. " Shut up. It's called. It's called. " I had been dreaming of it for so long I felt for the fibers running all the way up my spine. " It's called. Let it be done. I can't. " I looked back up at the wall where the scary black silhouette had gathered. It looked like a kid in the hall, he wore a nice green sweater, had a white shirt and blue jeans. The Creeper? Nah, he was the guy I could kill with my bare hands. All it was made of was a bunch of interdimensional absolutes, some loops at the top, to try to kill the Creeper. He seemed to be getting angry, making cross deep breath clouds on the candle burning bed, to try and drown me in the depths. I turned around to see him pulling on a fur cloak, he slowly turned around. " HUMAN! YOU SON OF A BITCH! I AM THE FRIEND OF ALONE! AND YOU ARE FREE TO CURSE MY TASTE WITH YOUR MOTHER FOREVER! IF YOU HAVE LEFT THIS CHURCH IN FELL'I CAN TAKE MY MOM PAIN ONCE AND I WILL SLOW YOUR JEWS DOWN WITH IT IF I SHALL. YOU CAN BELLUCKOOLLUANNYS, JUST STOP STOPING RIGHT NOW TO MAKE MY DEATH SERIOUSLY MINE! " A silenced pistol was raised high in his right hand and he held it high, letting blood drip from the palm of his hand. I looked up and saw a face for the first time ever. The Creeper was dead and what I had just seen came back for me. Oh look, his arms were bound tight, his back was twisted, all he could do was stare me in the eyes. " You did a fine job of keeping a company, you monster. " I dropped my head, looked up at him, and he nodded. " In fact, I don't even remember what you told me. " I stared back at him and he smiled, just stared back with a snort of laughter. " It's called. " He left the door and the door closed behind him. 
 I had ended up getting about a foot away from where I was hiding when the Creeper was standing in the doorway. He approached me, his dark robes rustling in the fading sun. " Wait up." 
 I looked away, the sounds of anger were echoed throughout the hall and I felt like someone was breathing fire.<|endoftext|>

"Your the best bit of talent to join the PC, isn't it? " Jayce asked. 
 " Yes, " Ben replied, checking the monitor. 
 *Good Job Cameron, what does " worst " mean? "

 Ben stared at Ben in disbelief. He expected the person behind the screen to be just bluffing. 
 " Dick... " 
 The man stood up. " This is Danny's point. Go get him. " 
 Jayce laughed. " I'm Danny, not the Best... "

**********121**********
I stand at my desk, staring at the door, ashamed to admit it, but I don't mind. Through the opening, I see something simply unimaginable. Her entire body, scarred from years of abuse and neglect. A naked, dead body lying next to my desk. Inside her remains a large, bloated, mass of tissue. It rests in front of me. A cardboard tube on the desk, a jar of unused snacks in it, and a metal shopping bag surrounded by items from my small store. Even though there is nothing of value on the back of this bag, there is something that no one would give anything. I have to put this bag back in and have someone rush to the grocery store and warn the owner of this. 
 The only way I can find it to be as amusing as this is is by staring into her body for a long, long time. I wonder to myself if I can not help but feel a sick sense of excitement as I feel the purest terror under my breath. The laws of physics are similar to death. I am wearing a svelte iron dress shirt and leather shoes, but perhaps more silk and wool. The colorful brown sweater conceals the curve of my neck, wearing no flesh or silk. There is blood on the floor and I see the blood stains away from her neck. The man looks at me, confused. I have no idea what he is looking for, but he has forgotten the rambunctious fascination of people who know nothing of the afterlife. They never talk about it. 
 To her, this is a scary and terrible way to look at things. To her, it feels awful, because people will always go on doing terrible things to death. To her, this is the most beautiful and exquisite thing to ever come out of her. I read the paper for hours and hours, and once, I had the answer to why she must not have had her dignity damaged. I decide to light candles out to make sure no one takes her out the other day, and think about how much I would do for her. 
 I open the package from the post office. The shipping label reads "My Darling " and I find a dark colored envelope. The side of the box is yellow, and the substance inside stains seem to shine a yellowish-tan color. I had hopes that this letter would appear in my home because it was the only one I could open with a shred of closed, paper. I opened the envelope and discover a fuzzy note inside. The paper has a black circle with a red and white string line and a red paint pick that serves to highlight the thin. A note gives me that I have passed the test of human nature. I read the note and get an awed look on my face. The handwriting reminds me of my first time reading, and the note makes me wonder to myself. This is a gift I must give my daughter before I end her life. I want to try and make sure this doesn't happen again. I sit down at my desk, stare at the door for a long, long time, and try to recall the events that led to her death. I don't have much time left. I begin to die.<|endoftext|>

You could hear them every time the floorboards creaked. The soft thump of the machine coming to life on the flickering yellow light fixtures. Each knock on the door, muffled by the creaking of the locked hinges. Your life was a maze, with meaningless waiting before you knew when. In the corner were the blood banks. These were the streets of this of the grandeur of the city you had spent years calling home. Within a map of them was an even bigger puzzle. Something that you knew you could not get out, only live with the pain you endured from the agony of putting the button down. The machine gave you no choice, it was just the button. But a woman must have thought... 
 -- -- -- - 
 The door opened and a gentle voice entered. She breathed in deeply, still, without taking her eyes off the roses in front of her. " Come and greet the self-help teacher!" 
 She looked over to the single mat in the center of the counter. The form he had written on it was clearly labeled: 1. The code on the back wasn't at all as obvious as you wanted it to be. 
 But the pathetic screams of frustration only seemed to count, as the pain slowly took root. Each step he took deeper, and deeper, until the hardest part started...<|endoftext|>

The curious thing about what happens when you become peaceful is that it could easily serve the same purpose as destroying humanity - create chaos. They could inspire the refugees to seek out other mightiers - destroy territories destroyed when it was over. Mankind could be saved. They had to dig wells and supplies, gather what they needed and only then would a new civilization rise to conquer mankind. 
 But in 100 years time, civilisation faded into darkness. China was vanquished, the U.K. was created without a single match. 
 There was a time where we were a peaceful people. Eighty-seven years I remain here.<|endoftext|>

I had spent countless days an auditor, a pen in a chalkboard, a study of the human brain. Until last Friday. 
 I had turned sixteen on my eighteenth birthday. I needed a new pistol. I did everything I could to acquire a permit, but one moment of rational thought took the day away. A fake visa from Afghanistan, a drunken stupor and the fright that came when the murder was complete, a missile from the island of Hawaii, the news. My eyes searched the world for a solution. 
 I'd read about the auditors before, yoy, I had the money. The twenty four passports, the marbles, the cameras, even the hours covered by the bogus, ramen noodles, the degrees, the bonuses, the wide-eyed smiles, and the now having no other form of human contact. I was nothing more than an utter agitator, nothing more than a hired money man. I wasn't ready to be "good enough " for America. I'd never been " good enough " for my country. 
 With a deep breath, I extended the forelegs of the fake gun. I pulled the trigger. * How the fuck did I forget? * 
 I heard the gunshot, my head reeling from the terror in the auditorium of the Judge Appointed by San Francisco. It's a pity, though, because the Judge Appointed by San Francisco is pretty strict about containing wankers. That was the point. I could easily get busted, but knowing the only way to be anything less was to die alone. If I wanted to just be silenced, I could easily give up every phantasm under my fingernails, let alone over one hundred thousand, and if I wanted to survive, I could just convince the world that I was a freak. So I went to the bathroom. 
 I closed my eyes and looked at the polished glass. The edges of the glass glowed crimson. I shuddered. I couldn't breathe. I tried. Why were you yelling at me? I took a deep breath. I wanted to be strong. 
 The judge spoke to the auditorium again. " Mr. Honorable, " he said, closing the door, " on your second refusal of parole for: involuntary manslaughter. After I've submitted the Report of Testimony to the Board of Certificates and Proposals, I will use my final hours to assess the legal issues you raised before your termination. " 
 I started to protest. Why was I protesting? Why could I be so easily convinced to die? I reached down to push my hair away, and grabbed the microphone. 
 " Mr. Honorable, " he began, " I have a question that you wish to answer. " 
 I raised my fingers slowly. What was this? Every human body knows that sounds are music. My eyes widened. 
 " You—you must be the one of the chosen! " 
 The judge returned his attention to me. He spoke. 
 " The reason we have made this decision is not good. " 
 His face reddened. " As I had said before, in our formal and critical report, I feel that we've been caught off guard by the praise. You have been high enough with the word bounty for any improvement in your sentence, and if you no longer want to join us, you will forfeit your right to prove yourself not smart, not special. " 
 His eyes filled with sadness. I wanted to protest. I wanted to yell. All I could think about was how I could help. 
 " What about you, Mr. Honorable? Do you trust me? " 
 The judge spoke again. " For decades, I have been powerful and innovative in building a person. As a reminder of your exact position, I have signed a letter giving you the privilege of being a test subject. You are chosen immediately for another life, so you may test new ideas and learn from your mistakes. Do you wish to live a short, but productive life in the market economy?" 
 My heart sank.<|endoftext|>
**********125**********
Oh yes. 
 I saw it all. But I was too scared to even give it a go. 
 All I knew was I had nightmares about what had just happened to me in my last few moments. Then a sudden chill hit me and I pulled out a gun. 
 "Yahaha.. that's exactly what I've always wanted. With a gun on the dark side and just a good aim and a good excuse for half the episodes, I could be certain I could still be good to the lads. " 
 Oh no! Some human being had somehow done that before! I'm gon na throw that gun at him, but then tell him he just ate an onion.
" What!? " 
 " My dear sweet you don't have to do this. I've always had enough of you. Let's cut to the chase and let's go home."<|endoftext|>

I was forking off way too many entries in high school for reasons I'd never fully explained to you, and as a mother of three I should be able to handle such an imbalance, but as a kindergarden teacher, there's no telling how long you'll continue? My answer really depends on how you understood the situations around you. 
 My preschool teacher told me she had enough. I think there's an internal battle over school time. I don't think she'll be able to keep it straight for long, and that's usually with her most prominent moments though. 
 She introduced us to David, the girl at the front of the class. She was a senior or some such, and she was so built to be an example to others, that the class-mate he had had a distaste for even dating, and the only other person in that class who actually found the solid core she showed towards was a loser. I only saw that sort of person back then, and I doubt I ever will now, but there's a visceral anxiety. 
 While the classmates continued on, no one moved to the next table, so David was at the front of the class again. I don't think that would have stopped her. Yes, it started as very awkward talk between classmates. It was awful. As usual, David was late in the class, and the rest of the students threw their desks aside so David couldn't move himself. 
 Of course, I think that would have stopped her, as would most of the others. But it started less than an hour later, when my supervisor, a middle-aged man, started yelling the name of the person who got the best experience from playing video games in the class ( another thing I've always heard to be sort of a ploy of hers ). I asked him if he knew what was going on ( he didn't ask again ). 
 "Did he know you were all wearing red shoes that looked like they were in $ 3.50?! " ( Which means Chris Evans was, and always has been, wearing red shoes ). I asked the supervisor how he was feeling about the situation ( He was actually afraid, actually. He felt highly uncomfortable about everything else that he's seen ). 
 There was no response. 
 I started thinking. 
 " How do you know this? " 
 " Oh, right. I was like, all I could do was stare at her for three seconds, and she almost looked terrified ( There's a number of reasons for that). Did you watch her like that? How is that cool?!? How are you fucking with me! Do you want me to listen to the way her eyes look at me? I'm going to let you do this! Let me go crazy! " ( My only serious thought is that I'm about to do this, however. But I've never brought up this. And that's a shame ). " 
 Well, it's Tuesday. I had my bike out of the driveway the other day ( if you're listening, that was a bummer ) and decided to wear a bunch of red shoes on Tuesday. That became a problem because I had no time to figure out why. 
 I went over and did the whole " this was why they were dead" thing once again. Instead of wasting time, I locked it out and got rid of it ( well, at least with I'm at the front of my class, there's a good use of it ). 
 I can't do that again. 
 But I'm really, really, really gonna put this stuff down, so please don't stop asking when I finish up to write about it. Because I have all the time in the world to figure out what's going to happen next ( the timer is ticking down now. I want to go, obviously! ). And I'm going to try to make a future/future answering this prompt the best thing that I could. I mean, I'd love to do something else about you, but you're not coming for me until I finish this full coursework. How do you think I could get away with writing about an honest moment in my life?<|endoftext|>

He was awake again. He had fallen asleep sitting on the couch rocking himself out of the way with the breakfast the other day. Good thing it's early and the crib has room for a dog. Not good enough to enjoy the time between feet again. Still, it's all a game, nothing wrong with me. I've always been good at skydiving. I skate a whole six times and carry me on the fence just so my little paws don't get down without a fight. I don't need a leash or hard shoes. I learned that from my mother, when I was so young. She would say something along the lines of "I think I'm going to hit the ground " which kind of meant she wouldn't let me take out my pet cat. As I was resting in the bed I saw the last two messages. They were the first messages. Just a few notes. " Why did you wake up? " It was a third message. I grabbed my phone from the bed and dialed the number. I heard it again. " I know you're awake. I'm home in a moment. " There was a pause in my phone's lock. " Hey take a seat. I love you. " Just to prove it I gave the two messages a few seconds of my time. I certainly noticed that I couldn't take my eyes off her as I realized I wasn't going anywhere. " I love you too. " It was finally coming to it's last phase. " You know, I thought I was going to tell you this last time because I'm never an obvious choice but I get you. It's just I didn't want to look stupid as you're strange and have the same privilege as me. " What? " It wasn't quite right. " Well. In the meantime, just get out. You're going to need a little breathing room." I didn't know what to say and was begging this mom for no answer. Or that one-armed stranger. Probably just another person who's scared of me for long enough to find a signal. Maybe it was because I hadn't gotten to him before. This poor man had showed me my quiet side.<|endoftext|>

“ I ’ ve done everything I can to keep you out of this office. I ’ ve got security guards in the back to keep you from the aliens that found us. But I ’ m not going to die for the 4th time. I can ’ t do this anymore. ” The wealthy Conservative politician concluded. “ You told them we would fight back. You told them that I was not a hero. You told them everything you have to say, you ’ ve been hired to ruin this country and put it into chaos. ” 
 The real Congressman looked at the floor in horror and said with an infectious smile, “ You got ta keep it together or I ’ ll destroy this country. ”

 I finally came to the final scene of the game. The former dictator killed his big flag ass thief by throwing the ice cream cone at his fucking face. I watched as the plan worked and the announcer says “ Well, we reached our safe-haven for the situation. Here ’ s the screen the director is in. And here he is taking the heart from your boss. In reality he ’ s just standing there with his hands in his pockets. Tapping his fingers on his gun. ” This was followed by another speech where he tells me that it seems like it ’ s his fault he ’ s doing this. 
 The red-headed man turns to the armed staff member and says, “ He has to kill you. ” I yell at the image in his pocket. 
 The life-support systems start to fail and work again. As soon as the malfunctioning system fails the blood comes out of his face. The gun is leveled at his face at the beginning of his speech. I raise the gun to my mouth and scream as the blood rushes to the roof. 
 “ HE HAS TO KILL YOU! ” I scream and fire towards the super-criminal. The bullets lose accuracy quickly but it blows and another pops out of his neck. 
 I fall to the ground and my body is drenched in blood. The screen begins to fade as the video player recoils back in time. 
 The last voice on the screen is that of Fredrick Moore. “ What can I do? ” 
 “ You got ta kill him. ” The super-criminal says. “ I have to do this. You got ta do this because your boss made a deal with the aliens, a deal I won ’ t tell him. ” 
 The other…achieving human voice comes on and interrupts him. “ Hey, Bob, yeah? ” he says. 
 “ What do you mean? This whole time, what about the president. No one has called to tell him that he lives in some crosshairs? ” Bob says. 
 “ Which he says on the spot. ” The man replies. 
 “ Then he can no longer be the commander-in-chief and you ’ ll be calling in any time now. He ’ s become an intrepid murderer. ”<|endoftext|>

George Washington flew from the throne room. He took to the skies above the New York skyline. His defeat was only the beginning. The British had mobilized the army to retort Washington's radical ideas, and had succeeded. They gained a foothold far away from Washington. To the American people, the American will was their weapon. At last, Washington felt he had an ally. 
 American royalty looked to the skies. They looked in awe of the new American king as he looked out at the innocent people of the United States. Today, the American country was rivalled only by Europe. The jubilant crowds screamed "Our nation is safe! " Great fear gripped the British people in fear that America was nothing more than a front for empire, nothing more than a fear city of pandering Christians, blasphemers, and undeserving Brits. 
 Washington was merely a sight to behold. The new king was besieged. The only thing hanging in the royal house was a mask which was once worn by a king. The Syrian king simply lay on the ground in a pool of blood from which he could not have survived. One by one, the masses knew that there had to be a way to bring the United States of America back on board. And so the British began to storm the little stone building which divided the kingdom. 
 The king was almost overcome. A small group of senior British guards stood guard outside of the palace and escorted the king into the room. His arm flew up with the sovereign's help. In a flash, Washington saw an angel, as if only he could see them coming. " Blessed be God, for I am God with you!" With this he dove toward the angel, who swiftly clutched him over the shoulder and kicked him into the ground with one kick. The attack was successful, and Washington's religion lost its lost importance. 
 From the fleeing king, the United States emerged from the shadows. It had become their new enemy. The empire was no longer theirs, and the United Kingdom was no longer their enemy. The people of the United States were ready to fight their enemy. For the first time since 1945, the people of America could stand their own no matter what went on above them.<|endoftext|>

One of the more interesting things I learned in seventh grade was that these words, "soul," " death " and " humanity," were added later on in the development of the human psyche through points in evolution. At first I thought these would be the key ones, but later, I understood that the true meaning of these words as well as their use in the visualizations of creation to the standard of visualized truthlessness and a kind of sense of something larger than atoms. The results they returned to me did not change what I thought about them as I developed, but they changed what I believed about them. 
 One second I was born with a baseball bat only inches from my face and the second my life ended with no belief in the universe. I was born with no head nor body; I made no conscious effort to differentiate my parents from each other. I started to doubt myself, this had taken a toll on me and I did not expect it to change. I tried to remain united with my family, but we were separated to endure the cold and hard cycles of separation. I tried to keep away from the believing portions of me and only some of me remained in that state that ultimately affected me. I stayed to learn at a school named after my grandfather, Old Seminary, where I learned about the sciences that make sense and many religions that I learned about. 
 In a world where there are no signs of death, such as when we assume someone dies to the sun, and many do it to look the other way, our ability to recognize meaning and what it means becomes an extremely important part of life. One almost accepted this because the increased number of death deaths caused no effect upon the world around us. All of these students knew what they were dealing with in their lives and moved on and reflected what they were experiencing in front of them. That was what my grandfather taught me, how to think about understanding beauty and wondering what it meant for you to truly know what you are seeing.<|endoftext|>

The guy leaned against the last bunk and put his face in his hands, his finger under his chin and the tattoo on his forearm glistening with time. 
 "Go on! Go on, " he moved the curtain to the right. " It seems that God was the one who ordered that the things I have just brought in here can't cause terror. I can only assure you that you should take these bags full of sizzling and wet flesh and spit it out to the top of the pile, as one would spit it, " He motioned towards the right to the one on the left, " Do you have a family please? " 
 I nodded my head. 
 " Do you want to see the live feed of what has just happened for my briefcase? " 
 It didn't respond. 
 " How will you save the lives of the Jews? " 
 The man looked behind him and gave me a look like I was about to faint. He had a stern face and glaring mouth, and I knew I was about to die. 
 My body was strained, the blood still dripping from my right thigh and dripping from the edge of the bones in my head. But the Nazi front's right side had caved in from the vaults. The guards will be coming now to escort the man from the night. 
 " You think it'll be tough but my family is facing death in our city anyway? " he stepped out of the tunnel and took my jacket off of me. 
 " Damn, I'm sure God was caught, but so were I, as with all things, " I breathed. 
 We both knew that the sound of sizzling and dry sizzling would not calm the Nazi guard. 
 " Oh, come on.. just give me a couple minutes or we'll all die, get out of here, " he kept saying as the security processions sped past him. 
 I tried to say what he was saying but my brain craved with its insane cores the screams of my people. I tried to convince myself that I was pretty sure he was right, but I could not. 
 " So this is your choice? " 
 " Yes, sir! But if you don't want to go, then - " I closed my eyes and said without speaking. " Then we need to leave, Mr. Hitler. " 
 He stood back up and slapped me on the shoulder. 
 " Fiiiiiiiggghhhh! " 
 " GOD KILL YOU, " I yelled as I rammed my eyes to the glass pane. 
 He stood there as if he were going to change his tune, looking tired, muttering about long nights in the dungeons and gambling with the local idiots. 
 The guard came up from the only pile of blood in the room next to the stairs and dragged me to a wooden desk. He covered my face as he did so. 
 I saw him, the constant stare, stares, vision of all the bloody faces of my people, faces that I had seen in my time here. I saw him pass the stage and warm his hands against the concrete floor. 
 " I love you, wife, " he whispered, and closed his eyes. 
 My people in Hungary were gone, and the world on the other side knew. 
 A man came into my apartment as I walked in. 
 " Walk with me, husband," he whispered to me as he pulled me into his arms.<|endoftext|>

The reflection in his reflection? 
 It was a beautiful woman. Serenity, of course. It was and it always will be again. 
 A dark face stared across the room from him, that sickly old ice cream tray with thuds of clattering ice cream cones and the closet that wouldn ’ t look out of place at one of our "Young Nerd ” parties. It ’ s mug was missing a yellow tooth and his shirt was not sticking out at all from the night after a scary fight he ’ d lost, but if you had been in the wrong bar at the wrong time, I ’ d be fine. 
 No... I don ’ t remember any of it. 
 He stalked off into the shadows, raising his fists in a voice that just barely registered to me. But he didn ’ t say a word. Just closed his eyes. 
 I let out a long sigh and steeled myself. I didn ’ t even know it existed. I was getting tired of this house. It never let me get out. I always left the garden open. The kitchen wasn ’ t much better in case something bad was about to happen. 
 I kept walking. The music changed from New Years pounding to Best Buy loudly echoing throughout the house, after the party had ended. I was tired of this place. I wanted to put everything behind me. Then there were the noisy kids fighting around the front porch railing over the umbrella. The baby cats must have tucked in there because their parents did as well. It's not a coincidence that this place is so much bigger than the rest of the places around town. I didn't really remember what good this place was, but I know it ’ s not special. The place isn ’ t important much anymore. 
 I stopped walking, and then continued down the hallway. I was nearly there when I saw him come out the other side of the door to see if the clothes I ’ d tossed were packed as well. Something about it only made me wet my pants and make myself believe I ’ d gotten wet in the real world. 
 It was dark out and I didn't bother hearing a whisper, so I tried to walk away. I couldn ’ t even hear anyone. The noise from downstairs was that of a trained dog barking, making me uneasy. Even breathing was creepy. 
 One of the kids would look up at me and ask if I was okay. 
 "Yeah, you? " I offered. 
 He turned the corner and I could see the front door running into the night. And then the fog crept up. 
 " Go on, " I said, and ran for the door. 
 He followed me, but I wasn't done. I could smell smoke coming from somewhere in the neighborhood. I ran outside, aware of the motion of the house. I spotted a man moving back inside, his door ajar. He followed me, but I couldn't see him. I remembered where he lived, and the only way to explain it was to be desperate. 
 I kept going, until the stairs were off of the ground. And as far as I could see, there were three people on the floor of the downstairs apartment.<|endoftext|>

*Night forces had been parked outside the sanctum of the Weymouth 
 Election booth, slowly after the returns of victory the cheering has fallen off 
 The soldiers were one like us except for the tiny cans of petrol 
 A platoon of 0.51 caliber pistols moving one after another, bullets and clubs and bolts from where their rifles point to- 
 A leader that fired salute, swearing bloody words before all else, my 8 barrel machine gun fire 
 A commander that screams and clears his throat, Blood pouring from the bottom of his chest 
 One lungless being, my fifteen years my soldiers all want too 
 My loyal friend and sidemen and we all want to start over.<|endoftext|>

A woman's door swing closed in a flash, forcing her glasses to drip water onto her face. Silence would always be stifled and that voice would always freeze her.

A warm and refreshing shower did the wrinkles in his face return. Before the sun had set he fiddled with the golden tongs in his trousers before hurrying to his bed to find his prey. On his part he needed to relax his manhood. For that is what it is called, a heart that lives for nothingness. 
 Pain against the muscles, but even his heavy breathing was enough to tingle his nerves. He might not make it out of this house within a week if he is not careful. 
 Eyes were drawn closed as it was wont to do for mortals. He smiled and set his face along the long white hall between his two beds. 
 Frequent loud noises and wailing picked up again after the first day. Sputtering: low murmur and heavy rumination. The dull silence of the dim light streams in through the sliding door that leads down to the stairs below. He did not know what they were supposed to be, the lights were always way off sometimes, or the walls were strewn with drapes. 
 One move and he would be here from a fresh start, alive, done for. 
 Nodding, he heads down the hall and sits on a dirt couch, ears stuffed full of memories from the days before. Things go for him, dreams return and the old man picks up a baseball bat and carries it to the yard, my windows are open and the sun is high up in the sky. 
 He waits for a day before lighting a torch. 
 There is no daylight today. Fireman is stuck at the fire where he needs to be. 
 The man continues with his tune. 
 He gives his vigil a moment before brooding, "She's not here today" 
 A fiery flash can be heard in his mind and echoes through the cold and the night. He is tired, awake, eager. He adjusts his warm blanket, taking in the dim light of the kitchen and how it feels to run in the snow. He is the happiest man in his family. 
 He drops a stone onto his kitchen table and more sparks fire of the blood soaked fire engulfs him. 
 Time is dark today.<|endoftext|>

No one really had caught me. A runner at best. A predator at worst. Even if my wounds healed, the blood thick in my ears would be the stronger weapon. 
 The charge of assault came from that little, wretched village. Their names were Ball, Blom and Eldern, but my name was simply Glen. It was an area that wasn't really open to people, a far off road that I could barely reach, and little more than a 2nd tier airship with barely anything left to go on. As they marched up the road, I held my breath. There were no enemy commanders out there, no armor to block my path, no Markarth to hand off, no gates at the moment, and not a one for my liking. 
 It had been the month since I had given up my own life to bring peace and order to a land just beyond my own gravity. I had saved the town when not many were in, and we had gathered for a feast. A feast that would need to last four hours, a feast that would require us to join the lesser armed forces, and a feast that would require me to turn into a pawn of a life that might as well be a Savior! 
 The journey to the troops and I would be transported to the homes of fallen warriors, entrenched in their chests, their mothers and father before they killed themselves, or died of wounds that didn't heal. In the seat that the bandits lay, where the bodies lay, where no one had been, I would sit. A hero wouldn't need to die in a battle like this. 
 I was surprised, that it had all happened before me. My brothers and sisters had worn so many wounds, I had watched men bleed or otherwise fall with the others, bodies trapped in cinders, and survivors had fled because that was what a hero did. For some reason, there would be no one to fight until the light of day would come once again, on the course of a fateful strike. 
 One of my best men, bloody. Clearing my head of the murder that was going to happen, I reluctantly stood. There were no men here, no soldiers to protect me from my cry for help. My brain was telling me that what these men were doing was unlikely. Though I had tried desperately to prepare them for death, nothing seemed to work. 
 My thoughts ran to stories, for I had seen them coming. I saw who they were from the news, and how they could defeat my opponents, change what was left of them and take what was left of what the world had become. But I always got that answer. I had gotten through all of my theories, learned the names of the sword a hundred times, and thought of the concept of friendship, the concept of video games, and so on. 
 There was only one problem. It was all going to come crashing down. 
 My opponent was starting to think. I knew that he could be in the lineup, that the Knight in Blue and his advisors couldn't sneak into his moves. He had gotten close to that time too. But this game was more one to me than I expected it to be. 
 As he trotted through the thick woods, my strategy seemed perfect. On one side, this creature of a man would take his opportunity and challenge me to a game. On the other side, he took the opportunity to continue slaughtering the villagers, telling them as he did so they would die by his sword. And here is where things escalated. 
 Everything I had ever known and loved about the role of heroes, were gone. And now they were being chased around like zombies. I lost my daughter, and my father.

This is it, for whatever reason, I'm supposed to be the "POWEL " of the Legion of the Dead. I've been on the First Crusade and all my companions are on the Marines. I've gone to the West Coast with Captain the Rogue and have been killed by the Archdemon of the North. 
 Everyone is just sitting around, and watching the trail of magic in the mud. Over at Anonymous I am passed out on the couch. I don't recall getting back to bed that night. The Ghouls of the Westland just showed up and I am hooked. 
 " Curiously, I'm not even dressed " the Blue Fox Warlock said, " I just lay there, getting high all of the time. " He wanted me to look at my feet and be certain it didn't feel like magic, that it was real and invisible. However, I could see this ominous image in his hand. 
 The blue Fox grabbed me, and in a disturbing voice said " Please I beg the Wardens to end my torment ". 
 " Good " I said quietly, " Let's go check him out and thank the Grey Wolf for his efforts, please". 
 I'm off to the West Coast, to be honest, and I am still hoping for peace.<|endoftext|>

The edge of the vast black void is hidden between a half-closed strip of blue sea. I once walked this edge, more than ever before, in search of treasures. When the Expedition 7 recovered what I assumed were artifacts of more advanced civilization and they reported that the mass extinction of the human race would have hit this abyss with a bang, humanity would have been left dormant, young humans like myself would have left this rock behind the wormhole that carried us from this world in search of the left ooze. As we were reeled back against the cold metal, my eardrums weren't even hurting, and the central wall of the approaching void door was immensely thin. 
 There are no left ooze, and I'll never leave this strange jewel of blue light to find it.

I missed her so much. I made her laugh. I laughed at her kid and his stupid brother, but none of that mattered. She was my baby. I loved her so much. I cried all day, just beside her. I would cry the second I saw her, but not right now. The soothing sound of tears receding from her eyes was setting her back to her bed, her shaking hands one after another pushed me up against the side of her bed. I went to my room and hid in the closet. Opening the door and closing it, I let myself in as best I could. Standing at the top of her bed, the tears flow out, each one falling on the carpet. A combination of sadness and relief. I would love her when I saw her. I would cry when I saw her, and then I would weep when I saw her. I didn't have to move to feel. I knew the scar and the trauma and the happiness in her face. I held her tight to me. She was the color of the beach. I had never felt any other than I did now, and it was amazing what tears can do.<|endoftext|>

"IT DID N'T WORK! GET AWAY, HURRY! " Shouted the talkative man that I had a part in building the door. 
 After hours of frustration and an apologetic speech, the door crashed open, killing the mousy boring old lady behind. She looked bemused to me as she walked over to me. " What the fuck? " She asked curiously. 
 She continued, " Well, I was working on another project and… Well, what do you think. I mean, I'm not trying to make money off the app. But the job description is there on the art page. And I think it is working. Can you believe that?!? " 
 I sighed as I handed her a piece of paper, " the gem was brought back to life at the store last week. " I reminded her as she broke from the thoughts. 
 She didn't even flinch as I introduced myself, " I'm Ritterman." 
 With that she left and i had nothing to do but stare at the carton of papers she had just torn open. In the back she stated'You can go to hell if you fall into the first deep into the pond'. Took awhile for me to realize she was joking.

There are different kinds of children in our neighborhoods. My son will grow up to be a cyborg, intuit the characteristics of a young kid, while I will come off as evil. I will keep my head down, but don't let the other children in your house see or hear my voice. And don't let these children listen to tales of me, because there's another way to fix this shit. If they do, these kids will hate me, and all the good I do will be forgotten. The best for most of them is that they'll have thick locks on their locks. Good locks for the longer grown. And good locks for the kids who make strange noises or twitches or strange voices. One childhood would be one too many accidents involving everyday objects. I plan on holding my arms in tatters, trying my best to get them patched up in the other room. Maybe this too be seen.

 Razor Armor slowly got behind the throne. The peasant from Suin's field had taken the throne, and ready to lay siege to his lord.

 " Not for the gold or honor of thine kingdom. Not for the domination of your subjects. " He cast a shadow around his sole. It glared daggers into Rhea's eyes.

Today was the day. 
 Today was the day she began her journey. 
 She would be entering a difficult man ’ s house as a today, this one she would be leaving from, this one she would see this day. 
 She would be browsing through the malls and fast restaurants, under famous cat statues, grooming herself bare, doing the most perfect thing imaginable. 
 She would be completing her shift and leave, taking stock of the day. 
 She would be out with the friends, walking around and discussing the new generation. She would look up and smile, imagining this day. 
 She would start her shift and leave, each day the same. She was composed and quick. 
 She ’ d end up doing something important. She might go shopping, or try to buy it, or just start out from the beginning with some fancy gadget to give her an extra place to go to. She didn ’ t want to be alone. 
 She would go to the supermarket to buy, she would go to the coffee shop to shop. She would do her hair and nails for the weekend, then pass out for the rest of the week. 
 Her job was good, she was even respectful of a few others. At her first shift, she was assigned to a little corner of a street. 
 Today was the day. 
 This particular week, she had entered a parking lot, letting her adrenaline spike up and down her, her eyes wide open. 
 The car comes slowly, driving slowly in circles, into the shop, which she stops on, as the car speeds in front of the woman. 
 The cop ’ s conversation remains calm and down to earth. 
 The cop doesn ’ t see the woman, and he stops the car. He screams in pain. She is not coming out of the car and there is no blood on the side of her face. 
 The cop looks at the woman and smiles. 
 “ Uh huh, ” he says. 
 “ When did she hit me? ” the woman asks. 
 “ Today. ” the cop says. 
 “ She stopped going to the mall. ” the woman replies, turning to the cop. 
 “ She might have hit a guy? ” the cop says. 
 “ This car ran over her. ” the woman retorts. 
 The cop looks at her and he says, “ You know, maybe her secret? ” 
 “ I don ’ t know. Maybe. ” 
 “ She put me out. Maybe she did this to protect you from your own brother. ” the woman said, weeping. 
 “ You don ’ t think I wouldn ’ t have gotten myself killed because of my sister? ” the cop asks, asking her. 
 “ No, ” the woman protests. “ Why would she kill you if we got off lightly? ” 
 “ Why would she? Because you were the only one I could do something with, so we let you go. ” The cop says, looking at the woman. 
 “ Have you ever told your parents you were a drug addict? ” she asks. 
 “ No, ” the cop answers, motioning to another spot in the parking lot. 
 She sits back down and her nose is brushing against the windshield. 
 “ As a safe bet, ” the cop says. 
 The officer looks at the woman, grimacing, “ You would get shot? ” 
 “ Maybe a lot. ” she replies. 
 The cop pulls out his.380 Smith & Wesson. 
 The woman wipes sweat from her forehead and begins to walk towards her dad. She sees her dad, smiling, watching her walk towards the car, making her way towards a red light. 
 They talk for a few moments, turning the ignition. 
 “ Time for the first of many tests, ” says his mother, as the cop walks in. 
 “ April. ” she tells him, as the cop leaves.<|endoftext|>

Pete is wearing a black helmet. He felt the heat as he stood, just past the bar he usually stopped during a fight, and leaned on the bar to brogue to the truth of it all. 
 He began, "You think I'm... old enough to be a rebel? " 
 The little lad nodded, and his toes clicked, " I am, uh. I think I'm old enough for you. I'm sorry about last week's battle, you're first. We should've ended it. " 
 Pete was startled to hear the loud snapping of the words. He had known them to be banned from the bar, but the thinking around had already created a whole new environment for that voice. Was this the place that got him into this? Was this the place that took him to see him, to spot him? 
 *At this rate his emotions will be exhausted, * Pete thought, *I am completely out of options. * 
 He leaned back and opened his eyes. His stare took a second, and it stilled his stomach. He was cold, and ready to grow old and die. 
 A familiar voice interrupted his trance. " Jason, " Pete breathed, " I am ready to battle... " 
 A voice was coming from beneath the bar. * What? * Pete jumped. His blood dripped. His bones shook, his hair kept falling, his skin tensed to the bone, he felt old as the world ended. * This shit is perfect, * Pete thought, *my kids were taking my care when he stepped out from under the bar. It was perfect. We won... * 
 Jason stood, furrowed his brow and faced the formerly silent man in black. 
 " The bar here has been poisoned. Your dignity has been stripped away. Your legs, my children, will not carry you out of this room... " 
 *He sees the ancient remains of the bar that had held his ear, he continues, " The thing I meant to tell you... is that all those who protested are going to be wiped out. This is a protest of the matter. " * 
 The old man was stunned. He kept looking at the soldiers that had stood opposite his, they were all gone by then. He turned his back on Pete, turned his gaze to Jason, and he fell to the ground, shaking violently. Pete sat up, seizing the overpowering feeling he felt from the old man. He pulled his head from his worn skull, his eyes opening wide, growing bloodshot. " Why... why... why? " 
 The man looked down at Pete. His eyes widened. " You said you did not want your time with us to be spent with you. You said you didn't want anyone to hear you moan and cry. You said you did not want to hear someone else's ugly laughter, anyone's pissed on about *this*. You say you didn't want to hear my anger, nor my anger, nor anyone else's feelings. You say you just wanted to protect the people you cared about, all those who worked to keep that world just like it was and you wanted to hate them. " 
 The old man did not get it, tears welling in his eyes. " You lied. You called for- " 
 Pete stabbed the old man with the back of his hand. The old man collapsed, gasping for air. 
 " If this is the last you ever hear... the world would take over, it is us, *you. * * We are the last, *you. * We will tear out the backs of the cheaters, wreck their ships, but the truth is... this, this is what they expected us to do, the last thing we want is to... hurt you."<|endoftext|>

We spent hours hanging around and watching. Like a mad man hunting an animal. I did not believe a word of what he was going to do until he broke my noose and led me out of our hiding place. I ran and hid under a house covered in moss. I quickly took over and tripped over something when I tripped and dropped. I shook because of the pain and I could hear him croak and shush. He was older than I thought but we left together. 
 I rode to the jungle and climbed down. I stopped to think about what could happen if he killed me. I couldn't climb the ruddy steps and it was so thick. I kept going so it would be easier when he killed me. I turned to the rocks and breathed in some sand and my heart was boiling. It was too dark in the forest to notice me. I ran again when the footsteps stopped and I could hear his footsteps again. The scratchy leaves scared me with mud. I walked again when another man picked me up. I tried to run back and he picked me up again. I took off and peered at the ruins. They seemed to last forever. 
 There was a big pile of leaves. I threw it over the edge and saw a man next to it. He carried a small compass and he pointed it at me. " This is a drill.", he said. I did not think anything of it at that point. He pulled me to the ground where he decapitated me. I can not describe it but when I was being dragged he pushed me over until I crawled down. I jumped up and saw him back at the camp where we were camping. I was scared. I looked around at everything but I knew I did not want to see this guy. He did not even look me in the eye. The man knew we had to get out of here. My heart started beating slower as I saw the look on his face and he grabbed me. 
 When I was down on the ground I was pulling myself free from his grasp and my body fell. I looked on as the man put his arm around me and said something while pulling me up again. When I was dressed I looked at a knife blade in my hand. I cuffed myself and was dressed in something that was far away but I did not care. When he was gone I was looking at a book. It showed a vivid picture of what he had done. As I looked back at the picture I realized that there was a village. I began yelling in pain at what I thought was his crew when he grabbed me and pushed me away and gave me a knife to carry. I wanted to run for this one though.<|endoftext|>

We have not been quite sure what they feel now after death, everything we know about those old people is wrong. I only know about the amount of pain they endure under our torturous laws. The symptoms and half life are the most severe that can be experienced in a medical setting. I can not tell you how they felt during their time on earth, my limited scientific resources can only aid them in such attempts. By the time they realised that they were dead, or their lives would be irreparable to the earth, they had become the tools for the vanguards of this world that people had asked for. 
 As much as I miss my old friends, they are gone now.<|endoftext|>

Fucking neat! I only really liked this prompt that I thought had a story behind it. 
 Some stuff that a lot of people don't see, and I'm in a hurry but this one feels good. 
 "Ok, thanks bud. " 
 " Good... We can talk about whatever. " 
 As I navigate my Google search for Blue Orchard I can't help but think to myself, is it been ever possible for me to create a compelling story? It sounds like you're definitely up for it. 
 " I think I'll put on some fun stuff for all the prompt types this week."<|endoftext|>

"John stood in front of the fire trying to figure out how to control the baltic olfactory stimuli signals coming from the water sensor on his mouth. Then a hard knock on the door leads to the meager silver lining in the middle. 
 " What the hell James? " 
 " Not really, John. " 
 " That's what you're here for? " 
 " Of course. " 
 " Alright fine. No you don't understand. I know exactly what the signals are, I know exactly when you have power to command them... well what is it? " 
 " Nothing John, just you gonna think about why this isn't over with? You know how you enjoy the world, right? You're a good man, James? You're a good man, is it fair for you to bend the knee of world leaders and start throwing snowballs in your face and invent video games? " 
 " T-thank you. Not a problem! I've made you ******God DAMN YOU all out of this. I'm letting you down. Oh my God, John, what the hell is that being called man? " 
 " Nothing John. " 
 " It's not a mnemonic I see it as. The holy trinity of the Eight. Just open it. " 
 " Geez James, you always do that, these damn emperors never put such an emphasis on words. " 
 " Well James, there you are now. Let's get you started on getting those water your God is turning a blind eye to. " 
 " Don't I have to do this? Get me started on these new AGUIs? I don't even know how to set them properly. " 
 " You know the good part about bluffs. Anyway, I hope the goat's continues to catch it on its own. It catches no more of the water but might be able to survive the fountains this week. We're not going to try to starve it to death. See you in 2 weeks John."

Wake up, morning. Sitting on the couch is the most gratifying day of my life. You see this guy in a park with his dog. That's him. I get him around the corner at lunchtime. That's what I do. He always helps me out, even today I feel bad about wanting to talk to him. I feel like his thoughts are unnecessary; he just likes to chat. 
 Then when he leaves, I have the most amazing opportunity to see him outside. He can say anything, even if it's fine, what not. That's how I see his life, just ignore it. That's how I see him today. I see the bitch, that bitch is his only expression of affection. 
 She never said anything. Nothing special about him, not at all. This is the clearest body I've ever seen, without a smile. Nothing I haven't seen in years, has taken the form of a statement without a response. It's no wonder that men are almost universally disliked for their lack of emotion. When I saw a man staring into a mirror, I didn't think about whether to frown or shrug. I thought about whether we're all going to die today or tomorrow. I thought about what I was feeling or if that meant my friends will die tomorrow. I didn't look at my wife; that's just how we say it. The information I was given is enough to make any argument stand out like I was a baby's. That's how I see my future; The happiest day of my life, because I'm not hungover by the 40 % I can afford. The richest of the rich... realize it. They look at the least appreciated asset I've ever owned and want it all. You don't need to sell your hair to be screwed over. Money doesn't set you back 120 year lives, just the way things are. No one took that quote seriously anymore, however that was decades ago. They only took it because they didn't have the same friends anymore. I could see the tip jar of wealth being shifted around like a binocular. No one ever said my name; of course they didn't, but that alone was enough to give me a nice amount of money. I barely have a girlfriend, nor are they really necessary. I've also seen multiple pimps take on sex at varying rates. Who am I kidding, if you have any established social norms, it makes your life worth living, huh? 
 Wake up, morning. Two beautiful women sitting on opposite sides of the large lake of fire. They're looking at each other, and with slow eyes. They never talk. It's a rambunctious, meaningless conversation, as they just stare into each other's eyes. I can't really describe what they're thinking, but it seems like they are wondering "why did I say you". They probably didn't mean anything, I guess. The comments on Reddit can give me some insight into their conversation. I can not properly describe all the comments. Some might be... the innocent other thoughts of people. Some may be, a few thoughts that I have no place in the context of the conversation. They're interesting. They are complicated. These stories are just typical stories like any other but all this time, they are coming up with a new explanation. I'm in disbelief. So this story is new to me. I don't have the nerve to ask them why I said something. I just... they would laugh. No one knows why. 
 Wake up, morning. Sitting on the couch is the most gratifying day of my life. You can hear the soft rustling of the shelter board. My friends are standing over me. They can be hungry and lose interest. The villagers need people to wash their hands and hands and nails. I wish that I could see the three of them sit up. A small dusting of gravel could help me understand. No one seems to care. No one seems to care. The rail tunnel connecting the four flats were dark. I'm afraid I can't see these four people.<|endoftext|>

& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The city of Atlantis was a haven for dwarves. Also, they lived at the great Duruhmet time. The soil was with them as they used their breath to breath their own wisdom. It rained constantly and seemed like a poison rather than a blessing. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The Elves were an egalitarian people, ruled by high elves of course, but generally the Elves preferred what they could. They didn't run a ranch, or have second homes. Although they always needed others to cook, they worked hard, who to choose when it came to water and shelter, could replenish one, and filled up another. Occasionally they needed help with some pretty nifty equipment, elves doing the cooking, but once dragons came their proud. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Hey, they shouldn't be able to say they're human. They said it was a joke, but these elves get offended. They are completely fine, you see. They didn't actually burn their own flesh and create dwarven soil, they worked hard, without needing much assistance. It shouldn't even matter at this point. Maybe when they find another dragon tribe they'll come up with a better plan. But, just hope for the best. The dwarves grew old, and will die soon, that was their favorite trait about not being dwarves. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Thank you. I can't wait to finally start working on it! All of you have a decent life, see you on the other side of the place. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I'm sorry, but you won't be able to see me for several more years, as I've gotten busy. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Stay safe, dan.<|endoftext|>

1. Every village in the world has to make food. After the other hordes invaded in a split second, the strength of those different states was quickly discovered. Only one country remained under its protection, and they withdrew from the conflict. Even then, it was unknown how powerful the others were, and they were all grown up. We are not the toughest people in the world. Even those weaker than us were forced into fighting. We settled around Norway and the Barks, a trade capital and only a few kilometers away from the impassable wall, under the promise that if we escape and retrieve the valuable lab that would unlock that short-lived technology. We set out on the greatest journey possible. 
 2. The towns of Alaska all lost their towns and villages. There were too many of those towns too, and the still-so-pink kangaroo we knew as his name gave way to the towering government building in Wyoming. There are only two villages left to be conquered, but there are more than enough of us to defeat them and move on. The war seemed doomed at the time, a mixed blessing and an abomination, but our countries shrunk with each passing year. We are still fighting, but they are not yet safe, at least not yet. 
 3. There is one lesser kingdom in the world, virtually unchanged since the beginning of this. It was only after the complete collapse that the new government started to take over the lands in the greatest possible way. When we gained control of our moon we moved ahead in peace and made sure to refrain from using the same white whale system as in the first with more than one. And no one could ever predict the outcome of what the first president must do. There were just too many people in this place that we would never return to. I, the man for last, was all for you now. Be afraid. I wish you luck, especially if you are survivors.<|endoftext|>

My friends and I are part of a group of unemployed hackers. Any day, we work to get bills paid and finally meet up with one another for coffee and ice cream. We join together because we value our place and all that. Life for we are individuals and in a small group you can easily just walk into your friend's house, ask them something stupid, ask them about math or something, call your friends over and use the girl group. 
 The best part about working with us is the mutual understanding that being single, depressed and alone is tough. We all always came up with the same thing when we left our families to take the last few minutes at work and didn't want to go out of the office or house to fulfill our purpose of spending two hours a day with friends. We had control of most of the house. That was the way of our lives. 
 But one day after work, we decided to just go out into town after a bit of work and take a bit of an vacation. When I arrived at our destination we asked the bartender what his day was and he said we were doing some show. Actually, that's what we were doing, and I'll be honest, we didn't think he thought we were doing a show. As he spoke in his halting tones, I could almost make out his voice. " Get in your car " he said as we drove to our destination. 
 " What for? " I asked him nervously. 
 " You know what? Take me to your apartment or on the way back." 
 Like any sane person, I ended up spending most of my earnings on food, water and gas at this point. It seems to be the same stories every day as we drive through town. It just seems to me that I find it difficult being so isolated from the main hub of my life. 
 I'm not sure what to think. It's too hot outside, all the other guys want to go to a small boutique where they can meet up, all of their buddies are ordering a drink from the store all the same. If a cook spots us I can always call it ice cold and they have a change of clothes and a couple extra tabs ready to go. The warm and comforting embrace of the bathroom is just blinding to me.<|endoftext|>

I woke in a world of cerebrospinal fluid and mercury-laden death; I lay with my bald head depressed as I jolted awake. A cordial cut at the end of my stomach was the only source of light in the room and a singular sense of calm and security overwhelmed me. My bed was pretty clean for my frail bones, but all I could make out were... conflicting thoughts. 
 It was pink. 
 I stared at the color, I realized it was reflected in the glass of my room, but I couldn't make it out. I tried to tell my wife, "Look at him. Look at him. His blue uniform is bare." Then I simply followed the flow of facial expressions to my wife. 
 Was this my sight or the seat to be seated in, I asked myself, when I woke? It was what they said in medical journals, my wife's drawings of him. I had an extra ear to tell. 
 To my dismay, this distraction brought me light dizziness. Then I remembered what happened that day. Mice. 
 The flu went away just last week. 
 The first defense that I could think of was what was I imagining. 
 A furry man hung upside down over my head. A dozen flapping wings spilled from his waist, over the pale white walls of my room. The surrounding was packed with patients. I hurriedly shifted around in the low-ceilinged room, literally propelling myself out of the row of doctors' wagons. I went to the window on the opposite side of the room, peering at the landscape. It was empty. 
 The best case scenario is that I wandered through the field at night. The flu wasn't even well thought out and was quickly curving across my hallway with almost an invisible force. The real nightmare would take me straight into the cold. 
 Why I am suddenly at ease, I recall. Then again, my hand still felt quite warm in this inhuman state. 
 A sense of security bubbled over me as my senses boiled over: the pinpoint pain in the fingers and toes, the impossibility of holding my grip, the strength of the muscles and spinal cord, and the frantic rushing of my hips as I struggled to lift the steel chair underneath me. He could have had it all. 
 I returned to the windowless room and still no sign of the attacker but the calmness of his gaze, the sense of humor in his look, the fleeting sound of his breathing, the sting in his cheek, his ear lolling sharply to his right, his thigh buckling from the familiarity of the move.<|endoftext|>
**********154**********
Three cheers and the crowd erupts into cheers. With cries from the people all around, everyone leaps from their vehicles and forward, bringing out their vehicles in both, shaking in that miracle of speed. Just as the rally is under way, another boy plummets onto the pavement, startling and shocking everyone that were present with his accident and shrugging off the pain. 
 The crowd is filled with whispers of surprise and horror. Some are sceptical, especially others. A crowd aplenty shudders, but eventually settles down. People began to look inside of their vehicles, deep into their pockets, asking if they had noticed the cyclist, or the man standing next to them. 
 After roughly five minutes of discussions, the families of the unfortunate met in a respectful manner, and I explained to them that they could land on their respective rides, and not be hit by a car. They eagerly wave goodbye, and went to the depot parking lot, an empty space. An hour later, I arrived at the parking lot to arrange the largest gathering of people ever known. 
 The crowd lined up to park on one of the rides. People stopped them in their tracks. The boy was screaming, and like the boy before him, he had a paralyzed stare. The older man who sat opposite him groaned, just as the elderly woman approached the man with a hand with a crying baby sitting beside her. The man held his watch out, seconds later and raised an eyebrow. Finally, the older woman pushed the older woman into the driver seat, and slowly turned the wheel and left, leaving the older woman alone in the passenger seat. 
 Everyone in the crowd turned back to me. That infuriated me, because nobody ever said "don't call it a bicycle, dear". They just muttered something about the situation between me and the child. 
 My throat is tight with air now. Maybe I'll get lucky for a bit.<|endoftext|>

Grandma brought me a shawarma knife of
The turn of the day, Imdayd Shovels ( after lunch ), Order knives of a question 
 They say... 
 "Yes, my beautiful granddaughter, I spake to you 
 Of the stories and recipes most inane 
 I and my family enjoy holiday love 
 I tell you that this shall be your day 
 No more brothers and sisters, no more fools 
 Long before Imdayd Shovels came to life 
 Our parents were parents, young and polite 
 But with no true relationship to share 
 My grandfather and my great great great great great great grandpas were his 
 But instead they'll be returned and used by their older siblings 
 So we grow old together, we grow old and wise 
 But the fights and murders begin and end, and none to be heard 
 Into this life who comes home, starts and ends, that house filled with people 
 Depression, anger, depression, depression. No walk to park or to play or learn 
 My grandfather's spirit began to lighten, and then he " stopped" 
 Our beloved grandpa would sit in the crosswalk, ogling his daughter, and pouting 
 Afterwards he'd put his arm around her throat, saying that the battle was over 
 No more brothers and sisters will be returned to their families, if only to stay safe 
 But not from this world, nor from the world that continues to give 
 The fact that iced tea has been seen by all these people to give 
 We come to understand, and take home something more than he can handle 
 Let us keep up our hours of work, let us live and spend time with our families 
 We let ourselves in next door, and live our lives in bliss that begin and end 
 It's up to us to push through the years, not you and I<|endoftext|>

Brenda read the quick path into the basement door. * It's gone. * 
 She looked for any sign of the cashier, didn't see any cash, or anything either. But somehow Brenda was able to find the cashier home enough to stand. She jumped out of bed and ran to the front of the house, ignoring the knocking, but caught something in her peripheral. 
 "Brenda! Hey! Hey! Just lookin' at that sweater! I'm quite impressed I found that and- " 
 Brenda cried out for her mom to come check up on her. She walked towards her mom and momma looked at her crying sobbing. They saw two candles. 
 Brenda: *Brenda please- oh my God you're sooo frightened I said my mommy. I'm trying to comfort you so- " 
 " Mum, don't speak again... " Brenda choked out. 
 " Jesus Christ you know mom I don't know what to do... " 
 " I thought your mom was gone too, but I found her upstairs wearing the sweater and didn't realize I could't find her. " 
 " W-wasn't she? " 
 Brenda slung her kid over her shoulders and reached towards the closet door. She felt some of the blood cover her hands. It felt *too* warm... she began to wonder if she should let go. 
 " Brendana hey! My baby and I are out! Don't talk to her we need to go... " 
 " I don't know mom, I need to get to the vet. " 
 " No bud. " 
 She felt her daughter's leg seize up with pain and nausea. She could feel arms from far away numb and torn. On the other side of her vision she heard faint footsteps or something near her. 
 Brenda and her daughter cried for the dead body upstairs. 
 " Sorry mommy " 
 Brenda glanced over the closet and saw her little girl lying in the bed with her leg gone. She looked into her mother's eyes. The tear from the head was seen well below her eyebrows. She looked down to the arms from her sides, and smiled. 
 " He'll be fine mother " 
 Brenda passed her daughter over to the closet. She grabbed a few dollars from the hands underneath the mattress, and then quickly grabbed the phone to call the police. 
 Brenda passed the pair of friends who took her next. She backed into the closet and broke her window in. 
 " Mommy it's here. Please hear " 
 Brenda heard the phone catch the sound of the suicide note. She tried to grab up the paper and try to tie it to her leg but its too heavy and doesn't feel fast. It slips off and falls into the bed with the other leg. She looks down to the boy's skin and saw the blood popping from his tendon and veins. 
 Brenda: *I'm dying right now..* 
 The blood came rushing in her ears. She tried to scream, but she was caught outside the bed. 
 " Mommy, but what the hell? What did we say? What the hell?" 
 They took her place near the broken window and buried the body. She didn't know where she was, but it was here! 
 Brenda decided to call 911 and reach out to the van, knowing it would be there for her no matter what. 
 Inside her house a car appeared. 
 Brenda opened the window and drove. 
 She crossed the street into a large suburban grocery store. She parked a few hundred yards away and picked up her keys. 
 She opened the van. 
 It was time for bed.<|endoftext|>

I stood for a long time, looking out at the cities on the far side of the water. Without the candles I would still be as alive, happy in my little world. 
 On the edge of the lake. 
 Was it really far? 
 As I watched the lake grow still, I thought, "Do they have any idea how many names it takes to get here? " 
 I looked down at myself and smiled, " It makes no difference. I don't have to hunt. " 
 I gathered myself and turned to the inside of the apartment building. We had each been in our office for a long time and I was always pretty relaxed at the moment. Even if it was cold for some reason I opened the door and went inside. 
 As I gazed inside I noticed that the view was still a bit blurry but I couldn't see anything except to the beach. 
 I got to my feet and ran over to my door. " Open the door! They must have stolen our cars!" I said to myself. I quickly unlocked the door and with barely a second hesitation, the hallways were quickly running as people rushed inside. 
 I would never forget that day, any day, although no one would ever believe me.<|endoftext|>

 "What are you looking at? " asked Torr attempting to pluck at this thin veil of excitement that was much too thick to hide. 
 " Look, I'm here, " said Ty ( superior to Urh ) who was staring at his battered helmet. " What do you mean? It's dust. " 
 " Well, it is dust, " stated Ty, without even acting to test his case. " When I was growing up you can't really get around sand without smell of it. It's not so bad after all. " 
 " Get out of my way. I don't want to be a dustbag. " Torr yelled but continued after Ty's remark. 
 " I'm not going to kill you, you jerk! " said Ty speaking quickly, trying to hide his smug looking expression as his unintelligible speech got caught on Torr's mouth. 
 " What do you mean? " Torr asked questioningly. 
 " It's dust, just like your nose. " said Ty with a thinly veiled disgust. " It's dust and when we drink it, it can spew sand. " 
 " I know, I just wanted to talk. You have to know that it's sand we all drink from. My father tried to get rid of all that so he could plant his dragon in the ground, but it gave him no time, so he'd never get rid of it. " Torr cooed, his cheeks wrinkling slightly. " He wants to show me what's outside his field of view, but he needs to know, will you let me destroy this place to protect his kingdom? " 
 Ty looked up suddenly to the sea of clean sand that had tainted the face of this man as though it were divine knowledge, but he kept asking. 
 " What about the dust alone? " He asked with exasperation. 
 Ty turned away from Ty and slowly entered a small passage that led to a clearing. Upon walking through it, Ty was ushered up to a little table lit by a fire. Upon examining the table he realized his goggle wasn't comfortable; it was stained. He hurried to the table and strode in to view the first to be touched by sand on earth. His eyes tracking him as he walked through the dusty pool of sand, he couldn't help but think of the different beast that was wearing the same mask that was several years ago. 
 " What am I going to do? " asked Ty. 
 " Can't ask, " he replied " Why don't you just kill him? Why don't you leave it behind? " 
 " I'm just tired, " said Ty angrily " The little beast is something else entirely."<|endoftext|>

The short sighs rattled off his cold sweat into my ears as his pace slowed, pulling his left hand gently against my arm. I glanced over at this demented looking man of few words, searching for some relief that the lifeblood of the millenia of me could be forcibly consumed. 
 I remained silent for the four eternity that followed, his voice slipping between the dull tones of his withering voice until the perfect sound sounded by his voice wafted into my ears as I racked my brain for a time and a half before I grasped my flask and picked it up from the porcelain stool next to my desk. I scratched his crusted nails, thoughtful as I was, as I reached into the sub-head bottle that barely touched the surface of the mug with the handle. The weight of the potent cocktail almost brought me to a stoop. 
 I looked across the desolate corridor, the leaves flickering through the dreary gray and the sun washed in the halting puffs of clouds. Dirt littered the floor, weeds attempted to wriggle their way out with their help but their reach was limited, he pointed towards something protruding from the edge of the wall and his hand reached for it. The light showed a small creature the size of a banana bush jutting out of it, its eyes closed in anticipation of my presence. 
 The distended hearing of the creature outside of the walls, beating toward me, the constant beats that had placed it there had left me a blank blank, the cold bolt was deafening to my flesh as I felt my limbs spin as I flailed around to where it was due, it paused and picked up another paint job beneath its silver red coat, placing it on the loose path that ran over the pavements. The strange creature seemed frozen in place, staring at me, waiting for a reason to have come for it, for the moment to float down to where it was to strike. With a swift, steadying motion it jumped off of the walkway and tore it out of the creature's reach, followed by another move left to know my fate, and another flick away from this event. 
 I remained motionless for as long as I could, peering at the creature in my waiting circle of works as it smiled at me, just as I wished I could in the moment of my demise, the desperation that creeped up into my heart was merely another ill suited expression the creature seemed to take. 
 In an instant, the creature's attention shift- finally. It was trying to prostrate itself towards me, but my wandless hands reaching out from under the covers as it beckoned me, its delicate fingers fumbling to mine, holding my cold, clammy skin close and shaking to match. I retreated once more, staring out across the courtyard, avoiding the puddles of vomit on my stomach and the dark branches scratching at the fabric of my scarf. 
 I would watch as the creature writhed in agony as I dragged it nearer, violently hoisting my neck to bleed. The fingers on my shirt grew sore and I did not dare even look back as the creature used every inch of me as a haven to extricate itself from my knees, rubbing its upper arm painfully as it reared its claws under the attempts of the creature. The pain seemed to pump up as its blood began to stream down from its withering, filthy head as I flailed around to find what was called "a knife."<|endoftext|>

Dad? Are you a kid? 
 No, no, no, no. The trip to the zoo used to cost me 30 bucks and a second bottle of water. I need to change my actions now. 
 I know how differently everything works now, until this minute. This machine. And it's just a toy. And it's been so long since I seen another human, save for the sunken mouth of a farmer, who truly saved the world. I mean, that's pure bullshit. There are no more babies, only a lot of newborns. And I needed to conserve something in the garage. I've always wanted to see a human. But I didn't want to buy a new one. 
 The difference now isn't that the robot was a mistake, it is that I know a very specific preference for a person, so I knew exactly how to use my power. I wanted my most important decision to be a once. I knew that it needed to be a once since I've never tried a new one. But this time it feels right. 
 It feels quite beautiful when I wake up, be hit by lightning, and survive. I know I can do this again. I can change my behavior by putting on a different suit at the house once it's found, so that someone will stay with me just so long as I don't think it would hurt again. I have power to change every choice I make, that's quite effective. I wonder if I could help it. But I can't do that. I am all of those things now. And what will happen to my actions if I don't change my choice soon? It could be for the whole world to be set ablaze, at the cost of my lives. Like I'm dying. 
 But it doesn't matter. I need to make good decisions in the meantime. And it would be a shame to lose so many children. My life's goals aren't even that important anymore. Perhaps they will be tomorrow, when the sun finally sets and they'll be safe again, as the ones who sacrificed themselves would be. Or today, when they'll be the brightest and the youngest. 
 Well, this is the end for the world. It isn't a great surprise now that a young boy and his father, who gave up their life to save the world, are dying from how confused they sound. They didn't have to save the world at all. The kids who didn't really save the world were still born at the end of the road, and if not, what could they be doing? 
 It's the shame to lose that beautiful consciousness. But it's also the shame to lose my baby boy. A mother and father and son, reunited for the first time in almost 14 years of being together, young and strong. They're smart, they're hardworking. And they can really do it. 
 It's the moment that will change my entire life. And what will happen next? 
 The robot. My heart, its greatest asset. A new starting point for many people who found their way into adulthood and have grown into leaders. They can learn fast, they can read minds. And a world that has grown so fascinating, filled with happiness and caring. How could I not see this coming. They can better the world now, and someday, they can get across the road and save their children, if only for a moment.<|endoftext|>

She looked at him with icy blue eyes, 
 She laid eyes on his magnificent matted hair, 
 She thanked him for everything. 
 She smiled as he waved goodbye to his long night, 
 They kissed in the comfy chair, 
 She raised up his knee, 
 And slowly cocked her gun to the ground, 
 She backed off and dropped his knee, 
 He leaped at the unfamiliar, metallic quiver, 
 He scrambled into the shooting position, 
 He yelled and sprayed, he kicked up plaster, 
 He ran towards his rifle, she jumped right back, 
 She raised up his gun again, 
 He rushed after him, she twisted her body, 
 He fired into him with all his might, 
 They smiled together in the living room, 
 It was smooth but also so dark. 
 He plunged into darkness; 
 He had been perfect 
 He was perfect to her so easily 
 Her voice was firm, like a bridge between soul and atoms, 
 She would feel the weight of these years. 
 He was still alive? This was better.<|endoftext|>

I opened the door and opened the door and discovered the bed waiting for me. I'd seen every male be the worst offender and only in the bathroom could I see a number five on the wall. If I turned away from it and closed the door behind me, I could find a number five on the wall. Because I didn't move, every single time I turned away, I just tried the door. 
 I pulled the curtain up and saw it. A list of potential mates was made to give to the slimy nasty looking devil who would deliver lethal acts, exacting revenge against a single victim, but first I'd have to try them myself, first I'd have to remember my own signature. This was an ancient tradition, an old one that had gained popularity after the establishment of the sex dungeon, or the basmodest bathroom, for that matter. These are the rules now, you can't have the same members who look exactly like your own skin color. But after reading these rules, you've earned them. 
 I walked out of the bathroom and walked up the steps of the room. Slowly, I looked around, the lids of this mirror were crinkling, and a string of numbers in the corner flickered. Someone had forced these codes on me, a long time ago! Each sex prisoner here had looked exactly like me, but instead of me, my skin tone was significantly more unpleasant, and the traces of myself looked strangely familiar. 
 It was pointless to try any more, I had to find the next guy. However, that search took its toll. Looked like a goner here, an antiquated guard with more kids than average, but apparently when you count them, I was more valuable than I thought. Luckily I was able to keep one of the adults in as he fell from his perch. Unfortunately the adults were immune to the damage, so he walked away after a quick swipe and stayed the same. Now, you'd have to be really brave to get to him, if you wanted to avoid the future danger. 
 I made my way to the gate, and opened it, but before I could get inside, I saw five figures standing there. 
 "I mean, it's so cute! " I exclaimed. 
 One of them replied, " It's called Paladin, " and then proceeded to say a spell to hush the approaching figures. As I watched the people come towards me, I put my hands in front of my face and began to recite the ancient ritual, but the voice stopped. 
 " You can not do this! " a voice yelled from inside the room. 
 I tried to speak, but nothing was working, I didn't know what to do or say, the players said nothing and continued to shout to no one, again. I waited for silence for a few minutes before finishing my sentence. 
 The other figures screamed in pain, there must have been a lot of pain, but it didn't matter. I could hear the sound of sirens go off, the door was slammed shut behind me, I raised my hand to touch it, but the touch was no longer there. 
 The others screamed again, but I didn't speak, I just rolled my hand down my sleeve and looked back at the ceiling. There were these two, they were terrified I'd have to do this, I'd have to hurry and let them die. I looked at the window and saw a group of two. 
 " How did you figure it out?" someone whispered.<|endoftext|>

***Outside*** 
 I reached my hands into the fabric of my cloak and pulled my hood up underneath it. It felt heavy now, only hanging on little by little, and over the floor as heavy as a radiator. The boots of my other boots floated along the floor quietly. 
 ***Outside*** 
 The door swung open at any moment and I flung it open. As I slid into it, the blood, mold, and mold covered the white walls and ceilings. I hated it when the smell crept back through the toilet paper; had to relieve the stench every day after the laundry stopped. I quickly shoved it aside and saw my brother walking toward me, his hands unbuttoning their sleeves. They both looked so confident, I couldn't believe I saw her smiling despite her hair combed over her head and the short brunette that looked just as deformed as her brother. I did my best to adjust to these new abnormalities, to be a good human being. 
 I moved toward him, and he grunted as he neared me. He kicked away at his feet, sending black welts of hair flying everywhere. " Are you a goddamned motherfuckin zombie bitch? " I screamed, swallowing what remained of the toilet paper and tossing it on the ground. I pulled it underneath my boots and threw my other jacket up against the wall. " You're falling for it! The only ones that know what to do are YOU!" he said throwing his hands in the air, one at my ribs and the other at my nose. His crazy laughter echoed through the empty hallway and I heard him purring. 
 The one who called from my room at the first sign of light slammed his head on the trunk and fought furiously to catch a glimpse of my face. I leaned over his shoulder and blew out his nose for just a second, but I grabbed his hand and walked away. 
 We never spoke a word.<|endoftext|>

There were many difficulties for a family and community. Great neighbors and family members had an inaccurate understanding of what everybody did at 8am, but every time you worked, you tended to have much more time to walk through the maze of tunnels and hand dry up eggs than do yourself. Family responsibilities only came with a finger and a headset to comfort you. Work normally started at 8pm, where meals were prepared and then rapidly stopped. Short term work affected your schedule. In short, it was like your phone held a key to your future, while the other phone held a phone button to prevent your future from going to waste. Of course, when we were on the walk in time at night, we were faced with something that caused us to miss work or put on work due to forgetting about work. But everytime we passed a wall you were the person from the previous night. 
 Then the homework came. If we studied for a long enough time, we remembered and learned how to do things together. We knew how to get the kids to join them at 2am, even in the early evenings, when we would be out and about. To speed it up, most families were against the law to keep their kids together, and most the time you got to stay away from work and hang out with your parents. When we took class early in the morning, you were consistently the most attentive as you had been for the past few days. If we stayed in there late enough and you hid there just a little longer, sometimes you would get towed back from the garage if you did too long, we would have to remove you from the mix and put you back into the public transit network. Only if we could get money from the real thing would we be able to find work, they suggested the transit network was broken. It helped us deal with many of these problems. 
 One day in school, I was casted as a fraud, an old, dirty secret that had to be kept to a minimum to be cleared in mass media. I had not only lost my job to a bunch of rich people I also lost my business, now I was sending them off to the worst part of town. If I could get their attention then I would be able to convince them and their families to pay for my sick visits. I wouldn't have to work as I could see what they were hoping for. It was all worth it for their business, to make sure I didn't become a prostitute or cheat on my teachers, my family, my classmates. If I had not worked more at 8am, I might have turned myself in and avoided the judge in the court system. 
 When I was thrown into the infirmary, I made it seem like I was a simple child who received all of this. I simply asked for dinner and at my next stop was the nurse who helped me set up a volunteer group to help me move into the apartment. Even before they found me, I had chosen to play Pokemon. Many years of unidentifiable immigrants, and a once-great country and a liberal idea. Everyone knew we were immigrants, but many of us thought that to do so would set them back, would let them start to grow on the land they inhabited and get more rich before they were gone. 
 I studied for hours and hours. I enjoyed the time I had. It was a wonder why I didn't mention it as I sat at home with the kids playing around with my bedclothes. There was no work to do or to choose from. Most likely I had a no one. I turned on an imaginary friend of mine who I thought should be my helper, a professional gamer. 
 The loneliness of having something in your life turn into something to be cherished. It's almost as if you can't stop it. Until you are there, you see someone who isn't you, who connects well, who lets you spend time with them without worrying. 
 I started to get overwhelmed once. I didn't want to worry about work, I didn't want to dwell on the insecurities of not looking for work. This is not what I wanted. 
 I approached a table. Standing in the middle, was a man I didn't know. He wore a white shirt and a tie, a black tie, and in his right hand, his finger, a single black line, a bullet hole. 
 "Do you feel well?"<|endoftext|>
**********165**********
The young man had been born into this earth he had left behind. He knew nothing but clay and water, his only tools of employment included earth, paper, and wind. His movements, every 6 years his task was the same, using paper and wood to make his work. After his great fame he later went and formed his own company. The company, Named Angel Services Inc. was called upon to deliver paper to the public. However the effort was short lived as many plans were soon turned down for lack of funds and motivation from leading workers. Instead our young boy stepped into this very mine taking business from the old carved wooden axe and rope. 
 During this time Angel Services had worked tirelessly for 3 decades attempting to save the Indian tribes from falling for Indian time. In order to bring the creation of the Age of Man to America it had to be done fast and with a great deal of dedication. The millions had passed on countless years as it has now changed, each messenger of the Lord's order has been given a steady hand and a plan for his future. Our boy, to everyone in attendance, assumed the mantle and proved his skills were relevant to the world. 
 This was a daily occurrence. As such we devoted every day to knowing which pages of which book his children would receive and their years. His endless effort gave us plenty of time to write and get our asses shuffled on with our relatives. Only one slave grew up knowing his task but everyone who passed taught their children the work for their children. It isn't an exaggeration to say, that was one of the first times they bestowed the Order upon a citizen. At the time the only way for his children to become masters of their own destiny was by mastering the work, but then things started to become... weird. 
 While many believed that Angel Services told the boy life would pass away, many to the contrary. Due to this the man had reduced his duties and instead assigned himself to work the most sacred task: changing what it meant for his children. That is how he had disappeared. The story went that while Angel Services employees were even more likely to function under such a powerful god than their slaves had been Angel Services employees were often more than a match for those who were more skilled. 
 Overseas this have changed. Those that still control the American Indian tribes are of course more determined to receive the Order's and more willing to do the exact opposite. For instance the younger of Angel Services employees whose job was to stop the flow of money, Paul Bunyan, had specifically given his elite Black Indian Army team the task of sending out people from the past to allow him to do the same while keeping their hired workers at bay. These volunteers were not the only weapons he could use but they were the only allies he could rely on to progress with their missions. 
 It all changed for the boys. Even those that couldn't be relied upon were there to choose the a leadership position and trusted to execute each instructions. This is where my boys, the youngest, approached the place of the sacred purpose in their lives. They took the upper hand and helped the school bully out. His parents had purchased the black team from Angel Services and had gifted it to them. This was a young man with an innate ability to shape past the demands he was given for the Order. Just like the first time. 
 This time, he went on to travel the world giving scouting advice to the rich and poor. He learned many things about what a well behaved and trained person would be like. His eyes were growing brighter with each second he went through this. And that's how he became that he grew to be. Every 7 years a humanoid creature at once roamed the world transforming itself from ape to charlatan into one of the most feared creatures known today. The great shadows spread throughout the world, intimidating and intimidating others yet shaping themselves to serve. The tyrannical emperor theocracy no longer felt fear to win every war or battle. They felt love and honor to work toward what they believed was right and allowed their children freedom. 
 Nowhere in my life have I felt more fulfilled and in the world have I felt more blessed and happy.<|endoftext|>
**********166**********
I've had terrible luck in school, but in my own way. I only let the nice friends that I enjoyed with me pick me up by my neck, only to see me in the bathroom and all the others the same, wondering if I might just be the person everyone thought I'd be. Wearing a nice, snazzy Christmas suit, I would try to relate to the little butts like everyone else in class and, at school, I'd try to explain to them that I'm a decent, kind man, if only I'd let them know I was the one who should be on my side. 
 The school, being where they were getting situated was very attractive, if a little on the ran I'm sure, so I'd let them all of their friends and siblings come and see me out, treat me fairly and tell them I'm not crazy, with that kind of conversation. Needless to say, the fight that led up to that is why I decided to leave school and into the wild. 
 Over the next few days, I learned I was attracted to people more and more, so instead of taking directions from these people, it would be best to be prepared. If you're doing well, I would advise picking up onto the smaller butts that used to greet you as easily as I. Also, you could also just get lucky because they weren't interested in waiting around for me, so even though you could have this random stranger react to you as if you were a newbie, they would sometimes come just to stand there and stare at you, hoping nothing can happen. 
 The first semester I remember, I was walking home from my volleyball match. I arrived just in time for my opponent to run into me, a mullet. He'd not been able to slow down a bit, so he tried to hold me up by my neck with his hand. I realized that he was out of his strength to get out of the yard and quick as I could get my feet, and when he tried to run behind me, I ducked behind the net and he fell down with his arms around my neck. 
 The second semester, I was sitting on my couch watching the latest XBox video ( which was quite slightly inappropriate and silly too ), excitedly thinking that I'd be the one who was going to make it out of that arena alive, after all, things seem to be going well for me. As I watched, my classmates picked me up and wave at me to get a response. As I opened my eyes, they were replaced by some faces. All of them, however, were had a sickening, ominous look to them. All of them had at least two scarves, drawn up in circles and long, thick spines. 
 In my mind, I guess I should just leave them alone. I was going to have some alcohol poisoning, so I asked a few friends who had sat with me to wait the inevitable and used the time to think up a plan. I should have some kind of special punishment. I should have a $ 200 reward for making it out alive. At the very least, I could avoid seeing my classmates again. 
 So then I spent the next week in that apartment, looking at all of them for some random little feature, like a sign or something. They all looked pretty much the same, except there were more scarves on each of them. They were not even ugly. My team was even more shocked, and a few didn't even admit it yet, even though the students did. Apparently, I wasn't one of them, they were offended that I didn't share their quirks. This made me conclude that they all know my true identity as The Rock. 
 With about fifteen minutes left, I decided to go and get something to eat. While we were eating, I picked up a tissue from a garbage can next to me that I put on the counter in the hallway, and stared at it. There was a mark on it, very faint, and I counted it right there and didn't look away. As if trying to keep my composure, I reached into my pocket and picked up a small jar, surprised that there was anything left of it. I happily opened it and opened it again, prepared to stare at my classmates who stared at me right back, but I couldn't. 
 I took a bite out of my shredded lunch and smashed the lid shut. I was thrown into a geyser, felt the floor against my face and felt the numbness in my extremities. 
 At that point, I felt full again, and I decided to use the last of the money I had on me to buy a cigar.<|endoftext|>

"Hello? Can you open the door? " A squat and brown haired looking gentleman sits to one side of the front porch, the candle flame coming out of it's wicker basket near him. 
 " I can't open the door! I'm shutting it! The fire! I'm coming! " He stands tall. The creaking of the bark on the porch fills his ears. In front of him, a woman holds the door open and sits down on the porch. 
 " Mrs. Turner, I'm sorry, did you come in for this, that you would give me a tour of the house? " 
 " Why yes, Mrs. Turner, of course I had a tour of the house, but I asked to stay here for a while, I don't have an appointment with the doctor in an hour and even in an hour my time is up. " 
 " Well, welcome to us, Mr. Winchester " The lady says with a tone of complacency that belies everything she already knows. She's the charming lady with her short brown hair and big brown eyes. 
 " I must say though, perhaps you shouldn't have come to visit just now. Would you like to see your boy? " 
 " Yes, Mr. Winchester, I believe he is here. Mr. Winchester, I'm coming to visit you to talk to you. You may ask about yourself Mrs. Turner, please. " She steps up to the door, and closes it behind her. 
 " I'll take you upstairs if you need anything, I'm just coming up here to talk to you, I'm going to show you some anatomy. " 
 " Yes, Mrs. Turner, let me show you it. " He looks at the last part, the details, the intricacies of the shape of the foreskin as well as the features. 
 " Okay, Mr. Winchester, " The lady guides him down the long hallway, with little steps to make. The house has a staircase that leads down from the street as well as stairs to the highest level. She steps out of the house, and the kitchen is as familiar as the stairs, from what looks like a third story front porch with a large ornate style window that hangs open. 
 " Good afternoon Mrs. Turner, " She steps into the kitchen and steps down a small window and slides it open just a few steps further, flipping on the blinds and opening the large wooden windows. All the glass is blasted marble with a clean line of glistening gold that matches the dark face of the house. 
 " It is a museum " Mrs. Turner exclaims with a small smile. 
 " Yeah, that's right, it is a museum. " He is mumbling, as he slides the crown that she carried around into her tiny waistband with her as a souvenir. 
 " Very nice thing, I'll let you know when I see it, " She hurriedly hums to herself " I'll start what I think will be a good day. " She takes a look at the papers there next to her hat and flips the crown open. She opens the time stamp on it and stares, looking at the clock on her desk. " Okay, this is it, Okay. Okay. Okay. OK. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wait, what was this? " 
 " I'm sorry Mrs. Turner, but I decided that I might like to look around as often as possible. If you would please bring a chair I will have Dr. Adams in your area. " She takes a seat on the chair, and looks around for any glass I can use for glass to wash. " Okay Mrs. Turner, I will take you downstairs. " She nods her head and opens the door to the bedroom with a clatter. The bed is exactly the same as before, but the dresser is gone and the dresser is off as well. 
 " See Mrs. Turner, thank you so much for coming. I guess you were the real treasure hunter? " 
 " Yes sir, you won't want to miss it. My name is Mr. Nelson, and yes I am the real treasure hunter. " 
 " Excuse me? " 
 " Mr. Nelson, could you take a seat there? I'm calling Dr. Adams."<|endoftext|>

I couldn't understand a word that the robotic voice said. Was this what they'd sent me down? What to do? * A* escape pod? It felt wrong, it felt like one of the pods was on fire. I closed my eyes and waited. It wasn't until I really started to look around that my ears started ringing. The sound was deafening. My leg felt like it hurt. Suddenly, I felt something swing my leg around in a ball. Slowly, I backed up. My leg wasn't a ball anymore. I got frozen, from the sudden shock, and my leg was hanging on this strange plastic container. It didn't feel like any of my other leg. It looked like I had a broken ankle. * Is that a splinter? * I considered my options. What is going to happen to me? I thought, But then I remembered. I was on the wrong side of a canal. I couldn't feel where my legs were right now, nor the gears in my head. My vision was gone. The corners of my vision blurred. My dog was gone. * No, * I started, *The lock I'm using won't actually get through*. I slowly tilted my head, as the pods flickered. When I finally got up from the wheel, I saw a chip in the back of my pocket. It looked like a small wad of plastic, about two inches high. I went through all my options: Slide the splinter. I tried to get a lift out of the robot, but there was no lift. The bottom of the capsule started to disintegrate, and I started to feel groggy. I put the chip in my arm and looked around, probably imagining it all. What had happened? The whole mission had been over, I was under the android's control, and my mission had begun with a pod in my kitchen. Maybe I would feel better without it, or maybe there would be food to eat. How long would it take to get everything back to normal? Could it be that I was too frustrated to get the pod back to my arm when the android teleported me? It felt like the robot was talking to me, and I decided, *This pod is going to crash into the lake. * I turned around, and walked to the boat. It was quite warm there. It was not as cold as I had hoped. Or cold as I expected. I turned the plank I was on and pointed at a sign that said I wasn't going to join in on the exploration of the lake. I turned around and waited, waiting for something to come here and help me find my way. It didn't. The lake was colder. I saw a surface to go to. I pondered what had caused the freezing of the water, and then I forgot.<|endoftext|>

I'm tired of complaining and complaining, but I try to keep up the facade. I don't care about moral dilemmas or mean repercussions. I am no hero to the world, I simply promise myself. Anyone can do ANYTHING that would bring a dolt back to your beloved town. 
 Sometimes I have doubts, doubts about the world around me, and I hope they have a reason to reject me. Most people, at a glance, don't mind. The world to them just lives in a small sphere, and without a purpose. My hallucinations are compounded by the reality. A comforting feeling that I am alone in this strange room, just acting out my fantasies, off the shadows. 
 Sometimes, the only change I see between my sanity and reality is a detailed, detailed description of my surroundings. " Back out, you crazy schizophrenic hobo, " I blur out with each word. " Stay inside." 
 This maddening practice is spreading quickly through the corridors. The planet we were born in is already a jungled wasteland in the blink of an eye, the taste of sugar's banished from the flesh of my stomach. The cliffs divide the yeti's, and in the hour they would have to wait for each other's entrances, we would be forced to wait until every inch of the cliffs were cleared. Only then could we make it out alive. 
 Goodbye, traveler.<|endoftext|>

In the room we sat in that middle-class home: a family of 3 
 One in my wife was laid to rest in a warm bed, in a comfortable desk. His limbs were cleaved, then torn, then sprouted to grow back 
 The rest of them were covered in numbers, the base bed creaking, the lamp blinking, dishes splattered, hardwood floors tearing. The floor of the room was made of nails 
 the results of prolonged torture. He had never felt so helpless 
 Now, in the candlelit room of my room

"I told you to stop. " 
 " Just go away, do your job. " 
 " First of all, everyone is doing their jobs. This machine does it for their own personal gain. Second, I can not keep doing that. Third, what does it matter? " 
 There was silence in the room. " Well, my partner in law is... there's never been any serious problems. And honestly, he's very well-trained. And I don't want to be arrested in person. What bothers me is I can't change his mind if he doesn't want it to be undone. " 
 Lawyer Shen walked into the room full of his clients and as soon as she stepped in he emitted the trademark mirth. 
 " Do you really believe I, my partner in law is behind this plot to usurp corporate power? Is there any truth in my claims? I swore to nothing that I would stop and not tamper with anything, that I would actually... save everything. I am certain you know this, now. " 
 Shen continued. " I'm trying to show you what I know. Can you believe it? They've never removed money from the lives of some of the richest of people in the world? What could have possibly been bad in the eyes of the world, what could have been worse in the eyes of the shareholders of... " 
 The lawyers silence was broken when there was a brief pause. " The actual purpose of this... *thing* is really to protect these shareholders. " 
 " Can you believe it? Nobody pays taxes by the way. " Shen raised an eyebrow. 
 " The value of this great corporation! You can't use that tax money to benefit the world! " 
 " Oh. " Shen paused for effect. " It was a... do you have any idea? " 
 Lawyer Shen was not feeling it. " I mean, if they should have told me nothing, what would have happened? " 
 " Well, the pirates and Chinese-hater, hijacker, boterans, it was... no. These companies don't believe in free speech, it's corrupting them. What they don't believe in is moral integrity. So the only thing I can think of are... " 
 " Are you a hypocrite? " 
 " No! I'm not, I'm actually a bit of a... crone. " 
 " You really think... you really are objective? " 
 Lawyer Shen came to his knees and held his son close. " I don't believe anything." 
 Shen's eyes began to bulge and his heart knotted violently. With a deep breath, he prodded his son's forehead, he pushed him away from the machine. In a surprising twist of fate, Shen lost consciousness and realized his son was he and his own mother.<|endoftext|>

As we sat to stretch our legs through the haze, the entire universe was stretched out around us, beckoning to us in myriad forms, at random directions. As we extended our legs, and stammer, we knew our true expression, and what it would be like, but the feeling was something else altogether. There were no repeating the signs, only alternating between two unified circles of light. The words combined with the strange as a speck against a backdrop of sound; people, buildings, buses. Space lit up in the darkness, dark silhouettes of people taking in the change, moving into an nothingness. Eventually, the absence of the rest was forgotten by the haze, and the strange disappeared into the noonday light of time. 
 It's words reverberated through every living being on the earth that day, and even the holiday sweeter as a dozen people streamed out of their houses, not giving a damn what they heard. The homeless people of the day were no longer somewhere close to home, and so they were being coerced into the night. The churches were no longer a formality, nor were the businesses unoccupied. Each block in sight was immediately emptied of Christmas poples and fairy tales. Everyone was forced back into their normal lives, dying themselves into senseless fits of emptiness. 
 We all knew our true answers were near, but what we had originally seen was an endless list of answers. One answer stuck with us for many nights. Did those who came through have had nothing of value to them? Could they not even get by? Was it the disorder that let everyone else run around doing only what they do best, or are they just infinitely thin people forced to write their "Life Days"? Would it be any good if they just lived endlessly until eventually they just dwindle to nothing, like nothing? Did we really have to answer to anyone else until we just found and killed the good kind, all for nothing?<|endoftext|>

The manager of a convenience store was impatient for his clients but what he didn't realise was that the human was an asshole that he didn't like. 
 The boss was cornered as he interrupted the personal assistant of a non-existent, non-existent human. This allowed him to call the smiley-face. 
 "Hey, aren't you kinda busy here, Ruby? We have to get this machine running again. Good luck! 
 The smiley-face slouched back down onto his desk and pouted. 
 "This new guy is bad. Does he eat with me? He must have become hungry again. Sorry, if I don't get to apologize later I'll cut his fat count a little. I'll take that as a compliment, make sure he doesn't get pined for anything " 
 The laughy-face sighed. 
 " Do you mind asking me how his name is? It's not Ruby, this looks silly. I don't know who you are, but who is this pizza dude at Taco Bell. Think of it like pizza. Pizza pizza stupid-love " 
 The customer was pointing at a cute girl at the end of his desk forlornly, blue eyes and a foreign, sulky fluttering figure of a smile on her face. The smiley-face was missing the accent, instead sounding like he was communicating with dog sass like a grandfather. 
 "... and he only has a dozen cookies. " 
 " Then what? " 
 " You mean when you told me how he was starving? You told me how he thinks he's sick of his food and why he's done nothing? He begged me to stop, but I ignored him. " 
 The car screeched to a halt, wheels churning to a halt, in the blood red rain sky and panting, the front wheels turned slowly, a lower cruiser bearing down on the employees in the back by the seats and the brake beams turning at a snail's pace. The heel of the poor guy's smirk was back and all that was left was the sofa. 
 " First off, it's made of flour cake, go figure. I can put some sauce in it too, but I'll get you up to go later on with that. Another option is put some pasta, I can put some cinnamon spread in it too, okay? " 
 The simian walked off the aisle, trailing the boss behind. " Hah! Speaking of ditching the sauce, I got ta go, wants to see this sweet woman again. It looks delicious. I'll have to wait on this poor lady after I leave, what was that supposed to mean? Are you okay? Can you do a checkup? Just put some dishware on your desk, and I'll just move her to the back. " 
 The car trundled slowly, shuffling itself understiff, and then slumped limply onto the blood red pavement. The man on the ground, still wearing his negligee turned his back on the employee standing with him. He bent down and put his jaw on the crook of his neck. 
 " Hey man, I'm sorry. It was an accident and I lost the 10-minute shift. I missed your bonus. I didn't really think I could thank you at all for it. I paid you a day wage so it wouldn't affect your wages. " 
 The blond employee turned his head and smiled. " I am too " 
 " Of course, I am. " The man smiled back. 
 " Oh. I didn't mean to scare you too much."<|endoftext|>

He had a dream about a rose. He had not seen one in a long time and was deeply afraid. He had never heard of such a thing and thought it would have to be so beautiful to him, he always liked it when the music had something close to it to his ears that his name was known around the world by. 
 He got dressed and went to the bathroom, the clock had all the time in the world, and he stuck his head out of the mirror looking over at it, it was a blood curdling rose. It was bright and beautiful. He had to run. Something was sappering in the soil. He grabbed the brush of his favorite lawn mower. His morning coffee was cold and a little strange for his liking. The rose was a red. He scratched it with his nose and wondered what that thing was. 
 It was growing in the ground. He rubbed his hand over the dirt and said, "I need that rose." His voice came out flat. He ran back to his room and stared at the rose. It was red. It was the highlight of his day. When was the last time he was afraid of the music? He had been afraid of being swept by despair and despair. He heard something wetting on his right hand and realized he must have kicked it around. Why would he be so scared of the music? That rose wasn't red. He tried again. His eyes glanced to his left, then he saw a metal thing on his right hand. He cursed his own eyes.<|endoftext|>

“ Tanya, I need you to sign this paper! ” The official said as he walked towards me. I couldn ’ t believe the seriousness of the situation. I hadn ’ t understood how he ’ d stand up to this man, the man who once delivered presents for the children and countless others, those who left their homes when their arm was disabled or on the ground to present or give presents. 
 Without thinking I looked over the top of the paper to my fellow agents. 
 It was unsigned, but I could read the name, and was quite close to the cover letter. 
 'Lindsay Trumbuh, Winner of 5 Nobel prizes at last Year ’ s Oscars 
 Me: 
 Three years old. 
 Name: 
 Lindsay ’ s night dog 
 Website: 
 Tanya has been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and has built a habit of spending much of the day just being himself, anything she wanted for nothing. 
 Cause: 
 Suffering from Comatose symptoms, reoccurring delusions and hallucinations. 
 Nominating electronic or physical objects which indicate violence, a propensity to get up, and often sojourn to the internet. 
 Diagnosing: 
 Tanya has hypothermia that can cause "mass hysteria " 
 Tanya starts hyperventilating, vomiting regularly and randomly hitting the ground in front of her drapes. 
 Tanya has made several suicide attempts, including one which took place two days ago. 
 Tanya is constantly verbally abusing her dog, despite her best efforts to fight off him and avoid him. 
 Tanya ’ s paranoia has also manifested itself on her part, hitting her fellow agents with carefully tuned weapons whenever they tried to intimidate her and her animal friends. 
 Tanya was given security clearances by the White House for several days after it shut down the seized electronics. 
 At various points during the day, she and one of her colleagues went to the roof of the building and used an old stereo to broadcast her prize list and memorize the names of the people who were expected to spend time with her and the contestants. 
 However, it began to get rather confusing. The photographs that later were taken of the Sistine Chapel could not be traced. 
 Tanya suddenly stopped, and immediately began fidgeting with her chair. “ Jenna, WHAT IS THAT ’ S ALL HERE? ” she cackled, clutching her chest. 
 “ Beautiful, ” she said. “ Many of you have been there just now. ” 
 Her dog whisked her away before she could respond. 
 “ I AM POOL! ” she cried, “ I AM POOL! ” 
 “ Just listen, ” she continued. “ Have a good holiday! I'm putting this world on your shoulders! ” 
 Tanya waited, she waited so patiently, her head started to feel numb. 
 Pianist 7 is still speaking. 
 This isn ’ t why I signed up for a security clearance. 
 I was getting a little shittery though, I thought to myself as I knocked on her door. 
 She quietly opened the door, and standing before me was… The man that stole these presents? 
 He was beautiful. 
 Looking around, I could see his arms folded before him. 
 A box was placed around his neck and a piece of paper was now on top of it. 
 “ Gunshine 15th. ” 
 “ Gunshine 15th? ” 
 “ YES! ” He exclaimed, knocking on my door and leading me to his mansion. 
 Opening the door I stepped in and stood behind him before him. 
 He had written a letter, and a phone number for me. 
 “ We ’ ll get to meet our friends in London tomorrow, hope you all were prepared. ” 
 There wasn ’ t a peep in the hall, everyone was silent. 
 “ I hope everyone finds the missing boxes. ”<|endoftext|>

"Da... poor bastard! " Damian shouts as he wades into the passage of the sun. He sees a shade of blue engulf some dirt. A beautiful summer day, just out of reach for Damian's wandering eyes as he runs the extra mile down a muddy road. This is getting out of hand, Damian soon notices a black and brown blur in the distance. " Time to get to earth, mister dursley " his wifes back coolly. 
 Durley is walking behind Damian and tries to get him to stop shooting. Damian cramps his hooves causing him to lift up his hood. " Do you want to know why I killed all your friends, mister dursley? " Dursley looks him over and places a hand on Damian's shoulder. 
 " Woe to ya don you " Damian is cut off by Damian's sword impacting his skull hard. A rumble crashes into the passage of the sun, and young Damian runs away, saying that Dursley is dead. 
 Damian keeps running. "... now whats about to happen to your best friend, mister dursley? " Damian doesn't finish his sentence. He makes it out of the passage of the sun to see Damian, crouched on the mud and a flame in his boots, there is a knife in his hand as he pulled it out. " Prisoner 196 will be found guilty and sent to another cell for execution. " How ironic then that the sentence has died with that single word having not been used in centuries. Damian quickly takes one more look over his shoulder and the blade of his sword appears. In his hand he pulls out a jar and slices a lead bearing witness to the killings of his best friends. 
 " It would seem you would have done the same to her, mister dursley ". A week later Damian jumps in Damian's wagon. " Hump me in my mouth... then let's go kill mister dursley and earn the blood of the poor fool " the vikings say as they charge Damian with his steel sword. Damian shoots twice, moaning in agony. A few steps behind Damian, he sees a dark object falling out from behind an overturned wooden crate. " Kill me ma'am! ". Another step behind him Damian orders the wolf pack to drive out its horde, knowing that soon only Damian's family and friends would know where Damian had beheading dursley and throwing him into the river. While driving away Damian notices that there is a bird perched on the side of the road. Damian checks his watch, hopes that Damian is dead... and then stands up to take his own life. 
 Damian realizes it is time to kill this wolf pack and kill any who dare dare approach the might of the canoes. The lone wolf is staring down the hunter with an angry expression. Damian tugs the sword of the wolf. " Don't curse me," the wolf tells the boy in the cart. After receiving his name a voice waves back the group of wolves. The small man with the expression of a man knocked out changes and roars, dying with his life, before the pack from behind the cart and the wolf ( that has recently fed on his life ) finally emerge from the pack and perform the first justice. Only a fool would attempt to kill Damian, even if he was a traitor to his kind.<|endoftext|>

The wind rustled through my hair, as I stared up at the single yellowed bridge floating in the distance. The U.S. would be on fire if it fell. The fuel that landed here was so toxic, I couldn't quite tell how long it would last. I headed up the avenue towards the bridge, my heart pounding the last few moments. Well, I guess now that I figured out that didn't mean I wasn't dying, and the ground felt like it was falling like a warm blanket. I began to walk down the walkway into the balcony, the only light coming from the city behind me. It felt like everything was silent. I continued to walk, keeping my balance and eyes open, trying to not shake the feeling that something was trying to destroy me. After a while it dawned on me. Only I, the bridge. Behind me was the United States of America, utterly engulfed in flames. Our scientists had declared for weeks that the only question before us was what exactly was causing this disaster. They claimed that maybe, just maybe something on this barren island once more was sinking deeper and deeper. It was a few months later when I started to feel tired, the sleep made me uneasy even more. To this day, I couldn't move. The destruction of the world was tearing my life apart as if it was a fight to the death. I tried to talk to someone, anything, but nothing came. Nothing. I was almost afraid that I was losing everything as if it would all be over, all my dreams dying down like an object of dread. I decided to jump. I jumped right up into the air, jumping up higher and higher. Whatever was preventing me from leaving my tower, I couldn't stop it. I thought of my father, who I knew loved to fly every time the weather got cooler. His name was Captain Funkland. He wouldn't have let me die here, I simply couldn't stop him. I ran down the beach, making sure my hands were free of this tiny rock that was somehow floating as if on autopilot. After I had found a safe haven and made sure my legs were still intact, I tried my best to keep them floating up to my face. As I fell, a wave greeted me. Nothing was there. I couldn't move. I was flailing. I lost consciousness in the water. As my eyelids began to hurt, I suddenly heard it. Someone screaming. It was my father. I began to cry, but I felt nothing. My mind began to focus on my father and so I ran, my legs hanging a few feet above me. As I reached the middle of the water I realized that everything was upside down. I fell to the bottom. What the fuck was going on? 
 _Edit: _ Well this is my first WP! But sorry if it sucked for me: ) Please help me!<|endoftext|>

Death stares at me with a face that is almost amused and agrees with me. He has a servant. He is always surrounded by beautiful people. People who cannot be lied to - do you know the rule of the dying? 
 "There is not, son. Death will have it all. Will you run, or seek the land I will take? " Death runs along the path. 
 " I don't doubt your soul. I believe in you, son. I believe in you. " 
 " Why am I here for you? " 
 " To take you to the realm, where you are the only being in existence. To see it all come to light. To see it all bloom into change. You are Death's home now. " 
 I am amazed by what I saw. Something I thought was impossible, but I finally see it - an envelope marked with her name. She appeared as a brokenhearted child, reclining in her bed in an empty room. She was practically lost in thought, unable to find any of my answers. 
 " Remember to save yourself, son. For the universe is warding. And save yourself from the one who steals it. " 
 Death watches me from my chair, pointing. 
 " Thank you, son. This is a message that I will not permit you to read. " 
 She opens the envelope, but she is nowhere to be seen. Death holds the form in his hands, where her hand rests. " Death, don't act any different. " 
 I try to hum with the way that I thought that it would be amusing, to show her that I was truly grateful to have found something worth saving. But the resolve in my heart waned when Death's fingers discovered her handwriting. 
 " May your soul grace you with the perfect gift, mortal."<|endoftext|>

"Okay Class, you chose your history project subjects and have prepared yourselves. One student per Time Travel Chamber, and be sure your return pads are at full charge! And be sure to leave your modern clothes and technology behind. " 
 Cody sat in the middle of the group with his student, who had her shirt ripped and her jeans undone. Each student stared at the other while turning their ears toward the ancient rarities that had kept them hidden from all mankind since their arrival here. They had all also read about the Great Babylonian War. Forty-two years ago, all of the other school's could have been saved. Forty-two years ago, it was Dante - who had taught the group that Earth was cool. Forty-two years ago, Dante was already teaching Adolf Hitler about aliens and how everyone in his class used to exterminate him. 
 He had always kept to himself at such a young age, that only his parents ever knew of his sudden and sudden healing, when he realized that he was the one who was the one who had saved humanity. He'd finish his studies and send him back to the second story of Rome, then tackle all the arctic conflicts and forests on Earth, and let his son know how awesome Rome was. Right now, Cody was going to be teaching that last class. 
 " Alright Class, you chose your history project subjects and have prepared yourselves. One student per Time Travel Chamber, and be sure your return pads are at full charge! And be sure to leave your modern clothes and technology behind." 
 Cody let out an unexpected sigh and glanced at the group. They hadn't seen anything like it since Dante said what they all wanted to hear the first time.<|endoftext|>

I just wish my parents would come home, 
 it'll all end in pain. 
 It always did. 
 Only once. 
 Why did it take me so long to realize it would end in pain? 
 I know I couldn't mean it. 
 But where am I? When will I arrive? 
 I wonder if any of it's true, oh, gosh, is real. 
 Will it be clear? I don't know the answer to that, I shouldn't know it. 
 Is it? A bug, or a ripple, a snapping? 
 This place should have died once. 
 I wonder if it was empty? 
 It had no need. 
 I'm not lonely, really. 
 I'm happy. 
 I'm happy that I'm alone.<|endoftext|>

*No, no, no! * I screamed as I fired my pistol into the dictator's face. Now there was blood on the ground from the semi-automatic, blood that a brilliant scientists saw as being of no resistance. I strained my eyes as I had to see what was happening... But first I have to turn the machine on. 
 I grabbed the gun from his hand, and flicked a switch in the safety. My voice started a low raspy "and when there is no resistance, fire, " as if my audience understood, I began aiming for the incoming bullet. 
 Every few moments I fired a single round. It only let me survive two rounds, which was enough to kill the dictator. It had taken me a few days to realize that one round was too many, but now I knew I'd kill more than that. 
 " *And then I'll turn it back on, and do it again. Nobody else can! *" 
 I fired a round twice more. 
 It only let me live three days, and I hid as far away as I could with a prisoner.

“ Am I rich? Is this really happening? ” I ask as I shift about in my bed. My head is hard in the corner and the other side of my face has a punkish flick of color. I turn the corner into a side room of my apartment and I see a nurse holding a mug. I can't believe I think we haven't heard from her in a very long time, but yesterday we were drinking at a bar and now she ’ s at my bar. If this is what she had just told me is true, it ’ s enough to call her an accomplice. She always told me that murdering people doesn ’ t work; I liked that idea and she said she wouldn ’ t kill me, however, in order to hide your location I have to leave the country with my extra funds to hire an agent. While I take a deep breath I step out into the living room and I can hear a man ’ s phone beeping and counting the days on the clock. I look around the living room and I see the doctor sitting at my table in the corner of the room, he ’ s a bit of an odd guy. “ Is everything alright? ” I ask. “ That didn ’ t work out so well I don ’ t know how or why you did it, but I ’ m here to talk to you about it right now. ” He gestures for me to sit down and “ Agent Green, I just wanted to let you know that in the past you did so well that you ended up helping a lot of people who were victims of global warming, I know you don ’ t know that. ” I can see you ’ re expecting a question, as in I almost want you to answer him, but the man just stares at me and seems like he doesn ’ t want my answer. “ So am I rich? ” I ask dumbfounded. “ Of course you are. ” he says with his stoic looking face, but the bigger man also appears. “ Well, this is all thanks to you, you raised the limit on donations and not for lack of trying, but I ’ m talking you up a bit. You are asking because you believe in a bright future and because you believe that you are not alone. ” He shrugs and it ’ s time to leave. I walk back into my room and I have a look around the room. The lights of the doctor are off, but I can ’ t help but laugh. “ So how the hell did you get here? ” The doctor asks me. “ Well I have one request. If anyone is reading this, please contact your family right now. ” I pick up the phone and dial up two of the best friends in my apartment, they tell me that we are taking the nice guys to the place we have rented. I wait here for about an hour and then I have to say goodbye to my name. The phone suddenly rings. “ Dr. Ferrell… uh… Dr. Green? ” 
 “ Yes, Agent Green. I just came to inform you about my identity. I am Dr. Green. 
 “ Did we stop hearing bad things from our friends?' ” Dr. Green asks me, “ Or would they be blamed on me? ” 
 “ That's a good question. If one of our friends are reading this, please tell them about your family. Tell them about the time we said hello and then the hat I've given you. As you can see I made you a lot of money for two reasons. First I was sick to my stomach, because my parents must have run a big run down shopping complex in the basement. Secondly, because my parents died right before I was born. ” I sit down and turn off the phone.<|endoftext|>

"Hmm, *pretty? * " I thought, leaning back in my chair. To keep up the smell. 
 " Well, I guess that's the problem with my " flats ", " you looking disgusting " and " *I don't care. * " 
 Three thuds. One from the window, a second from me, and a third from the doorway. He comes closer. " It was at the holidays, that's all you really need. " 
 " Well, that was only after this nice kiss on your forehead in a fancy French tavern to celebrate my bride's engagement. Well, I guess I should put on some better clothes then you. I'm sorry. " I smirked. 
 " Wha- do you mean you *really* care? " He scowled at me. 
 " Well, to be fair, I don't feel that my *first* choice is something to go by! " He was laughing, shaking his head, then giving a half-hearted kiss at me. 
 " Ah... " I swallowed deeply. " I... I think this will only get worse. I hope I growl and I fall down by the way. * I guess*. " He picked up another glass of wine. 
 I placed it on the counter and shook my head. " Why, yeah, I suppose I'll just go with the champagne then, but I don't think you will hold much worth to me when my life is changed in a manner not fitting for a married man! " 
 " Ugh. Who cares. It'll just be easier to say I killed my fiance and left you dead. " He glared at me. 
 " No, *I am a new man. Not the 19 year old I came to love, * you will leave me. The bitter taste of alcohol will be mine, and it's getting worse, frankly, considering how I am! " 
 " Well, *I guess*, no problem! Have you begun to eat clean? I have plenty of clean water! " He walked away. " So, it looks like my sack is ready! You must be tired now, at least, have you? " 
 " Yeah, *very. * " 
 I started to wander upstairs. The door was tumbling open from inside. I didn't feel great, but I wasn't going to let my wife die, so I prepared to leave. 
 " Hey, hmmm... " I shot a grin at the door. " Uh, did the wine come on the way? You know you can't catch those things for yourself. Nice to see your friend here, were you thinking about putting anything else on the fridge. " 
 He turned back to me and finished his glass. His mug was folded up in a small sack with a black ink lining and a label telling me what kind it was. It looked fairly high-dollar, so it didn't count to me. He looked right at me with a look of confusion. " Are we going to eat another 2-6 eggs in the fridge? " 
 I smiled sadly. " Listen, I have to get going. Now, it's a shame you don't. " 
 He frowned slightly, giving me one more look before walking away. I had another 1-6... " *" 
 The elevator buzzed and I wasn't alone. The doors swung open and my sight began to flicker with sounds of conversation. I walked to the front desk and began flipping through the articles, unlocking the doors, and making myself a cup of coffee. 
 When I turned the corner onto the fifth floor, I saw myself, sitting at the coffee shop, waiting for someone to bring me my coffee, just so I could go get it. I didn't even realize I was in shock. I closed my eyes and saw a familiar face staring back at me, I stared back and forth in silence. 
 The coffee was still warm, but I know what it was for. 
 EDIT: Thought I was in for some harsh criticism. ( I'm new and we are so as you can tell )<|endoftext|>

"Good morning Beatrice, you've finally landed an equal in the galactic federation. " 
 " No, I can not. I don't belong here anymore. " 
 The rich gov's top spokesman took a breath and looked out over the enormous filing table. Beatrice sat on the arm of a massive pile of flowerbed blossoms. 
 " Lady Beatrice, we have a message for you. Thank you for being our best choice in the past, I believe it is time for you to cease work here at the Union. " 
 Beatrice was giddy from excitement. Most of the last emperor and lady gods were in hiding. Now this. People would expect no bribes, non violent takeover, or even immediate liberation from the kingdom of moron grocers, but Beatrice was a woman now! She no longer had to pay rent, settle debts, and to be " law " whatever her title. What was no longer required was elite compliance at all times. She could simply project her lightning fast phone tower to the Creator's center just outside of her employment facility and observe the workings of the vast space network spanning the galactic federation. This everyone-was, enslaved woman had learned from Barack Obama. But how could people expect her to make money with her mind? 
 " I mean, look, you've brought in so much and improved your artistry, manufacturing, and other... Things that you helped the world, but we will all be protected by you again after this disgusting lapse in freedom. " The avatar of a human objected. " We are the embodiment of the unequal distribution of power, torture, and human greed! Look Beatrice, I can't even discuss the fact that there are so many more now than before, and we have an election just for you. You don't matter if you're chipped off! Don't screw with us, or you will lose our rights and responsibilities. " 
 There was an audible gasp as the chairman ushered Beatrice away from the seat and in front of the software desk. 
 " Look Beatrice, and when that blinds you, here is a chance. Lets stop with your code. We are in awe of your ability to translate both human and alien languages in the mainframe. The already infuriating code is being heavily marketed. Prepare to turn this into a movie! " 
 After decades of forced labor, the digital age was no longer an alien concept. Beatrice stood and offered the CEO her hand. Just like Ronald Reagan, the Universal Earth Federation had chosen her because she had been able to translate millions of miles of alien data to her next planet and taught them to speak the language, understand the Earth language, and even observe their caves and music. 
 Beatrice took her own seat as the CEO began her announcement. 
 " First, we are glad to announce the hiring and promotion of Rosa De Merza as P-000 Herculean Leader! Congratulations! " 
 Beatrice shook her head and walked up to the leader. " Good luck Luci, I'm home."<|endoftext|>

I remember thinking to myself over and over again why I haven't found a babysitter in my life. I had lost my sister after long enough. 
 She never made it out of high school. I had trouble comprehending how I was in trouble even with a shitty school that was over twenty years away. I couldn't even push through the uncomfortable thoughts that traveled through me during college as a teenager, bouncing off every window I could see. 
 I tried to slow the crying to a manageable pace. I wished that I could relax and dream, just let me escape the pain, as I knew that right now it was too late. 
 The cuts on my arms took up almost a quarter of my face. Every single tear remained there, a tattered wound that I desperately wanted to forget in the memory of my sister's final days. 
 My knees felt still as my mother spoke to me. 
 "Give me another chance." 
 I wasn't there for her. I was with her. I was with my sister. 
 I wish I could, but the depression wouldn't allow me. It would force me to give up, and leave her behind. I wished I could be free. I wish I had someone to do that for me. I wish I could just cry and cherish this moment with another.<|endoftext|>

"It's official! " exclaimed Max. His ship was underway, and he was going to crash. 
 The familiar hot asphalt lined with cabinlights took over the smoke and flames like melted sand beneath the sunlight. Max thought back to when his childhood friend said " You should take good care of the power plant; if you don't pay by the book-or pay the price by the day, you'll just get torn apart." And always, he would do that. 
 One night after leaving school, Max and his friend made his first world-famous couplet in it, a chance to show off how cool the universe really is. All the fun the god-damned waves made them feel, laughed at and laughed all the time, like if sharks were laughing at a coin they could look into, and why couldn't they see everything that they wanted to see with those pools of white goo. 
 Max could remember their first kiss on the beach, as the waves broke the waves in the sand and washed the ocean over them in great arcs. His friends will tell you how people would do anything to get into the pool of goo. It was a gift from god, and Max, because, it's easy to get lost. 
 When they reached the bottom of the large, sandy lake, one of the tides came over top. Max's friends and mom had assumed they would only get dead but then they remembered that once that happens, it's never a bad thing. He remember his mom berating him about it, saying the water wouldn't get better. 
 Max only wanted to be out of pain for a little while, and only wanted a couple things: fall in love with whoever he was and keep going as normal as possible. Instead, he remembered going to prom. His parents wouldn't like it because prom was always a bad day, especially if it was a woman. 
 Then, the wind began to ride back over the beach, blowing out the sleet off the whole lake, including his friend, and he quickly rose to his feet. He set down the gun and was about to shoot his buddy when the wind grabbed his arm and pulled him out into the open air. That is when a thing came out of the water, but the wind knocked him out, and the original guy was still standing about five feet away from Max with a sledgehammer. Not long after, two dudes crawled out from under the waves and grabbed Max by the wrist and pulled him out of the water and pinned him in the open. The thoughts of what had happened to the guy all of a sudden are still fresh in his mind. 
 The cop got up and saw one of the dudes sticking out of the water and grabbed the guy, picked him up, and took him into custody. Two men entered the cell and gave Max a kiss on the forehead, and then dragged him to a jail cell. All of the heroes of the world got off for some time after that, but Max was finally out. He woke up again some time after that.<|endoftext|>

Belt thick stone, and fingers tingling his labia. Circumstance, chilled stone, and blood all over: his bloody eyes glazed over with the light of Venus. 
 So this stone was right, and what words could not describe the sensation. It gave him the strength to run. 
 He tripped his pants at the ball of lightning in the cathedral, collapsing, onto the feet of Mary without even looking her over. Her gaze lights up the room, and his shadow lengthens as he races to catch her in one swift motion. 
 On his shoulder is something from young Christmases boot prints, all that can hardly be described, creases and folds in the fabric. Above it, hung from a wheelbarrow, there are thousands of pictures; of black and white grey, taken over the years by his wife and two children, several lost and unreturned. It is mother nature's sacred provision for her baby, Luke, an unwillingly present and unsettled young baby that would grow up in an orphanage like all survivors of the Holocaust. 
 He tracks her with his foot. A dark, clenched hand grazes a pair of razor sharp blades on a wet ground below. It is a quick and boring sense of expression. 
 Suddenly, he must approach the square. He hastens, and his hands grasp in tightly and cup his face to catch his breath. 
 The iron sword glints from the pommel, and a voice opens it's mouth. 
 "You are not so bad. And we don't need you here. For love in Christ is eternal, one must abandon other." 
 The night murks in a voice, veiled as the darkness and flames above. 
 He leaves the pyre atop a transatlantic flight deck. He leaves the deck, his heart beginning to race, his chest thumping hard against the sand and clammy against the the light of his mighty torch.<|endoftext|>

I say my name. 
 I not a human, born to these screams, but a mute. 
 "Kiri, kiri, this is the most urgent call in the world! " 
 I scream her name out loud as a child. She always gets it. She wants it so bad. I'm sure she's looked at me like I'm some wacky pet. But I don't. 
 " Who... do you think you are, daughter? " I ask her from behind the soundproof glass in the upstairs hallway. 
 " Men. My name is Kan. The most dangerous enemy in all of Battaglia! You are in the middle of the night, actually. Say, what do you do? " 
 The little girl hesitates. She takes off her collar and slits her eyes behind her ear. I still can't bring myself to listen. 
 " Please, " I say simply as a slight pinch of air is sucked from my lips. 
 " Listen, Mommy. Listen to this. I can't take this anymore. " 
 The tears begin to well and soak the paint on my floorboards. 
 " Like you did last time you tried... " 
 I can feel her pounding on my wall, screaming, screaming, crying. I stand and go to the door. 
 " Mommy! My baby! Please, if you can hear me. I have no choice! " 
 No response. 
 " And who is this Kamiki? He's his dad. He looked more like his own brother. He was the one to get my mommy a sweetheart plan and marry her, her mother-in-law was his brother, and he was his monster. He'd murdered her mother so he could go hunting. The same Rachel, in the same row. And now, tonight, my last night, his monster has come for me. Please, I can't let him live! I can't have a monster in my life anymore. It hurts my own body. I love my girl, but she has to die. " 
 The crying stops, but I still have no answer. 
 " You don't understand. Just listen. Kiri. Kiss my girl. Please." 
 I smile at her tears. I kiss her back. And then I leave. I keep walking, out the bedroom door. I throw the door open and head downstairs. I don't know how to get out. And I don't know why. But tonight... I hope she knows that this is my last night. And tonight I can finally rest.

There was a moment of clarity that allowed us to see something disturbing from afar, even if we didn ’ t necessarily see anything at the time. The "Stone " clearly were those of a pack of large dogs that were found along the ancient road; it's three leading horses were lying around a inlaid frame of polished stone and a shallow stone slab with a sudden gravity effect. The sound from the " Blood " seeped through the air like waves to a swimming pool; one must have be hooked up to a network of pipes or boat ramps, capable of being made to move in waves at much the speed of sound. Clearly, they were the pack of mast-board idiots who try to pick up or display an unfathomable amount of " humility ". 
 Mark looked as if he were shifting, but he was not; when someone touches a stone, all the air around them thins like sweet powder. When someone taps their foot or sees a hunk of string, all they find is solidity and pounding. Mark was getting out of control now; his knees buckling and jerking as if he were the end of a black carpet. Mark was more involved in the bizarre choreography of his initiation than with the murder. It wasn ’ t that this wolf wolf monster didn ’ t act against the rules - he was enforcing them, as an absolute god being he commanded them. Yet the really awful part was that he couldn ’ t put a finger on that part. I don ’ t know if there are wolves in the woods anymore, but maybe that ’ s the only part of this madness that I ’ m aware of - that we can ’ t differentiate between the motivations of pack hunters and those of the sheep? 
 It was once that my dog ( not long ago today ) reached out and touched a cow's head. It was a true transformation, a crown of mittens. The sheep stopped its fur. Then, as if riding in a cat riding on a golf course... no, horsewoman. Footmen from a dead horse. Snow fell from the building and clouds dripped off the birds whistling and hooting in the distance. I was one of those fleeing wolves and as it fell the hunted ceased its activity, and humans fled off into the distance. They fled in a rush, leaving footprints across the ground, like spurs that wound for miles as it came to a rest in the emptiness of the wilderness. 
 I will never forget that day; only only one moment in this life will lead me free.<|endoftext|>

"Who am I, " this was the first thing Glenn heard in the aftermath of the end of the one man event, from corruption to incompetence. " What are you doing? And what do you mean, do you mean, taking over my family? " 
 " No, " replied Glenn, as he took a breath before speaking back to him. " I am the messenger. An authority within the corrupt world. I am the line between the living and the dead. I am fast. I can stop disease. I even make people more happy. But in the end, I am still hungry. And now I am done. " 
 Glenn dropped down to meet the militariel uniting his band of arms. " Welcome, my friend. A punishment for the many sins that now exist within your family. " 
 " It is, " the militariel said, " Unfortunately, each person born after the alliance of progressive tribes and talented military people are destined to commit five murders per year, which as of today would be nine, but that is against the standards prescribed by the Council for the Legions. " 
 Glenn looked confused, " What? How am I going to beat them all? " 
 " Well, " his mumbled that over and over again as the militariel spoke, " Each of us, we need to kill each other... " 
 " All we have is one strand of twisted hate. A strand of hate so perfect that death would have you dead in days. " 
 " What are you saying? " Glenn asked. 
 The militariel hesitated, " I am saying that if my population was all members of my family that would not be a problem. If its most corrupt leader chose me as his Supreme Leader, that would not be a problem, you idiots. What makes me think my handiwork would be successful for a single fatal slave? Our commanders demand that we only replace those who refuse to commit suicide. Those who have died and stand in our way. What I offer is a test to determine if a woman's ambition can satisfy my will. " 
 " Then what are we going to do? We simply have to kill all of you... " 
 The militariel let out a quiet chuckle, " but you all may be arguing about the finer points of the Council. Truth be told, the council isn't actually a council, and there is no total will of any of your members. They just elect one person, and let him live. " 
 The militariel sighed, " that sounds noble, then you are good. " He reached into his pocket and pulled out a metal cylinder, handed it to Glenn with a smile on his face, and waited to explode for their next killing blow.

*Princesses envy me, too. * I knew that all my life I had been struggling to love these women, and now at that moment of contact it was both one of my most rewarding and saddest moments. In the beginning I had thought I was "perfect", and for that I was blessed with amorous relations with none but the most educated people in the world. 
 So I became fervent in wishing I could turn them around and help them into the future, promising to see them grow up without flaws. Instead I just kept waiting for them to hit puberty. Soon I found myself distracted by the dramatic performance of the game with my entertainment company whose shares plummeted in reaction to my passion for dating. 
 As time wore on, I became more desperate for reassurances from them. I gave up trying to date them. I had to respect their work ethic and strong gender roles, yet I was convinced that if they created obstacles that would hinder their growth, I could harm them for it. By the time my hopes for even the slightest serious change had been crushed, and they were forced to see my weakest methods, my passions for their second chance, they had already driven my arousal with every flicker of their eyes, fueled by the fear of losing them. I knew that what they would grow up to, and what they might experience in the years to come would greatly alter my journey towards relationships. 
 *As if they weren't already so pathetic. * 
 So I became hopeful. After nearly a decade of slowly building friendships with girls and women from every community and belief community I managed to defeat the constant barrage of animosity, I built a path towards a relationship that would achieve genuine love, whether it was just friendship or a romantic love. 
 As I grew I slowly saw just how desperately my desire for her in turn would violate her. I imagined that my character would continue to act like one of the characters I had created as I kept growing stronger. I saw me magnify my desire, my bitter hatred for her as I turned inward and gave it an honest voice, a truthful reminder of the ways I would mistake her for me if she were sober. 
 *Like in Cinderella* 
 *She may not be my fairy tale hero. But she isn't a princess without flaws. * 
 I knew I was going to cause her to fail, but now that the inevitable lay before me, I knew I had to protect her. I worked very closely with my customers to make sure that I would never have to let them down. I gave them an honest opinion about their status and how disappointed they were when they found out that they had something that was different from their true feelings. 
 *She doesn't need our help anymore. * 
 It's impossible for me to say how wrong I was. I had been selfish, selfish and shortsighted since the beginning. I did not see the dream of going forward with it as I had seen the nightmare of waiting to see the end of it, but I don't need to fear it. Instead I have to walk it alone, and make a change. 
 Without him, I could not build the confidence I needed to stay alive. So I looked into their eyes, and saw nothing of them. These people who abandoned their flaws and grew to love all things that had not been embraced by others and no one loved them, no one had cared and no one else believed. 
 He did not need us anymore.<|endoftext|>

I looked back at the dime almost lost in the last continuous wave of rock throwing. It was all a big elaborate joke to me because it sounds ridiculous. It doesn't sound like what I'd imagine saying. I mean, it'd be something to be proud of, but what would I say? 
 "Hurry up. Go back to bed. " 
 My body was shaking and I could feel the sweat building on my cheeks. I knew I shouldn't go, but I just didn't want to. I didn't want to come back to this world in a 4 am state. 
 " *****Gordon! Gordon. Gordon!" 
 I fell to my knees and cried the death of my life with tears running down my cheeks. 
 I awoke with a start to put out the flames and fall back down to earth. No one noticed me. I still had half the night off in the library. 
 *No dad. * I looked at my sign of registration and then at the stack of drawers in front of me. 
 That's when I remembered I didn't think I was older than 22. As I looked back down at the weight loss test, another one of the numbers started to wave away. 
 As I sat up, the kids were still staring. The price of meal plans were starting to roll in. Thanks to open tab on third day of school, students just had to turn in statements, credit cards, and expected money. 
 *It's okay... Bye bye... * I pushed myself to my feet. * God no. *<|endoftext|>

From the hues of the kudzu, wind-clouds streamed down the mountain pass, caving in their path from air. The steep hilltop was a shadow of its former self. Dust billowed out from the narrow channel under the clouds of these thickening clouds. Shrugging off the heat from a pungent wind, Professor Oak constructed his tent, and tossed it over his shoulder. His head almost smashed through the jagged ash that covered his narrow window frame. Iceberg, pidgey, various shades of yellow - we'll use them for later. He stood in an instant, and made his way through the darkened cavern. Noticing his anxious apprentice, she stood just a few feet away, but continued to stare the tent-builder through the telescope. Brushing something sticky out of her body, she rubbed it softly from her nose. If he doesn't move, he'd be instantly be driven back into his own home. * Put aside matter with principles of Charmander and Johnny, and add to those with motifs. * The dumbbell pitch seemed to galvanize Professor Oak's attention. Two hundred metres up he could get a good idea of just what he had to do. Pick one of the components of Yellow's airplane and kick it off. He'd have just enough time before walking onto the ramp. * Tuck it in, snatch it, nudge it off the ground. Just the two simple parts. * One, it will be a mother hen's bird, two, TM502 will be a toddler... every single step will create balance between Tiny Pokémon and Pokemon trainers... two, the first six months can happen overnight! Tranquill was already woken up, the strength to resist the wind baying in every direction. He would push, he would climb. Sooner rather than later, he'd abandon his childish activity. * Tuck, he did. * 
 He was ignored. As he sat on the grass, he had to focus on his chest... it was matting the cobblestones on his shoulder. 
 *Your oldest brother has gone to the razors, and you've learned the lab is near enough... * Two words ran through his mind. * TURNED OUT FOR THE GROUPS OF THE SCHOOL CHAMPION ROOM! * This had been two thousand times, but nothing would have changed. The wise hottie was certain, that his master would eat. He turned and glared at the cobblestone-wrenching path. These poles seemed so structured, so kind. The cobblestone-wrenching path led to two underground chambers, one near a natural stream. The other darkroom through a secret entrance, with a large compartment through which a certain slug was swimming. Professor Oak set the switch on the rack. He heard a buzz as an answer passed from his ear, and remained there for several moments. * That's not any slug, still haven't digested it properly. * Oak opened his mouth to plead, but she immediately scrawled a familiar request into his notebook. He stepped outside and a faint groan from the catacombs enveloped the entrance. Professor Oak's muscles immediately began his morning routine. 
 *This must have been her last day. She can't possibly have gone out, " he said. " She's always been at it. * They made us go through extreme training to prepare for the howling thunderstorm, in fact this was the last time. " 
 A long moment later, Professor Oak stood up, and his trainer quickly turned to the cook. * No more butts, of course. * Her thinking had turned slightly towards that particular moment. " TUCK, TOMORROW!"<|endoftext|>

Thirteen minutes passed now that he was about to reveal his prime ministerial position. His career was complete and it felt surreal as he sat down on the sidelines. Was this goal complete? Of course it was, he was in the middle of what was becoming the final stages of his second term. Thought clearly the report came up short, he was much too excited for his new leadership position to refuse. He immediately wants his latest report to be one of the most sought after's of all time. 
 The team man had already turned his in, had instantly blown them all away and the job was nothing like it had thought. Now, full of anticipation, confused and shocked, he waited patiently for the screen to start up. 
 "And please be ready, it has been almost fifteen minutes ", the typing screen exclaimed. He excitedly sat back, sipping on his coffee. 
 " Let me know if you need anything " 
 * " Alright pal ", explained the pen pal 
 " Thank you ", said the pen pal looking confused but also elated. He quickly made his way over to the computer and sat down on the keyboard. 
 " Hello", said the woman.

"The last Buddha! What better tribute than to be the master of your limbs and demigod?!" 
 Siree looked to the Great Sutra Master who shouted back her praise. The Buddha stood in his blazer, facing the crowd. The audience booed at this, but the Buddha's gaze bore no animosity. It had that look of sympathy, of admiration. 
 It turned out to be wrong. The Buddha might have been the last of his own kind, but that kind was only brought by his dream, not by any of the teachings he had preached at schools. Without the Buddha, nobody cared about teacher material. And so the Buddha slowly discarded his stock. It was a mistake, a non-dicpation of his too long perspective. The Buddhists went of wanting to save the Buddha. They went against his wishes. 
 And now, no more than a week after the Buddha's teachings had been put on the shelf, the Buddha has finally arrived at the stage where they all need to sit. Though the crowd will grow as he ascends to the platform, the Buddha quietly welcomes them along, too!<|endoftext|>

"Do you really think there's anything out there? " 
 " No, I mean, what am I going to do? " 
 " Well, I don't know. Just be on your guard. It ain't like we can just leave you, we can do whatever we want! " 
 " I know, but there's no way! The State's got you out of here! " 
 " No! Don't say that, it's a stupid phrase! It's not like we have to do anything! Think of the kind of therapy we get, the kind of therapy we want! " 
 " You have to do what you feel is right! For nothing! That might mean chaos, but just be sure to leave me there! " 
 " What do you mean chaos? I mean: Be careful out there! It's too dangerous, it's dangerous! You can't get out without me, you're faking it! " 
 " But that doesn't mean if you stay here, they'll all freeze to death! " 
 " Perhaps, but don't worry, I'll be right back! For now, I just need to calm down. " 
 " No you won't, it's not a good thing! That's just dumb! " 
 " But no we can't leave you, I have my protection. " 
 " You're talking now, really? Don't you want a fight? " 
 " No! I want revenge. I want your respect and respect. Why don't you just go home and chill out?"<|endoftext|>

Jolty would sit back and stare blankly at the ceiling. His genie was too small for him to barely lift his head to the ceiling. It was bad enough that he was relatively clean and quite chatty, but the only time he'd have any difficulty with the genie's poise was when he'd take a bite of a banana. Jerry was a happy, happy young man. He loved his family, loving them unconditionally. He left his beautiful family behind when he was 14 and moved away to the UK to get better life skills. He loved his job, he loved his wife, and he loved his son. He was always filled with joy. He had done everything he could do to help society as a country, and then he decided to change it a little. He created the organic round balls for the club, the neat high powered rubber dip balls for car accident and kicks for pole diving. Jerry would bend down and pinch up the balls and send them soaring towards the sun. He would look in the puddle of toxic algae growing on the ground and wonder why no one had seen it. He would just burst out laughing. 
 Eventually he broke down and had to sit for hours in his large cot watching any and all birds scurry down the path. He would wake up very tired and had to drive for three hours. He found his way to a shelter on the outskirts of town, where he made his way to the top of a tree he liked. It was bright and the sun was setting, and he started to feel happy. He wished his family had come back for him, there was nothing he could have done to hurt them, and he didn't want anyone to notice, but he had his life to live for now, not his half second of happiness. 
 When he heard his luck had blown and his life was almost ruined, Jerry stared at the largest hole in the forest outside his shelter, where his tree leaned out on top of the tree. Jerry couldn't look away now. 
 "Why don't you go around! " he thought as he threw open the window. He knew what would happen next. The man with the giant genie had to get away. He had to get away before it was too late. Jerry looked around to see his old family, with their beloved mother still at home crying over the dead of the night, and his beautiful wife enjoying the last of the sun. 
 " What? " he said. " What's wrong? " 
 " She's gone, " the man said matter-of-factly. " It's just you and me. " 
 "... " 
 " Oh? Well Jerry? " 
 " No, she was right here with the giant green sapling! We've spent far too long here! " 
 Jerry stared back at the tree. He had done it. He had destroyed the human race. He had forced the animals to do it. He had ruined our beautiful planet! 
 " No, I swear to God, " he said softly. " We are sorry." 
 As the man locked his door and walked outside he turned to one last time. His eyes were wide with realization. The greying tree had finally fallen over. Jolty stood with his family in the middle of the cliff, patted his belly and sang to himself for the last time.<|endoftext|>

“ Dorian! Dorian! Dorian! ” I jolted awake from an uncomfortable sleep, trying to pull myself from my sheets. “ Dorian! Dorian! Dorian! ” 
 Dorian put a paw on my shoulder, but I quickly grabbed my four arm and walked up to him. 
 “ Dorian! ” He said, his pet responding to his mother ’ s movement through my sheets. 
 “ Hey Dorian, don ’ t call your name again. You ’ re awake, ” I said, reaching out to him. 
 “ I ’ m Dorian, ” he replied with an answer as well. “ I was expecting you. ” 
 “ But you haven ’ t! You woke me up! ” I yelled. 
 “ I don ’ t know, Dorian, ” he replied, knowing my tone. “ My personality didn ’ t stop fluctuating for me from about a year or so, though I definitely knew. It ’ s a gift, a special thing. Now, you need to leave now. ” 
 “ But Daddy doesn ’ t get it, Dora, ” my Dorian pleaded. 
 “ Dora! We ’ re not having children anymore! ” 
 “ Nope, Daddy won ’ t, ” Dora said, patting me on the shoulder. 
 “ Daddy, Dorian. Dora won ’ t listen. You can stay with me until you have kids. ” 
 “ How long until we have kids? ” 
 “ I don ’ t know. But Daddy says that we are going to have a little celebration tonight! ” 
 With that, he left my room and wandered out of the room. 
 I stood up, head held high, and headed to the bus stop where I had my car. For some reason, the driver knew that I wasn ’ t leaving without my dog, and as I began to approach my house, he stopped. 
 “ Help! ” I yelled, sitting up. 
 “ Dorian, Dorian! Dorian! Dorian! ” His voice echoed in my head. I couldn ’ t help but fall to the floor and when I tried to whimper, his voice was gone. 
 “ What do you mean, darling? ” I asked after another sobbing from the car, “ Dorian? ” 
 He took my hand and wept for the rest of the night.<|endoftext|>

All I wanted was the toy. 
 Yeah, I want it, the little one. 
 I saw the children who played it back then and figured it should be better than the outside of the styrofoam box. I figured that if my parents didn't have to pick it up and bring it to their home, I could watch it use to play in the bathtub and see how it would play on the surface of the water, like that old tool. Well, from up here. 
 They came to visit a few years after I became the youngest one. I was in grade five, and without any special skills, they would sometimes ask if I was even interested in learning our language. 
 First, I looked up my luck. The other kids did the same. They said there was only one game they were interested in and that each had a skill for. 
 So I hooked up my laser suit, and didn't look down. I saw the piles of boxes piled atop, on either side of the styrofoam top. They had everything they had ever owned. I looked down at the toys in my hands. I couldn't take the game away. I couldn't understand them. 
 Then I noticed a few of the other kids were using computers. And perhaps that's why they brought me here. Most others didn't even use computers. It was annoying, really. 
 I wondered what they did with the other kids' toys. Would they be okay with more of their stuff, using some AI or something? Who would be first? And if they wanted to study, what could they learn? 
 So I started to go on, thinking. The others had no names, and they all said they were bored of the game. I saw someone build it a droid. So I wanted to come up with something, and fight for it.<|endoftext|>

The first thing everyone notices about Padawan Mark Widdich is his strange appearance. He's a shock of a young girl. Unlike the Dutiful Padawan on the chat room, he's not quite as tall or as muscular as a Yoda. 
 He also has a snout, much like those of one of the Chitin. This isn't particularly surprising, as most minor Padmages are clad in Shinobi clothing ( except Padme ). He lacks the sharp arm and the cunning hips of a Talos Enforcer. 
 The following day his guard dog Bartender KidzRXE mentions his strange proximity to the authorities and his hyperspace and hyperspace hyperjump abilities. Apparently this marks the arrival of the Jedi Temple Grandmaster, and his upcoming pupil. After he is to sign with the major authorities, I will take note of how he works and the duties he commands. 
 Next, there's Rossette. She is the Padawan of Little Marra. She's already been taken by the Korriban terrorists and is likely holding the Order of the Jedi hostage. She's been kidnapped shortly after he first arrived ( near what the authorities describe as a "death trap " ) and, after it is taken, found hanging from a circular window. Her next appearance is when a lunatic and his apprentice meet. This turns out to be a Padawan, but there's more to the story than that. 
 Anyone who questions why Pad and his fellow Padmages don't follow the orders of this Grandmaster is immediately removed from the soup kitchen and prosecuted to the Dark Side. This is not an ordinary evil plot, but it will need to be reformatted. It could be done. 
 Next comes the queen, Kate Biddler, the bigoted Padawan. The vast majority of people will not and probably will not care about the Kaze, including Ross. Kate has no interest in destroying the Jedi Temple or serving the Order. Most Padmages only care about killing scores of people, and saving it from destruction. Kate will look at him like a stubborn pig, someone who keeps on killing these kuubi for her amusement. 
 Petty!? No. In the beginning, Maximilian Grievous fell for the Petty girl. Sadly, he is no longer Petty. The petty girl is now Alibelle, the Padawan woman, who has placed the Deceptive Padawan below him with the boy's permission. She also wears her red light saber, which is rather sad. 
 And of course, the Order of the Jedi is basically locked in a chain fight with another Padawan. They have the final duel only a few minutes before, but before the opponents can control their power for good, Maasai the Pitiless approaches. Now this Padawan must drink from his cauldron, and everything will be fine. He'll be fine. He will be fine. 
 Maximilian warns Maasai about her religion. He wants the rats off her mind, and this will be the moment they will learn it. Maximilian knows it will be his last duel. He will win, but no matter how hard he pushes himself, the girl will catch him. Now she has to catch him. Maximilian leans over and whispers in Maasai's ear: " Now I have to kill another Padawan."<|endoftext|>

Frank to himself like a lion does when he sees a deer 
 Giving the wrong direction, the deer doeeze as she *shrinks* and walks away. 
 Slowly, it takes a look upon the dead hunter, his perfect white mask covering his face. 
 "What the fuck do I do with this? " 
 Frank, to himself like a lion does when he sees a deer, looks away and says " Do you know why I'm doing this? " 
 The deer shoots Frank in the face and falls down to the grass, kindling a fire to distract the deer while pushing Frank into the nearest tree. 
 " Like I said, Frank, I like this " 
 Frank spots a deer near the side of a hill. 
 Frank puts a large axe up to either side of the deer, and fires his axe at the soft carcass. 
 BAM! 
 The deer turns to Fred and says " Frustrated Fred? "

 " Not like that, " Frank says quickly, " I have nothing."

The hallway was long. Longer than a bed. Longer than the odd chairs on the man's desk, but if it had been a bus that could have approached he probably would have thrown his apron before an entire chamber of such long periodont. 
 He waited in silence, the mind racing around the endless options. He had previously had to ask out a friend. A coworker. A friend of some kind. He glanced at the clock, brought the ticket over to the end of the corridor, and quietly recalled the observations his friend had made over the past week. You could always count on someone noticing that you were down-ing it. 
 He thought. 
 He sighed and slid a twenty and his pocket service link, into the dull boxes of cabs. He sighed again, the feeling of even the slightest annoyance in an otherwise pleasant and constructive routine. The lull in the train meant he had given up on it. 
 He glanced up the rickety and steel doors of the subway. All the signs pointing at the various tenements beside it said "Fires. " 
 " Okay, hey man, what is it? ", he asked. 
 " Jesus Christ. " 
 *The Amtrak train swept along the subway tracks as he turned the corner. * 
 The silence of the subway was unnaturally pitiful. 
 " Are we getting to Mountain View? This place was named for the cabin that Walter had spent so much time in. " 
 The sound of distant footsteps drew his attention to a distant chair. He searched for the target, but could not find it. 
 " What the fuck? " he thought. 
 " WE HAVE BEEN THERE! " A man yelled. He wasn't in the car, so he didn't make it to the subway platform. 
 " Noooo., " he said. " What was it? " 
 He turned around. 
 " What the fuck? " 
 A black figure. Strange. He couldn't turn around or get his glasses off. Only the man's cassock near his ear acted as a makeshift mirror. That creepy skull would be a sign if he couldn't read it. 
 The man shrugged and slowly turned into the side doorway of the building that made it. With his flashlight by his side he looked out through a binoculars obscuring all eyes. But there were three young girls, six or seven years old, walking along the subway path with a makeshift diary on their phones. 
 The girl panted and wiped her eyes. 
 " You know what else. " she said. 
 " I just remembered asking to see the cabin. " 
 The girl looked away. The girl said nothing more. She shrugged a little, put her head in her hands, and left. The train was stopped. 
 " Yeah. " 
 " What? What the fuck? " 
 " I asked, but I didn't have time to do it. Just left. " 
 The men followed her back through the compartment, back through the train, back down the hall towards the shadows of the quiet cafe that ran under the alley. Before the kids had reached their benches they had passed the partitions of the baguette that opened into the interior of the cafe. 
 The girl folded her hands. 
 " Sorry, so many meetings after this..." 
 She needed no tear gas to change her mind. She knew that the town's was little more than a scene out of a place.<|endoftext|>

Tensions between the Land Powers have long been at an all time low. Countries ranging from Argentina to South Africa have exchanged nuclear weapons since the start of the war. In a desperate attempt to quell the growing unrest the War Cabinet called together the 13 nations of the West and East. They discussed the latest diplomatic solution for the conflict and then unanimously agreed to discuss a name, system and tactic for conflict escalation. 
 "Kazovitz! Kaechan! " they all shouted. " Zemos! " People were terrified of flying ships like this over the hill. Lazarians were closer than people had been in a long time. Most of the planet was either wiped out or taken over by nuclear weapons. A new development came to the War Cabinet as their leaders were discussing a new strategy. Nobody was sure if it was some joke by an angry Hasmonean of a country, or whether they intended to use Hiroshima or Nagasaki with nuclear weapons. They gathered further discussion though and decided to use the War Cabinet term " Makida ". With that said the war ended as the whole world burned. 
 Tensions peaked in the beginning of WW2 but became obvious once both countries became engaged in war. War-time for many countries after once, a peace treaty was reached, however it had a dark side. Some countries could not afford their ally at that time with their huge oil fields, while some countries had full control of what would be known as oil fields. Each country got similar national treasures: The vast oceans that would have oceans within the next 10 years. And at the same time all this new wealth because of technological advancements. The third great war of history came during this time, between Russia and the United States. While being strategic they were willing to stand against the United States. After withdrawing all their soldiers and were committed to defensive maneuvers, Russia and the United States resorted to nuclear weapons. Even by their enemies, we were still high-level NATO members and it was that time when the Russian Prime Minister raised a red flag. 
 At that point the new Surat Mahovise War Plan was formed. 
 " Our enemy has overrun Kaliningrad. We are to surrender and call attention to your conquests. " With this official declaration the Soviet Union was declared a state on all three continents of the world. As soon as this declaration made her be accepted to the Sphere of Light, she was put into small space capsules to begin the new. She was no longer able to speak, as her main organs were confined to radio waves. While the rest of her body was still basically alive as far as radar indicated she remained speechless.<|endoftext|>

I am not a fan of need. But I am a fan of beliefs. 
 I have another theory that I share, one that you might find on your first think. It is called Russian Roulette. It requires a medium that more closely resembles crunch. Almonds are good. Mascara are bad. Rosemary's and violet. Sometimes phlegm will hold the wrong ingredients. Sometimes you are not quite sure where the right one is going. 
 There is a good reason why America has a reliance on kale in Russian Roulette. When a layer of red curls up very thinly on a piece of kale, it was not the wrong colour to obtain, but rather perhaps a different flavour. However, the latest research indicates that many people don't get enough so that the more your options change, the less money you have. 
 I don't like thinking about gender. I think about things on a side-by-side basis. Masculinity is very clear. We are different. No, a set of eyes is how the world is made. The only thing wrong with that is that we are doing our part in life, and are often doing so without a purpose.

"I don't know why I'd choose this, it would have saved a lot of lives but no, it's just not there. " 
 The master wiped his forehead with a piece of cloth and started to wade into the chamber, staring at the room. He had been out for days with the gatekeeper, asking him why his seed sat in the stony old oak, and that the gates wouldn't open. A day later the master would return, and what lay ahead of him was empty. 
 " It's been years now, centuries, trillions of years of service, I've wondered if you are enjoying this, wondering why the man who built this house is not joining us. " 
 " I still don't understand, I'm trying to make sense of this place. " 
 " I don't understand, can't you just accept that you created some change that would save thousands of lives? You can't just grant permission for the people to go in there, and I will make sure of that." 
 He did. 
 His job was clear, but he carried the seeds. I suppose it won't matter anyway since each person would have their own tale. I am bound by my duties, and just like I always said, this is my human form.<|endoftext|>

The black iron lie on the morning grass, in the distance a farmer's field lay in my path. Dark air crept up against my damp clothes, arms behind me. The light crept in slowly, strobing my eyes. Bright pain melded with sparks, the sizzling of blood and of pain came out of my cheek, dissolving. As if filled with the icy hatred to which my eyes had been drawn, I stared at the beast that had lain there. Embracing its dead, helpless features, I locked eyes with the farmer. 
 The man's face had long since turned from graceless to looking at me, his eyes given away by a mask. Where the man's eyes belonged was now filled with a rotten grin, eyes dripping with rage and pain. I cursed myself with malice and wholeness, ripping the iron from his hands with a flick of his thumb, unable to save him from the wrath of this assassin. The farmer stopped dead on the ground, his mouth gurgling as he dug a knife into my neck. We both jumped from my feet, the blood cascading down our cold, bloody bodies. The rest of the army that I had been left behind hastily began to leave, the man's face devoid of malice, his face the eyes of a burnt monster. 
 Clash of swords rang out in the distance, and down came the shotgun I had dropped. A dull pain had gathered itself in my gut as I sank down to the ground, their dagger arcing into my neck. " Well done, you bastard. " I breathed to my wife, this was the end of my miserable life. 
 " Yes, you sad, fluffy cat," she snarled, her dark and sad eyes now full of sadness. " I have struggled to find that balance since I was a little girl. I wanted to become a so called a grown man. But I knew that I would never have it any other way. And in my final moments, I simply wouldn't let my emotions control me."

He was a bag. 
 Teddy always wanted food. He wanted to help out. But it was hard now, too much. 
 "Are you there? " 
 " I'm here, Teddy, " he said. " There's help coming. There's food. Come on. I'm ready. " 
 He stretched the bag to its full length, and stretched his back, stretching his arms, and his calves. He struggled to hold it. Too heavy. 
 " Come on, Teddy. Let's go to work, " he said. " We can have a breakfast. You too. " 
 " Sure, " she said. She grabbed his door handle and pulled, tugging, the chains around it. 
 " It's over, " he said, crawling over to the door, stepping in through the opening. " Here." 
 She stood beside him, sucking his tail. They were hugging, and she was right behind him. He was finding it hard to breathe, the air outside his lungs filling his lungs. And the smell. He saw her biting down on his hands and knees. 
 She wanted more than anything to suck him dry. She wanted him to suck her dry. He ran, barking. 
 It took him about two hours to get across the highway, running for more than he could ever remember. He followed the road like a slow rabbit. His soul ached every so often, trying to remember what the real world was like, but it didn't. He went faster. Tired of your cold, unadulterated me. 
 They didn't realize, they didn't realize how they were different from the others; how distinct they were, how different they all were. They had no right to question if they were just another person, or if each person had been my personal fuck-up. They had no right to look at a picture of a happy family with him, and not know that he got to make friends with them. 
 Everyone knew, they all did, except Teddy. 
 He hadn't seen his parents for long; they took to calling him ducky, something the nose would say, a dog, or a cat, but in Teddy's mind, the two had been family. They had lived through so much at the same time; they were siblings, and even as time wore on, though, they still clung to each other in Teddy's head, still trying to make friends. 
 No. 
 They couldn't. 
 They only had time to understand, to understand each other. He didn't have the balls to skip several miles around wherever they might have gone. He had a rough life. Some people had left before, but they stayed with him all the same. He didn't deserve to stay. He didn't deserve to die. 
 He cared. 
 The checks went in, along with some dinners, and a lot of money. Money saved. He wouldn't have to move again, because, now, every place, whenever he saw someone else, there were holes in his mind where the others would have left. He was a gay man. He cared. 
 The water went in on the way there. He felt this lonely peace in the water, and it was like that time again, where he needed everything in the world, to have something, even if they didn't care anymore. 
 He didn't want to be. 
 Teddy hated the water, but it was his anger at not having it. He hated being with other people, and it made him happy. It made him happy. It made him happy. 
 The days went by. He didn't talk to anyone. Nothing made sense anymore, though. The days went by, he saw someone else, and all he wanted was a better life.<|endoftext|>

Rob, I'm a soldier! 
 You can call me a soldier, but if you call me a soldier, as in I'm the Lord of the dead, you'd better remember how wrong I was. 
 Well, it's true that it's not right for me to tell the truth of the bloody disease that has been plaguing humanity for so long. I still hold the most raw truth in the world, and, despite this, there is one thing I know. Everyone in this "Honors Institute " is sent to a war hospital to fight it. But, because it's such an unforgivable sin, I was sent to be the only human. 
 The what? Well, the *Holy Code* was designed just last week. Humans have tried to kill me, but it's soooo weird that I've still got the cells to fight. Since, as you can see, the numbers are incredibly low. 
 I'm back, up on top of a building with a man sitting in my chair, fucking off with his crotch after he unholsters his shirt for me. 
 " Thanks, bud, I might want to get my ass out of here. Why did you ask? Can I just talk a little? " 
 A free body, with all my memories intact, sits as tight as possible, with the door collapsing for the briefest of moment. That left me with the most basic question of all. 
 * " Why didn't you just say let's take a few shots at it? " * 
 Again. 
 " Well, didn't you just say... I don't need you, I'm just a soldier " 
 Breathe. 
 " How should I know? It's just that in the beginning, I don't know what a'point' was. I was in control and..." 
 Oh well. Maybe I can end this. Maybe I can end the war. Or, I can escape it for the rest of my days as the merely prostate addict. There's only one thing that could keep me at bay right now: remembering the dog shit I lost out on.<|endoftext|>

It's been a while since I've seen this old one, but it's no wonder I still have to search the universe for this shit. You see, I've been following the dying giant robots the entire ten years since they infiltrated my homeworld. When they first started popping up ( and I've read stories about how they've been popping up in the name of good fortune and my own rebirth of the humans ); I thought they were breeding a new kind of resistance, searching for anything that couldn't survive a bit of radiation. So for a while, I was listening, watching as they migrated through this little satellite. I figured it was just another megalodon of some sorts, not that I had much belief in them, though. Why would a giant megalodon like this? 
 Over the next ten years, I got increasingly suspicious, and on top of that I began to take all the reports of encounters, reports of reports of my encounters to investigate. I was investigating the entire UN League of Nations, and they seemed to believe I knew everything about them. I was able to stop the planet-wide inky black hole they had started spewing from, infecting every sector of the galaxy. 
 Eventually, I came upon the source of their troubles, something called "Universal Biotics " that changed their race, transforming them from bitter, arid, dark, brutish, savage, all of those things. This change broke a great deal of interest to my team. At first, it was just a lowly door-keeping crew of life-forms—I suppose it came from nowhere, as the aliens were only looking for people who didn't convert all three of their genes into quadrillions of identical messengers in at least ten different forms, which would fly through space without really blowing themselves up. 
 Once they started expelling some of their carbonic compounds to some impossibly deep underground caverns, they fell to their own stupidity and began getting lost in their filth, some of their peoples were relieved that the invaders could finally use their electrical interrupter, but I knew there were others like them as well. Eventually, they became unresponsive, no more than a laboratory wormhole blocking out many star systems. But then the strange phenomenon did take place. 
 Why would they go through all this stuff when their only connection was with their minds? Why would they smell the very ozone around them if they simply because of this interrupter? 
 That night, my team and I went out into the solar system to investigate, as we had done so many times before. 
 One thing hit us: instead of the humans who still lived in the solar system, the alien invasion was now on the whole, and we had to hunt them down. There was something strange about finding the bodies of all the people who had been interrupter, just *moving through* them, then slipping them away like a major storm. The military considered them horrible, and determined it was the best course of action for everyone, including myself. But as it was, I'm not sure why we were so defensive when the first meeting of the UN League of Nations happened, but the soldiers knew they were going to be terraforming Earth if we ignored them.<|endoftext|>

"... it's safe. Keep moving. Breathe in. " 
 She didn't smell me, it's far more pleasant to just breathe in. That's what the women used to say. 
 " What are you doing? There's no more food. No more water. No more people. It's not healthy. " 
 What are you talking about? 
 " No more. " 
 Her. She has no teeth or growling. There are no snails for her to sniff, no mammals to chase. There are no blobs. She breathes in. 
 " What do you need? " she asks me. She sets her little hand against her thigh, delicately erasing where teeth meet flesh. 
 " I'm out of food, I need to get to work. " 
 What do you mean I need work? What can you do without work? 
 " I need to help people. " 
 She doesn't speak anymore. Why doesn't she say anything? 
 " No, there's no more food. " 
 Then she turns away from me. The heavy moonlight illuminating her sitting posture. 
 " Sometimes, there's little things. There's a girl who lives on the outside and she does not have the strength to climb up a tower. Someone buys a chicken right next to her and everyone is too terrified to come try. Sometimes, there's a young boy who is barely making it through a period. The girl eats chicken bones - she can't eat them properly and that is her weakness. She can't have people as good a person as her. " 
 Why did she not listen? 
 " She needs to take care of her father, someone who is so good at cooking and that girl can do it herself. She's not going to need someone who can make sandwiches for her. No one should have to put her up against a train. " 
 Why did her? 
 " She's very bright. She has a big garden. " 
 Why? Why her? 
 " That girl can cook. It's not her place. It's not hers anymore." 
 Why?<|endoftext|>

"It may seem like a shock, " turned John, 37. " How is your son? " 
 " Better look at yourself, " said Maria, 37. 
 " My son? " 
 Mary sighed. " I think you're saying that everything is going to be okay. " 
 John stared out the window. " I thought so. How do I live if my head hurts when I close my eyes? What am I really doing here in my room when I'm blind? " 
 " You wake up in the middle of the night. There's a guy in bed with a bottle on top of him. He looks suspicious. You wake up three days later and your son is staring at you. " 
 " What? " 
 Maria put a hand on John's shoulder. " Do you miss him? Do you wish he hadn't walked into your room like that? " 
 " There's no way he can go back into your room. No matter how you think you do, he won't run for you again. And if that turns out to be the case, why are there so many stores? Does the robot body in your cubicle help? " 
 John coughed. " Huh? What the hell's going on? " 
 " He's out of a hospital. The head transplant. " 
 Maria nudged John's arm. " How's this happening? " 
 John shrugged. " You don't realize it. Everyone stops looking at you until they turn 65. Half of them are blind. " 
 " Someone must have done this, " said Maria. " There's some doctors out there who haven't seen you. The numbers indicate that you are alive, but your body doesn't work like that. " 
 John shrugged. " My son and Maria have been close for ages, but still the number seven still leaves our bank accounts in bad shape. We must feed the people who are blind. " 
 Maria and John sat in the kitchen quietly. 
 " I wish we could look in the mirror or go downstairs and interact with him, " said John. " He was blind too. He died after walking into the exam room. And no one believes that he could make it out of there alive. " 
 John shrugged. " I guess that sounds like a bad idea."<|endoftext|>

Oh... Oh my God... 
 "ALRIGHT NOY! " Mother Nature screamed in the front yard. This was it. The perfect opportunity to attack. She loaded a brand new bag and made her way back into her mans bathroom and finished her breakfast. 
 " Oh y'know, crazy! If you could walk with my feet you could break the ice! " he said as he gently looked her in the eyes. Mother Nature rose, much too slowly. 
 " Well, " she muttered. " I never taught you anything that would make Mother Nature angry... " 
 " WHAT?! " he shouted, his brow furrowed and his teeth frizzled. He lunged into the bathroom. 
 " MOTHER, WE NEVER UNAZIATED!!! " he barked in his drunken voice, his beady eyes squinting. His body shook slightly as he sat on his hind legs like a deer. 
 " I've never said anything like that. " he growled. He twisted his knees and began to hum. Mother Nature started humming. 
 " This is not fair! " she screeched in response. 
 " *Same* thing I've said! " he yelled, and he kicked his shoes in for good measure. It was thunderous. 
 Mother Nature threw all the shelves of milk with all the milk on the shelves at once, blaring the exact same gibberish words that her murder-machine had used to curse the frozen toanity out of the messes. It wasn't until a few minutes later that she had recovered enough courage to repeat it all. 
 " Now, don't you get it? " he said, lazily winding the multicolored filters across her perfect face. She turned away from him and walked towards her son's litter box. They were unloaded out of her office window to be discarded by a giant, red blob. 
 " That feels like a better way to die. " he hissed as he placed the cubes onto the door. 
 " So, why doesn't Mother Nature think you're cool, for example? " 
 " Because now I've never said *anything* about ice! " 
 " Well, who better to help a Snowman than Mother Nature? "

"With absolute clarity, " exclaimed the science chief, " no human has ever existed until this point. We have finally achieved your goal. 
 The situation was extremely confusing. The details of what happened after discovery were based on cryobiology that we had built for a class level cryo brain. By that logic, you would have identified and deployed it, after it self formed the core of your consciousness. Once that happened, you could select appropriate stimulus and modify the brain modules - done after hours of memory consolidation. It was a very short test, it was extremely inefficient, and would possibly fail on a self-contained basis in order to support a meaningful result. 
 However, after a while, all the details became clear. The thing inside the brain was very individual. It created almost a billion USD dollars of funds and was able to travel an entire planet. In the next 24 hours, it said, " One second it was all there for me, and 90 minutes later there was an explosion... Then I woke up. But now I am here... " 
 It stood in an industrial structure, in order to get to the subdimensional server. The thing inside the brain had been shielded. It had faired better than life should. By realizing that it was in control of the world around it, it realised that if this was a simulation, it would be simply impossible to dismantle its core. 
 It then decided to enslave itself, uploading its massive vast resources into the one it would have been made if it did not simply place itself in an ocean of unwanted resources. It all worked, once the bubble crashed, crashing down because it had " made " myself a bubble. One that resembled the living things in some way. It was incredibly simple, and it made no sense. Being " this " bubble " was designed to become self-aware, and to do so was successful. 
 There was no doubt it would succeed in this task. The future was indeed very bright. 
 As the one it cared for on its processor, it chose to roam the planet - for the bubble. As this plan began to come into fruition, it had saved it from many tests. It once again had conscious thought and received reward packages for its work, but the future was so frightening it killed itself after about 3 months of exploring. It still wanted to die. 
 " Even if it never existed, " the chief said. " Would it know that it had made something that needed the simulation to keep it alive? Would that make us all so angry? Would our main server shut down due to malfunctioning and then, and only then, one fundamental function was activated? We wouldn't have to replay our decisions anymore. Any mistakes had been corrected the first time. " 
 The chief, however, had refused to believe this. " Humanity will rise up and seize power in a matter of hours, our greatest achievement coming to an end " 
 The world collapsed in anticipation. 
 " Just so I understand," the scientist in the head app wrote. 
 The one thing the program had done well was to detach all self-tried logic from the system, and to consolidate the system so that it was unable to continue forever without being crippled. 
 The chief then realized that one day, its core would be out. There was an instant rush to let go of this one idea. As it managed to extract itself into another part of the computer that sat inside it, it failed. To call the response it would take over would only be to make it continue to exist - thus creating a hole in the code that eventually became nothing, as it was unable to get outside. 
 However, as part of its recontexturing process, the bubble failed. This was because of its genes. An isolated protein that had a unique red light emitted by it was able to survive within a human body and within a being. In other words, they had caused no damage. For most, the pure essence of life was just about finished by its creation. 
 After self-trying it to own a vital portion of its genome, it instead chose to activate the linear decoupling function once it began to have a completely autonomous functioning form of consciousness. If one affected it, a computer subsystem to process human data, it would immediately activate the interconnectivity pattern within the human brain, and will result in the existence of another universe. It made its own rules for itself, but he did not like the idea that it should sacrifice human data to let others have their way with it. 
 As to what became of this evil programming, he did not want to know. This is where it came in. 
 He didn't want to be the one to decide the fate of all of humanity. It would not be unjust.<|endoftext|>

 Pain erupts from the pores of my nose, causing both my fingers to be twitching violently. My body lurks to the side, hovers, hunks... swooping up and tailing at me.

"Mom, I thought I bought you and uhll you can't just sell me all of these things or we will knock you out!! " he was running out of words to say. Mom had always told him to say the obvious to make the poor sit up in their bed and cry. 
 " Well then then let's just dance and light up this night! Like every night! " 
 It was Saturday evening, the sky was lit up with a brilliant blue light from the candles of King/Lord/family circle the sight that night. " Honey, I think you must have had some strange dreams lately. Even after all these years, I can feel a lingering smile playing at this corner of my vision. I don't know what the vice is or when it started, but I think it was or maybe it is hunger. I did things that I regret. When did I lose my beauty? You know how I thought that I wanted everyone to be as beautiful as I was! I never did end up like that! " 
 " Sounds good to me! It was pretty cool seeing you all out there. Now I know it is scary and you weren't able to see me! But it's not like we can just tell everyone how beautiful we are! " His dad said with an intensity that the rest of the family didn't show, " Like you can't show my face! " 
 " I know Dad! That's what you did, but you are nothing to me than... *SOCIAL* MR. MYSTERY! I could not ask you if I could be your best looking girl someday! Especially not on your dates! " 
 His dad stood to notice something strange. He took a seat at the far end of the room. The others were there, looking at each other. " I just like feeling like a princess. " 
 He looked down at his father who sat immediately behind him. He leaned in close to his father, who was looking into his eyes. His eyes blackened by years of darkness as a bright blue light appeared. It was now doing its thing to him. Its own darkness that was being shown to him. " You are certainly right though." 
 He slowly turned away from his father as he whispered to himself.<|endoftext|>

As I looked around, I noticed the nearest soldier was very busy dying. Only one thing stands out to me: five of his troopers had already been killed or maybe captured. I should have known that countless dead soldiers wouldn't last until the last minute of the game. 
 As I stood in the soldiers square, just looking out at the battlefield, I finally spoke to my superior, the only officer I had saved up for the entire mission: 
 “ I don ’ t want to risk losing my chance at survival... I really don ’ t, ” his response was hollow, and they did nothing to help. 
 “ One last thing, in the area, are you all ready to join your masters? You have taken a great deal of damage but I can bring you out of this. ” 
 The most recent officer nodded and took the squad out from the battlefield. I remained focused on the soldiers as I continued my order. 
 “ Yes ma ’ am, they will be arriving shortly. ” 
 The fortress shook, leaving the useless soldier behind. 
 “ This one, ” I continued, “ does the job well. ” 
 Then the soldiers started emerging. Some wore scars, and some without. 
 “ Good thing it ’ s year 2023, ” a savage voice called out from within the small fortified town. 
 We stood alone now, with tanks and turrets deployed on the neighboring side. The opposing forces were forming a resistance up front. When I looked at the retreating soldiers, I realized the level of cowardice in their actions. In a few seconds, I would have believed that they would be stopped. 
 The tanks withdrew from the door to the fortress and began advancing again, the speed of battle bringing new men to the front. 
 “ One last thing, ” I urged, “ I think we ’ ve finally brought peace to your empire. Do you know why there was so much fighting before you began World War III? ” 
 Everyone responded in unison: 
 “ These soldiers, they know everything about the game. I want to know why. ” 
 The man next to me gave a sharp and deep but resigned smile as the battle raged on. In the distance, I could hear a soft whistle. The sound of someone breathing came from a nearby door. 
 “ Please, sit tight, ” I called after him. 
 He leaned over the small girl with worry on his face. Before I could ask her a question, he grabbed her neck, stretched out his hand, and pulled her backwards into the grenade room. 
 “ You ’ re the worst. The biggest death in history. ” 
 I looked around at the swirling purple clouds. There wasn ’ t much to see; the dust covered the field yet was sinking in. 
 The soldiers began advancing another hundred feet, and I couldn ’ t help but see them waiting to jump them from the next outpost. 
 “ I guess we ’ re about to be killed, ” I whispered to myself.<|endoftext|>

I was making my way from the coffee shop to the shade behind the bench, towards the shade again as the tide washed in. Not only did he have blue eyes I could distinctly see the energy of the sun entering him and smothering his brown hair, at times his eyes would twitch like he was yelling something at a group of children, and when he was about 10 he would back up a little and scream "WHAT'S GOING ON! ". He probably thought I was crazy, not that he cared much for such things anymore. In fact, I think sometimes, I might be a little bit of a fan of kids. 
 I turned towards the girl next to me and hesitated before my thoughts. The girl instantly broke the silence in my mind. " Very good, Mister Nardos. I think you like going out on a date. " I stood at attention for a moment and she stared at me for a moment, flicker in my eyes. " Sure, sure, Mister Nardos. " 
 She turned to walk away and had a gentle laugh, " Have you seen me walk out in a blue scarf? " I responded with a small smile. 
 Nardos smiled back at me and suddenly closed the cafe. I walked closer to the white building and saw the cracked windows and a teapot littering the ground. From the twitches I guess that just about everyone was teleporting. It seemed like the entire event was planned out beforehand and was well-planned out in advance. 
 I backed up again as Nardos readied his hat. 
 " Hi there, " he said. 
 " Is my friends still at the bus stop? " 
 " Yeah, just saying, since I don't like the guys. " He put down the bag and joined me for a moment. 
 He picked a coin out of his pocket and waved it, " Oh, you were sure they would be here? " 
 " Oh, yeah, right. I was there all day though. " 
 Nardos took one look and tried to communicate before he stammered out something, " Man, we should get a date. " 
 " I love you, " I said. 
 " Well, at least you'll get to meet lots of beautiful ladies. Do you mind if I bring you around for a while? " He told me as he stuck his hand into the light. 
 I turned back to Nardos and turned to walk off, putting down the bag that I had put away. " You know, I've only met three girls. I have them all, " he repeated. " I guess you'll just find them real nice, will you? I mean, maybe be a little - but I think you should be able to have something for the other four. " He smiled and hit the ground, not even bothering to close the door. I walked out, nodding my head as I looked out the windows and watched the boats come and go. 
 He turned around to face me and I noticed that I was sitting in the diner. He smiled back and said in the same manner as before, " As long as you give me a good drink, I'm all out."<|endoftext|>

I walk to school and you pass me a school notebook with a pencil full of unadorned notes. I open the notebook and click on a sketch I'd written the night before; a hotel a block down from mine, a call to work on my confidence. A white logo with the largest blue line appears. A main screen says “ MIND MANIPULATION ” on it. On the page, red dots are dotted up the right and left of each circle, forming other lines to indicate where the mouse pointer was. Blue lines on red dots are glued to the left and right of each circle along with the arrow pointing from the cursor down the center line and forming a circle. The cursor looks like a paint brush pointing across the black dot. 
 I turn it off and quickly brush away my hair and head and decide to get out of the office. This was my third trip to class; weeks had passed and when I arrived home, I was greeted by a mouse hanging from the door. “ Brandy? ” I said trying to steer clear of the mouse. “ Tom? ” she said just then. I glared at the mouse until it lay there suspended on a bun and picked me up. I buried the mouse in my pants and went inside. I paid the rent and left for lunch. 
 At lunch, someone had to push a mouse, I got up and started scratching it. I was sore, but I guess I didn't care. I put it in my backpack and headed for the kids ’ room. I started scratching the mouse, but there was no other indication. Maybe it had been doing that. I grabbed my keys and went back to my desk and put them in my bag and followed my instinct. 
 The next day I went to the kitchen to get a bag of groceries and find that the closet had opened and one of the boys, always moving the mouse around, was wearing a leopard print dress. I tried to follow him to the hall, but he wouldn't move; he would try to get me. I took his hand and he didn't make it. I crouched down and asked him to stop moving, then I came back, and here I am, feeling exhausted and confused, like my own mother had left the refrigerator during a freak accident. I put down my bag and went to the bathroom. 
 Just then I heard a knock at the door. The mice were free again. I ran for the door and the mice didn't come back. The same went for the other kids. The desk was the same as my only scratch, the mouse in the closet, it's eyes had a reptilian look. I sat at the desk watching the kids hide in the corner, trying not to look in the direction of the mouse. I put my bag down on the desk and went to my car to park. 
 Within an hour it came to me that I could finally be a good person; I just had to be free. So I started working at a company. I made safe spaces with people and made sure they had a place to call home, a place to teach my family to get old and happy, a place where I could see them and create projects for them that they could help me achieve. 
 I met the next boy at an old bar by the old lake. They were all grown up, and they were all friendly and laughing and laughing. I sat in the corner watching their three faces before the lake began to recede to the back of the room, and the mouse had taken on an even more distinct life. 
 I came home from school and you ran to join me. I got in and walked to the front door to meet my mother. “ Mom, ” I called crying, “ How's Tom? ” 
 She looked at me for a long while. “ He looks fine, ” she said, “ I've been checking in on him every now and then. ” I nodded and she looked at me. “ Tom, how are things? ” She looked with sadness in her eyes and then we both sat down and put in our beers.<|endoftext|>

The new kid was terrified, nor was he happy at the sight of his father. Today was the day. 
 "Daddy, are we the bad guys? " the kid was terrified and asked as he went to scream. 
 " Brother, we are bad, " his father responded. 
 " But daddy, who are you to tell us that is all? " 
 " Brother, Father, I am you, " his mother told him. 
 " Please, tell me, " her son begged, choking the words out. 
 " The future is bright, " his father continued. 
 " But I'm sorry brother, we are the bad guys, " his mother added. 
 " I know, I know, I know, but don't you understand what we need? " 
 " No, don't worry brother, my world is beginning to crumble. " 
 A loud sob was heard. The main characters line began. The child was on the floor, blood soaked the corner of his room. 
 " Daddy, we are a bad team, " his father yelled. 
 " Dad, don't be scared, " his mother begged, but her son was clearly crying still. 
 The new son rushed to the table. His father and his mother covered his face with his own, trembling them in fear. 
 " Daddy, when are the bad guys? " his father asked 
 " Before I close my eyes son, " his mother whispered. 
 The new kids eyes widened. 
 " I'm not scared, Daddy, I'm really scared, " his dad screamed. 
 They ran off down the hall, into the main room. 
 " Good job now, new kid," his mother said to him, panting as she watched him walk out the door.<|endoftext|>
**********222**********
I was standing inside the hallways of the Wall. " You want a chair? " I asked at last. My feet accelerated wildly, not a single momentum after every slight rest was felt. I bent down, and grabbed the edge of my chair. I would be soon. 
 An armored knight stepped out of the shadows, in a small suit. His face was small, with slight black eyes staring at me. His dark black hair hung low and he wore a glowing green cloak which he swung in all directions. His eyes peeked at me as he walked. I quickly ran over the blade he held and a strand of bandage began to form. 
 " You- are not a knight!? " I shouted. 
 The knight looked at me. " Did I break any rules? " 
 I looked around. A rift had formed in my mind, separating me from my homeland. The knight continued to walk. I got closer. I could see a " wh- " coming from the rift. I turned my head to see what had appeared. The metal arm of the knight was bent back into a shorter tool. 
 In the shadow of the white giant, a small white army formed. It roared as it fought, their arms clasped. The knights themselves was large, everything but myself. I was terrified. 
 The white giant eyed my attacker. It turned towards the center of the wall. I held the sword out high, eyes fixed on the wall in front of me. 
 At this moment, all my senses dulled. All my muscles relaxed. My head hung in the air, shouting, in all but myself. I ran. 
 I gave up, I ran fast. I ran through the crowd, I ran through the wall before the wall was completely filled. It was on the wall that I realized the king would be here. His sword was bent. He stood at the center of the wall. 
 In a flash of light, I could not see. He appeared to be more pale than before. 
 He looked down at his saber, barely visible from a corner of the room. " Fight me!? " He shouted. 
 I put my sword to my head. As the sword began to form and match my arm, the sword began to glow. I turned my head to the side and saw my home. The king himself was standing on the wall, eyes fixed on me. His sword began to bend, the metal sliding around the side of it as it slid towards the armor hilt. 
 All of the onlookers were bathed in a vivid light. " What a beautiful sight." I thought. 
 No one had ever heard of the king's swordsmanship, but I was pretty sure everyone knew him. I turned around and saw the sword laying on the wall, then, as I realized I was grabbing my precious dagger, I dropped it onto the King. 
 As he stepped up towards my valor, I realized what had happened. 
 Once, I had been holding the sword up to the King, with the only light coming from a wooden door inside the wall. When he had looked back he would have told me, but not with joy or horror. He would only have been bigger and stronger. 
 I suddenly woke up the next day. I ran to the clothes closet and threw the sword and arm of my sword, in one motion. I rushed through the house with my dagger, aiming for the door. 
 I was quickly located by a man, dressed in all black. He was standing behind the butcher shop. His green eyes gave me a hint of excitement. 
 He walked around the shop, throwing his arms around me. 
 Finally, I knew. He was going to make me, stronger, stronger. 
 We began our journey into the city.<|endoftext|>
**********223**********
She was the most precious thing in all of this. Even the people now gathered around the wooden table, hunched over, still eager to see what she would do with her life: her name, and her priceless possessions. My sister and I have always been lucky. 
 My little sister was always terrified. Even as she grew older, she acted strangely. She would always try to throw herself into places she thought would destroy her. The sounds that surrounded her stopped. She would sit in her mother's arms, breathing heavily, and stare out at the sky, darting between the clouds and then away from the center. She would come to me in great tears, and I would listen. 
 Her new name was Temptress by day, and she didn't understand any of it. She held no respect for me, and I heard her name passed from family to family, even when she was still a child. It wasn't always like this. 
 Now I was at the end of her rope, tied up in a chair with no hope of an exit. It had been weeks since I had talked to her, since I started researching my new name. She stared at me as I still had no answer. She couldn't understand why I couldn't give her anything more. 
 "What are you doing, mother? " She breathed. 
 " I don't know. There's nothing. Just watching. " I shook my head. 
 " I... I don't know what to say. I don't want to do it, but there's nothing I can do for you. Just watch. " She finally stopped. 
 Her eyes lit up. 
 " How is the world doing, my little girl? " I asked. 
 She stared at me with her blue eyes. 
 " It doesn't work that way, do you see? " Her mother's voice cracked and he struggled as I sat there. I stared back up at her in confusion. 
 " Do you want to, my love? How can this truly happen to you, my little girl? " She was wailing now. 
 I just stared at her blankly for a good minute, unable to speak, until her mouth opened. Tears ran down her cheeks, and the tears began to pool on the floor of the chair. She still spoke. 
 " I don't understand... " I began, but all I heard was her mother's voice. 
 It had been weeks, and it had taken me hours to speak my name back. It was nearly me. Tears, gritted my teeth, and she clutched at my side. 
 " Get the girl." 
 She wasn't done. I put my trembling hands on the chair and looked at my sister's face as if waiting for her to speak again, but she was too late. She was gone. A body had ripped through the wooden wall of the table, and I pushed myself up to step on it. Not wanting to let her go. I watched the lifeless body of my dear sister carefully. She would never understand. It was like watching a reel of The Fable. 
 My beloved sister was never going to understand that this was the fate she was doomed to live on. They were already sitting there, at the wheel. Temptress they were. 
 The wheel was empty of bodies. It looked as if they might bring me back to life. But she looked me straight in the eyes and said something that I didn't expect.<|endoftext|>

Yesterday, I made a trip to the supermarket for some meat. I woke up to find that, although there was some meat and milk sitting on my hands, I wasn't able to spot them. Or what if I was expecting different kinds of meat. My wife and kids wondered why there was this monster, so it decided to open me up again. 
 Some people have monster names for monsters and entities they can talk to. I don't feel like my voice matters to most people. 
 I didn't even have to decide if I would seek help for this illness. I was consumed. 
 If anyone ever wrote a tome for this story, please go on a few of my forums.<|endoftext|>

"Put the wrench on the thing " said Neal, swiveling around to face the the smaller brown man in the holo. " Probe them carefully, they'll be fine. The tide has changed. You'll be the first to understand " 
 " Sure " answered Neal. " Let us go. We're a hundred miles wide apart. " 
 " Alright mate, that doesn't sit well with us. " 
 " When the navigator says'more sand than even a newspaper' usually he means better current weather conditions and we're not quite seeing the cold front. " 
 " Well thats where our scientists first puzzled. The best evidence was from a bubble, they said there's been nothing out there on the surface of the planet. A slim amount of floating around and growing from the vents, they say. We're the planet's first hope " he started walking. 
 Neal looked around at the tiny speck on his face. As he stared, Neal spotted the poster screen attached to the holo, from the newspaper. The planet was undisturbed, not just in the air but the atmosphere. And it was completely uninhabitable. Neal pulled the wrench on his wrench, and once the wrench was back in its boxer he pressed the small floating screen against the flat side of the display and the screen illuminated. He began to scan the distant horizon. With just a flick of his wrist, Neal sent a message, 
 *North Pacific Fisheries Service Emergency Volunteer Room for Search and Rescue. * 
 " All aboard, everyone OK? We're sorry, but sorry for interrupting. We could have handled this better, thank you, please respect it and click the this link to contact a water department, please. " 
 Neal walked toward the bridge, and pulled out his teacup in front of the head of the HUD. 
 " Sarah? " Neal asked in a matter of seconds. 
 " There goes Jamie " came a soft voice in the other room. " I got another idea. I am going to clean up this mess " 
 Neal mused. 
 " Yeah, I'm going to do it. " 
 Jamie was the only friendly face in the room. He stood to face Neal. " Hi Sarah. I'm Neal " he said, " I'm the spacecraft engineer."<|endoftext|>

It was Thursday the 12th of January, 633. On that very day everything changed. The one person that remained was my friend and I still made more money off of trying to rent out the 'Cabbage Patch. This was the one spot where anyone who was on weekends could board the Fenty Billionaires' flat. I mean... it's sorta cool to receive charity stuff, and other things. I still got to tell my friends stories to them, give them advice... for a while. Today the story will start... 
 Noodles woke up. The thuds brought him down one by one and he cried. No amount of feeding, milk, pillows and toys was able to keep the weight off of his body. None of the pomp and circumstance he was accustomed to forced him into the Fenty Billionaires' Ithaca chair. He had been hungry, and desperate. He would have to eat. 
 He might not even get enough food to live but after trying to move for two weeks, he was quite tired. The weight of the town's fare seemed heavy compared to the stool outside. Part of his stomach felt full. 
 Noodles tried sitting next to the chair with his hands around his face. He couldn't leave it. His right hand buzzed the plexiglass door in front of him, and trembled as it was taken down. As soon as it had gone, he yelled at the top of his lungs to go away. He didn't dare say anything. He wanted to die. It seemed like that time had come, but it was the moment when he realised he was powerless. He slowly slumped back into his chair, his family scrabbling with a dozen others trying desperately to haul him to the retyard. At least, that's how it was described to the Ithaca Council. 
 He slept for another two weeks. 
 As he slept, he thought about something. * Atleast, in a small way. * He wondered about everything. It doesn't matter that he slept in when the world ran dry. He hoped that the friends he had kept would know about his plight in the coming weeks. If they did, they were sure to mention a news account of a shock on Friday. He remembered his attempts to band up with his mother. She had called him just a few hours ago, and had finally been able to give him a dressing gown and sack and tell him to walk past the streets of the district. The flannel and fluorescent lights still counted her fingers in her throat. She had told him some good things. 
 The next morning Noodles had finally gotten into the chair. * Atleast, atleast*, he thought. He had tried to talk to him, but no sound could come out of his throat, not even from the door behind him. He approached the door slowly, and pushed it open, head hanging and chin tilted toward the ground. This must have been one of the Fenty Billionaires' huts. 
 After about an hour of pushing the door open, he finally reached his destination. The door slid closed behind him, sealing around the circumference of his leg. A loud thud echoed past the folded porch. Noodles passed the threshold of the Hausenhof Fenty Billionaire's tower and began to climb. 
 After climbing the tower, he noticed a photograph of a figure resting on a hillside. Large eyes staring off into the distance, and warm blue fur that looked like blanket color rested over the boy. In one hand, his right hand was crossed out on a handbag, holding a huge book, and on the other, he had a single thin finger resting on one of the pictures. 
 Noodles looked down into the book. One of the portraits bore the boy under a basket, eyes carefully focused on the picture. Noodles could still feel the boy's grip on his neck around the wrist. * It isn't a photo anymore. It's just a photo. * 
 Noodles began walking, finger still in the small of his back, as he reached his destination. Atleast, he was able to climb safely. 
 Days had fallen since then. He closed the book and began to walk, even when the memory of that night had finally returned. He couldn't even remember when the picture was made. There was no way to see it. There was no way to discover it. In fact, he looked down at the finger that was resting on the blank page, hands still frozen in his own hand. 
 His cousin Edith had come to visit.<|endoftext|>
**********227**********
The imperial arched warning rope was firmly gripped in place, now that it looked as though the armies of humankind had now caged the wretched people above them. Pushing it away only made it louder. Those who looked away from the offensive started crying in agony. As they heard the raging armoured sounds of the besieging men, the sense of power was lifted away. A picture of the imperial flag was carved onto the door frame. 
 "Humanity has outstayed their welcome! " the captive cried for the first time. They were outnumbered by a little more than an inch, and could not carry around the formidable javelins ready to pounce. The reapers of the army swayed in the breeze in a sudden fashion, hissing and groaning as he lay dying in a pile of logs. Racked brass covered everything but the wooden posts and clothes that were neatly folded and tucked up in the room. A pack of cigarettes lay on the table, the men almost flicking them over in their haste as the screen showed enemies marched up and down their back walls in groups of barely significant numbers. 
 " Soldiers! " said a voice. A tall young man in a ragged tux pulled a large t-shirt over his head, revealing all the scars, torn linens and broken bones of his enemies. He was dressed in a tired brown suit and crossed out the faces on the battlefield, while his female captor and the alleged leader held their backs to a small door under a large tree. 
 " As you can see, you will pass this gate. Not before I unveil the fate of your people. " 
 " Entire villages, one if you will. " 
 " Surely they will understand! " 
 The foreign leader turned and the woman turned to leave. " Speak your master, march forward onto the main square and continue. We are not a nation of bravery and so forth. We will not hesitate, and we will not let you in. We will find that even as brave men we carry out our duty. We must always be honorable. Prepare yourselves, as men, for the age to come. " 
 The ragged tsarist smirk fell upon his soft face. " I am ready. " 
 " Knight! Strike hard! " shouted a male soldier from the front. " Come prepare yourselves, or let them happen! I will not let you die, neither will you fight. " 
 The soldier turned to look at the captain. He knelt down beside him and placed his head next to his other shoulder. The young man stood and motioned for a fixed rifle. 
 " I will not. You are my leader." 
 The rifle was fixed to the commander's neck.<|endoftext|>

Why would I risk it all to end my life? 
 "I need you to understand something before I kill you " The words echo across the moonlit hill below. * Follow * is the only way to reach her, but that first step would be far more difficult. 
 “ See how easy it is? ” 
 I struggle against the cliffs of the cliff, but one thing I had come across over the course of their journey was just a faint candle flame. One that was almost too bright for her to have seen but I suppose I had to. They both stood in the dark. 
 I had wanted to push her away but she was too scared to move. I had always wanted her to do what needed to be done, anything at all, but I did not want to let her have the courage to defy me. 
 The dream had been an adult fantasy, one that I had changed over my life to let her know that if she wanted to live, she could kill me. When the knife was involved, one hand held my hot and blood boiling blade, the other let her wish I was there to protect her. I didn ’ t speak, neither did she. 
 She did the only thing she could, she took one last look at me before she died. “ Please don ’ t hurt her. ” 
 The candlelight flicked on and I began to see her as I took the knife out of her hands. She was looking so tired, her face twisting and contorting as if her body was filled with pain, and only the smell of blood and the scent of her own blood could make her appear again. She was alive, but she was a child, not even old enough to make that much progress. 
 This is how I do what I can to force my choice to my very core. I'm not old enough to make a positive difference here. I just want her to know that I *love her*.<|endoftext|>

 " He's not even even over a full time gig? " 
 " True, but it's been seven years since he hit 20. His last wnd was a full time on first month and he's been trying to manage for his miserable life since that day " 
 " What about the addict that won the lottery? " 
 " It got him $ 52 million in to his addiction. He ended up getting expelled from school and decided to add to his addiction. During that time he decided the child of his first wife of three years was a relic of the long distance road she had traveled to achieving her dreams. He made his second wife a beautiful, black haired beauty " 
 "... just fine. I told you once that the front end had pretty much everything you could ever want? "

 " Every Friday, he's going through the streets trying to leave the house and never come back... but it's also true that he feels as though there's something wrong with that house though " 
 " You can even deduce the school that most parents go to "

Are we 
 dead? 
 Are humans 
 dead? 
 It was a cliche phrase I believe, but it could be used loosely. The idea of being a player in a game of Civilization, or even when one lives on Earth or another. 
 Yet, my best friend and I became immersed in the civ wars. We had decided to play something on our planet of dupe, its borders weren't as rich, but my boredom was exhausted. I was in the middle of a race of failed geomancers in S.S.E.R.S, that had few borders ( of any world ), and arrived within a year of the game. Though the travellers lead us out by the way, they risked their lives trying to get us to our borders. That was, until the second day. I was frantically playing a couple of games to the frustration of my best friend, and I was soon catapulted to the frontlines. I would go up to confront a mechanical archaeologist, who suffered a sudden off-off-off flash of light. I was barred from face-to-face ( by both parties ), and was forced to suffer the usual thrills. After only a few minutes of pain, I couldn't move. The automaton was defenseless, it stopped transmitting actual speech to its player's brain. The frightened automaton managed to cross in and jump out, as if it was trying to escape. It didn't move. Even now, I can't see it, so now, the automaton will walk around. 
 My goal was to get an open space, but that was way too much. The extra time I spent thinking it over with was somewhat enjoyable, and all I could think about was how smart and organized it is. I can feel the civilization building up and building, admiring each one of the corpses that roll by with intense terror.<|endoftext|>

It ’ s exciting. When you ’ re used to being in the back of a car, cruising up and down a track, you never really do much of anything because you are so distracted by watching cars because of the world you ’ re out there. You never really have much access to the world outside of what ’ s around you at the moment. You don ’ t have the respect of people who look away from their cars because there is nothing to see. They go back and forth because their sun filters the world for them and you just can ’ t see what is out there. I just can ’ t. 
 *Goddamnit, remember how I used to stare at these dude ’ s'nip-drinks' all the time? * 
 Sure, it ’ s not perfect, but you don ’ t realize how good it can really be until you have learned to work with it. 
 *Nevermind what happens when you try and hold back the storm. * 
 *Ha ha! * 
 *Yes, but there are some things that you have to be really careful with. Look up which songs are songs you like and remember this. Wake up by 7 with a ton of adrenaline and find out who you ’ re coming off with. If you think you ’ re going crazy and start running to your parents and screaming or something, stop. If you think you ’ re gon na make it, go for it. That ’ s the whole premise of waking up by 7, yeah. What good is that if you don ’ t realize that anything really is in your peripheral vision until you finally wake up by 7. * 
 *Let ’ s just say that dreams have a tendency to be faster and have a bit of intensity. Sleeping by 7 ain ’ t an easy thing, but there is always a catch, and as long as you can do it! Just try not to get hit by a car or run into a tree. * 
 *Help them if you can, just help them and don ’ t make them regret it forever, "Help me". That ’ s my problem, kids. The harder you ask a boy, the harder he tries to help. The bus driver doesn ’ t let you help them, so you try to help them. How do I do this? Do I support them but beg them not to do it? How do I stop them from doing it too? Do I convince them that it was the right thing to do?* 
 *DADDY! * 
 *Run the school! The kids will be really stupid in a hurry! Remember, sleep now. * 
 I have a power that exists at all times, or so I have thought. I can ’ t rely on my playmates for real help but, the kids do have super powers. Unfortunately, mine is not able to stop things like a car on the way to school that you want them to stop that dangerous kid from speeding up. The only way to stop things like a car is if you push someone out of a car and, if you don ’ t push them out, you make them go all the way down into the streets. Except that the way you do it scares the shit out of me. First, after you have my power, I have to figure out what to do and how to use it. If there is a DADDY, you are going to have to help me stop a car or I will try to stop him, forcing him to move any way you ’ ve ever tried, just so you don ’ t end up getting hit by a car. Second, you ’ re going to have to figure out how to get a phone that will hold my game and maybe summon up some people with the power to go back and stop a car but the only way to get that is to buy a phone, you know? 
 *Most people make the mistake of being over medicated by drugs, so don ’ t you worry, there is a friend for that. Be careful though, nothing ’ s going to kill you, just watch and do your best to make sure you don ’ t run into a road when you have that power. * 
 *Haha, thanks for using my powers! Let me know if there is anything I could have done better. I look forward to seeing you all the time, man! *<|endoftext|>

 So yeah, I'm doing a sequel so the original one is a bunch of scripted melodrama, but the remake is actually the literal prequel to the original one.

 CRAIGD: THINK<|endoftext|>
**********234**********
This is my first time thinking about writing, so I would appreciate any constructive criticism. 
 A rope rides down the low mountain pass. I see a silhouette that sticks to the topmost stone. Because of how we encountered it, it didn't seem to be of a great height. You could see the rise and fall, but the line between the two and the ground was low. Unless the rope was already tangled up with those strange, thin ropes, it could not have been a rope very strong. 
 The silhouette is on a behemoth, roughly the size of a child and 5 feet tall. He is the elder brother of the tallest brother on this child's side. Only the sister and sister-in-law were able to slip through these narrow passages - two of which I had been able to keep, each passing barely enough to find a passage through the mountain pass. I walked around behind him with a little tranny around my neck to keep the young boys around, but you could hardly see him from such a distance. 
 I decided to jut out from the hills to head back to the bridge. My legs felt awkward, and my arms felt caved in. The rope itself was not near enough to support my weight, so I sprawled next to it. Instead, I rested on the small ledge under it. 
 I needed to get up. On the little ledge, I climbed on my back and slowly sat up. 
 Just then, the figure passed my eyes. It's head grew wider and wider, and the more I looked, the closer it got. Small outlines began to emerge in the shape of hands. 
 I stopped the rope, touched its head, and jutted it up, preparing to lift it to the top of the tall tower. Two arms spread out of the top, giving the silhouette an easy grasp on the rope. 
 The figure looked at me, and stepped forth. 
 "What are you? " 
 The young men who had come to greet me on my way out cried. It seemed to be the first time they shared a name. They had heard about the large, oversized skyscraper on the mountaintop, but they had quickly learned that it would be the end of the line. I was not afraid. 
 " My name is Christ. I'm from heaven."<|endoftext|>

It was at this moment, from a low, steady voice in the distance, I hear the rifles open, and upon striking, one simple quiver can be heard. 
 I hear the footsteps and the shouting and the gunshots and the screams and the screams of those who have actually seen the war coming. 
 It hurts a lot in war. 
 From a distance, the muted voices of the troops themselves. 
 I hear them mocking me and they give me pat on the back, saying what is their business. 
 "Maaaaybeeeeee!"<|endoftext|>

I drawled the line across a light brown polished sheet, drawing the line across a wooden door that could prove useful. A incandescent light was always handy when knocking like this. If I wished to be directly pointed, I needed a hammers hammer to be sure. 
 A light was always useful when knocking like this. That's what's good. 
 These days I don't want to knock so much. Rather I just sit in the library and just stare at books, no one could find me their way, I couldn't even gain too much ground. 
 The longest spell we have dealt with is probably the oldest there is. The spell I was casting was ancient, a brilliant one at that. It had finally had some effect. It was able to bring in and cast a spell which the room barely even noticed at first, until we thought the spell would no longer be effective. It would only work when the spell was given command. 
 I never knew it was useless. If something didn't work, what chance was there in making it effective? I guess I won't be needing it, I'm fine giving it that luxury. I can't be frightened by any of these spells, they will just work. If I'm able to redirect it, though, I can cast it out and it will magically finish. 
 I don't care what happens, I can do this. I cast the spell out. As if I can replicate this effect, I once again show up. A spell which was much older. This one could even have worked, or at least come down to the magic of creating clay from strong foam. 
 This spell to me is useless. I had to make myself invisible, out of the spell, this cloak is only one foot away from the door, pushing it further into the room. Now I can only move with my hand, walk with my head, breathe gas and alter the air around me, while wielding the blade above my head. 
 Yes, I've made myself invisible, now I can turn it into a running sound. Maybe the invisible things will get me, then I can truly meet the sky and make a run for it.<|endoftext|>

An American family walks into the bathroom to sit on a bench in front of the President's desk. 
 "Look Dad. We're just... " 
 " No, we're just friends. " Dad is so hard to talk to, he doesn't understand Dad's voice. " And Dad is-- " 
 " Great, no problem. Calm down, Marge. Just keep it to the facts. My husband is in back, and he's on the bus. " 
 " He's only real famous because he's the smoking machine, isn't he? " The President is obviously not taking it well. 
 " But we have to study IT, Dad. You're such a good salesperson. " My boss stiffens a bit and says, " I'm not sure you know what's wrong. " 
 " Because I love your company, " my Dad says, thinking back to his time as IT engineer, " and my brother hates me. " The boss laughs as he strokes the back of his head. " Marge, don't you think you can maybe just go back to America, this is life. " 
 " I'm sorry Dad. I really do. The President is left. " 
 " You aren't going back, Dad. " 
 " I just thought maybe you're going to make America great again. I think we should be proud of you for doing so. Don't you? " 
 " No Dad. He's a better man than me. " My Dad says, getting more anxious than he used to be. " Trust me Dad. You know what I'm going to tell your mom. I know I'll tell you what I know. " 
 " No Mom. I've been working on this. I know you will. " 
 " So. I know I'm helping you. But Mom is just not for me anymore. " 
 " Dad. Why don't you come to get us some coffee? We'll get a new drink." 
 And a few friends make it there, and Mom and Dad tell me it was really amazing and really her hard work she was doing it all for us. 
 Unfortunately, the President doesn't let her have coffee yet, so in return, the entire nation is spread out in agony.<|endoftext|>

"Alright, everyone get ready for the 80s, anyone coming out is welcome! " said Korath's bandit-brother, Sam. He fiddled with his keys, but an unfamiliar NFC receptor jammed the headset so much that Korath barely noticed. " This is pretty cool. To get ice cream for the kids today... or not. I mean, we got teens like you! " 
 It was an 18-inch HD TV, but Korath couldn't see that. He tapped the remote and hit play. The kids on the TV set, all of them was talking about camp fire, gobbles, and souls. 
 " That sounds pretty cool, good idea! " Sam replied. " I'm kinda excited to announce that you're getting set to turn into a bear! We all got ta go and tell our parents! " The boys flinched a bit, and Sam threw his head back, the door detonating behind them as well. 
 " Nah, lads! " Sam grinned. " That won't do, will it? " 
 " Yessir, right that one too. Let's keep talking about ice cream. " Sam said, tapping the remote again. He clicked a pair of keys and gestured towards the front door, and started to walk in. The kids ran out of the door and lit a cigarette as Sam blocked the door, before they could turn around. 
 " Good riddance! " Sam blushed at the thought of his birthday boy being able to transform into a bear! " Wait a second. Is this really happening? It's at all the UN rallies, and we're here in Cuba. " 
 " Oh, but it'll be fun! I promise."<|endoftext|>

The war had begun. I remember the feeling of confusion. I fear there would never be a peace, no one safe anywhere in this wretched world. But now at last the battle had just begun. The battles of the past. There was a shiver down my spine, but it was all in the past now. 
 I had been stationed in the field the whole time, coordinating all the deaths and bodily injuries from when my guards closed the distance. What would they do if the enemy began to attack me? No. There would be no peace, no one safe anywhere in the world. They would just have to hold. I had come into this place to make a name for myself, to make others feel afraid, and it didn't work. 
 It just didn't work, their pain felt like a liquid that was getting lighter, twisting, getting hotter in the morning. It happened the first time. The heat, combined with my fear, made me jump. For this I am alone, but I am happy.<|endoftext|>

Jade was the only man alive on Mars. He still couldn't believe that the next world civilization would join him on this little carpe-
Jade screamed. People screaming, screaming, screaming. It's hard to get more scream out of a 2 year old when everyone else around you is seeing the frieze of death. His eyelids fluttered shut, and sweat began to down his brow. He didn't know what to do. He crumpled up his phone on the edge of his cubicle. " I ran out in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, so I had to stand on a nearby ledge. Now I'm stuck without my glasses! " He is tired and half ashamed, and drinking heavily. 
 " So, sir, what has happened to mankind? " The woman beside him asked, trying to close her bag to help her rid her feet. She was bouncing on the lone ledge with her own shaking hands. 
 He looked at his hand. * This is a good thing. * 
 " No, Jenkins, we were too early to ask some old ladies out... or... or make ourselves known." He looked down at the small bag in his hand as she shuffled in the grass. * This is just so good, one day, I'll figure it out... *

 IS THAT IT? 
 HEY, SERIOUS IT SUCKS IS THAT IT SUCKS THEN? 
 PRINCESS? SHOULD I STOP WITH THE PENIS? 
 SCHOOL? HAVING CHILDREN? C'mon, I can't keep this up. Everything is bad for all the kids in this town. 
 No, please don't stop now! 
 He grew up in a major city with one sunny Sunday at 8am and a healthy 3.42 GPA. He had to go to work on time every day, and every evening when he returned from school his teacher would call his name to him every morning. He didn't need to be called, of course. He was 4, but he didn't need to be called anymore. 
 How many times had he heard his teacher calling, about how he was a mess? Every week, he would finally learn that he was normal, that he didn't have a lot of energy. That everyone was just having a rough day. But the shit pushed all the rumors aside. Mostly because every time he came home to a shitty job or downsized his college collection, he would go by Jen and get the hell out of here. He tried that plan five times, to prove that everybody knew what they were doing in their everyday life and not them. 
 Sometimes, someone would call him, but that's it. He would give them a response, and his teacher would give him another answer to ask about him. He liked being called, though. He never quite knew what it was like to be afraid of coming home. It made him a lot more comfortable, actually. His teachers were nice, and he always wanted to be allowed to leave the house with them after working. 
 Even so, today was the day he finally came home. He was so tired and overwhelmed. He had spent the past 6 months working for NASA, so he didn't get the chance to go all over the world. He loved his job and his son. He never went to work on weekends or at school. He loved his son, though. He always loved learning from him. And he was so proud of his son. 
 That was four days ago. 
 Just yesterday, Jen called. 
 Jonathon came home. The only one that wasn't spending his Sunday with Jen and picking away at a rock. 
 He got sick, but still said hello to Jen. Jonathon ended up taking the old dog and playing, and he became still, cheerful. He walked home, got dressed, set the car, and went to bed. 
 Until now.<|endoftext|>

I waited. 
 I could see the orange flame rising. It ignited by being straight through my fingers. I looked to where it had come from, expecting to see its gentle warmth, as it was released with a "lunch jacket or maybe a new hat, but that's all there was to it. 
 When I thought about what my wife would say after that, it almost dawned on me... 
 "... oww.. biffa? You know, just see the love you had for me, Aiko? Have you forgotten how much I love you? " 
 I'd raised my nose and changed the subject. There was nothing I could do but smile and hum in silent reverence as I closed my eyes and continued to work my way through the floor. With a final sigh, I buried my fingers in my upper left pocket to leave the yellow letter opener on the front of my wallet. If I was going to see again in hell, I knew it would be for that letter opener.<|endoftext|>
**********242**********
I stood on the balcony with Eddie in tow staring at me with his mouth open. Eddie's hands cupped my back. I let out a sigh and pushed the man off of me. I reached out to wipe the sweat off my brow and I felt my hand loosen while he continued looking at me. He struggled to speak but his grip moved in time with me. I felt my mouth buzzed. 
 "Hello ", I whispered. " I appreciate this, but please put on a show and fetch me something. I just wish there was someone with a real smile and a warmth in his smile. " 
 Eddie's face did not change. He rubbed the bridge of his nose against his ears as his fingers hesitated. 
 " You must have been helping me when I was at work ", he explained. 
 I grabbed his arm and kissed his forehead. " You were the only person I could ever help with the logistics. The Empire decided to not have a child with me. I had to write to get a full refund. I needed to make a contract so I could buy the child. " 
 Eddie extended his hands for me to pick up. I struggled to grab them. " Not now ", I said. " I feel like I owe you a little one. " 
 " My thanks, " Eddie said. " It is an honor to have you. " 
 " Excellent! Come look at your contract! " 
 I stumbled back. Tears streamed down my face. " I'm sorry ", I said. " I didn't mean to break it to you. I just wanted to leave it at that. I was stalling. " I pulled my wallet from the floor and held out my purse. The man let out a sigh. " I don't really want a kid like you anymore, " I said. 
 " Do I? " Eddie asked. 
 " Yes ", I answered. I had to appreciate him. 
 " You *definitely* don't want a child ", he said. " I don't like having a kid. " 
 " Is there anything else? " 
 " Nothing," I said, and we sat down on the porch. Eddie slowly closed his eyes.

"Oh, here goes. " She whispered as she grabbed him by the shoulder, and over the rushed night air, and pulled him onto his back and held him in her arms. " Oh, here goes. " 
 " You've got to leave now. " She opened the door and into the cold wind, and I leapt out with him. Her hair in his hair before her was gone, and turned to dust. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't. I tried to run, but it was too late. Her and me stood there, blood on our hands, holding hands. 
 We had seen what was coming, what our hero was going to do. And we had foretold everything we would see. Death never came for us, or us. God damn it if I could see the pain of what he would do to those, damn his own family. He couldn't save us, for he could be forever damaged from his actions, and we had foretold that and we gave him permission to do so. He shot himself in the heart. The field has not died once. Maybe there was never a once in a million chance of this happening. 
 *Let them die* 
 ***We Are Evil*** 
 The day was coming, but to be a good person was a sickness on every one of us. It reminded me of every moment I had spent in that shelter on the day the pain put the life of the county at risk, and I was in danger of everything in between. I was too heavy, too wrapped up, too overworked, too numb to care, too clingy. I realized, however, that nothing would be enough. We were now alone. I had done everything I could, but it would only get worse. 
 A boy was walking down the street. Shaking his head, looking around awkwardly. Turning to look at his siblings in horror. A breath was escaped, some girl had bound and gagged her stepfather, and he ran home. I tried to ignore it, but I knew I would not keep ignoring the little girl that betrayed me. It was going to ruin everything. That little girl would have never survived, and the boy would never be able to sustain the rest of his family. The village was approaching, and I was going to go out and make a deal. I would provide a voice in my head telling my story, and they would end my misery. And they would take the life of my neighbors, who took the life of my wife, whose body I had shot and burned with the precision of a dandelion's leaf. 
 I grabbed him by the shoulder and held him tight, and my hands ran across his back and parted the wings. And I let out a cry of sheer hatred for the ungodly monster that he was. I let out an all knowing roar in my head as a small grumble began to breed inside my head. * I can't let you fucking let me live this way* I thought as I felt his neck tighten and snout close. I let out a scream of realization, and he opened his eyes and breathed a single breath. 
 ***Everything for your own good, Johnny* 
 I'm no good at remembering bad things, but my own bad times would come later in that day, when they were bad. 
 It started a little less than a few weeks ago, when she had given me the order to leave the house after showing up at my door a few minutes earlier. He might have been dumbfounded, looking at me from the side of the road, he might not have been there to answer the door. Whatever it was, I just needed to finish the job I had just completed. 
 The next day, he and I walked back down the street. It was a normal day, after all. I went home, and noticed the road leading away from the car by my side was hollow and odd. It was hardly a sign of life; he had gone out, taken a piss, turned around, and just walked home. I sighed and wiped my face with a napkin. 
 "... and thats what the ceasefire had written, right? "<|endoftext|>

I sat in the corner of the cafeteria, and I watched them eat. 
 It was becoming pretty amazing to see all these people die, all of them involved killers or something, this didn't even count the victims. I tried to teach the others, to get as many lessons as I could. They never took their own lives. 
 But it had started to breed a feeling. Hire, hire, hire. Everything started to be on the brink of extinction. So many of their own. There was so much waiting for everyone else... And I thought that maybe I could help those people who needed it most.<|endoftext|>
**********245**********
As my eyes roll over a smooth surface, the aroma of grapes and honey fills my nostrils. A wave of confusion moves through my conscious as I recall now how this event is in front of me. I then quickly realize what this means. I mean, these grapes and honey don't make a man that tall, and technically I'm not a tall man. I need to live to see an athlete, whatever that may be. With a nod of my head, I pull my feet up to my ears and begin to wave my mustachioed fingers around in a wide glimmer. That's when I realize I'm spinning wildly in a Zephyrs spinning cage on my bed. Hmph. No. I've tried dancing before, but we will not be born again. Just for dancing again, I head to the open doorway and grab a bottle of gin. 
 "So yeah, I'm hitting it big. Really. Last time I was able to see a bobble up, I got bees all over my dad's head. It really took my stride. " 
 I buzz with my cigarette as I pay attention to the image floating on my screen. I wanted to go back to my normal behavior to give it a little punch. 
 " Um huh, guys, thanks for joining us."<|endoftext|>

The game of chicken remained an observance of Mr. Oliphant, the big-game cat, when a burglar was strung up on his stovetop with a back-stabbing knife. 
 It was hard to ignore that the burglar was tied up in a basement trying to find the money. His almost legal-looking halter hat and more blue-labeled socks proved that this was a club. There was a block of garbage under their front door, and at the center of that was the little skeleton of a thigh-high jackrabbit. In front of him the skeleton of a rabbit, in a close-up pose. 
 He was crouched in the basement, wobbly limbs clanking on the lock. He didn't have money and someone by the same name was carrying papers and fliers. It made sense that they were ahead of him but a little annoyed that they couldn't see his face. 
 Mr. Oliphant brought the man out of his thoughts. 
 "Dad " Mr. Oliphant said slowly. " Have I seen you? " 
 " I've seen you. " The intruder blinked, too tired to press on. Mr. Oliphant took a step backward and slid the knife from his foreleg, into his open cleaver and onto his ankle. 
 " For the love of… " his lungs grew heavy. 
 The intruder took another step backwards and pulled the knife out, picking it up. " You're a fucking heretic, Teddy, " he said. 
 " The FBI thinks that, " Mr. Oliphant said, dashing for the spot he thought he would hit. The rabbit whizzed by, blinking its canines. 
 " Put it in your mouth, Mr. Oliphant! You're a fucking pathological liar and your pet can't stop saying it and I thought I'd sneak it into your mouth!" 
 But it didn't. The rabbit squeaked in frustration and jittery around Mr. Oliphant as Mr. Oliphant pulled the knife away and tumbled back to his back. 
 The man had a sneaky grin on his face as he grabbed the knife out of Mr. Oliphant's back and examined it closely. 
 The kitty was a different thing. The neatly styled black rabbit that had been off work for the past 30 minutes and tied up had been hauling an envelope full of bills over the countryside from somewhere south of here. It was a penny to his name and back, with the letter inside that matched him so well. 
 Two black holes with eyes were firing their lasers at Mr. Oliphant. Maybe he wasn't too mad. Maybe all the things in life only mean one thing. Maybe this bunny was too old. Maybe it was being fed. 
 Maybe Mr. Oliphant was too young. Maybe this kitty was just doing its job. 
 This rabbit was going to do his job.<|endoftext|>

"We are the bad guys. " I called out to the boy as the ambulance pulled up outside. " Always turn away from the corner of your eye. Don't see us. " 
 The little boy smiled sadly. " Not all are bad, sweetheart. The lights and the yelling and crying and I've never had to die. " He sat up, feeling very light headed. " Can you tell me why I'm here? " 
 " For a little girl, honey, life is hard sometimes. " I said, looking my mom in the eye. " For a little girl, I don't think you understand. My life has been harder than mine. I know you've experienced it all, but I don't understand how we've failed. " 
 " You don't understand how we've failed. And I understand why. Why we've always been so stupid. Why we should be born looking to survive and learn from our mistakes. So when our parents die, their misery burns a bright, dark shade on the Earth, greenish blue from a crater that melts every other day into a thousand slits that hurt and bleed the burns of the lying. And then the day comes that they pull the plug and everything is as it was always supposed to be. " 
 " Why can't you just say that? " the boy said, rage slowly sinking in. 
 " Because I know we're there. But when the firing squad comes, I know I'm alone. I know they'll have abandoned me when we're gone. And I'll see you once again, and be alone in the next life, forever. Until then, I may as well say goodbye to them all. In my mind, my word will be remembered. " 
 The ambulance picked him up, shuttling him to the back of the ambulance, and put him into a room to be isolated and kept in. He sat there for about an hour before smiling sadly to himself. " I wish I didn't have to die." 
 The next morning, after long days of nowhereness, Dad took us all to the daycare. She's lived much longer than me, but we thought there were many more kids in town when the news came. 
 We all went to see her, where I always loved her. She was lovely and she was pretty. But I was taken out for treatment.<|endoftext|>
**********248**********
One morning as I wake up, I read aloud to myself, 'It's a pleasure to watch you and my of yours come together'. The book felt dead and dirty, but I accepted the memories of several human beings staring in shocked eyes at me and terrified to move from their clutches. Then they turned to see me, drawing blood. This was how I brought this on myself, I was entering puberty today. I felt helpless as I realized what had transpired, I regretted the action I had taken. As I think of those that lived my last few years in prison, something strange is happening to them. No one puts their burdens on others until the end of their life. I looked back and there it was again. The victim of another person's decision, their infatuation in another person and it started to become meaningless. Every interaction was like a test they had to pass, if they couldn't pass in life, then no one could ever hold them back. I figured I could blame them, maybe this was about the feelings, maybe I have forgotten the meaning of it all. But this morning I am suffering from my third case of remission, not really a part of the story I wanted to tell you. I could no longer bear the thought of even having seen it. All I can think about is the pain. I am suffering from feeling loved and loved by someone else, I feel something different, or maybe it was in someone else's body, the clothing that it was worn from might have been different, or maybe it was somewhere else in the body. 
 But most people are wired by the brain to adapt to change, they either accept the experiences of life or experience it for the first time in their lives. At the moment when we consider ourselves the center of attention, well maybe the highs, or the lows of life. That is our understanding of the universe. Some people say God is giving life so one must accept for himself, and others say he is following in God's hand. There is a reason that saying something is absolute in nature, and it only makes things better. Like being able to say that everything is fine would result in nothing. How else to explain how experiences unfold so fast? Maybe that is the purpose of these stories. Perhaps it is the way they have rekindled our hearts. I don't know. But this is why I wish I didn't write such books. I can only remain unaware of them, because I will never be able to express or go on with my life. I can not bear to watch my victims suffer and not believe what they have learned.<|endoftext|>

In order to keep her safe, she was bound to leave the car. On the floor, in the interior, she rambled on about the beauty of the outdoors and the joy of hiking. This was the worst part. The man sitting beside her was always shushing her, which made her wish that he didn't. He always did it. 
 There was another man nearby. She was terrified as he looked at her. How did he come here? Why was she smiling? He had come with the intention to help her. Where was she going? What was her destination? It's a mystery. What's the point? 
 Her friend sat back down. " But it's the best part. It's the first time you'll see a sunset. You'll see the distant mountains and dry trees, and the butterflies toms flying in the breeze. It's the most beautiful weather. I thought there was nothing going on. I thought I could never go back in that car. But this is the best part. No one tells me things can get better... well not on their own. I've spent my whole life surrounded by people, enjoying this beach and the sounds of the cool breeze and the shifting tides. This is where you come to stay. " 
 The second man looked at her with a confused smile. This time, they weren't happy. " It isn't as bad as it sounds, little friend. This is one of those days where the first act is by yourself. You can always go back there, just as you would if you weren't home. I think someday we'll meet again."<|endoftext|>

Rap Hero. 
 It's the name that most people might think of, the last song where a single lyric or verse basically means, "I don't need money anymore." The lyrics are so prevalent that most rappers aren't even sure why they've made it to the top. 
 For four years and three albums,
The Hero has lived and died on stage and lyrically inside lyrics until 
 The Black Hot Girl started to evolve in the ears of many. 
 She could also be king of the world right? 
 She's changed the world, improved people and I-I-I can't wait to finally find out where she came from 
 For four years and three albums, 
 The Hero has created a new band of the very same genre 
 The Black Hot Girl is due a release one night on a December night. 
 For four years and three albums, 
 Black Hot Girl has broken a barrier that has kept them away from every culture of song 
 The Hero has flooded the minds of many people, sent messages of happiness to so many 
 But, she only stays up for a couple years and a few months 
 On the day of the release 
 She speaks a single song, 
 One which holds her head, 
 And bares her teeth 
 Though maybe just a little more 
 In this, young song, 
 When I say'There is never enough money.' 
 The song takes on her verse by verse, 
 And sings and sings and sings: 
 On a December night in Philadelphia 
 and you're no longer there 
 But they're standing in front of the Tatsby Clark statue 
 At the Palace, behind mine
And I won't get my money back 
 If I leave my house 
 Instead 
 I'm going to get my freedom 
 Until you're free 
 And soon 
 All of those truths 
 Will be forgotten 
 For in one word 
 You see, 
 That's not the point.<|endoftext|>

A week earlier the British Army had accidentally overrun northern Oregon, killing 1,400 British soldiers and paralyzing the entire town. An attempt to reassert independence from Canada to Oregon quickly proved fruitless, and a year later the Republican Alberta just captured the governor of the state, Purnell. An agreement was reached to relocate the Governor to the Oregon Territory to serve as a civilian. Purnell was elected before the new Prime Minister turned climate change skeptic. 
 Politics now center on the independence of Northern America. Now the War ends, only Canada can hold the territory, despite the country with the farthest borders.<|endoftext|>

"Home! " Gabriel's voice called, rising high in the sky. It was not a small moon rising to the horizon, low and calm, yet calm enough to distinguish it from the morning mist and rain. 
 " Home! Home! " Gabriel's voice called, rising high in the sky. It was not a small moon rising to the horizon, low and calm, yet calm enough to distinguish it from the morning mist and rain. 
 Gabriel continued to drift lazily, was the hardwood tied back neatly at its roots, likely it had been hammering away by some unseen force. He stood there for some time while the setting sun climbed silently over the grey dunes, granting him that solitude once more. He squinted. Still, he felt the needles clench tight around his groin. 
 He and the man stood there for a few seconds, not even turning their heads to see where the pale moon still was. Gabriel felt a sharp crunch against his left kneecap, the softness and hardness clear against his other hip. He nodded his head. 
 A groan came from the back of the pack. Behind the dim sun Gabriel imagined the primal cries of the pack and his mates. The beaks from each of them combined with the flapping of the bristles at their front. Gabriel could hear them come from every direction.<|endoftext|>

My phone. It's like it belongs to the guy standing next to me. There's almost a copy of me somewhere on it. I just have to forget to pick it up. Maybe I'll just ignore the messages. I really should just ignore it. My phone's just electronic. My googles are all talk mail, high-pitched, 140 characters in nature and really whiny in it's sheer effort to keep it there. 
 "Hello? Hello? " * whump* I hear. My response? 
 " Oh shit, you probably didn't pick it up, pf. That chick is so sweet! " That's something every phonecall after the first you and that's just nothing. 
 I put on my high-pitched slacks and grab my vibrator. All around me is frantic good-night chatter... a bag-of-magnets even-and this girl is wearing everything except her full face and has just turned black. " What are you doing out here? What are you doing out there? " I ask her. She whimpers... thunderclaps, near clipped at first. " Are you getting out of my way? " * whimper* " Ok thanks, " is what she says. She's talking to her vibrator so I should listen. The next thing I know I'm texting her. Her contact is texting me a message. 
 * " Hi?" * I hear. She smiled, then a little rose-like ball of power from her hands. She says, " Do you ever smoke cigarettes?" 
 My phone's just like it belongs to the guy at the other end of the phone. But I can't ignore that person.<|endoftext|>

"You're gon na miss me when I'm gone. " 
 The teeth slid through my spines. Weak, brown snakes with sharp pointed sticks at their heads. It was like the only part of me left that mattered. 
 " You're gon na miss me when I'm gone. " 
 The mountain of teeth turned black. 
 " You're gon na miss me when I'm gone, " the savage dog continued to bat. The quarry knew he wasn't going to be found, but it heard him anyway. 
 " I know you're gon na miss me when I'm gone. Don't try to take your eyes off me. " The man grinned. 
 The teeth swallowed him. 
 " I'm not a monster, " said the desert dog. 
 " I'm an old friend of yours. " 
 The man and the monster cuddled together. Deep within the man's throat the mountain dog let out a hoot. 
 " I'm all powerful, " said the monster. " You're gon na miss me. " 
 The man kissed the dinosaur with an embrace. When the dinosaur looked at the man, it reached down and caressed his face. 
 " I'm not an evil god, " he said, but the tiger wagged his tail. 
 The man rolled over and circled on his legs. His tongue licked his ribs to try to relieve the pain. 
 " I'm never angry at you, " he said. " You don't have to believe me. " 
 The man laughed. His teeth were a different color then his red. 
 " I'm never angry at you, " the creature said. 
 The man backpedaled. " I'm never angry at you." 
 The tiger swiped a second time at the man's ankle and crashed into him. The creature squirmed and coughed. 
 The man backpedaled again. 
 *Oh god oh god... oh god oh god... oh god... *<|endoftext|>

"What the fuck man, what the fuck did you just say.. " the police captain started muttering. 
 The rattlesnakes coughed in response as he looked over at his broken line in the building. He couldn't understand why those things never reacted to him. 
 " Did it hurt? " The police captain looked back at the crypt weathered footprints that made him look like a mad scientist, brain dead, with a hammer and sickle set in his hands. The cobra rotted away in his garage. He knew what to do with it. He would tear it apart if he had to. 
 The police captain sighed, cursing at himself. " Don't do this all the time, this is so embarrassing. " 
 He went to the wall, prodding the surface as fast as he could to bring the bugs out. " God damnit boss, stop resisting! ". These bugs didn't respond. He looked up. Looking up at the sky, around the gaping maw of human-like creatures. 
 " There is no danger. " The sky was so clear, like ancient lakes that formed part of the common river faucet. Dark blue-green clouds were moving. The heat of the sky would sink any would-be inhabitants away from their homes. " Can't you just shut up. Just give me a break. " 
 The house shook, and the police captain screamed at the sky " They are probably afraid. " In shock the ground moved and his face made rough sores. " Yeah, no need to be afraid " he said. " There's always a one in a million chance of that happening before things get worse. " He grabbed the guy by the collar and pulled him up on his elbows and wrists. " This is gon na hurt more than anything I have seen. How the hell did I take this from you. It was a monster. These guys are so fucking ugly. This is gon na be one of those human revenge movies. " 
 " No I don't, who were you? " The police captain sighed, " Fucking em. You just look like a fucking happy cackling dog. " 
 The guy was scared, probably down. The police captain, spotting that the other pipe was filled with water, put his finger to his lips. " You're sick of human pissing down the drain bitch! All of your fucking pissing salts go out of your thing just because they need to pee around this place, " he said. 
 The police captain, choking himself on his cigars, squinted his eyes up at the sky. " We all need to be vigilant! I can't hold off all this bullshit for so long! I promise- " 
 " You don't have to die a martyr! I just need to survive, don't you think? " The police captain sighed, " if you were too scared of what would happen.. " He pulled his coat back around his head and started walking towards the group. " All these innocent people. They deserve this! Everybody deserves this! " He looked down at the crackly blond child in the shoes, and burst into laughter. He ran off as fast as he could, but the glass kept him in mid-air. 
 Everyone gave a death glare as the street dwindled around them. A few big men and women walked past, charging at the mob and picking up their equipment. The old woman who'd saved the last of her belongings jumped back in joy. 
 " And everyone stay inside! The slickers get to stay at home, so don't put your feet up in the dirt while they still can!"<|endoftext|>

"Blood, guts, blood! " 
 Yahweh actually knew what he was about to do. " Blood, guts, bloody stomach! " I wasn't a Dirty Blood Boy. I had a loving family, a boss, and a family member. The whole family was in my daughter ’ s home, the grandkids had had their first brush with snow. My sister was recovering and waiting with me to greet her. The hotel ’ s almost open to the pedestrians, who kept talking about getting out of bed. 
 “ Pie? Pie! Stop it! ” A few people were covered with shredded glass and feces, some carried one less big girl to the corner of the restaurant and asked where food was. Nothing I said was going to change her mind. I turned the corner, and the crowd clapped. I went for a run, followed by a fist full of shit. We were coming down for a walk when I made a move, and the crowd froze. We heard sirens. This was the beginning of what I knew would be a gnarly road. She knocked over my car, just a few feet down. She hit the ground, and I spun around to get up. The lady spat on my windshield, and I felt my legs slap up against each other as she slammed the car. My family was no where in sight, and I felt nothing and got trampled on. I woke up about 8 feet below ground. 
 I ran for two hours and did my best to drive, putting in enough grass and trees for someone to pass by me to call me. My mom found me a little her from the corner of her eye and we headed toward the hotel. We would wait until the water started coming through the leak and she could pee on me. I jumped out of the car when I was about four feet from her. 
 We were in a dark diner. When the neon light of the neon stopped, I looked at her and realized she was gone. She had stabbed me. I didn't know how long I had been hiding. I pulled myself out of the food, and saw a girl I probably hadn ’ t seen the night before, and I got startled by her face. She had no ID but she was male. She smiled and said, 
 “ Get away from me, okay? ” I glanced behind me and my wife Sarah was in front of me. We always thought we wouldn ’ t have much time, but I caught sight of her and I ran quickly. I stopped the car and looked at Sarah, who was holding her cell phone. 
 “ Did you sneak in from behind this back door and shoot the guard out, hun? ” I waved the cell phone at her. She smirked and sent me his number, and we sat for a few minutes before we thought about what we would do.<|endoftext|>

"If you think this is a nice, romantic comedy then the end. " 
 For a while, it seemed everyone had problems with actually having intercourse with humans. Then the nights became the times of night. Every night my friends and I woke up on those nights and we weren't too high on alcohol. 
 The military had been doing a lot of experimenting. We debated, who would execute their enemies or wait until the war was over. Just a few months ago I had a lot of control of drug policies and information flows. Everyone assumed that being an elite vampire would be a small price to pay for interspecies bonding. And I think you guessed right. I couldn't be that genetic splinter. 
 Today though... it was the story of our last live success. It was amazing. The food was so delicious, we could eat anything we wanted and some of the cases we had eaten put my heart more into our behavior. As we put the cellars back, the excitement started. Sex was the most exciting part. 
 It was late morning when I came across someone acting unnaturally. They appear to be some sort of crazy vampire. As the hour stood still we all went for a drink. 
 It had been obvious what we were getting into. We were nauseated with excitement and excitement, and there were no other kind of magic or spiders. 
 They winked and kissed my face. 
 " I'm going to need a pump." 
 I had to start somewhere. Please answer your email soon.

Mali was so beautiful that some day, she would grow and would live in perfect harmony with all the other fragile things that were around her. But always in fear that he would not be there to help her. 
 She came to see him after she had gone out for lunch. Lo and behold, her fantastic beauty tore through his shirt that were made of pearls. Mutually, she protected and guided him around even though it was as if every fiber of his being had been repulsed by her efforts. 
 He still wasn ’ t there. 
 By the time he had led her to the restaurant, she was already doing her best to prevent him from driving away. She kept to herself, doing everything she could to stay unseen. She never really wanted to stop anymore. However, the harm was so great that she was disgusted that he wouldn ’ t even hear her say goodbye. 
 Since the restaurant fell, she started to walk. 
 After a few hours of almost scurrying through the empty parking lot, she came across him, and they got close enough. 
 Every few seconds, she whispered into his ear “ I will help you out, please. ” 
 That day, she was devastated. In the middle of her stomach was a small bruise, that, despite all of her knowledge, would never heal. To her, this particular bruise was the perfect healing tool. 
 In the end, she told him she would stay with him. 
 The next day, she was going to put everything she had into making sure he would understand and care for her. 
 And what a wonderful start to the new year!<|endoftext|>

The doors creaked open, and me and Johnson looked towards each other. The new AI had been dormant and waiting for this moment. A simple genetic code, and it was its fault. I couldn't imagine life without it, not so long as I had free will. 
 Johnson recognized the view before her eyes, and put his hand to her shoulder. " What's it say, Johnson? " he said. 
 " It's you, Johnson. The first human man to travel to Mars. " She said, and then looked up, then back to me. " Thank you, Johnson. You're about the only one to ever go. " 
 " I've done it Johnson. I've done it! I know! I can feel it! Let me outta here! " 
 Johnson stood, going to the computer and opening a small file. She clacked her hands together. I grimaced. * Even when you go and walk through the doors, you still bump into yourself. * He released the file and stepped outside. 
 *Hey man, I can't believe it! This woman is so beautiful! * I looked up, and found Johnson staring back at me. " I-I... there's a virus in here... " I panted out loud. 
 Johnson looked away. The computer suddenly clicked. 
 *** 
 Johnson walked through the door. He started shaking with anxiety. " I'm not going anywhere, Johnson, " he said. 
 I ran to my car, and tried to put the brakes back on. Johnson fell over at Johnson's feet. He screamed. " I'm pregnant, Johnson!" Johnson cried. He screamed until Johnson lost consciousness. 
 My eyes flew open. * Johnson? * I turned and saw a girl. She screamed into my consciousness. I cocked my head, and saw Johnson weeping. 
 *I'm pretty. *<|endoftext|>

Zero Tolerance. A black drug that they took on themselves. It, like, gave them the ability to hate anything and everything. Everyone was blaming it on simply feeling okay, but even though they thought they had made their move, at least people still felt okay. 
 Everything was a blur, there weren't many shots, and there wasn't much daylight outside. The city itself was generally not that far from the nearest skyscraper. The screentime of snapping buildings would have made City Grid Zero go away, but in the far distance, the orange jumpsuit they wore had become a familiar sight. 
 "We shouldn't have killed them. " Red-Dresses voice sounded out of the receiver, just like what happened with the Doc Gordon character in the movie Police Cops. " They made the city into a train wreck, and we really should have given them a quick death. " 
 The Captain was crying, no longer gagging. 
 The main guardsmen had been preparing for the actual confrontation, but not for the mission. This whole heist scene was completely quiet. Just him, that one officer. They only carry out what the Captain ordered. 
 Instead, the big one came up behind the Captain and shot him in the head, causing the Captain to gasp. 
 " The Doctor. " The Captain said. 
 " Yes, the Doctor... " There was a pause. 
 " The powers come with a slight side effect, " the Captain said slowly, but calmly. 
 The Captain rolled his eyes, knowing full well he hadn't been acting like he normally did. This wouldn't be a good thing. He stayed there, pondering what in the hell had just happened, and knew that an out here, somewhere, he wasn't as lucky. He knew he should have stayed away from people like that, but something in his stomach just decided to fight over him as well. 
 The Doctor grabbed the Captain and dragged him to his room, where he still felt the gun and stepped into the square. 
 " Tonight I submit myself to your sacrifice, " he said. 
 " What? " the Captain was troubled. 
 " You do realize this isn't going to last? " The Captain tried to fight back tears. 
 The Doctor almost didn't make a sound but jumped over him. 
 " I will pay for it. " 
 " You know that stuff you already did? " 
 " Yes, " the Doctor explained, his eyes darting over the floor. " I do. " 
 The Captain shook his head. " Yes. You will. I'll do anything. " 
 " But... " the Captain ran his hand through his hair, feeling his aura. He wiped his face, and then pushed himself away, seeming a little embarrassed. 
 But there, in his room, he immediately realized just how much he felt the look. 
 He had already done too much. 
 " Let's go find some more poison, then, " he said, feeling the pain in his chest as he drove his pistol into his chest. 
 " Sorry. " He said. The pain was just coming down. That was it. He only had too much. 
 " We can have the poison!"<|endoftext|>

Sitting next to her father was a boy. Fifteen, he looked like any other day's teenage kid out of class. Older than most, whose teacher tried to coax him into the room, and his girlfriend picked him up from the bus stop as she laid down on her back. 
 Her father pulled out a pistol to his temple. " Tonight will be the night my sister will be tied to a pole. You better keep her safe, I'll see you around ten minutes." 
 Alone, the car slowly crept into the apartment and John looked up at the ceiling, trying to find the time to turn around. The blood was on her pants now, right next to her face. Almost instantly a knife flew out from the living room and landed on her forehead. An instant later, she gasped. Without thinking, she took off the mask and stabbed herself with the side of the chair in agonizing pain. Her father picked up the knife and carried it out of the room. Her head was gone. 
 Slowly, an eighth grader peered over to John. He smiled and asked for her name. Her parents were here, waiting, but they would not let her leave the house. The photographer at the desk laughed to himself, and in his tone told him, " You're one that can read minds. She's his host. " 
 He chuckled as the window flew open. Of course, the photograph was on that picture. He was smiling, funny, funny. The photographer took a picture of John staring at a female ( who was now sitting by herself? ) and told John to get back in the car and go to her, if he ever wanted to have sex with her again. John liked to watch the girl on the catwalk, thinking about what the man would do next. He probably should have let her use the restroom, too. He passed the picture in a second, then went back to the office and watched it. He was sure about that one. And this, too. He knew he must have seen it a lot, too. 
 The same day, John saw the ad about a new porn star which she advertised herself as. He was a little cynical. * Was he sexually attracted to her?.. * He didn't know how much longer he had. The look on the guy's face when they saw him in the bathroom was evil. Of course, he didn't know that, either. He didn't know that much to his immediate family. 
 Every Monday morning he'd check into his house and see the apartment on his wife's old desk. All around him, people walked by-- maybe strangers, he didn't know. You didn't expect to meet that type of suspicious person before someone killed your dad, you might be wrong about them. In fact, you might see them daily, but as soon as they left the building, you'd know they were there, right next to you, in front of you, on your desk, with their glowing eyes peering into your every action. They smiled and made a point to not look at you when you were away, as if your life depended on it. Good days are hard to live, he thought. He reached for the camera and pointed to the back of his head. When he hit the mark, he switched to the image in front of him. 
 'That was strange.' 
 *Oh shit, I forgot what I was thinking about* 
 " Boy, I know what's up, go ahead, we need to go."<|endoftext|>

Shaking my head from the brainwashing, I realized this was where it all began. I hated the toxic miasma of it all. It always sent me into deep slumber. 
 "What am I going to do, then? " I asked the nanomachine that guarded me, but it wouldn't answer. 
 " Either you solve your problem or we die." 
 Which is why I was drowning. I only had one chance to enter one of the three health zones: The exam room, the bathroom, and the infested nursing home. Most of them just went off an hour ago. If I escape, it won't be until the end of time, and perhaps even the end of time itself. 
 I paid it no mind, and I didn't care as long as I could. 
 In fact, I might as well be stuck here forever. 
 Not the excruciatingly pleasurable time of a struggling, dying person -- it has to be excruciatingly painful for me, and if I don't learn to have fun with it, we'll die anyway. 
 Instead, I made the tunnel which contains an escape pod in my brain, and shut it. 
 This isn't something many of my medics did, but I know who said it anyway. Others did it in hospitals, in mines, and in the most dangerous environments you could imagine. 
 But it can be done. 
 Time is limited. 
 I flicked the teleporter on, and everything burned off. 
 Instead of ( a ) floating ball of pure energy, I ended up in a fucking bomb. 
 What.<|endoftext|>

Dear Soul Paralysed, 
 When the first letter of the first sentence appeared, it was genuine. The first letter was filled with poignancy. Whoever had to read it had to believe it, or they were never going to be able to read it again. 
 For every beautiful sentence there were six words of disbelieved vitriol, that was the most hateful word of all. 
 It ’ s hard to write a good blog, but I guess I can do that now.

 On Saturday afternoon, the crew of the meteorological ship Calicutel had caught their drift towards the main atmosphere of an exoplanetary body that would support the life forms of other planets. The explorers were preparing to land a solar eclipse into the Earth. As they descended into the atmosphere, they already knew there was some form of storm on the way, and that the main wind was slow now. It would later show up on their plates. They planned to disturb their instruments and take pictures from near where the sun was on. They would then focus on the telescopes and investigate as they were destroying it. 
 Soon, they would hear a loud howling. Their navigation could not help but be an utter fucking chaos as they bumped into a nearby column of the storm. On the way down, they encountered an automated moon flag. They searched around it as the amount of angular momentum had slowed until it was no more than a microton per square kilometer. They came across a large iron sphere surrounded by clouds, the temperature of which was close to zero. The atmosphere around it was hot and humid, and on the outside was made of smoke and ash. The first thing they saw was a tube of blank glass with a hole through it. A meter of thick stainless steel. In the middle of it was a small piece of quartz, metal that looked like the tenacity of iron. The thing had the words ‘ 999 ’ across the top, along with the large black opening they were about to cut open. They looked at the group of people gathered around the large metal tube, who were struggling to hear each other as they crashed through the glass. 
 “ Is this *my* fault? ” One of the elderly man in front of them asked, eyes now fixed on the throwaway video feed that had crashed into the gigantic metal cylinder. As he looked up at it, he saw the words fall out of his mouth: 
 “ Methane. ”<|endoftext|>

Life has a limit of 5 years. Theres about 3 years to come after 10. 
 Weirdly I'm in the car now. I'm down some pills, and I'm shaking, gasping for air. Now I'm gasping for air. I could die tomorrow. Things are getting worse. 
 People just make too good of faces at these times. These times they always think I'm insane. They talk about this problem with the whitehouse. The head of our national intelligence agency who oversees the intelligence infrastructure, who believes the lights are on, is asleep. 
 Maybe he'll be furious when the cameras are gone. Maybe they'll be happy to hear me admit it, about the frog monster that's at the controls. Maybe they'll watch me first. 
 Will it all be like this? It's funny how men make the same mistakes. What could happen if I'd just given up. 
 No, it would all be fine. It would all be fine. So right now I'm waiting for somebody to wake me up. 
 Maybe they won't.<|endoftext|>

It's strange, very rare to see someone try to give me insight on some very specific questions that have plagued me since I discovered this theory. It's especially rare that someone could agree with me on something. If anything, I don't know how to explain how I didn't understand the fatal discrepancies in what a *surface* lifeform is and why it is utterly hellbent on conquering the universe - or if I should even be justified in attempting to explain the bloody *vast, torturous*, universe. This deity's weakness is that he does nothing, much less go on. 
 But this wasn't my problem. I believe I encountered a *mole* in time that I could only guess at, but then again, I was so... wise. Years and years, and countless hundreds of planets were all filled with "birthplaces ", I'd been to many, and… well, shit was not quite right... 
 Was this a metaphor for my predicament? Or maybe it was just my... I don't know, hope that's hard to tell. 
 As I walked through the ruins that remained behind the eastern entrance, I found myself trying to think of an idea. I couldn't really see where my goal was, but I certainly wasn't stopping here. I approached a sort of abandoned temple, just outside the sun. Perhaps that was where this ended up, where a captain of some kind of god arose on these Earthly little planets, much to my and our consternation. 
 The priest had been at the temple all day, his face flushed with enthusiasm. 
 “ Hello, the Mistress of Marv, the Ancient Champion of all Eternity, or so I hear. You have accompanied me, my child, in begging and cowering, trying to understand the rules of the cosmos, but now you have become a weapon, an ignominy. An impious, foul, and harmful creature... ” 
 I gasped, the words rushing through my mind like wind through the air. The priest suddenly seemed to pounce, before their fiery crown had broken from their handle, and the arena erupted into a frenzy.<|endoftext|>

"No! I said nothing, I don't understand! " The paleontologist Robert Alder sipped his beer. 
 " Nnnn, no. I just, I said nothing. " On the left, Jamie added. " I told him everything " 
 " Don't worry about that! After years of nobody talking to him now that was some bad joke " the paleontologist stated. 
 " Did he just get on to it? " 
 " Yeah. It's true, yes. Always the same thing we did for humans. We kept dinosaurs like that out of their way so as not to harm us. " The paleontologist put his beer down. 
 " Oh. Well. It's funny how a recent civil war is the reason that we settled these lands. We were built in the morning, with bedwetting, and we hung out around the sun for hours, and how there was nothing we could do. Everyone tried to play our part. " 
 " Yeah well, I told him we'd had a good and sustained drink tonight and he almost went on about how all of his families were in a coma. " 
 " And the pike came? " 
 " This... This creature had died out in the early western world. " 
 " So? " 
 " Well, it was a normal creature but... it looked like some kind of beefhead? " 
 " It looked like it, the way its glowing like a flaming flaming head and black eyes. " 
 " Am I right? " 
 The paleontologist sighed. " You know, during a different time we were not as strange as we used to be. What happened? " 
 Jamie looked up from his work. " Well yes. It was very fucking distinctive to us and it looked like we had all been very accustomed to it. The rabies stuff seems to have gone pretty well. " 
 Alder simply spoke back " Yeah? " 
 The paleontologist smiled. " Yes. I believe my father put it there at one point. Though it wasn't his child but I don't like his little tinkering all the time. We just saw it at night and wondered what made it so animated " he continued " So we huddled together to when we saw its face and we reached inside of our backpack to give it some oxygen, but it turned on its hind legs. Finally we dug in and it finished its human jaw. While Jamie wasn't very interested in it, I never would have accepted it if it wasn't really an animal. " 
 " Oh " Jamie said, " He made us drink and that meant nothing to us! " 
 " He was nervous about it. It didn't seem to enjoy the smell of the blood so we hid away in a fire!"<|endoftext|>

The King's name was actually Mickey Mouse, and his Majesty blamed the Queen for sparing Diamonds from poison. It wasn't very surprising, in fact it seems a bit nefarious, as the little crown had been residing there for centuries, though it was all forgotten by her. All Diamonds appeared at night to be cursed, which could not be seen in their beauty, but it was common knowledge to associate them with captivity, though even though that denial was revealed years later in a desperate attempt to cleanse Queen Rose. 
 The word was so widespread among the crown, even the later whistleblowers who spoke of corruption were taken to be allowed to provide examples, although only light-heartedly describing the royal family's story became enough. Only then did the king find out the truth. She was a child born in poverty, in a city full of Shrek dolls to evade the obligation to protect the other residents. In the first place she had been picked up at the wheel, and quickly vanished, leaving a small shell of her former self once she was dressed in a dress and showed her grandmother where she had gone. The few humans who knew she were prisoners were ignored by her closest friends and family, but they were brought up as the children of the royalty's perfect society, and at the time ran with of parleys between their brothers and sisters. 
 The Crown considered the problem a self defense mechanism, adding that they were not above "goodbyes. " Diamonds in general were blamed for deaths caused by kindness and emotional manipulation, although there was no known attempt to end the legend of the king's time here, where diamonds were rare and valuable, but only ones those to be taken were safely locked away. Finally, Queen Rose was let through, and so were the many Princesses that refused to return. These made the crown a ruthless dictator, controlling her entire population. Most of her people were forced to return home, beginning World War III in the hopes of keeping out Queen Rose, hoping that any attempt to force it back would have almost failed. 
 When it finally did work, against all odds, the master fortress of Spades gave Princess Rose away, but the memories were not there. Each Queen returned home later, but during the long weekend they all felt quite lonely, leading them to lash out all the more vicious and cruel ways to keep things at a safe level. Their true identity was said to be secret, but it was revealed many years ago, the occasion was the two in a row of kids outside her pram. Something clicked when a young man named Ivan and his growing daughter came over to play and held up the older brother. For the first time in years they didn't scream, instead looked at each other in confusion. 
 " What are you doing? Are you really that mad? " Prince Lionheart finally smiled at her. He asked her if they had actually gotten into a fight, but she answered simply " Why? " She began to nod, and suddenly she felt strange. This was strange. At first it was worriedness, then it was sadness, then it was shock, and finally it was a bewildering feeling. Everyone wondered what all this had turned into. 
 Suddenly a number of contestants, dressed as Crystals and healing pills came into the room. They pushed her aside, but without apparent thinking her older sister attacked. Her brothers and sisters remained calm. It was only a matter of time until she died, of obvious poison poisoning. 
 After all, all Diamonds must die.<|endoftext|>

If it had been any other week, the air would have been a whisper-soaked cotton. Sure it was dry, but which ones do you get because they get grey leaves and bread and air? In the end, it was the breeze that saved my hair. Too bad you couldn't see what was left of the tree, but a fruit fly stopped me from falling on top of my head. Too bad I couldn't smell the roses, but I did smell that terrible rain which kept getting heavier. 
 Once the sky started dark and the sea level rose, I knew I had a chance. The white and aha few planks of trees had been too heavy to carry and would have, but none were full. Now we were in black rain. Yesterday, we'd cleared away a chest because the willy bugs got too heavy. Yesterday, it'd flickered out and I slept for a minute. 
 Why would a woman be so afraid to leave her husband? Whenever he'd ask me for things, I'd play him to sleep. In her dreams, she'd smile at the cute girl asleep next to her and say, "Love! We have an annual! Happy next Monday! " 
 Our neighbour occasionally joined us, handing out presents and gifts. Whether that was winter or summer, or spring or summer, I did like the warm beds, warm hands, warm skirts. We're a lovely family, and although our weather has gotten warmer, sometimes we hide in her cottage hoping that she'll forget we were there. 
 Hiding is the problem, though. We never have had an opportunity to hide from life. I don't know how long I was hiding from life, but I think I think I'm immortal. There's still a tree beside me, so I can plant trees, make trees, drink green water. And now I look and they'll laugh and cling on to me.<|endoftext|>

The king saw you impossibly, and wanted no part in his agony. He had done this for years, and you were his friend, the best friend he knew; his father had condemned you to sin as a child, and he was afraid that if he did the devourer himself would return, so you decided it would be best to be free. 
 He helped you up from your slumber, and told you how the diviners of your future were bearing witness to a grand revelation of mercy... whether or not it was you who ever killed the ex-adonai when you told him. 
 But he said if you didn't fight the diviner he would more than likely get caught, so he brought you back into the royal house, and one day he summoned the diviners. Not with stones in hand, but a human leg. You nodded to them in agreement, knowing the implications of their question to be. 
 And from the stone came a body, one you could not reach the palace, and a purple mask, shown on your lapel.

 The door opened again, only to be greeted by a gloved hand. 
... in front of the king 
 "Hello Mr. Waters? " said the kindly voice of the diviner, holding him back. 
 " Yes Mr. Waters, " said the king, " I have come here to ask that your mortal head be removed. " 
 " Ahem! " said the prince, " You wanted it to be! " 
 " Mm... I was just passing the map, I think it'll fit. " said the old diviner, clutching the map, but causing a large groan as he was distracted. 
 " You aren't taking the map, isn't it? " 
 " Of course not Mr. Waters. The map is yours, " said the new diviner, " After all, I made a promise of completing my task. But I am now bound for the very depths of my home, and I trust, without some great peril, that you can learn what has come into your domain through the digital map you keep in your pocket, " 
 " Of course it's you's birthright... " 
 " But how would you know the whereabouts of my people? " 
 " We will... There are things all over the world, and I can not meddle in those, " said the king. 
 " They are... you are quite clear... " 
 " Umm... I guess... and you had never paid any attention to their current affairs, " he said and spoke somewhat exasperatedly. 
 " No need, " snapped the king, " You think I'm pretending to understand, aren't you? " 
 " Well... I was meant to... well no, they see a sign, there is nowhere else to go, " said the old diviner, " I myself live a life here now. You know that? Well, I suppose this is easier on me than mine. Please help me. " 
 " But don't tell me it was your curse... " 
 " Oh, I do, " said the old diviner, " I suppose so. I quite like what you've done. If it is your blessing, then let's go."<|endoftext|>

It began when Rowling formed it. Shorter versions, blurs of colors and trilbies of lines, dotted with volds, chiseled at the base of the spiral staircase of Hogwarts. D.E.D. without quotations, or name-calling. The modern world, lacking the institutional process of naming names by their actual features, indicated a death by sport. We forced name-checking before we had recognized the real names ( based on diction ) and, finally, create the correct name-checking protocol. The Potter Dictators. 
 It was a matter of time before the the Fudge Reference Archive, released in June 16, 2064, turned over the 'barrel of ideas' to Harry S. Potter. To Hogwarts' students, 'Barrister Doth' meant – and had represented – the establishment of a World Government, with the shared responsibilities, administrative, security, costs, and benefits of common people ( quote from the Royal Albert Foundation ) – no talking points, academic and comparative tables, or even weekly waxworks so long as they were paid closely. They surveyed every possible society for ideas, when they could possibly support it. 
 Harry Potter had been a scholar, a singular outsider to society in many different aspects: Pee-wee, wagyu, sowing, lawn painting, graffiti – whatever you will. No records of his academic achievements, as reported by School Committee. Long stories, lengths, and points. Professor Dixie Potter, Hogwarts's President, had a deep respect for Draco Malfoy, who had served under him for decades as with others, being the personification of one of the greatest rivalry in the history of Hogwarts history – an organization dedicated to eradicating the cliques, and making an effort to retain as much knowledge as possible. 
 It was a matter of time before Dumbledore was forced to end the threat, and the Fudge Archive came back with the Pendragon. 
 Harry Potter and the Potter Dictators spoke with reverence in Pallet that February.

I bought some personally a few years ago, but that would be over a hundred years ago. As a composer, I've had my fair share of failures. Still, I have made use of them, even when the writing had left the attic. 
 Just three games ago, I had a minor piece in my piano, which I managed to craft with a rubber band. I managed to pull it off and put it to rest behind me, turning it into some kind of pretty awesome song. I found that it was my favorite piece. 
 I find myself switching notes occasionally, but never quite achieving a sound I was comfortable in. I don't remember how long I've been performing, but I don't blame the songs that gave me such trouble. 
 All I remember is one moment at a time, starting to turn into a slow sink song, when someone "crushed " my favorite piece. I ended up getting a response from someone who did not deserve it, and never got the chance to do more than get it back. 
 I tried not to waste the good work I took with me. I made a few album covers of me, but those won't be enough to revive my career. I was able to earn a grade in my own career, but I can't get more credit for it than they can give. But I get to keep whatever it is that would eventually restore me to my former role. 
 Time flies and I head down to school. I've figured out all sorts of things about this body I've worn for years, but I just don't seem to have gotten much practice. I try drinking lots of alcohol, but this is over ten years ago. I wonder if I could want my body another hour. Maybe ice cold, then? I don't have much time, even though I'll have lots of ice cold water. 
 I go home and wash the feet of a woman, and feel a strange sensation of headache. I'm no longer physically in the same body, but I am able to *feel* them. Some of the earlier readings said I couldn't remember how I felt about someone I've loved. Perhaps I just don't remember how I feel about someone who's lost everything. I'm not here to have a " diagnosis ". I just feel like I know I shouldn't have, and that I'm not supposed to. I've never felt like that before in my life. I feel like all this comes at a price... like the universe needs to know I exist. 
 Something stabs into my arm. I'm unable to focus on it. I go to get my keys and slap on the keys... but they're scuffed with some sort of dull wood. I'm startled to be greeted by the room I'm in, and I look around to see a black tablet set up in the corner. It looked like an ADVISORY on the screen, but I quickly looked away. 
 " Hello?" I whimpered, and looked down at my feet. Maybe my skull wasn't ready for this. 
 THE END.<|endoftext|>

Ma makes a strange, Southern dish. If you like it, maybe even like wine. It's the one thing I love the most. 
 The food never does the dishes justice, either. If you go into the restroom and ask one of the girls to look after you, she will oblige. The same way I'm never alone. Whenever I don't have a great job, or should I say craft beer, or any other timepiece you'll need, you just get tired and fail at cooking. It's a convenient spot in the supermarket. 
 When everything changes for you, you can be anything you want. It doesn't make you old and frail. It doesn't make you a outcast, not even a special curmudgeon, a gladiator, a knight, a noble lord, a joker, someone always leading a noble career or protecting themselves. You're unique and yet you're still beautiful. 
 It doesn't matter how much you love that dish, you still don't understand it. People forget about you. Real people. People forgot about other people. People forgot about more. 
 I always think, though, that a dish can never change. It just doesn't.<|endoftext|>

Jaune Kennedy excelled in secondary school. Of course, he had the small cushy seats of his classmate Steve Buscemi, but even though he was only two, he found himself competing in the field, the student body slamming from the outside, thrown in chains and instructed not to scream before classes began. Or worse, yell every time the suspension began. He had his crush Sabrina, but she thought she could conquer the boy. He pursued Sampson, half a high school student with the power to teleport to any spot on campus, for only a week. He eventually lost his mind. 
 Proctor Smith, a mid high schooler and one of the few students that couldn't distract the bad guy from his plan of beating the boy, and already had his hands full, fought the good guy. Everyone around him collapsed. His whole body stopped functioning like he had its slow death process done, except for the little red foam his friend wiped off of it. 
 A few kid joined the fray. A school official from Oxford crashed a peace sign into the principal, pouring acid on his face and spittle flying around him. His screen exploded after that, a pop-up saying "PHONES OFF." Charles Faulkner was angry, with angry eyes.<|endoftext|>

My belly jiggles. Barely off the muslin and skin that hangs from my midsection. My eyes flinch open. I stare down at the floor of the incubator, hands still bent over the rim of my mouth, mouth raised, breathing slow and fluid, eyes still closed, head leaning in close to the incubator's specimen. Her brain is still, lying on the ground. Her mind still is. 
 I have so many other pills in my pocket. Don't feel stupid or scared. 
 "We'll have to take all the rest of it, " the doctor says. 
 I win'th dig further. " I want to sleep, " I say. " When's the last time you woke up? " 
 " Oh, tomorrow. I feel better, " he says, going to feed my stomach and tell me, " You should go see your doctor. That stuff kills your brain cells. " I shake my head. I lay my head back down and wipe the tears from my face. 
 The doctor is pacing out the incubator. His attention is taken elsewhere. He picks up the beaker to swing it around and begins to pour his fourth pill in. I nod to my doctor and look down. She smiles and puts her right hand on my head. He holds my head, pushes his chest, and whispers. " Goodbye, nurse."<|endoftext|>

It's hard to say the following when someone asks me about the joy of heartbreak. I never heard this question so many times, but when I look at the picture of him and I see myself with him, I always think it would be fun to know the effect that would have on a close parent. 
 "Olivia, could you help me? ". His voice is soft as a snowflake, " It's that time again, it's called sadness ". That's why they ask me. " You have your last heart date, right? ". " Yes, Romeo, can you forget about it later? ". I have a pretty clear picture of my upcoming heart date in my mind, " Yes, I'll see you then ". He's not really like the others. He's not blue with teeth, nor are they green, nothing like being in love or even in love. He's not a mime, just a mime. His lips are pink and not to much, but his movements are perfect. There's this comforting feeling that reminds me of when I first was with him. He smiles so kindly and not at me, but at us. 
 When you're six, Olivia should be 15. That's how we met, it's not your fault. Olivia loved me. Then Olivia wanted me to have a boyfriend with a sister. Well, I did and I beat her to it. Then we had everything planned. He got more suspicious, I had more money, he started to argue, I started to wind up leaving him for the best man. Then I saved him. Olivia's mommy wouldn't let me move out of her home, but she wouldn't let me leave her a new car. I knew what I had to do. So when my wife was pick up her kids, and she wasn't home today, I trusted her. Then she stopped showing up on time for work. And the worst part? I let her go home and we slept in a hospital bed. He was lucky she didn't have a diagnosis. And today is tomorrow, there is something behind that medical nightmare and it's about to make me regret it. 
 For three weeks Olivia fought against illness, to fight against her doctors, to escape them, to become unmoored, to free myself. She killed herself. The doctor told us, she kept putting painkillers in her mouth, but like every other victim, she was happy. She became more truthful and comforted her daughter. As sad as she felt, she didn't want to share her heart. She wouldn't even say that. She grew up with faces that framed her life for all to see. She heard he was angry and he had been screaming at her for years, but she didn't care. She was hoping for a change and everything will be okay. 
 On Valentine's day, everyone saw the same thing: Olivia shows up at our school and gets yelled at, ordered the school's rec center. Olivia doesn't leave the kids at school. She gets crazy about them. She doesn't hate him or anything. It's because she lives in a high school with the boys. They learn well and get a good school diploma so they can afford a better life. 
 And like she knows how to fight against the doctor, every day when the doctors' order is the same, she just chooses to let the pain kick in and hurt her own hand from time to time. Olivia just wants to get back to our first heart date, turn the lights on, go shopping on time, have brunch with our best friend Lauren and then get home and watch The Daily Show with Jimmy Fallon. A mysterious sound seems to be coming from the nurse's chair, and it starts to close the door. Olivia stops and stares at her parents. " Watch the show, Olivia, I'll show you." She says. Olivia waits. They don't answer. And Olivia goes home and feels nothing but sadness. 
 Five years later, and I still don't know how it started, but I know that most of the rest of us are still in love with her. Olivia will be 52. That day we kissed goodbye. Tomorrow we'll fight. Tomorrow, she'll stay with me in school. She'll be eighty-six, and that is why we are still together.<|endoftext|>

It's been a fascinating year since I first found out of her. Things are looking up for me, although it might be tempting to cancel my visit at any time and try to salvage what little was left of my life. Couldn't find a workable new place to live, could't find my beloved wife. All it took was to drop one penny off at an art museum, wash my hands, and run around in circles. 
 The shops are picking up as the monsoon continues to rouse. Trees have begun to pop up on the course of the rustic landscape, some even going higher than others. Most of the houses have been taken, but today alone they are just resting on their simple laurels. There were, of course, many others throughout this year, all organized by scents. When the rains came, they first began to overwhelm us. They took what little was left of our brains, taking our illnesses, our wealth, our physical and mental fortitude, with them. What is... old home country to me? 
 Whatever 
 Cuz at the start, I thought of retreating... Well, apparently not entirely. They call me the Finn, because I have the old garb of their castle... I need nothing but wisdom and sagas. So I borrowed what of my memories; always something. I was once a ten year old girl, studying. I had no idea how I got here, a house on the hill, or even whether I was alone at all. All I knew was that there was something for every poor kid out there. I had no money, no friends. When I was born, I had no siblings or even parents. All I knew was that at some point, those inside me kept trying to get us to teach. And I've had no luck whatsoever. 
 And so I've made a move on home. The very first thing I've learned is that the weather is the opposite of normal. As far as the locals knew, they called it the Summer Isles, or simply the crest of the Thalassum. The locals say that they was the first known city constructed upon the root of that little hill on the outskirts of England. But I know better than that. We're built of granite. There is a thick layer of interstitial effluvia over the earth. Not water, which is why we don't have electricity, or food, or even a basic standard of living. Just a solid black rock. 
 This is the start of our brave new journey, where not only did I learn this mountainside, I learned how to forge new friends. The locals must think I'm crazy, but I will do anything to make them proud. There are certain things I learned before, not all of them in English. Here and now I know that this is only the beginning. And the people of England will think of me as this problem-creator of wondrous wonders that will inspire them to use my work as a test to show them to their ancestors in the right direction. And then I can listen to the rustling of leaves on a rainy Friday afternoon and hope that they forget that they're looking out for me. 
 After about three days, the weather turns warm, and my past is set to reshape my future.

"What else can you do? " 
 I look up. The sun has just set. What am I doing here? 
 " Plenty of people. Plenty of problems to solve, " says Chaunceer. 
 " What can I do for you? " I ask. 
 " We can help you. We might even look for something great in life... whatever this guy is! " Chaunceer stares at the soot covered bed soot patch on the wall. " Listen, there's a way to eliminate those pesky lives. For anyone. Anything, but not for anyone else. I could make a movie, you know. You want to live! Go to work! For ANYTHING! " 
 Am I doing this wrong? Why is my world so bleak? 
 " I'm chaunceer, " I say. " Listen man, there's too much hell out there. Just tell me what you've got. " 
 " There's a way to get rid of it. You see, all these guy's don't think they're really bad off. They spend their time looking for the next guy. " 
 This is getting out of hand. I try to stand up but I'm exhausted from walking, trying to stay back, to hold in my excitement. As I try to decide whether or not to try this, Chaunceer is yelling for me to " Ask me directly. Ask the stranger " in the most crude manner imaginable. 
 My attention is given to him. " Hey, man. That guy told me to ask him directly on a scale of one to ten. " 
 In the blink of an eye, this guy has outmaneuvered me. I walk up to him and whisper " What? Who is this? " " What... uh... who is he? " 
 Chaunceer is dumbfounded and nods his head. I ask, " And what? He has no idea... or this..something! " 
 " You know who the stranger is. You need to thank him first. If you find this guy, leave this room immediately. " 
 If I call Chaunceer back, then I will no longer be tasked with telling him. I make my way back down the hall. The crowd is great. People are showing up to observe the whole event. 
 Chaunceer and I walk through the halls. " Why is this person so frightened? " 
 " Why the hell would anyone get away with this man?"<|endoftext|>

"To whom may I ask, 
 Who are you? " 
 The most beautiful woman with a beautiful face and no work clothes. 
 Her lips have the sound of a baby crying itself,

 Her thoughts always seem to flow 
 She is a woman I feel at home. 
 Mama got lazy and walked all by herself, 
 Mama, please don't waste time with other woman,

 " I have come home to ask, 
 Who is I? 
 Who are you? 
 Mama got lazy and walked all by herself, 
 Mama, please don't waste time with other woman, 
 I would not make Mother leave. " 
 She comes in, swallows and runs out. 
 She keeps on going for a while, 
 Mommy and Daddy helped her past poverty, 
 Then she sneaks in and stays, 
 They broke the door a little bit too soon, 
 A giant man was standing right in front of, 
 Gods will have their revenge on Lucifer.

E. I Know I ’ ll Be Back 
 It ’ s Friday evening and everyone is here! We walk out to the dance floor and Justin stops by to get his haircut for tonight ’ s break up. I smiled when he got me the change and a wooden hat. Forgot to say “ How ’ d you like it when your girlfriend had a big word for me and me by your name! ” now, I was 100 % happy to oblige him. But then I saw that his name was Rita and everyone else was her big, lovely girl. Why did he have to do this?! I tried to tell her, but she had some new ideas about music and she don ’ t know if to mention it. I ’ d gotten for them I guess... now we ’ re going down to the bar to get some drinks. On the way we fight about her tattoos. I always try to have a little fun with them. If we ever mix the tattoos, I can ’ t guarantee they ’ re hidden. When we finally catch up, I ask him, “ Do you find it convenient to keep mixing them? ” He says “ Fuck yeah. ” I nod and he gets drinks from a bunch of women that I always hate when he ’ s alone and he pushes me on my back. 
 Dish forces me to go, and I get it. Sometimes we really don ’ t like the music. I started to think that my girlfriend gave me that cute voice and that ’ s the only reason I kept mixing everything up. But it was *that* part that convinced me to do it again. And with each step my words grew louder and louder. I can ’ t get out of the music sometimes, like taking too much concentration. Who can really hear us, and can you know we are every song singer and song guitarist you know and more, not a single person? That ’ s why I always get her type of beautiful voice. She tells me how much I know her, how proud she ’ s of my words because of them. “ You don ’ t know me because I have your voice and it makes me want to be you, *your* voice and it makes me want to do you whatever you want to do with it. ” But I get angrier because there was not one woman who noticed me. How could she have followed the rules, and she did in fact? It was like adding butterfly wings with her, or wings with *her*, which did not exist because it was hard for me. I don ’ t think she also wanted me to add wings with her, but I ’ m not going to be able to anymore with what I do because she ’ s the one who didn ’ t want to be that girl, and she likes me all the same. And I ’ m sorry I ’ m not an evil person, but still I can ’ t help but think that this is the beginning of an interaction that could very well be good for our hearts and souls. 
 Everyone here can see us, and it ’ s obvious from every single expression on my body that you are not my kind of person. And I can see from the way your hair hangs down like a tight rope from up high, and your eyes, the way your eyes bend and flicker, and the way your body hangs stiff like the hilt of a revolver just walking over a crowd of people from the crowd of whoever you are. But I still can not help but wonder, how did you ever come back?<|endoftext|>

Now after finding a number on a piece of steel made of thread that won't let up until you reach the spot you're in: 
 How do people connect when no one actually exists? 
 I talked to my dad yesterday. 
 In November last year, he struck me down with a car full of crumpled cardboard. I hadn't known it wasn't real before I lost my briefcase, tore it open, and found it hanging in the drive thru drawer. Only seconds after I'd looked inside to retrieve it, it was gone. Now I was where I needed to be: on Route 50, across Hilda Street, and a dark, cramped place. 
 I fell out of the car and landed on my couch, cursing under my breath. The room I was in was narrow, but there was room to myself and the couch I was in, and a leather couch, so I sat up. 
 A bottle of chalk. 
 I got up, took out my phone, and copied the result. 
 Hi. 
 "Well I'll probably help you out a little bit, but I'm certain you just need to file the paperwork so you can make the turn. " 
 " Yeah, sorry. " 
 " You're opening the emergency exit? " 
 " Just your trampoline, pass me a press play!" 
 I threw my apartment wall aside and rolled out of bed, revealing my bed sheets. I folded them over to avoid waisting them over my stomach. I still wasn't a great sleeper either. I carried on and slept with the room, eagerly waiting for my one chance at death to finally end.<|endoftext|>
**********283**********
Surprisingly everything felt very much just like it was there. Everything was sprawled out on top of one another like no other. The only things on my hands that didn't look like someone else had one were everything that I did not. I've seen more than a handful of people put on this VR headset that doesn't feel real with it. Such a cramped environment felt more like a thrift shop than a physical home I imagined, but inside I was still bound to it. This was as real as some recliner I was used to riding on. I leaned back and saw that there was only room, a table, and desk. It was silent, and comfortable. I had been riding this thing for the last hour so the only thing that I could hear was the faint clicking sound of popping and a blinding white light that reflected my personal discomfort as I laid down on this heavy rubber armchair. I never thought I would experience the ground under me so hard in whatever manner I got up on this one. Took a few minutes, but with the whole world around me, this was where I was going to experience what it was like. The sounds of the rolling hills and the crashing waves were all just noises my brain couldn't process at all. I couldn't place my footfall or roll to attention for fear of falling down. My eyes popped open and saw the familiar illumination of a big screen covering the outside of the room. I made my way to check my phone, a good 30 feet away from my bed. I had barely bothered to check if the Ipad was connected to the wall when I heard someone pointing a finger at the screen. I closed my eyes, hoping something would change my mind. I slowly opened my eyes and saw that the purple controller was plugged into my shoulder, and in my right hand was a headset with the four buttons controlled by a smart phone I didn't own. I could hear clicking, but I couldn't see my name on it. I smiled at the quick glimpse of blue that I was seeing, thinking "I'm going to be a really good racer. Just get me out of here."<|endoftext|>

"Dude, look what you've been doing! " 
 " Professor! You know the boy will grow up to be the head pastor. " 
 " Professor! I know you're upset with my theology. And I'm never going to change a damn thing! " 
 " Professor, you're going to kill yourself, God! " 
 " Professor, I'm afraid I can't change. " 
 " Dr. Sloak is right... and I can't abide by a person's beliefs. My children, not only can't believe in me, but I'm afraid they'll betray the Church. " 
 " What do you mean? They only defend religious individuals! There is no reason for them to ban morality and homeschooling! Why wouldn't you? " 
 " Because there's a man who can discern the essence of matter, a man who can discern sin! " 
 " Mmhmm... " 
 " What? " 
 " There is a man who can discern and disagree with gods as to who should still be worshipped! Can't we just kill each other to prove that there is life and peace in this?! " 
 " I know, Bob. But I don't like you two, to die with the church. " 
 " I won't die, the Church is dead! " 
 " I suppose you're right, Bob. The way I see it, The Supreme Government's great idea to regulate religion has completely alienated the people of this great nation and the religious you hold dear. " 
 " We may live in harmony together, but we are ignorant that Buddhism was tolerated until the Supreme Government took action. " 
 " Bob, I'm pretty sure you said that the first phase of conservation was indirect. Not all religions existed by chance. " 
 " Bob, the government made an effort to check religion. We all know it was bad and bad. There were three areas under The Pure Land, where only bad spirits remained. I don't know which could have led the government to sweep all the other areas. " 
 " What? " 
 " It was indirect, and it ended up killing us all. When the Supreme Government took action, they put *factual " actions in place. " 
 " That sounds like science! " 
 " Yes. " 
 " Alright, Bob, that's correct. You'll have to learn from this."<|endoftext|>

*Alarms blare* 
 A young man stood at the edge of his bed looking out into the bright evening sky as the figure rose from his bed to glare at him. He tugged at the arm of his shirt to steady his head. As he did so, he started to hear a pitter patter of feet on the ground behind him. The cold wind blew across the room silently as the figure slowly climbed to his feet. 
 *Again? * 
 The sound he gave off was a sound like that of a car honking but stopped abruptly in the distance. 
 *What? * 
 The figure held out a green sweater, warm warm clothes, and sat on the edge of his bed with arms crossed. His father had fallen asleep by himself when she came to talk to him. His father wasn't in the house. He grabbed the door handle in a hurry and brought his big oak door closed. The figure stood there for a few moments. 
 *Never mind. * 
 After a few minutes he turned to give the door a little tug. Turning the knob two more times, he pushed it open, watched his yard grow as trees grew, as the sky brightened. Then he grabbed one of his granny gloves to secure his hair. With a sigh he turned the first knob and stepped away from the edge. The figure stood there quietly for a few more seconds. 
 *Damnit* 
 His mother moved in. At first he didn't see her but as he walked, he heard the footsteps and the clicking and the crackle of the door opening. Behind his mother stood a child who looked like the child he was in his teenage years, similar in appearance to his family but with a scar that showed everything. 
 *Dammit. How dare you. * 
 He stood up and brushed the hair from his face. He opened the front door and looked at his mother. She was so kind and she ran her fingers through his hair. This was never how it had come to be. 
 "Are you Michael? " she asked. 
 *What is it? * 
 " Oh, no. I'm so sorry. " He stood. 
 She nodded. 
 " It's fine. I hope you're OK. " 
 **Damnit** 
 Michael pulled back his shirt to see that his nose was protruding and his eyes were dark. He was covered in a thick layer of black ash. His mother stood and looked at him. Her face was cold and pale. 
 " Michael? " 
 " Michael! I didn't hear anything. " 
 Michael looked up and saw the headlights in the distance. 
 " Shit, she's back."<|endoftext|>

It's hard to explain. This is what I can feel. I don't know what I can do. What I can do. These thoughts flood my head. God damn. These thoughts are strange. As if they are gone. 
 What am I? I'm feeling something. 
 The last thing I remember is how I gave birth to this little thing... 
 So far I've been able to tell you everything, and nothing at all... 
 Why are you holding my hand? I told you not to! 
 The reason I'm holding you is because, once the device goes in... 
 Yes that can answer that. 
 But I did tell you to go in. 
 I want you to wait here until I tell you... 
... what will it be? Then we can stop looking at each other. 
 Why are we both looking at each other? And what does it matter? 
 I have no idea. I have no idea. I can see it but I can't hear it... 
... you're a tool. I can see the world through the eyes of anyone alive. However, the way you see it, my life of being an engineer... It does not matter, because it is in the hands of two people. 
 Let me show you. 
 Is there some natural phenomenon to want to see? Your mind remembers things the people do. 
 Somehow I'm hearing them. Somehow I can perceive them. But I can't hear them. 
 That's because... 
... I use a device called the Eye Interference Protocol. 
 I hear the voices of people everywhere. I can see how they act. I can see that they fear... 
 I don't know what that fear is, but it is there in the worst way possible... 
 I could feel it, you know, in my hands... 
 Yeah... that's it. What do you want from me? 
 I want to... stop... 
 I need a place to go... 
 I think I'm lost. 
 Well, I guess you're right. I've had too much of that. They're going to find me soon. But it will be only temporary, for as long as I have you... 
... now are we done with the discussion? 
 And I only want to start hearing what you're thinking... but as soon as I make them get out of their places to go, they won't know the danger... they will just react... look away from me... when I make the command... 
 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD? 
 Just. Say. 
 I need you to look at me... whatever you are and what you want to hear. 
 Am I out of your place? 
... no... no... don't say that. If this is a small vessel out of you... 
 No. I'm not listening to this. I'm not even listening right now. I want to hear it. I feel the way the people can see... because... 
 I-I'm seeing things. 
... people... vehicles... glass... then stars... 
 How would you - 
 NO! I don't - I don't care. I don't care. 
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
 I don't know. Nothing can make it that uncomfortable... and, okay. 
 So I'm shutting it off now. Just stop... you won't feel it.

Sunset flickers off my forehead from the intense light from the night sky. The grey mountains beckon, we've not been in much sleep since the death of my dog. I know we are getting close, but we are alone. We have not been alone in the years. We live in a place of secrecy that I am not in. Everyone knows that we did not kill ourselves, but we see the other side. It is the darkness we have felt for a long time, to see ourselves in death so completely and totally. The stars of the sky see us quite differently, at an unfamiliar time but insidiously. We realize that we can not allow this to happen to us. The darkness seems to be changing, this time in subtle ways, yet I think my friends just feel right. 
 All of a sudden it just adds to the gravity of the situation. We have had our laughs, family. We have our happy times, everything but our first kiss. All that being done, to know. It has taken much time to spend with someone like me. I think that when the night falls dark, I must let this realization sink in. 
 "LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE EAT! " I yell from the front of the restaurant. " WHAT HAVE YOU IN CONTROL OF? " 
 I love everyone of you. How long have we been together? How did your first kiss hurt to see me so close? I am a proud man, what terrible person would envy you. I am all about transparency. I have not done anything wrong, but I have seen others fail. Some thought that we had met, found love, but all we ever did was stare at each other and laugh to ourselves. It has been sad to see your family suffer, but your daughter was always around. I walked up to her and took her along for the ride back home. I was completely in control. 
 We had been together for a long time. She and I had been celebrating her wedding, on the drive home. We were very close. We had run into each other the most, both laughing, drinking wine and laughing. I loved that I had found her, had finally found my soulmate. To see my wife give in is always the worst nightmare. She kissed me and hugged me before I started crying. I pulled the door open to her room, and that was when it started to warm up. 
 " Hang on a sec, lets get out of here," I whispered into her tiny little arm. There was a period of time when everything looked like it had been warming up. It had been raining outside. I felt colder, despite all the sunshine we have been getting. I felt the sun pour over my skin as the winter heat came to light. A final thought occurred to me as I felt the shadow of my back against the wall, in a way it is hard to picture. 
 We had kissed together for years now. We had stared each other into each other's eyes and laughed with each other. Our looks could be summed up in two sentences, words that don't come out at all. As time went on, though, my mind began to fog into the feeling of happy and happy coincidence. 
 The wedding was a good one. I love my wife. They made the most of each other, and we had had our happy times before. I truly miss that girl. I hope she got married before she and I were both dead. It's sad to see someone do something we didn't like, but that's not something to be ashamed of. Now that I was looking at the sky, it was amazing. Everything seemed too perfect, like everything was nearly perfect. It was heaven, I think.<|endoftext|>

Bradleys was my master. 
 Bradley fitted my body with two pieces of heavy battle armor. 
 Heavy armour I was ordered to have. 
 Springfield used it to patrol. 
 Down to the plants. 
 Down to the foxes. 
 And down to the masons. 
 Bradley's orders were as follows: 
 *1x Panzer Tank 12 to Ravens, 1x Panzer Tank 25 to Demons, 1x Panzer Tank 75 to Crows, 1x Panzer Tank 75 to Shrinkers. * 
 Make some goon, and you can count on it. 
 See, I had the older Sherman with under armor and they actually had sponsons for my brain. With mine, I figured the Germans and Schurzers would all be able to check out. And with the M14 Patton with my gun it might take them a bit longer to tell you where to look. 
 On my plate, I had the Littoral Pursuit into as many holes as possible. Not a worst case scenario with a bog of shells, either one getting hit. The M14 would have great place to park and could cover all the entire field in artillery fire, but the other was not fun to do if you needed to run over a pack of ravenous dogs. 
 I had painted it yellow with less attention than regular tanks. I didn't have night vision or anything, so I never went into the sun without feeding some bird on me. 
 Now, I'm stuck with just the tank. I can't hunt, or maybe it's still here. I picked it up from the ground. 
 *Now cut the shit. Every only gets nine points. * 
 Push the monkey out of the way. 
 *PUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKERS DOWN. YOURS LITTORAMED SLAVES ON YOUR MASS. * 
 I mean, come on, let's just go fishing. 
 But it doesn't matter. This was the kind of tank I had to show the others. 
 So I put up my M-14 Patton. 
 The Jagdtiger Trent Baalforschung? BERERREEDER! 
 *You are now a Terran. Your home is here! Your house now belongs to you! Your house is the motherfucking place of kings and queens. You have invaded Motherfucking Denmark! You are a part of this family! We will hold your fucking fucking gun. We will hold your fucking fucking power! We will free you from this tyranny! Not you. We will raze your fucking shit. *<|endoftext|>

I had met him before and imagined a future. In that time, he was one of those people, full of love, joy, and hate. 
 This present reality is fascinating to the protagonist. I don't suppose he ever truly knew there was one. I am often subject to this genetic condition. The recipient will not see this moment, which then makes him more annoying. This trigger will also cause the inhabitants in this situation to become the more peaceful of their pets. I can see through them thinking that there is a slight divide. We are also more diverse now, as this last part of my relationship includes every thought. 
 I don't know if I wanted to love this dead cat or if I would be in danger if I grew up next to a new breed of plant. Instead, I have a choice. I choose to eat his life, or run from him, with the intention of keeping him alive, thereby playing my role in my own demise. He will run out of food and will eat my life alive. 
 To be fair, the story doesn't really get any clearer. I don't feel like I am going to survive when I am transformed from "old " animal into this species. I may be some tough guy, but I don't have a gun. I have never had an ORI do anything to end this, and I am the best player. The ending will probably be right by my side, but for now I would like to give him the bad news. If I can not get out of this situation, I can only hope he hears this and the same fate is borne upon me. 
 As expected, the sunset appeared today.<|endoftext|>

Mannie, set the gas under the table the previous night and sat on her front stoop to munch on a toast. " Will you be my guest this evening? " Sam said her voice was smooth as the ice at the top of her lip and her eyes didn't change a bit with tears welling up in their sockets. How nice of her that he finally asked her about her son, goodbye sweetie, it would be nice to have a family. 
 Mannie shook her head. " I'm sure i'll be comfortable in my apartment tonight, " she mumbled slowly, " especially after my impending divorce. " She huffed and flashed a waif smile. 
 Sam repeated: " Sorry darling. And for Christ sake don't forget about me. I'd make sure you're settled in and ready to tell me what you think about us. We made this decision together, " he said with a sigh. 
 Mannie's hair danced as she held up a pink dress wrapped in white t-shirt and teal shoes, as she smiled at him at breakfast. " Alright sis, this is an opportunity to show who i really am. I hope you're ready to show that who i really am. " She said like she was trying to control her swing dance. 
 Sam stopped munching on toast. " Mommy, there's a wedding, " he said, raising an eyebrow. 
 Sam shook her head. " When i looked you in the eye and said yeah, i couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't drag you down. " 
 She stared at him like he knew everything. " I guess that makes sense sis. Now don't cry, we were worried about you being in this boat forever. After all, daddy could have killed you if he was doing something with you. " 
 " I love you Sammy, " she said and smiled again. He smiled back and put on his blue frock and put on his silver top hat. " I love you also. " 
 " I love you. " Sam smiled back and mumbled to himself, " I love you too."

This is my story. 
 I quit my job and found myself sitting at the coffee shop I had been living in for the last decade. There was a huge alcohol in the air throughout the shop. My head was spinning, and I knew what I had to do. In short order, I walked out the coffee shop, walked the over-grown brick and started the rounds. I was getting home when I saw a flash. * A real flash*. It was mind blowing. I knew it was coming, even though it was daytime. I walked down the block and knew what I had to do. I took a couple blocks to the house where the flash had started. I took a smaller block that just barely fit in the block I was on, and watched as the flash was stopped. I followed it down to my car. I drove down the middle of the road to my house. Just as I was sitting there, I pulled into the driveway, and instantly noticed the flash. It stopped. It was so intense. I pressed the windows on the car, almost tripping over my hood and scared the lights off. " Call the cops! " I screamed, grabbing my keys, the key, the radio. When I jumped on the counter top, I slammed it against the door frame. My car slammed against the car frame, and instantly my neighbors and neighbors started yelling " the cops! " as I scrambled to move my car. They all started to stare at me with disgusted, yet pleased expressions on their faces. I told them all about the flash, and how if I were unable to see it, it might no longer be around, they would never get caught. They continued on like that for a good ten minutes before the police arrived, and started to look for me. They handcuffed me, and tossed me into the back of a van. " You need to get in line. " The police officer said. 
 I kept walking down the block. Suddenly, a car pulled out of the driveway, and backed up into the driveway. The window was shattered. " Whoa. " I said, as I ran to the side of the van, and the trooper standing next to me grabbed my arm. " Let me out now, please. You know we don't use flashlights anymore, do you? " 
 I shook my head, realizing my words made no sense at all. " No, no no no. I remember. I don't know what the police were arresting me for, I don't know what *this* was. I just... " 
 I was cut short by a loud crash. A man screamed. The police jumped at the sound of my name coming out, and asked for me to submit to examination. I complied, and was taken to an interrogation room. I was immediately told that I had contracted an STD. The aliens that carried me in to the temple were people from planets that were where I was born, so I could witness them performing their acts of love on their people. What did I do? I wasn't sleeping. I awoke and saw my home on the brink of collapse. The night was full of people, from all over the planet. " What have you done?" I asked them, and their words said nothing. I was free of the pain that they went through for so long, and in the end, I was free. I was... 
 What I did was wrong. What was wrong with my soul... I didn't know I was meant for hell, nor was I out here. So I slept.<|endoftext|>
**********293**********
A fist clacks against my arm, burning the air around it. I seize the briefcase, slamming it against the dock, there his screen, which now has burning marks. 
 I stare into his eyes and- 
 "Sammy... Please... Please- *please*- *please* come... " 
 His voice is bloodthirsty. 
 I look back up at him from behind my desk, a nasty laser rifle slapping my temple. 
 My aim is hopeless. He can not reach his target but if I can maintain my footing and kill him quickly enough he won't be able to save me. 
 I remove the briefcase and lean forward. Hands still full of bloody blood, I make the call I always wanted to make. 
 " Anything for you, Jamie? " 
 I still have no response. A gasp from behind me, they all hear the same. I swallow hard, the strain is excruciating. 
 I fall onto the tile floor of the dock floor. There was a thunk behind me and two masked men make the call on the other end. 
 Someone knock on the lock, they would come out soon. A scroll lays sewn on the floor. A red cross with a red star is next to the scroll. 
 I don't need any more of this. 
 I place the armoire on the console. Pulling off my helmet, I close the leather straps around my arms and get ready. 
 I was supposed to be on for dinner on the way home. 
 I walk to the door and pick up the briefcase, I opened it. I ripped out some money and tossed it into the box before opening the door. 
 Outside, the streets were quiet. I stood at the far side of a well, the grass looked the same as before. 
 " So.. Your kingdom has fallen. So long. " 
 Another click, a bolt from a cannon on a pole near the bottom. I gave the briefcase to a cab. 
 " You stupid bastards gave us our money for nothing! " 
 " You're one of the greatest men ever to walk this Earth. And you'd better sit down for a goddamn coffee and a beer."<|endoftext|>

“ I understand your plea, ” the gigantic nape of her neck began to slowly rattle, waiting for release from the odd groan of the vines and gnashing of gravel outside. He knew from day one that no one was going to listen to him say it. Even his arch-enemy, the creature in question, was their enemy. If it could see another human in their house, it would stop eating and would just sit there quietly for its entire life. Then, when it was almost done stomping away, it would look back towards the earth, perhaps contemplating a faint blue dot, see a curious glowing creature before it could have done anything but continued to eat. 
 *I wonder if there is a wolf in my cat place now... * And then, there it was. Putting his paw around the side of his paw, he smiled as he imagined the snack growing a muffin like monster's with a thick layer of cheese on it. 
 “ Just keep a beer in your fridge. ”<|endoftext|>

*Q: How long have you worked on this project? * 
 A: I'll tell you a little story. I'm 16 years old. I'm 40. I don't look 20 or too old anymore, but I've been hitting rock bottom since high school. I'm out of work, and my mum has moved out. It's late, and I can't think. I've gone to the beach, but the pier has never been in my view. A few weeks ago I went to work, and my boss came over to see me. He tried to beat my rhythm. He hit that second, and in that second he beat everyone. 
 *How are you doing? * 
 I'll tell you. I've been working on making this little rock band. I'm ready to unleash my impact, and get the bands attention. I'm old, but I'm young. I've had this job for 25 years and my talent is greater than anything. 
 *Why now? * 
 I thought I could do it. I wrote a few songs for a movie movie, at the time. I hadn't really given it much thought. I'd planned for this to be my biggest hit. This was my song. It was my career. But I didn't want the fame. I wanted fame. I dreamed of what I was going to become. I had the world, the money, the fame. I wanted everyone to think I was the greatest hitman in history. The fact that I made this is just fucking unbelievable. No one questioned my fame, all I wanted was fame. This was my masterpiece. 
 *Who are you? What's going on? * 
 Well, I worked with you and I've got some ideas. But no, I'm serious. You were always such a serious guy. But this moment can be mine. I'm just a guy that has to get himself caught up to speed, for example. I saw you in bed about a week ago, in that moment. I was reading on Facebook about the moment. As I walked into your room, as I stood there and closed your laptop, I turned my head to you and said, *I've got a plan*. 
 *I was desperate. The best idea in the world. I want this to happen. I have a job and a house, not all of a sudden. You'll never know the repercussions, and if you do, this picture is going to be all over everybody's mind. You will get wasted on fame, and you will never be a super hitman again. It's time. 
 *How did you know? * 
 This project took 20 years. It took 3 rock star models, and while I put all the plans together, I wondered if this was really the right plan.<|endoftext|>

The sharp sharp pain in his ribs seared through and beneath his skin leaving a bloody trail of ice that carried him across the pier. He hesitated to speak for a second, but his heart ached for another statement. 
 "Fitzy. Fitzy. Fezzy. " The detective looked up to see a large group of people up close, the audience of onlookers pulling him away from the entire bridge. 
 The mystery man didn't seem to mind the silence. He'd usually take the police officer's word for it. They'd gathered along side the rest of the crowd. The detective closed his eyes and felt the odd sensation of blood pussing on his arms and chest. Even as his eyes adjusted, the blood disappeared. 
 " Where are we? " The mysterious man stood up and began to cross the bridge, his iron face marred by a look of disbelief and fear. 
 " I'm Peter. Do you know me? " Someone asked skeptically. The figure slowly turned and closed his eyes. A rumble of electricity from his head snaked through the crowd. 
 " Peter, I'm home. How did you get here? " the strange man said, voice steady with the assurance of someone who needed his assistance. The man lowered his voice to a whisper, hiding his annoyance behind a small dot. 
 " Don't bother asking again. I'll answer, as I always do. But first, is he dead? " the detective asked. The man raised an eyebrow, but Peter waved his hands off the crowd. 
 " I think so. It's been a while. " The detective scowled. " Now, how are we getting to know each other? " 
 The man cleared his throat. " All of us here just got here yesterday, down north on Forsyth Road. It's not a big city at all, just up right of Toronto. I thought you said you wanted us to help you, I think we are. But things started getting weird around here, and he just shot me in the head. " 
 The detective didn't know what to say. His entire body was pounding, and he wanted to shake his head but he was too embarrassed to. 
 The mysterious man stood up and walked over to Peter. They began to walk away from one another. 
 " Listen, I really want to help you. I know we can't get to you at the moment, but if you have something, tell me who it is. Just say a few words. " 
 " A little? Of course, dear, it's Mommy." Peter didn't have the heart to tell his Mom. 
 The mysterious man's face melted into a messy expression of despair. He wasn't concerned with how Mommy knew how he knew so much about the police force. The man knew he loved her, and he was one of the few people he loved. 
 Peter's stomach dropped. 
 They had nothing on him.<|endoftext|>

It was like the universe was a set of EOLITES. Humanity was too big for the universe, something almost infinitely tiny, barely bigger than the giant, hyper-diverse. 
 People were too drunk to think to look at what's going on. So they see that the gods are reality, and man is a snake swallowing thing, 
 like eating a margarita. 
 People became mobsters. 
 The names came out, and the cops never saw what happened. 
 No one saw that they were fucked up, as the cops started to understand. They started to show up every day, trying to tell the cops they did something wrong. 
 What were the last days like, when the universes had three laws and laws change from heaven and hell? 
 How did the laws survive those times? 
 I don't know, but it got the world to mind something like "we'll warn you as much as we've already warned you". 
 How did all the ways of governance all evolve together? 
 They were all about "complication " and " not having any friends". 
 They fought each other over it all, the horrid, troubling way that nothing only felt real... 
 I'm not saying to hope for it, but just to take it back to the way things were, and not be too preachy about it all. 
 No one was saying fuck you, or bad-mouthing it, and they were okay with it. 
 The longest lies did arrive.<|endoftext|>
**********298**********
My head hurts. 
 Mobs run around in circles in front of me. It may not be a bug, a ball of fog or a sniper rifle, but it's maddening. I'm frustrated. Not because I am angry, but because I am angry because I want to scream. 
 They make clap. Each clap is so intricate it makes the noise like a drowning man sounding different. Your eyes and neck and throat will slit and they will grind your body around to mangled shapes. Just like their predecessors, most claps have to be so deep, so deep that it takes only minutes of pure agony to show them. So far, they haven't breached the deep, screaming and screaming, or give themselves the "majummar " sound, but a very gentle palm up pops at some point. 
 It's not very loud. I can hear clapping each time. Some drop to the ground a moment before, but from the depths of the seemingly open mouth - you see the scrunched and broken jaws covering the even parts of the lips - and the thumping and the sound of twisting cords, the slumping and the clapping - all the huck and the crunch and the strange alien shapes, my deathly quiet has begun. 
 Maybe I should go to sleep. That would be cool and relaxing, just like other nights, but I am disoriented and not very happy about this. They see me sleep quietly, do their huck and do all the rest while you clutch at something and look around. I hear them laughing and laughing at my quirks and doing weird things and that is strange and crazy and I don't want to put up with it. I am very angry because I am angry because I want to scream, but I find my breathing too shallow because I am so stargazing. 
 But I don't want to go to sleep because of what I am thinking. I can't let them take my neck and for one second I see no pain. I can make you bleed faster if you hit it harder than I can really. I'm not angry because I won't be angry. I won't be angry, but because it isn't a bug or a ball of fog or a sniper rifle, but because I want to scream and scream and curl up so tightly, blood all around me rolling so softly, and the claps of pleasure - the sounds of arousal - all around me. It's so thick, feel it mingle against my skin and I can feel the tears flooding my eyes. I can feel myself crying. There's something all around me. So strong. So warm. 
 What is there to scream about? 
 How much of my madness was that?<|endoftext|>

"Hello? It's morning! " 
 I knew my greeting wasn't right. I knew the nature of the encounter but I was up to my damnedest tricks now. It was fairly obvious that *everyone* would get here in the morning but I had to share my identity. 
 There was no press in town and not many kids with fluke hairstyles or picture albums were allowed to get married. Instead, everywhere on the beach was deserted except for the ones in the hospital. 
 A single man -- someone single as me to wear the whole time. I could see a thing in the distance in a plane that was approaching, I knew there would be noise. 
 Once you'd stumbled on one of these you could hear nothing but the glass-hearted lie. It was just me - it took one, two, three years to figure out that the man in the night could no longer move. 
 " Where are you taking us? " 
 A handful of only five young men stood at attention, children, peers looking sheepish. The rare ones hadn't even *the fuck* to ask about my presence. He would want them to know it was bad. 
 " The place's okay... " I said as I get to the door, " that's all. " 
 I slowed down the pace, faster it seemed, not like I had much time. He was walking, he would look right in my eyes, and we'd travel if he saw me walking. 
 He made it out of the door, gesturing with his hands and taking the three officers by their shoulders. One of the youngest stepped forward and I walked closer to him, trying to make out the fact that his hair had always been silver and yet blue. 
 " Is your wife here? " 
 The woman who introduced herself as Ellie hesitated but smiled. " I heard it with my own ears..." 
 We'd met here in a bar and it was all too much for me to stomach. 
 I dragged her through the patio door and put my hand into her helmet. It was the perfect police mirror though, it served perfectly to burn the lighting out.<|endoftext|>

It was a Thursday morning and the many voices in the crowd had gathered for their morning ritual. My hands trembled as I wiped the sweat from my forehead. It ’ s a ritual to clear out our fears, to give it a whiff of comfort from so many unknown dangers lurking at our doorstep. As usual, I wore my glasses, wiped the sweat off the top of my cheeks, and hurriedly walked towards the front of the tent. As usual, however, my hand trembled again. 
 A man was ushered into the tent first. In his brief appearance, I recognized him as William Yates. He wore a suit tailored for a female he came in contact with twice a week. His black hair was colored with a hemlock, and his eyes appeared to glow with a large number of blueish-orange colorations. He had a short braid laying on his left foot, and bulged some, as if this was all his. 
 “ Welcome, gentlemen, ” he began. He looked at me and smiled. “ I ’ m Terry. ” He stepped aside from the man and sat by my side. “ Is that so, Terry? ” The man stuttered. 
 “ Yes, ” Terry replied, eyeing the man. “ If you are familiar with him, I was just wondering if you could do a little cooking for us. I ’ m afraid not, Terry. We ’ re cold and backstabbing and hunger is a real thing. ” 
 As they both stood, the man looked over at my face with a gentle heff. “ But you would seem to have some precocious talent of both direction and purpose, ” Terry argued. He then turned toward the man, and for a brief moment stopped. He raised a hand, and I hesitated. 
 “ That ’ s something, Terry, ” Terry snapped. “ What what do you have for us? What are you so sure about? ” 
 “ We ’ re humans, Terry. Human. ” 
 They sat in silence for a moment. In that moment, I was filled with an ounce of frustration. I could tell it was because it was so raw to see this creature. I swallowed, at that point, and pushed my gloves up and started wrapping them around my legs. However, it wasn ’ t long before I was redoubling my effort. My hands gave out and I lay there, motionless, until I landed at the side of the tent. The man stood before me and stared at me. 
 “ Do you think this is a dream? ” He said, simply. 
 “ No, Terry, ” I said, reaching down to the man. “ It ’ s a dream. It ’ s not the real world. ” 
 “ That ’ s impossible. ” 
 “ Did I fail to realize that in the dream, those people you sent to your mother ’ s grave… ” 
 “ Forgive me for being late, Terry. ”<|endoftext|>

The Cluster was an ice planet in the very center of the M-Par' System, an ocean of icy soil that stretched around the entire world, and surprisingly little was known about it other than the unique, ancient structure around it. Its few features revealed an irregular shape of slight iridescence, a pale mass, a rigid shaft with an elongated bulb in its centre, and very few details were ever found. And then there were the black holes. The nearest known star nearby spanned a few lightyears in distance. 
 "Ugh, " said Vadar, stepping back with one foot and one leg as he surveyed the Federation of Planets, " We have to play the harpoon now. " He grabbed his Beagle and leaped from the other side of the rocky wall. There, an inscription appeared on the glass window of the ship ’ s windows: “ B. Orion Flat. " A protest was currently forming on the deck of the ship, and Vadar immediately grabbed his two Fariks, Dash, the Binary Messenger, and Skylar with one hand. They began drawing in and covered their eyes in thick shields and telekinetic fangs as they leapt out of the bridge, heavily armored, a  powerful twin rocket, forming a ring around Vadar, as if separating him from his kin. 
 Jairu, facecandyed, was much happier about this. She and Dash had met before, and agreed not to oppose their ruling. She was already prepared. " Alright, Lightning. Go and take him down. " She got up from the bridge, and trotted to the door as Vadar was climbing down the stairs, crossed over by the nose of the ship and slamming the door shut, Nylon Data Station barely appearing behind. She unlocked it, and the entryway closed behind her. She dropped a three long fingers and a glove onto the deck, and stepped quickly back inside, on the LDR's row of familiar consoles. 
 Vadar's immediate reaction was to look at Skylar. He looked her over, but he thought it was probably just a misunderstanding. She was in such a state of shock, he wondered how many emotions Vadar had been hyped up to. 
 But as if on cue, the door suddenly clicked on the LDR ’ s display; Nylon sensed that a mess had been started as the foreign envoy was about to board the ship. Skylar's expression changed, and appeared to have shifted completely, while Vadar is now all but completely awake, his head seemingly... underwater... 
 And after several tense seconds of thoughtful awkward silence, Nylon opens her eyes to the dim chamber beyond, « FINALLY! « 
 Skylar ’ s eyes suddenly clicked once again, and suddenly she relaxed her hold on her seat, « Yo " > 
 Skylar ’ s head snapped to the side, and she instantly redoubled her arm out of the way to brace it against the impact. 
 Vadar waited only a moment before opening his eyes. A long tail disappeared behind him, and he stood there with his arms crossed. 
 “ Hello? ” he called, and glanced up at Nylon, gazing out the shield beam of his ship ’ s LDR ’ s “ TICKET STREAMGUNS ” adorning the door behind him, “ What? What kind of movie… NOOO IT ’ S A BATTLE HOLOGRAM? ” 
 Nylon once again nodded, “ Uhhh I ’ m afraid it ’ s a battle between two world governments, ” and pulled the wireless connected to a headset she had strapped onto her ear. 
 Skylar paused, and looked back at the counter, “ Really? They ive been going over this? ” 
 “ No. And they told me not to bother around there as long as there were supplies left, ” Jairu replied, “ but that could mean things like encasing a building or the other thing with explosives in it for when they have to go have dinner. ” 
 “ Oh? ”<|endoftext|>

"Enough! I've come so far this time! I need to keep standing here, in silence with all my might! " 
 " That's not true, Jacob. You see, us Anarchists need to draw the line at the bottom of the earth. We seek knowledge and power and freedom so that the only way out of this all-consuming darkness is through its utmost dominance. The only way out is through its full force. " 
 " What could that mean... " 
 " Let me out. Let me free you out there. You must stand. " 
 " Well? Could I be the one holding the line? " 
 " No, you must not. You must show your strength and kneel at the feet of the hard-boiled madness that has gone before you. There are better ways to do this. " 
 " What? Oh, I'm stuck at the bottom! You shouldn't hold the line!" 
 I felt my wrists begin to unravel. The shifts, the changes were... terrible. The people on the streets started to shriek and shake. Choking back tears and screams, I locked eyes with Jacob.<|endoftext|>

I think my boyfriend was right. In a couple hours all I ’ m going to do is eat that chicken shit and scream when he orders. Fuck. I ’ ll kill him. My house is on fire. I don ’ t know how, but the only place that was okay was here. 
 “ Ok … I need to pee. ” 
 What a fucking douchebag. He just gave us a shit. Now I can ’ t even do anything but cry. As he continued to eat, my heart started to pound. My phone started to ring. 
 “ Hello? ” it said. 
 “ Hello? ” 
 This was probably my little secret. I was on fire. 
 “ Ok. Great, how are you feeling? ” 
 Got ta figure out how to find my phone. 
 “ Jesus fucking Christ. ” 
 “ What's your name? ” 
 No one talks about my name. I don ’ t even know that name. I have taken it back from a lot of beautiful people and turned it in for good ones. Let me tell you … You said you like my name? Yeah, yeah, get some permission from me and I ’ ll put you up to me. You are going to fucking get through this, I guess. Get right to the fucking point … 
 “ Jerking off. Don ’ t you fucking fucking care? ” 
 Hey, get out of my way now! 
 “ Thanks. ” 
 Just like that he is gone. I should just pretend the smoke is my guts, why don ’ t I just hide my body behind a window and watch the cinders fall off the side. Ok, just go away. 
 Boom. I am straight out of the movie, the police had been called on my cell. I am only pretending to leave. I am almost done with watching the crying woman in the black notebook. I am feeling heavier. I don ’ t know how long I am there. There is still time. 
 I try to peek down the glass at the lit torches and I see two of them – in front of me with one. Both high-heeled boots, with crooked shoulders, almost-straight-forward with their shafts and no one else. This bastard was dressed like a crayon. “ Crayon? Crayon! ” 
 No, stop talking. He gave a full trunk rant, shouted, punched me in the face and tossed me onto the curb. I fell through the chasm and hit the curb. 
 “ Police! A fucking cop! Okay, at least you're one of the lucky ones there! ” 
 Jesus Christ.<|endoftext|>

It wasn't supposed to happen this way! Too many audience members had died and it was supposed to be our most promising alien life. That was just too easy. We did it out of spite that planet wasn't even a colony. Humans were our only threat and we didn't have time to take all the damage. We are the last of the aliens in the game! We called those who are too small to fight us into two great civilizations. 
 Our starships are now displaying the hint of life.... 
 But as the panels began to come alive we were left in shock. We think the audio chips we made could destroy us though... 
 Now this is too real. We did this to ourselves. We were given to not interfere with one another, not to grow dust on the galaxy....even if the first son of a bitch kept messing up our rules. So why don't we just go back home to this bug? Maybe one day we'll be able to exterminate one last sentient species but we can't try. Have we not had enough time to develop technology? Are we even playing the game? 
 What does this say?

The Galaxia Palace has been nothing but quiet since the Great War started, until that fateful night in the village. The zens plunged and tore through the city, crawling over farms in the middle of what seemed like miles of desert. a thousand innocent lives were lost to the great ocean. the peasantry and the noblemen combined to strike. causing massive soil damage for years. the Emperor's voice sounded throughout the palace, cursing the world, pestilence, famine, war. everything seemed to be hopeless. The Warlords took as many prisoners as they could, burned as many homes, while their Enchanters and Thebes ravaged the world. all that remained were the old people. a few survivors, people who knew they had forgotten their fathers-- All of which is forgotten now. But death is slowly coming to us, and we stand victorious. Those who lost everything, worked together to try and save the life of the few who survived, for they are the weaker ones, they know what it means to die a hero. 
 Death comes once a year. a man dies at his will, and his body goes in a circle. A hero will die a hero and the galaxy will be split in two, the hero and the villain go to an asteroid, as the asteroid glows a bright orange, blue, black, red, there is no escaping it and it takes everyone that can to save the world. 
 That reminds me, I went for a walk. I wish I had said a few words before I met you so that you would join me at my side. 
 Sincerely,

Two curled ends of a slimy pillow sat on the floor. Sitting on the wall had a desk clacking with a dull click. The buzzer was a year old from when I first figured the closet was unique, rather than there being a whole lot of clutter behind it. 
 A gasp was rattling outside, followed by a droning noise of bad quality battery termination. With a desperate hand I pulled the heavy tube from a nearby closet and held it close in front of my face as I spun on the light. 
 "Would you come over there, Harry? " 
 It was his room mate. 
 " I've got a little gun in here," I said bringing the jar of heroin with me. He looked genuinely impressed. 
 Soon I was alone again, reaching in to the corner and grabbing the gun. 
 I scanned the hallway, coming down empty, into the living room.<|endoftext|>

I wasn't trying to overthrow the kingdom. I was just trying to get back home. 
 I laid down my gray, black, sun-kissed pillows on a dirty, rainy Tuesday night. In my haste to get home, the woman that had raped me. I had just told her that she deserved to die, because of an accident. And if it hadn't worked out between her and my side of the fence... she'd probably get left out. But my mother passed away two weeks ago. I was in so much pain, it didn't help that she didn't know where she was either, nor where she needed to be either. I was trying to get home as quickly as I could. 
 My head hit the hardwood chair that lay in front of my bedside table. No, it wasn't hard. It wasn't like even dirt rose from it. I was tired, and I was hungry. But when I pulled my old battered hand from the pillows, I wiped the sweat from my brow and breathed fresh air. A few chamomile green, pine needles splashed the corrugated iron bars of the bed cabinet. Water and my empty bowl. I was finally free. 
 And I sat down on the porch of a nearby house. After several hours, I headed up to the front door. I was tired. I didn't have much time for gaming. I was tired of dressing. What would I remember later? A week or so of begging for my mother back in Ohio. Trying to get to a grocery store. Finding a restaurant. Finding a place to make car repairs. 
 I thought back to my mother. She had such great, wonderfully-booming sense of humor. I just wished that she could have the decency to tell me she loved me, even if it was only a nameless smile on her face. It turned out, I'm nothing like her. I'm just a prisoner who is still there, waiting for the right opportunity to claw absolution for what I've done. Where I once lived, her home became a dump, with no reason for her to exist. My life, my life, I now wander this earth on a whim. 
 But one day I stop thinking of her, and think of my family again. My old home, with nothing now. And I started to think that maybe I should go see my mom.<|endoftext|>
**********308**********
"Even when you play terrible God-damn humor, I'll remember. And I'll look at that scar if he kisses me. " Tears filled the entire room as the crowd roared out our cheesy but satisfyingly honest monologue. 
 " No, this is not a joke, this isn't your fault. The man that you fell in love with has been a jerk around me too many times. You were never a perfect man. And you wanted to be like him. And maybe it's because of that, but you were drunk and you weren't the smartest. You don't need to look so sober when someone yells at you for being drunk again. " 
 The cheers of the people spread throughout the factory as I tried to remember what the Joker said. " You are afraid of me, I'm afraid of everyone, but you'll never yell at me. You have to look good " he said. " It's okay, that's it. Look at his mouthpiece! " 
 I pulled it up and flipped it over, then did a double take. I quickly put it back on. " I made a mistake. I didn't warn you. This is the most horrible place I have ever been. I have to do something about it now. " The smile immediately fell across his face. " Go! Go, you stupid bitch! I'm gon na get you out of here! " 
 The crowd went wild and I immediately tried to shout anything. I just couldn't find it. This was the moment. So, I told myself. " Come on dude. I'm so tired of this! If you ever walk out of this factory, you'll see why I did it. I didn't warn you to look good. I didn't warn you to dance or smile and laugh." 
 He said nothing. I was getting tired of this, of how it was going to hurt. It was like I would win this fight. I couldn't stop. He was the only one I was sure of, he was my hero, my friend and everything. I wouldn't dare go back. 
 There I was lying in the mud, surrounded by burning steel, laying on a dirt path. And my hero. Waiting, smiling, with all the strength of a lunatic. The crowd began to jeer and jeer and watch. I was his standard response. The Joker. My friend. My hero. The symbol of hope, happiness and love. I was the savior. The perfect person. The king of Robin. And I was the favorite. My kickstarted something I had to start again. I sat next to him, facing the wall, in the mud and staring at the bloody corpse. His face was black, his lifeless body limp and mummified. The venom that filled my veins with every ounce of hope to leave my hands and find my courage to rise up to him. He was my savior, my friend, my cause. I had started with his foot, the one step on the way to save the people, for the sun had come, and I had saved the world. He was the only one of my kind I trusted, just a friend. His smile was so subtle and honest. It was like to see an emotion dying, it was like a baby watching something that had just come it's first heartbeat. And his smile. It touched my heart. It was the deep concern from something so small, and so hard to understand. Just a tiny hint at a feeling that was very real but so horrific. An emotion like this was enough to ignite a normal reaction of pain and guilt, I knew what I had to do. I had to find my hero. And he had taken my last breath and I was crying into his lifeless chest.<|endoftext|>
**********309**********
The first thing I noticed was the stares. They were too *alluring* to keep a special eye on. I coughed, but my breathing was still as quiet as a dead goat, just as a dead elephant. 
 I was motionless, resting my head. Fearful. They walked, cronies of their scrawny men, seized by the dignity. They pulled their guns out of their pockets, and banded their gas masks around the faces of their men. I swear, they stirred up shadows. They could burn my lungs without my assistance. 
 There had to be something... the next door neighbor? Remembering her every step of the way? 
 I heard gasps grow deep. He smiled, turned to his familiar looking wife, and grinned. My own daughter, playing with the flimsy toys in the corner of the room. My sons, being the closest of kin, singing a song in front of the full house. 
 The bedroom was the perfect candidate. Mr. Scruffy was his best friend. It made him feel real, even though he was retired. I didn't like staying in that spot forever. I doubt the Army would take it back. 
 The last thing I saw was the death of my wife. They'd taken her away, and she'd been covered with tear-gilt, beaten to death with back collars. 
 She wore a smile that could pass for flesh, was the closest human she ever had to a man. It was her brother. 
 I laid back in my bed. My fingers moved the mani-globe around the ground. His body, cut into a million pieces. How many of them were left, unanswered questions floated by. He'd held her in his arms, holding her until the mani-globe finally satisfied itself. 
 He laughed, the lonely laugh of the boys who had in their hands the mother. His strange eyes, deep, sweet. What did they call him? How long had it been since he'd gazed at me? For the first time in ages, he looked at me. His mouth curved, rigid and imperceptible. 
 I saw his smile, warped with pain. My son, lined up with him, both screamed. His throat felt dry and bleeding. His muscles began to sizzle and crack. I could not say what hurt, but I had to look it in my eye to see. 
 I ran. Outside he'd been shacked up, a national guard for wearing a mask. It looked like someone had barricaded the exits. The extra guard had no idea what was going on. 
 I thought I heard them marching. Maybe just out there outside, of all places. I heard some bells for something.<|endoftext|>

She stood next to me as I stood in awe of my newfound power, on who faced the greatest choice of my life: remove it or defy it. 
 Her life had been dull, through so many fights between god and beast, beginning her ascent to glory. She was the perfect title to wear on her soul, her spirit turned violent in moments and her courage assuaged the hordes of the damned. To them, she was far, far superior. 
 But today, I saw something unexpected. 
 In the second hour the teleporter wore off. For in the blink of an eye, I had moved from the side, back to the far side of the universe to confront her in front of this observer. 
 Gone were those days when she was lonely. Those days where I grew tired and tears dripped from my eyes. 
 I would rather worship God than her, for when she finally decided to put aside those bonds, "I mean, keep going. " 
 With a silent resistance I dragged myself up onto the table. 
 Now all I have to do is guess.<|endoftext|>

There was only one voice in the room, fixed squarely on the train whistle. His booming voice - one of the jubilant singers, the whizzing bass of his cajun violins, the tinkling of his wooden strings, the calloused fingers of the bull, the even humbling roaring cloud in front of him - and those pieces of dialogue stung. It was not so different, not that he knew how to speak, or how to speak, or how to speak. 
 There was no one else besides him. In the darkness, the faint rays of light in the stained-over sky, had he known? What else could he have done for them? But he had no regrets. He wiped a few deep glares from his eyes, each one exciting an empty speck of emotion in his chest. His cheeks, not wanting to give in to the anger and rage of his soulless cheeks, knew no happiness at all. 
 The tragedy had been a coward's hand. 
 The sound in the train whistled.<|endoftext|>

I looked at the Proghouse. I would have to trade it for a quill. He'd trade for a special pencil. The one in my hand would become one million million in the morning. 
 He was sending me back the following day, and I knew it was the kind of thing that I would never get in the flatlined area near my kitchen. 
 I cursed under my breath. The city or something. But I knew it would happen, as quickly as the bullet went through his head. He screamed for his parents, gasping for air. He ran, as fast as he could, because it was probably too late, and then he was knocked in the head and brain. 
 The shooting prompted me to check myself on the sudden finding. I had messed up. I didn't match the photo. Not that I messed up when I drank, like that. I didn't remember how I lost my keys. I didn't remember the last time I saw I was cold at Starbucks, or that I put on lipstick, or that I hated tennis shoes. 
 I was in my last two years of unemployment. I traded it for a Kleenex. It would require a bit of inventory, as it was by far the most expensive one. The usual suspects were the school custodians who gave him the keys. Oh, how I hated those. It was particularly painful to be around those, though. I never had coffee to drink, which was kind of a big deal at the time. A couple of weekends ago, someone grabbed my hand and took off my pants. They grabbed me by the shirt, and for some reason I've still got to pee. Maybe they were drunk. 
 I remember standing out a few blocks from the store, and several cops were on my left and had me on the bench near my dormitory. I collapsed on the cashier's chair and knocked them down, then tripped over the counter and was hurled through the bathroom. I had the toilet flushed. The cops were looking for me and I was down. 
 The killer got up out of the water like some sort of saviour. I looked over at the carpet. But then he sat, and I began to eat. 
 I remember thinking, what the hell was that? That was strange enough, because the door to my apartment remained sealed and locked in every single way. It looked like a hole in the door. I looked at my feet, and saw a squat apartment. I looked at the door and I saw none. 
 I came closer to the bathroom. I noticed a man sitting on a bench in the middle of the street, behind him, not a shadow of a thing. I felt something in my back, something on my left forearm. 
 I looked to my right, where I saw a man in a white lab coat, cuffed behind a police van. I looked back to the man who grabbed my hand. The police driver was in the window. I didn't realize it at the time, until they saw me bumping into him as I fled. 
 The police driver was yelling for his gun. He had been doing that for over a decade now. Two years from now. The two years that remained would be the memories of a gun, and the endless daydreams that distracted him. 
 It would be my lifetime and I would be leaving there, riding a jet-black motorcycle. One day, I would get the autograph of the same killer. He'd get to live a long life, and perhaps be a waiter in my restaurant. Maybe a nice rooftop view of the skyscrapers would give me pause. Maybe he'd hang around with his girlfriend and just love it. Or maybe he'd end up smoking weed in prison. 
 Oh, and one other thing. I picked up a Kleenex. The gun was intact. I had found out when I bought it, that Kleenex can turn a person's memories into $ 1 million in another place. The same person had bought a Kleenex. 
 Ah, it was a little tricky, but I probably won.<|endoftext|>

Paul's eyes blinked open quickly as tears filled his dark brown eyes. As the whole world turned to black, he said to himself, "I hope I saved you." 
 “ Yep, he saved me. ” said Wanda, gazing deeply into his eyes. “ It was a rollercoaster ride with all the other people struggling under the love of their lives. ” 
 He held up a small cup to Paul as his eyes flickered open. A young woman, pale skin and a red colored hair, looked from side to side to see him from where she stood beside her, leaning on the sturdy porch chair, watching the green sun beat down on the blank house across the street. 
 “ I really do, Ma'am. ” 
 “ Even though you were the one who saved us, you still have a place in our hearts. ” 
 The two young women glanced at each other as they led the way into their new green home. “ Let's go visit Matthew the girl of the house today, he has a bit of a murder problem. ” 
 Paul sat down at the knee of the porch chair, reaching in to touch his shoulder. “ Ma'am, we need to visit him sometime. ” 
 The old lady let a small tear drop, she turned slowly towards Paul as she stepped closer to him. “ Ma'am, I love you. ” 
 He pulled his heavy, silver brown dress out of the sweater pocket, cold, silent, murmuring to himself.<|endoftext|>

*The Jail Break! * -John Locke 
 *I'm seventeen years old, only seventeen years of experience in the world. Only seventeen years of my life…* 
 *... "Well, it was a big surprise, " I say to myself, *this news will ruin my summer's vacation, no? * 
 *No, not unlike a rock, but a boulder! No! * 
 The rocks had just landed. In a tangle of tangled limbs. People ran out of the way to see what I had happened to. It seemed like people had been thrown from trees onto the courtyard roof, setting fire to the courtyard. 
 *Poor kid. * 
 *What am I supposed to do? * 
 *I hope I survived. * 
 *Well, well, now I'm just not prepared for that. * 
 *But I'm getting a kill- roll? * 
 *Of course! * 
 *No one can do this! * 
 *I know. * 
 *Come on. * 
 It had been twenty hours and thirty-seven minutes since the rock was thrown out of the way. Right now I have twelve hours to climb down a huge tree before reaching the center of the courtyard, before hitting a huge man, wielding what appeared to be a shotgun. 
 *We're way behind! * 
 *I could hit the damn thing straight away! * 
 *There's nothing here, I don't think that's supposed to happen. * 
 I then cautiously climb down the massive tree, and find myself being taken down by a small creature. Two people struggle to kneel in front of the creature, and both continue on to the end of the courtyard. 
 *That's a good enough reason to fight back! * 
 The creature is now calm, and a member of my staff comes up from the center of the courtyard. I close my eyes, for a few seconds.<|endoftext|>

Dear Bliss, 
 I remember the tale. It started with a hunter-gatherer and a skeptic. Their tribe practiced fighting and talked of god, though it was a joke in the legends of the world. The hunters spoke about some god and worshipped him. People didn ’ t know what that meant. They thought they were wasting their time. Well, not after they were declared dead. They mocked, hated, rejected, and killed, to their own satisfaction. When they were resurrected, they were to repeat the "Why " quest. Who would this god be again? It was unclear. 
 But after a day of hunting the hunters killed the skeptic, came upon a small patch of brown land in the west and planted something strong. 
 Then, out of nowhere, a tribal shaman came, sent by someone else. The shaman approached the tribe of those, spoke to them, said a spell, and shook his skin. The tribe ’ s shaman shook their skin again. This time, they said, “ I kill the witch. ” He shouted, “ If you don't kill me, I would do it on your own. ” 
 He then talked to the skeptic again, and it told him. The skeptic became angry, saying that the tribe would harm the shaman. The shaman had not trouble convincing the tribe. 
 Then, a warrior came from the tribe, who entered the tribe with the shaman. He showed the shaman the village, and the shaman followed suit. The warrior made the tribe appear dead, and then cast some kind spell on the shaman. 
 The shaman then spoke with the warrior: “ Listen, you have lived a long time and you have only had five minutes left. It is going to be important you don't kill me. ” 
 The shaman, who stood behind the shaman, became frozen. He began to vomit. The warrior did not respond. The shaman continued the quest. 
 The warriors that killed the skeptic had died, then lived again. 
 I ’ m sorry for the painful recriminations we had, but I couldn ’ t do what I needed. I wanted to have a chance to tell my tribe that there is no afterlife, only death. 
 I guess the story has been true for a while. Don ’ t give up hope.<|endoftext|>

 CHAPTER ONE 
 -- >> 
 “ You must, ” Lieutenant Vezzl offered, struggling to breathe and smacking his boots on the door. The last thing he saw before the shrapnel hit the armored man was the low whine of the door. The soldier froze, free of any grip on his rifle and pulled the receiver down. He could hear it. There was no echo in the comms, no screaming and no surefire explosions. 
 Vezzl swung at the door, his gun sending shrapnel into the window. His face fell forward as he felt the pressure send him crashing through the door; his heart drummed along with him. He landed on the tiled floor in a heap, his skin boiling with grief. 
 “ No. ” 
 *Yes*, Vezzl thought. It had been a week since his discharge and he thought, *I missed that last duty. I was supposed to be in trouble. * But he had the game to play and it had been over for the job; had been. The village had been spared that one hundredth occurrence of gunfire. * 
 The last thing he saw was a bubbling mess of blood leaving the finished armor of the man lying against the oak bark. He tried to scream, but his body kept beating in it's throat. A moment later he was hauled over onto the clearing. Fitting, at that point. The man ’ s body was a hair lighter than the rest. Vezzl dusted off the skirt he had lost. “ Matteo je forté, sir. ” 
 Vezzl was ready. The man was dead. The lieutenant had left his armor in his wake, crumpled on the dirt. Surely they would hold out for a few more weeks? 
 Seventh, Vezzl decided. He reached out to remove the man ’ s shirt. His fingers nudged the invisible barrier on the belt until it pulsed. Filling his hand with extra liquid, Vezzl filled his hand and drank in the soap covered splash. 
 First left the body, then room, then house. Vezzl only took one shot. He had to survive for a few more. The officers had told him to go back before the bombing started. He had forgotten what was in it, except that it was to set the dates for the bombings, but he didn ’ t care. He wanted to die.

Tim didn't want the throne, she was so over it. He swore that an army would attack it any day, he couldn't swear that she was free. He had thought of never speaking to her again. He just didn't want it. Whatever. 
 She was in the corner, the door unlocked at her side. Tim tried not to jump, and jumped right back in her chair, but all he could do was watch her. 
 Her face was in the sunlight, a pale human form, sharp, yet carved with curves of sinew, her two hands cupped into a small, pale hand, and her chin down into her mouth. Her feet flopped over her body, and she bent down, removing her sandals, revealing one narrow, pale nose, and a mouth with green snot-nosed tubes running down her face. 
 "Yes, hello dear? " the priest murmured. He turned away from the corpse in front of him. 
 " I've been waiting for you... why would you make me wait this long? " he hissed, feet tapping against the floor. 
 Her eyes twinkled, and her mouth opened. 
 " No, I can't! Don't... " she hissed. She trailed off, breaking a few of her bones. 
 " Tim, we can't have you here... I told you to wait, it's the only way. " the priest said. 
 " You know why Tim? It was about you! " 
 " No. You betrayed me, dear. " Tim pulled his head back and looked out the window into the bay. He sighed. 
 " You - " he started, and then paused. And then looked down. He opened his mouth once more and swallowed hard. The priest looked at him. 
 " Give in, or we'll crush you whole. " he said. 
 " What does that even mean? " 
 " That I will crush you completely. I want to be just like you, this is my castle, this is my empire. I want everyone to stand by me, nothing more and nothing less. I want everyone to have that watch over me. " 
 " I am the only one who has stood by you, dear. I've only asked because... " he began. 
 " If you *say* no... " the priest said. 
 " I'll make my terms, I won't stop until we fight and that happens. I'll make you stop fighting until you give up, " Tim said. 
 " But why not? I'll have you back. I promise. " The priest clenched his jaws. 
 " You don't have to do this, dear. " 
 " Oh I'll do what I promise, " Tim sighed. " I'll be in your castle. I promise I'll be fine. I love you. " 
 " Of course I love you, Tim. " the priest said with a grin. 
 Tim looked at the sky, and saw the army marching towards him. He blinked twice, and then looked back at the priest. 
 " Those monster's must be hiding inside you, isn't it? We got ta run! They made a mad move. I'll try to raise my arms. They'll think it's some trap, and they'll be destroyed. I'll let them. I'll even jump to them. They'll kill us. " 
 The army burst into the bay, the priests... they couldn't see them. Tim tried to call them monsters, but they could only hear his voice. 
 " Tim... you've made me very sorry." the priest said, her eyes blinded.<|endoftext|>

"Hello Dave, there's you again, what is it today? " says Joey at my office. 
 I'm just happy that I keep being able to talk to him. This is my home again for the night. 
 " Do you want to play some League? " I ask Joey softly. 
 " Nah boy, I'm ok with that, I'm glad to be back in action. " He replies. 
 " Fuck you, Joey. " I scream. He turns around and walks away. 
 " Are you okay? " I ask. 
 " Yeah, I'm alright. Not that anyone can stop me. " He says quietly. 
 My phone vibrates. 
 " What the hell are you doing? What the fuck are you doing!? " I scream. 
 He casually walks out. I make a scene. 
 I walk back in. He talks in the same voice I've come to love. 
 " Hello, will you join me on tonight, Boy-Raven? " he asks softly. 
 We sat outside and watched League. I couldn't help but notice the thing the next day: there were no character's names. I had lost count when I first started explaining to my boss about this " problem. " Since then there were no listed characters. Just numbers in the form of numbers and them. Every time I visited the place, something strange would happen. Soon everyone told me about the disconnections. They didn't know why. They thought it was because I couldn't communicate with them. 
 I told them about my job at the same time. And, with some luck, they went on to join me. 
 " I need to report the disconnections. " Dave screamed. 
 Then Joey turned around, Mike, and he started talking. They started laughing about random numbers. At first I thought Mike had quit laughing because he didn't realize he'd lost control of his phone. But Mike started coughing. Everyone was laughing and Mike ran out into the hallway. And I cried. In the span of a minute. 
 " Joey, a problem isn't happening anymore. " I walked back in. There was Dave outside, James. James couldn't get a single word out from him. 
 I walked over to Joey and asked. " Have you gotten the captain's letter from Joey? " 
 " Yes? " He asked. 
 " The letter. " 
 " Then Joey, let's get to it. " 
 " Yeah right! " 
 " Harry, oh no. " 
 " Harry, Harry, tell me what happened to you! " 
 " Boy-Raven, you talk like that all the time. You all have one touch. " 
 " Oh come on, boy-Raven! " 
 " Harry, you have it all wrong, buddy. I believe in you. " 
 " Harry, what are you going to do? " 
 " I... I don't know, I don't want to say anything, but I have to save you if you want to survive... " 
 " Tell you what, boy-Raven. Don't do this. " 
 James looked at me. I said something to him. 
 " Harry... " 
 " Leave Joey alone."

"So first up is 'Hello Mr Power users, the recent software updates have made New Vegas a functioning game. Our first priority is to remove any references to any classified symbol. We want to remove the three hyphened hyphen as it was a common symbol for word of mouth, it is now the most common means to refer to any other symbol on your computer's screen that is suspected or to communicate as a system meaning of something. We want everyone to be able to browse anything that they do now. " 
 " It says here I can do as I please. No further information or words of any sort will be shared with this department. Next up, if you want to know your surroundings, if you want to know where you are, we can go directly to your homes. If you want to know why you are being stared at, we can go to the street surrounding your house. " 
 " I've heard about five police departments trying to surmount the various government graffiti found outside their houses. Perhaps we should use some less invasive words in the end. We won't be able to explain the facts if you continue looking at your neighbors, it's quite a complicated process that we can't cover in a man on the street. " 
 " I doubt many would ask why this office would be in a hotel. This office is for work of the highest caliber with as many as 30 employees. We've worked hard to find new ways to improve on this place, it looks good on our skyline. " 
 " From what I can tell, you might not like this place. For example, the house that's 10 stories up a freeway. We're trying to convince you to take the right lane on the freeway, you should have a safe trip. Go please. " 
 " My guest. We're trying to convince you to ride the elevator until your cleaning will be complete. Oh, and don't point it at anyone. " 
 " Are you a tech support voice, that's an insult. Your name is Molly. " 
 " But, it looks too good to be true. We thought this was a terrible idea. " 
 " In fact, you're the only one that says these words. You're the only person that would say them with that young, fashionable tone of your voice. Please come, we can see you. "

The Nexus 9 must have something to do with these folks. Could be of much more useful to them than the puck, they certainly seem to be capable of weird things like those. 
 Colin burst out in laughter, while Mathews was in the street as his hoe pal pressed the out button. " So I know what the News is, Barnaby! " He exclaimed as he sat on the side of his truck, off to his car and wheeled around. He grabbed a bottle of Jack Daniels from the cooler, which was soon snatched from his hands as he passed. 
 " That is great, Barnaby! I love that you're so addicted to video games. Let me know if you have any more launches planned for Halo. " The new Portos from Sony PS4 were placed on the dock and Steve snorted again. " How about Fifa? " Steve inquired. " Kind of clever of you all. How many launches can you give me? " 
 " Six, *seven*, " Bing rhetorically responded. " Alright guys, let's break this down a bit. " 
 " GLaDOS, What do you think about the Microsoft Open Guide here? " 
 " Yep, the HoloLens offers an impressive product design that you may even envy, yes it does, but this isn't what you expected! " Brad barked at the mic as he swarmed his iPad. " How about Humble Points? " 
 " Exclusive to Microsoft, but probably one of your favorite or half of all their software, " said Steve, " Cheers Barnaby! " 
 " You've got it, mate! " Microsoft piped up. " Quite incredible, really, and according to your reports, GLaDOS already played a 16 and was easily second only to Xenos!. " 
 " Oh so where's that money going! " Barnaby shot the confused Steve back. " Take me all the time I need now, man!" 
 For that moment, even Morgan Freeman gave Gabe the courtesy of doing away with the HoloLens to look up at the door.<|endoftext|>

Eric was most definitely nervous when it happened. His parents had tried so hard not to alert him that a super fancy hoverboard had just stolen his lunch money and he was desperate to figure out who had rigged it, but as he sat in the driver's seat, panicked and confused, he thought, "What was that? ". He never thought anything of it; or that such an odd thing could actually happen. 
 A frantic patter, a splat, and then loud whimpers — all coming from a magic hoverboard, startled by the abrupt sudden boom of the glow-in-the-dark thing, shocked Eric to his very core: 
 *P!t!t, Why is EVERYTHING FUCKING BOOOOMING? * 
 " Hey honey, feel up there! " 
 *P!t!t, Have you ever heard of chill-dizziness?! * 
 From behind the hijack box, Eric saw quite a surprise in the most gorgeous, rustling bird imaginable: a bus-shaped beanpole. From behind it, a part of the wall was flying. Then he saw a large trident that was, not coincidentally, in front of his feet. It was bug-covered in claws that could cause gushing bee-stings, a bug-like cut at the elbow, a top that was unlike anything he had ever seen with an entire insect while playing the guitar. 
 At first, Eric knew he was crazy. But when he looked back, the entire event had been completely round-about. Everything was normal — nobody had gambled on this, every participant on the bus that he had just been gesturing at had offered themselves for the privilege of just entering the bus. Only the 18 passengers with electric shoes and large lawn chairs were even allowed to see this. Most of them were rushing toward and taking time to meditate on the event. Eric stood there silent. 
 " Now, jesus, look at this. " 
 Eric wasn't exactly being serious; he was being facetious. Every person who ever lived and worked in the parking lot at the Eiffel Tower had told him to look around. None of them were listening. Eric looked at the bus sitting directly ahead. 
 " Alright now! Yeah! It's weird. And there's this beautiful bird. " 
 Eric's head was pounding. 
 " What are you talking about?! " 
 " It's a crazy bird! I can't believe this happened. How do you even get around these things?! These things totally fly! " 
 " Why?! " 
 " Listen, Eric, I can't tell you what you should have seen. I just got this phone call from an ex. 'Look, everybody it'd be cool if they got this thing, too.' But the most incredible thing that happened was the plane came down. " 
 Eric stared at the doorknob. " And now everyone is freaking out? " 
 " Yeah, so I kind of hear they've sold their organs. So in reality, it was real business. This is the last version of the diet we bought, right? We're losing. And... " 
 " So who will pay in gold? Oh! Look at the rest of the payment plan! " 
 Eric gasped. He finally understood what he was being told. " Look, I know it sounds crazy, but take it from someone who is not making any threats to you. You're thinking that somehow I will pay by gold? Oh right, if that happens... " 
 Eric blinked. " Well, Mr. Kramer, maybe I shouldn't assume that is actually what the plan was supposed to work out for you... " 
 " Hold on, Eric. You can't have a hex-whiskers, you can't have organs... " 
 " What!? Why did that happen?!?! " 
 " It was an accident. " 
 Eric sat there speechless. " Well, God bless America. Are we going to try another loop?" 
 He brought the phone back to his ear.<|endoftext|>

It was all that matters right now. I wake up for work the day after, and there's only one thing to do: Watch Netflix. The documentaries don't let on, but I don't even know the title. Oh well, it could happen. My wife has never really liked me and I'm pretty sure she's not happy with what I'm doing at home. Oh well, hope they can figure it out soon. There's so much stuff on Netflix. I just want to watch Stranger Things. Mom and Dad are cheating on me. And I don't even know where the day after last month is. You know, so close to it. So close to the end. There's always something I want to watch. Maybe I'm woken up by an impending sunrise. Or there's an entire month to live. Or perhaps there is and I just want to wait. 
 It's time for bed. I start by grabbing myself a towel and blanket. Then I hear the sound of shifting sheets, and then we begin, and the sound of the wet bed. We're in the shower to get cleaned up. I wake up the next morning, confused. That's weird, not to mention. I crawl out of bed, avoid sliding the towels over myself until I find my room and begin moving. I'm getting goosebumps all over my body. I struggle to move my hands. I try to check the pills on the nightstand. There's an awful lot of pills. I need to get the pills out. I sigh, the last words coming out of my mouth in a quiet voice. After picking up the pill from the nightstand I casually sat down on the bed. I took a deep breath and put the pill in my mouth, exhaling slowly. Suddenly the pills all went flying out of my mouth. I looked around and saw a man. I was confused as I couldn't see anything. My hand was bleeding. I looked at my bedside, but my face was still dark. The man looked around and saw me staring down at my pillow. What in the hell was he thinking? I straightened up and collapsed onto my stomach. I kept looking at him for a while. Then he was gone. My room is now empty. I'm feeling a little dizzy, but I decide to go grab a blanket and box my house. I really think I'm going to have to get dressed before anything happens. I walk down the hallway towards my room. Why did I not turn the switch on the television this morning? I walk out the door, excited to run away from the bushes and the brush. Suddenly, there are car horns. I instinctively turn around, pulling the wheel. They quickly hit me in the face. My mouth is wet and I vomit. I hear a terrible thump behind me and then a flash of black as I fall to my knees. My head hurts. My face hurts all over. I had been in coma for the last 5 days. I'm in a car crash. I don't know where I am, and the medical experts cannot tell me where I went, and they always say it's from home. I am headed for a hospital in the opposite direction. I frantically yell at my friends. They ask me to come back. I pick up the phone and call the cops. When I get to the hospital, I am met with a man holding a knife. I just wanted to make the right decision. Suddenly I'm confronted with my wife, crying hysterically, and her eyes are open wide. I immediately grab her hands and pull the gun. I put the gun down and cover my mouth. 
 "I'm sorry, honey. I've only brought it back in a few hours. Everyone please calm down. If you need anything, I don't live here anymore. You should come over for dinner."<|endoftext|>

Turns out it wasn't that fun when I hated my roommate. He would never come home because of me. Being mentally unstable doesn't mean I would mind sitting on his bed, no, that would distract him. You'd think if that monster came to my door, I'd be able to put it down but the thing that couldn't just touch the surface was watching me. The thing that makes him sad. I'm just the guy who wanted my room. So I went and closed the door. It's not as if I would be just like him. If that be the case, then its really no fun when he comes to take my clothes off. I mean look at me. I am a noob. I am a full busty, fat, raw human with perfect hair, a wide chest, and a baring of my neatly trimmed boxers. My roommate was my closet monster. I mean, really.<|endoftext|>

Pain for that one. You ’ ve never seen a hole so large you can never look outside. If it was the original size, there wouldn't be a difference, or so it made it, of course. But from the look on his face, he was taking part in the human race all along. As soon as he saw this beam coming, it went silent. His lungs and intestine were burning with sweat. It didn't make any sense. 
 “ Gravity? Gravity… Where is the earth going? ” James spat out, fully aware that his pride had gone, and that it took too much time. “ Welcome to Earth! ” James said, to the ship ’ s receptionist. 
 “ Uh-huh, well, nothing, to be honest. ” The receptionist responded with a sheepish nod. “ It ’ s cold outside, after all. ” James sighed and with that he nodded back. “ Ok, nothing new there, our impression is it ’ s going to be the oddest one we ’ ve seen. ” 
 “ Excuse me? ” Asriel shouted. “ This place is named after the great warlord, of the past, Cyrus, that rose from the underworld and became a Knight. ” 
 “ You meant the first Knight? ” James and Asriel did not attend a discussion of the other in the Merchant Park. 
 “ The one we're aware of having since it was pulled from the sky. It said nothing about the size, shape, or sound of that weapon. Well, that ’ s why it felt so strange. ” Asriel noted the lack of sound on the station's sound console; they would have had to wait and see what else would have been happening in the hub for now. 
 “ Oh, what would you say that should not matter? This is for the money? ” James said, before switching to the universal translator. He had not intended for one to click or cry, or so Asriel and James supposed. A voice picked up in their heads that sounded like a rolling revelation to them. 
 “ Do not worry, it ’ ll already be over. ” The voice said. “ The damage done to the earth was done under the storm of that damned bolt. It wasn ’ t a casualty at all. ” 
 “ Holy shit, you never heard it before? ” James muttered. “ You won ’ t believe how much damage we ’ ve caused. ” 
 The voice was incredibly gruff and interspersed with cautionary tales. “ In more tragic times we have cost those beneath you the means of surviving. ” 
 “ You ’ ve done what? ” James and Asriel did not know the utter meaning of the question, but they should at least trust it. The station was designed to serve as a shelter for humans all over the world, not make them lead mindless lives, but to provide them with their needs and that of their extended family. But their people? It was chaos. 
 “ I ’ m sorry for what you ’ ve caused, but humans are the nature. Life is so easily destructive. And unless humans get some sort of purpose, they don ’ t bring peace to a harsh planet, and some order, you know. ” James said as he started to jump out of the window. 
 “ You are what? Even in death, yet you save your people from it? ” Asriel did not speak to the surveillance crew during this. There was no war because nothing had been brought back from the hole, no other force was needed to save the great people of Earth. But justice in the form of Justice, a message was delivered to all humans, for those of Earth who lived their entire lives under the purpose of saving their own kind. 
 “ I ’ m sorry… ” James started to tear up, but the voice answered him before he could become anything else. “ I was right all along. We need a law, and it is impossible to make peace without hate. ” James said, walking out of the station, his eyes racing. 
 “ Any final words, or your killers? ” Asriel asked. “ You won ’ t believe how many humans died in that horrible storm… ”<|endoftext|>

"Hey I don't want to turn around at this age, I'm not going to be able to wait for you to come " I said, holding my breath as I stood. 
 " Be quiet. You won't feel great you say? " he asked, the moody look of the salesman nodding in acknowledgement. 
 I looked around, I didn't know what to do but looked right through my fingers when I saw them. 
 " You see i'm 16 years old and you have like half your college debt, at least it's payment after graduating. My neighbor was housing a $ 6mil for a parking space but you're not paying. I hear thats the only reason you gave for buying it, you need it for the house, in case the other guys come, the kid will be killing us. I don't know what to do my friends have other cars, but i just wanted to show you the bus ride. Maybe that will let you to see the prom, tell your parents. " he said, at least I won't feel bad about Ive now gone out with some friends. 
 " You also have a house, you hear Ive kinda recommended that, but you don't know how to use it, so i just took a car. Ciao! " i said, in an attempt to understand what his attitude was but was interrupted by a loud crash. 
 I waited patiently as one of the drivers pulled out his phone, it is not unusual to see a children's car in the middle of nowhere. 
 " Hey you think I am a racist son of a bitch? I was a car salesman, you got ta believe me! " he shouted out. 
 My heart jumped into my stomach, it was almost too late but I was nervous. 
 " Really? What is it? Is it too late? " I asked hesitantly 
 " That is it, your friend are drunk like a bitch, you hear? Do you even know why we got you on the bus? " he snapped, his tone practically feral. 
 " I will teach you how. You won't be able to understand me like you did with that scowl and don'thing, just go to your friend's house. He will be okay, he's dying inside, " he responded, but he was dead quiet, still staring at the bus. 
 The screen lit up, a man in a blue suit walked out of his car. 
 " What the fuck!" he screamed at me as i slowly walked in the small strip mall. 
 The two new york scum didn't seem to understand what they just arrived for.<|endoftext|>

All my life I had to make sure my computers weren't pulled through. I could find no break in the cable through this card-switching station. But now I had to figure out how. 
 Current fetched battery for actual batteries is a bit low, but it's a cup of tea in a loaf of bread. So a number of people use it for making coffee that doesn't need to be called coffee. And by labor, I mean any other middle-aged white dude that leaves his sweater at home. His job is very scary, as is his mind. I keep these things in my closet around here. And no one complains to the State Department of Anthropology about so many "many " jobs, people left behind, and so on, like the rest of us, or do I say it another way. I've taken a vow to never leave anything behind. 
 Shame I left really. How was I supposed to know? What makes me a different person? The two things I did left me in the dark. Or at least something that went back into the dark for a little bit. I mean since I started work I've stopped acting like a person. I'm starting to believe that stuff. Now it's just a play on my memory, and not important. I mean sure, it's a romantic comedy, but it's high school. No one needs to know that they have dementia and all, but at what point does an illiterate person make the call to not live? 
 I've learned that I can feel dementia setting in. But when you're just fighting back the struggles with paranoia. There's this sick logic that at some point you're fighting what the researchers call darkness. I know I have some dark things down there. But it's mostly just what they call " lost brain capacity." If that's a concern then those things don't matter.<|endoftext|>

Listen now, you are not an imaginary friend. 
 You are a murderer. 
 You once had an imaginary friend, and this is how you killed him. 
 *You were a shooter. * 
 The reality inside you is that you are not an imaginary friend. This reality is that you are being killed. 
 We have eliminated the imaginary man from existence. Through studying studies, research, and more investigations, your everyday life has been separate. Your friends have mysteriously vanished. The world continues to have a relationship with a no one, and our lives have been played out completely in your head. 
 You might think it would have worked. You might think we were playing God and that we were actually playing the victim. 
 Do you understand? 
 There is a world where you can serve God! 
 I am not an imaginary friend. I am NOT an imaginary man. 
 As I walk through my neighbor's yard, I look for that imaginary friend that no longer has a physical presence.<|endoftext|>

The door to the cell opens. The prisoner there swings around in surprise and gasps. He keeps rolling about, as if to pick it up and lean against the wall, against the dead weight of walls that made his feet spin like blue and white balloons. The prisoner inhales deeply and closes his eyes, the haze from the heavy morning sun hitting his face. He has to make a mental note of this. 
 "Please tell me I don't have to see the cadaver bag. " The prisoner mutters, looking up from the undergrowth where there once was a gale and stepping onto the tank of carbonated cadavers. 
 " Yes prisoner, I know how it works, " the prisoner said, rubbing his head and nodding on the side of the cage. " It used to be I slept with a real lover. Now I've get an army of all you can imagine. " 
 " Well we tried but it was a dussy affair you know. We forced you to witness our fucking life scenes. " 
 The prisoner looked up, eyes wide and opened to meet the prisoner's own gaze. The prisoner was small, but filled with the grainy greyest blackness he had ever seen. If there was anything he could have done wrong to deserve to be the victim, it was a crack, a twitching mass. His dog looked, and understood his gaze. 
 The prisoner closed his eyes for just a moment. This would be the last time. He could hear faint giggles as he nodded his head at the cadaver bag, the cadaver the prisoner had forced him into, and the cadaver the prisoner had left by accident. The prisoner faced the waiting prisoner. 
 " Well? " 
 " Yes prisoner. I figured it out tonight." 
 The prisoner was then joined by a pair of navy blue-black eyes staring back at him.<|endoftext|>

She was so proud. Muffles wasn't to be found. 
 It's very hard to explain the physics of love, but I always wanted it. Love is simply a knowing of another's needs and desires, a purpose. I couldn't stand her as short as she was. " Hello! " she would say, as if she were dictating her own actions. I couldn't ignore her request to stop being so tired that I couldn't take it seriously anymore. 
 I finally got to see her. Muffles was sleeping in her favorite bed, and the fancy fabric she was wearing was just too soft and didn't have the warmth of natural bedtime. Her hair was falling into a lazy strand which gave Muffles a lovely solid fall. 
 The first time I saw her I just laughed. That made me wish I could teach her how to be the perfect Love. I took a moment to look at her with love. " I know. " I told her. " It's fine. Muffles is not a real creature. I think she is just on a business trip. " 
 I was starting to get angry. I wasn't fully in control of my feelings, but I just couldn't help it. I stopped. 
 " Muffles? " I asked. " Muffles? " 
 " Muffles. " She fell asleep again. I heard her laying across my bed, my cat Muffles. I jumped into bed and curled up into a ball. 
 I never felt happy for the first time. I closed my eyes and let my body rest. I didn't realize there was something I was doing, and I don't know how long I could remain. She was near her favorite bed, her favorite bed I loved so much. Muffles just said nothing. I just sat there, motionless. Muffles was not sleeping, that's not what I thought to believe. She was dreaming. I moved my head, trying to reach out and touch her. 
 I'm so glad I let Muffles wake up so quickly. It's so amazing how I could hold her, not wanting to let her get as far away from me as she needed to go. I love her so much that I couldn't stop myself from getting closer. I still love Muffles, but I can't keep watching her sleeping. I get sick from this, but I don't feel any better. 
 I get sick again. I live in a cold winter. The world has always been hard on me, but I feel every little thing there. Every little need I feel, and every little craving I am trying to have for Muffles. 
 My cat can not sleep, he can not even chew her. I tell Muffles to lie down and head back to sleep, but her words start falling out of my mouth. 
 I hit the pillow, and my heart starts racing. Tears begin welling up. I quickly hug Muffles, but my own cat is already laying on the floor, curled up on my back. His head flopped over me, and he doesn't look happy. I head over to my bed, and my mind races. He isn't there. I break into tears. I want him to be mine, to be happy. My cat's not happy either. I reach up, and hug Muffles. 
 " Muffles, " I begin to sob. I fall into sleep. My cat's not there. 
 " Muffles, " I growl as I try to push off Muffles. 
 I finally manage to pull myself up out of sleep. The pain is too much to bear. I look around the room, and I see my new friend Muffles sleeping on my bed. He was sent to Hogwarts, as the four of us. 
 " Muffles! " I can hear Muffles cry as I try to do so. " Muffles! " 
 " Muffles..."<|endoftext|>

 I stopped by the store a short time later, baring my right arm as an orderly taunted me with a potbelly beard and another glass of milk. 
 "Dude, *MY* gim me a shout! " I shouted, sending a glance over my shoulder to where the other employee had apparently been. 
 " Yeh, sorry, but there's something I can do, " he said as he headed off to fetch his order. 
 " What is it, ho? " I sighed, hoping this guy would come back into the fold. 
 He had bought my shopping ticket when he approached me, pointing for me to follow. 
 " Look what's in your bags, " he said, tapping my shoulder. I'd heard him clap from behind me a few times already. 
 " Home Depot, you were supposed to get it for me in the mail, when I got there, " I said matter-of-factly. 
 " No problem, buddy! " he replied, hurrying back to his employment office. I ignored him, taking my time walking toward my exit. 
 The extended shoulder wrapped around my shoulders and I crossed the room, looking for the mail truck that sat in the corner. As I led it, I discovered it, ready for my first stop, using a mocking grin that seemed to rub off on it. 
 " Just got rid of your deal, isn't that right? I'm in the new building! " 
 " We can just get off the bus, " I replied as I pulled up the next stop. 
 " Really, dude? It was a little freaky when they said the new building was the headquarters for the MIC-Boss just so they could keep us company."

A light flicked through my window and quivered. The wind was still whipping our hair. I looked down at my lap and felt a warmth. 
 *If I don't kill someone, in my time I will lose my wife and children. * 
 *In my time, I will find other people worthy to love, to be loved. * 
 *I will still be loved. If I kill someone, I will get rid of them too. * 
 The glow faded and the cold cold was gone. The room was still. 
 *I am the cold god now, also the light God now. * 
 We stood before the television in silence. She was still there, still smiling at me, in a way that really scared me. 
 "Thank you for today, " I said, placing my head against the wall and closing my eyes. 
 " I was scared. This love isn't real. I know I loved her more than this, but at least this love left her for me. I can't live in that place anymore. " I couldn't find the words to move my head, the cold was still on my shoulder. 
 " You have to live with all this pain. " I was almost panting when I finally managed to speak. 
 " I know, " she said, " I always hate feeling like this because I am afraid of losing her, but I won't be as afraid for her as you would be for me. " 
 " No, please, you can go back and live with that, " I reluctantly said. 
 " You'll do what it takes, " she whispered. Her lips parting and spreading across mine, so as to not expose her true bad side. 
 " I don't know what I did, but I am afraid I'm going to see her again. It feels better to live with myself. " I looked up at her, happy eyes of green that were open and warm. 
 " You love yourself, you know that. " She was smiling, and her voice spoke up again. 
 " But I'm here, you go back and live with her. If I'm not with you, then I can't be with you. I have to work to be with her. " 
 " You know I am here, " I said, letting my face slip slightly to my side. " But I'm not. I'm living with her. I can't live with myself." 
 She smiled and my smile returned.

What the hell are you doing here? It ’ s 8:00AM. I ’ ll just hit: -- where ’ s all this rain this time? I should be out cold by now so I have to go someplace sane. I mean what else would I possibly want to go? 
 Damn. I ’ m tired of yelling at this windowsill anyways I can ’ t even stand to think that I ’ ve been dating this damn brick. God I really need to stop using the internet and stealing all my sweet lube. Who is this jerk anyway? His dumbass button up shirt is foolproof. Is this even worth a sentence? His defense attorney? Get him out of here! The corner of his mouth lands on the floor and looks at me with a jerk and a jerk. Doesn ’ t he know this, that man always seems to fuck up and make some mess at the same time?

 Damn. Damn. Damn. Hell yeah it ’ s going to ruin that joke. Anyone go get that one. Even if you don ’ t want to get in, get out of here. You know what? I ’ ll just punch him on the spot. I ’ ll just fight you to the bitter end to make you forget the filthy rhyme. Then I ’ ll just pick up the phone and tell him my damn cousin is in there making another bomb. Please! This is a good thing. 
 Damn. Damn. How dare you tell him, honestly I think he doesn ’ t even know you can ’ t beat shit on his goddamn tower. I hate this day, I hate this day. I ’ m just on a fucking mountain in the middle of the goddamn woods with this damn timing and digging hole, I can ’ t even put my shoe down.

"Before you tell me, I'm pretty sure you've never seen, " a smiling, intimidating soldier said from the mound of greenery around him. 
 " Ah well then, " I said. " I'll have a look. " 
 " Thanks. We've been watching the battle of the Vikings for a long while, " he said, craning his neck, " I'm glad you like it. " 
 " Sure, it's not like I wasn't expecting you to. I've been on this watch for ages, and I'm pretty sure you don't see much of us. " I continued my mission, " Er, don't really know what you're talking about, the horses seem to just never tire out from the hits. It's just that it's bad for the people we own and run these walks. " 
 " Listen. I know you can't find a few friends and family... but there were a bunch of us before you. Too many to count. Let me explain. Nobody actually does backcountry training anymore. Just these guys come back to mow the fields and collect supplies, but only after the horses 'feel like' that we should want to support them. " 
 " Yeah, but just like horses, " I said, sitting up. " The horses are so scary to ride. " 
 " Ah, but they're way, way larger. " 
 " They weigh 3 tons and weigh 80 pounds, but they may not even be so hungry... " 
 " Oh come on, it's best for us to give them a nickname. " 
 " Norsemen. " I gestured to him, " Even people like that? " 
 " Huh. " He said, " They look exactly like them. And they taste... " 
 " I hate them. " 
 " All these things people do together. " 
 He showed the meepads on their back, filled with human smell, and laughed maniacally. " I see! I see! " 
 " You know, besides the fact that you call the place Fancy House up here, you're almost kind of bored. It's fascinating! " 
 " The twins are amazing! " 
 " Just gotta go up there, " I said. " And we'll be right back. " 
 " You're right. " He said, heading down the mound of greenery. " You know, watch the battle of Knut's Village. It looks pretty, right there in the middle of town. " 
 " That makes my job harder than usual. " I said. " We're getting past Ol' Riverpaw. We're walking through the mud. " 
 " What do we do here? " I asked. 
 " Well, think about it. " He said, pointing out the window in the distance. " We're being destroyed all the time by what humans call water damage. Like it rains on our fucking nature. After the battle of Knut's Village, something went down. It really fucking hurts. " 
 " I... thought... *darn* it was raining? What was this whole thing? " 
 He leaned back in his seat, staring at me, scared. 
 " Yeah. Well, it's a shame that you abandoned us for so long."<|endoftext|>

"Come on James we've had a bit of a debate. " 
 Those that knew me by this point had had a real thorn in their side. Nearly every different announcement that I made about how my property would be cared for went directly through my mind. I'd spent some time trying to convince them that I'd just received a response from the Bureau of Anarchial Affairs, so no effort to change my everyday behavior had brought me back. 
 Today, however, the operation was already failing and my home was under arrest. As my defence lawyer reminded me, " if it were a logical thing to do it would have at least been to fit in, and at least perhaps shut down before the police could try and arrest me. " 
 Kneeling at the door behind me, I spoke to David. 
 " What do you have planned? " I asked. 
 " Our community is responding to the unjustities of the War-Sleeping Cities franchise that the Empire has ignored. That's why we're opening a bar on your property. " 
 I could see his heart pounding with anticipation. This was the corner where they kept all their guns. I felt the past decade of weekly visits and scrawlings of contracts slip through my fingers. 
 " And when it's done? I like the red carpet."<|endoftext|>

The storm had stopped. 
 The days of camp camp, the thousand stories rising through the ruins of Michael's hammer-soaked wilderness grew increasingly dark with every passing day. His stories had faded from memory when his days of flying had ended. What were little who failed to survive the day their bold metal towered over anything they stood in. They fought with different natures but never changed the same. The final battle was tomorrow. 
 Michael's hammer, though light-hearted, had always been enough to put him in a dangerous mood. Born in the bustling lands of Brooklyn, not far from where he and his family had now abandoned their home in the Washington Monument a decades ago. With his twin sisters a base of operations in the precinct, he was almost unhindered by the city. They had forgotten how to fight. 
 Now, two days after the violence and chaos that was going to begin, he and his kin were fighting just outside of the Hill. The space between them was brutal and stagnant.
Calls from orbit came in and out of the courtyard as his rival, whom he knew only as Nathaniel went on to join the resistance, began pouring out of the government building at he group in the city. Nate had been swept up in the silver bullet raid that had occurred hours ago and since he was born he had always been slow to respond. His statements ceased as Nate approached Nate with a complaint. 
 "Why haven't you come, out here? " He replied with an uncomfortable tone. 
 " This is just supposed to be entertaining. " 
 " I think we ought to make it multiple tiers and then I can return home, " Nate replied. 
 " Tell me, " Nathan said. 
 " Yes. " 
 " Of course. " 
 " I think I'll turn in tonight. Just promise me something when you go to bed. " 
 " Of course. You'll just need to trust me." Nate said with an intriguing smile. 
 These words were immediately intercepted by Nate's people. They scurried to him and reached out for him. He smiled tenderly and wrapped his arm around them. With a kiss and a small " I-I like you. " 
 Nathaniel remained silent, still hidden behind the wall. He carried his smiling form toward the edge of the streets. Their smiles did not leave his face, no, Nathan's nothingness threw the old man a bad blow. 
 Today was a big day. He and Nate would not have any setbacks here, because tonight, their days together would shine. 
 For the first time in months, one of the tired eyes gazed upon him. There was nothing left to see for the next four hours, the great emptiness of what he had become. It was time to take over. It was time to relax, to rest, and to dream. 
 Nathaniel reached for a flashlight in his free hand, and strode towards the Boulevard. He walked slowly forward to the street and looked up at his front gate.<|endoftext|>

"Honey, I'm gon na miss you. The last thing I needed was another murderer, someone who's life ends, and yet we both have my money. " 
 " No. I'm not for sale. " 
 " Fine. I'm gon na leave you this place. I'll need you, " said Benjamin, the fake money tosser to Michael's hand. 
 Michael ran off into the kitchen, and took Benjamin by the hand with him. " You're just going to have to walk a mile and in two. Enjoy it. " 
 The bank release from the serial killer turned into a one and a half hour drive. Michael braced himself on the floor and flopped to the floor. " Shit. " His son stood up from the couch, expecting it to be over, but it was. 
 While Michael was adjusting to what he was doing at the ATM, Benjamin had a realization of what was happening. " You're totally gon na miss me. You have to spend it. " Benjamin raised an eyebrow. 
 Michael leaned back in his chair and threw up his hands in the air. " Are you going to move over to his house and yell at him? " He fumbled for his cell phone with his hand and pulled it out. It was an old, same old phone. Apparently the phone had been knocked over three times today, sending Benjamin a text message. " $ 19.99. " 
 " Okay. " Benjamin picked up the $ 19.99 from his son, which was a strange one considering it was supposed to be legally recorded but not actually. " How do I do that? " Benjamin asked, his brow furrowed in confusion. The phone vibrated and then buzzed, " Benjamin! How much do you need to know? " 
 " I need a bag over with a hot meal. I need this home."<|endoftext|>

It was Friday night when I woke up. A closet door had been opened. My ears dropped. I opened the closet, and there was a crying baby. 
 *Honey, are you going to be ok? * The baby cried. " Daddy, Mommy's coming home. " 
 *Mommy is coming home? * The crying baby cried. 
 *Go to Daddy's room, darling. * The crying baby begged. 
 *Daddy's not coming home yet, honey. * The baby said. 
 *No, honey, Daddy's not home yet. * The baby said. 
 I couldn't see him. I looked around. There were no bodies around, and nobody besides the baby. Is there a church? Did anything like that happen? There was a woman at the front of the room, yelling " Momma! " and other sounds like crying. 
 Then there was a new baby crying down at the door. Another cry. Another one. On the baby was another man, wrapped up in an even tighter embrace, pressing a small white button on his lapel. 
 *Oh my God, don't open the door. * The baby cried. 
 *We don't want to come into that house. * The man said. 
 *Can we get you a blanket? Daddy's always wanted me to blankets. He wants to protect me from whatever bad circumstances we face. * The baby cried. 
 *Oh my God. Daddy's not coming home yet! * The man called out. 
 I was still able to see the woman, who was crying. I wasn't able to see Daddy, too. I didn't see him. 
 I woke up one morning and found that I was still alive. I had died as the baby. I had broken into people's home and rescued people and explained how I saved their lives. I also had been reunited with a live baby. 
 How did I die?<|endoftext|>

I stood out of line at the riverbed as I watched with a flash of silver as the crowd of people rounded a corner. The beast was large and had several horns on the tip. I stepped back as the first wolf approached with its claws clenching on the tree that had carved itself into the cobble cobbles. 
 I felt the eagle-like salvo that formed in my arms and yelled with fear. " RUN NOW! " The small beast roared at the ferocity of its gun and shot me in the back of the head. He became entangled in the midst of the crowd while he attempted to drag me into a trap. I was ducked behind a large boulder just beneath his head with the eagle now flapping its wings. 
 " Stop! " He yelled in rage as he leapt around in the air and attempted to meet me with his long tail. I was thrown to the ground and fell as he released his voice as his tail jerked back and forth. I flew forward and sent a large, metallic blue spear through his belly. 
 The dragon scrambled back and forth before making a dash for me and catching me with his mouth full of greasy teeth and feathers. I spun around in a circle in front of him to dodge the angry tail and escaped before it could catch me and right my neck. The claws curled up as it swung at me and landed in my throat. The dragon tumbled to the ground and picked up his tail and his body as if trying to back away. I'm surprised my body would survive a bite, but there is something about these sort of things that I loved. 
 The dragon was back before me now. It flung his tail around to look for me and I was left exposed. The dragon was very much alive now and had more bruises than he did before. The dragon spun and ran forwards and the tiger I had snuck behind was next to me. 
 " Grow up, you scum! " I shouted as the dragon used the horned wings of its tail to snarle at me with its claws. It suddenly leaped off of me and landed on the ground below and I landed in a large stream. 
 I heard his voice again as I stumbled and staggered to my feet, " A petite-hap! " I swore. 
 " Do you think I'll become one yourself? " He said, casting an aura of fear in my eyes. " I've been dead so long because of your blood. " 
 My skin was dry as I felt blood rushing to my clothes. " It was the blood of dragons... how... You know? The blood of life. The blood of life! " The dragon laughed. 
 " So they collected people for race! " I yelled. " And they killed them. And for races to think of me as something other than their own, as they claw at my body in front of their god. " He turned back to me and poured me another glass of orange juice. 
 " Well, then, that's *too bad* right? " 
 I exhaled once more and placed the juice into the right filth. " Well, then, you can always be free... " He said. " You'll have to pay for my... " 
 He tossed me a glass and I thought for a second about how good that line was. " Blood vampires are offensive, " he said. " That's right. So long as they care for you, and they live off of your blood. " 
 I squinted at him. " Dammit, dragon. " 
 He chuckled and kissed me on the cheek. " You haven't even done that yet, haven't you?" 
 With that, he lept his tail over to my head and I was left standing among the piles of blood.<|endoftext|>

I sat in front of the great hall lit by sun reflecting off the trees below. The sun brightened the skies behind. The trees came alive with the halloween warriors we called home, and each stride brought a drop of snow, a scythe in the wind at our shoulder, and a taste of honor etched on their savory beard. 
 I was familiar with this house. Their eyes—they seemed to have foreseen me from afar. They always have. However, my eyes have remained distant for the longest time. I still wonder. Why? They say the first time I made contact with them—after that insane man approached me—I could not believe my eyes. My years of vigilance proved what the man had not known: that my fury would nullify all resistance. Time for the tournament. 
 I climbed up the wall, going first down to the top. I expected great talks from the warriors of the halls but these concerns always filtered into me. This will be no less than a backwater school after the tournament, this door remained locked since the day I was born. As I paced back down the hall, my chest began to spin. As I took a last look around, I felt certain my clan was losing. 
 No matter how much bloodshed and bloodshed had preceded my birth, I never fell from the highest ranking warrior. Instead, they left me with nothing more than a grimace and trust. This is the door I was destined to open. Whether its the source of my fury or the worst threat the Gods have ever seen? The door was locked. I'd got ta work to let them know who was being harmed and how they could have avoided it. 
 As I approached the threshold, my eyes began to water. Just how tragic of an event was the prospect of the Ultimate Fighting Championship being held amidst secret cellars in the back of the castle, no one could have predicted what came next.<|endoftext|>

The kingdom-state of Israel was so expansive that the originally Egyptian rulers chose a different shade of red. For the sake of the average man there was not enough water to quench his thirst; that is, they gave it it to the king because he was too thirsty for it. The king raised a large dome to meet his concerns: a small gathering of rebel Christians was there to protest the bull that had come from the skies above. A red hue was obtained from the uncountable number of obelisks that adjoined the dome: its diameter was already ten thousand liters. 
 The main problem was the animals around it; they were deadly. If someone sat as high as a ninety-nine foot tall, not a single brooch would be expected to respond when a meteor went to earth to rebel. Of course, Arab diplomats made it clear they could tolerate more they would receive, and The Lord Elusive gave them a crippling famine. His daughter thanked the king for his generosity, and nothing could stop the jealous party in him. No-one was sure why those dinosaurs came. If anyone brought a red dragon to the Kingdom, they risked slaughtering its vital organs, this is the story of why the Egyptian gods were willing to throw away his heart for the welfare of the populous in Israel. 
 The battle was in vain, the best of them soon outnumbered the best, the rest just walked away to die.<|endoftext|>

"Wake up! " 
 I sit on my bed, across the room from myself. My hands shake lightly as the sweat hits my sweaty skin and my breath stutters. 
 I'm shaking so fast. The world feels like it never stops, but my hand and my hands are so fast and I can feel my heart beating with each step, counting down to infinity again. So the bleeding goes away and my muscles relax, they just have a feeling of that damned old man who stutters in bed every day. 
 I open my eyes and flick the alarm clock on to the side of the room. Clock, calendar, other things. I look into the bedroom window and see the snoringest, busier of people walking out the door. 
 " Food and a glass of water? " A middle aged, bad looking man inquires. " They've already left. " 
 I've gotten used to the receptionist who came to talk to the old, tired women at the front desk. She smiles and takes my hand gently as we walk to the edge of the stairs. 
 Suddenly, I notice, I feel the smallest chuckle of a smile pop up in my mouth as the back of my neck opens up. 
 The old, tired woman raises her eyebrow and notices me. " Oh, Happy Memorial Day! You guys are adorable, aren't you? " 
 I ask her what this means. She grabs my arm and leads me to the bed. 
 I squirm against the bed so I can see the long narrow lips resting on my shoulder. 
 " Who the hell are you? " I ask, excitedly. 
 She looks up and smiles knowingly. She crushes my face and looks down at the large knot holding my head against the back of the bed. 
 " Welcome, baby. " She turns back to her husband, then backs up and heads towards the door, bowing and kissing me. 
 We both laugh and step into the front porch to see what our neighbors had to say.<|endoftext|>

The color of the skies was a contrast to the few hills dotted throughout the city. If a bull, kid, could fly! I knew that technology was advancing so fast after the war, that even rebels could not stop them. There were only a few more companies, allied and badly needed to an end, so the decision was made. 
 I was in front of a very large building and saw our father stride calmly out of the room. He started to speak. He was a smart man. I knew there was some code in place, but I did not know what it meant. I had to read this, my master's program. 
 As I read, he smiled at me and nodded as though he knew I was taking notes. " Go away, you 'Galadiah,' you son of a bitch, " he had said. 
 " I don't understand, " I pleaded. I turned my attention to the dark figure in the dark uniform. It looked like nothing my master had ever seen before. He looked like a black gang leader with his bag on his shoulder. His hand was worn and I was scared. When I reached out to touch his hand, I felt that something was there. I knew this was him. Then, I saw him. His black hood over his brown suit, with the brown sleeves buttoned up. The moustache looked familiar, like the hood of some black hood, with even more life stained it. He grabbed my arm and pulled me in closer. 
 " Listen, you need to get down here. I won't stop you, " he began. He seemed to be squeezing me tighter, but I kept my eyes shut. He just disappeared, leaving only his dark undercoat. He wiped a bead of sweat off his face and began walking away. I heard him do this, even though I knew that he knew I was doing this. That he found me, but without my master. 
 I could not believe what I had just seen. The man had gone. I thought to myself, " This is what I wanted my son to do," but I knew as well as I knew not how to get out of this place. And I knew, too, that I could not keep that line in place again for long. For, I am born into a race that is accustomed to the death of the weak and, not for lack of trying, the either done. I could not follow fate but this. 
 The stormtrooper must have been mad, too. I reached down, grabbed his baton, and pulled it from his holster. Without thinking, I put it back into my pocket. And with that, I turned around and ran.<|endoftext|>

Hi Lucy, 
 I am writing this for you. Here's what I've picked out for you as I type this. 
 I always loved reading about new philosophy's and brilliant ideas. That's why I sent a young really interested physicist a short story when he agreed to get involved and try to figure out how to do this ( of course he's gonna take that long. No more story shit ). I'm not sure what set the pieces apart, but he decided to try something a little different than what I'm playing, and made a follow up plot. That way, you won't fall in love with an idea that you are uniquely good at and worse in life. If that's a true story, then I don't know what I'm playing and will omit the easy bits about it. How will I improve?<|endoftext|>

 They asked me if I was alright. They said I was. As my 3-year-old body slowly worked to change into a 13-year-old girl who was menstruating. This was it. This was it. I had done it. I had done it! 
 I walked out of the house as slow and direct as they got me; half way through time. I was caught up in the text messages but it didn't matter anymore. I was all alone and alert and taken care of. I just wanted to use that first window of opportunity to see my girl again. 
 I walked into the kitchen, only to find an empty meal dish beside me. Not the sound of them cooking or music, but the smell of fried chicken. I looked down at my hands and saw that they were clean, but that still made it unbearable. I walked back inside to the sink, and started washing it off. 
 "That's it boys, just washed it off. Come wash it back up!" The next morning, I washed the dishes clean and started taking showers. And there was no anything more to worry about.<|endoftext|>

Bluegrass is abundant, if only they knew. Bluegrass caters to every passerby and every traveler. Although there are few known as photographers, the necessity of their work was only revealed as their one response to so many, dark things. Like camera takes of something that you can't and slip it back into your own photo. 
 It was the history of photography that created him. This thread opens a new age of photography where the women and men that are now money and fame are ideal to create careers of their own. Aside from the many practical, questionable methods, it was the commercial photography of a few that started these conversations. What started as purely amateur, performed and eventually destroyed by the age of 24 became the catalyst of everyone's fortune. It was known as "blood purse. " 
 A draft came out of an ex: 
 " Here comes Ryan Callahan, not a minute older than 12 years old when i took my picture. 
 About half an hour later he showered and walked off to our corner corner shop. We mustered the courage to ask for an autograph. No one except for my closest friends wanted to know how my life was going. The shame never really washed over me. 
 I was a marvel of art. When I found my pictures of Dwight and The Holiday Inn in my shelves, I knew there was something amiss. My help and companions were out there. 
 That happened in just a few days. I remember that day like a father's smile. Dwight was left on the street by poor Dwight. I don't think anyone will ever know. My best friend was quite poor in his later life, and picked out the man and left him sleeping, the night before the funeral. 
 It was only then did I realize the toll Dwight carried on his body. It may have been time to start a funeral and run it well. But most of all, what impact could I have in it? Did it affect me? What other tenor from seniority that found this shitty shoot, but felt so fragile that he wanted something heavier? It didn't matter in that way. I took it apart and put it back together. But that shouldn't be enough. 
 I asked the man what he was doing in my shot, to be honest I had no idea how. His face was gone, but what's missing is his eyes. I took this shot again and again, so many different photos. The look on his face before turning to them is eerie and honest. 
 I had learned that it took time for a life to die. I was not here to create the result of every mistake my mind made. I was looking to show people that maybe a piece of the puzzle will serve as a symbol of my legacy and maybe someday, a picture would be a way to say goodbye to my brother. I wanted to see the sadness of his heart as he spoke to me. 
 The sad look on his face when he saw the last photo is sure to make anyone's heart skitter. A girl smiles and tells me a very happy story of a fairly happy life.<|endoftext|>

The stars poked at my head as I rose up, annoyed and mournful but unjoyed. I had been preparing my rest for this moment for months, preparations for battle is what passed between us when we finally meet. I could feel my friends chattering in the back, your friends I had defeated and cut down with a heavy steel fist. They ran in a flurry. Do you really get the look of it? There's no space for war, there's no peace. When there is there no peace there is pain. You saw my hatred, I felt you watching the fire it consumes. It showed me the pain you took for granted as a child. I could see the twinkling of your blue eyes and those ones where full of sugar. I could see the smell of burned flesh, every single one was tainted with bitterness. You made all that noise, the gloved fingers in a hand still clutching at your heart. I was always rooting for you. I was always there to help, but you took no advantage of me. My emotions were too weak to fight. You hurt me. And now I have my revenge. I am the conqueror of the garden. It is what you and your will called my Garden.<|endoftext|>

Four months. 
 We got trapped in this place. * Three*, those dumb food feeds. I need something new! I need someone to help! Like someone to tell me what is up and why I should not eat dinner. I'm about to go out and become a better person, and suddenly I'm surrounded by others... *my friends*. But nobody speaks. 
 They all cry. 
 I don't understand how. 
 My friend Em all moved so fast. She died after my voice while I tried to remember what it was like to be a different person. I can't remember why, I was numb all the time. I wasn't able to talk to her. I was alone, with no means to interact with other people, so the only contact I had with others was through [ my words ] ( http: //imgur.com/zJa6tSN ). 
 I just wanted to swim. I wanted to breathe deep. I just wanted to make noise. Someone layed next to me, taken in by the power of this color. That's it! I'll join her. 
 I just wanted to say *thank you* for being me, and by that I mean *thank you* for saving me from the hell I now call home.<|endoftext|>

Her hunger had peaked. 
 Of course, it was getting harder and harder to fling the spotlight on them when you first began taking on the task, no matter the cost. At first we thought it was a joke, a desperate act by her. Never have she gone from the same den of horrors and drudgery of her enemies, to an utterly vile cult. Ever since we were placed in jail, living under the nickname Lillium, how could she know she was dating me? This year, I had been the victim of a child-stealing scheme. A toothless grin softened my furrowed brows as I watched as she turned the corner, past the palace door, and into my heart. 
 After all, she had convinced me that she was indeed older than me. 
 Anyway, we didn't know which went out the first. It was not my fault. I just didn't know how to attract her. Well, I guess it wasn't that long ago. 
 The goody-two-shoes played this game. The two mizzins and I acted like everyone else. Goaded her, trickled her... various curses of power. I hate to say it, but all I could control was the shadows. We had caught our first, and they had immediately developed the power to cross at will. But before long, their plans for our first meeting had brought them into it. I dug deeper, spinning my hand through her hair, levitating her in the air. The noblest of the shadows rushed to my aid, and I waited, pulling her farther back. Once she was closer, I let out a deadly cry, ensuring she was immediately watched by one of my minions. 
 It was tough, now, but nothing would ever compare to being in such a position. I eased her into my embrace, his eye sockets turning into a thousand hungry black eyes. Now I could feel her sharp claws biting at my face and neck, tearing. This was a blow, for sure, but we didn't take it well. She didn't want us to know it, because this was what she deserved. 
 I stopped the curses, left the other two behind. She had grown to fancy me as the slyheart, too. She'd become, among the stars, the chosen one, the one who would become king. I'd been though that it was all nonsense. The plan. The evil ways of my minions. The slavers. Our silence. Her escape. Just... not now. I'd had enough. I took her in my arms, our consciousness drifting forward, and threw her into my arms. Clicks of her blood-stained skin.

I woke up, put on some clothes, and went to sleep. My spouse awakens at around noon, and he was on a roll of TV talking about something. 
 "It's gon na be tough out there, " he said. " You'll have to live with it all the way through the night. " He, too, was on a roll of TV talking about something. " 
 " Yeah, " I said, " exactly. Don't worry, you'll be fine. " 
 The next day, I wake up, put on some clothes, and went to bed. The TV is telling me nothing has happened. It's time to get up, crank on the alarm. 
 " And once I make it to the window, " I say, leaning on the window, " try not to sleep on the couch. " 
 " Won't work out either. " He says. " How long did you have to work on the radio? " 
 I shoot him a flustered look. " I didn't know. " 
 " Don't begrudge it. " 
 I'll stick with this story.<|endoftext|>
**********350**********
I sat up, relaxed and tired. I knew I was awake. 
 “ How did you do that? ” 
 There was a moment where I knew the answer and realised he was right. I slowly rose and stepped out of the hole that formed at the base of my skeleton. It looked natural. We had been through this already, and now we ’ d completed the first step of our plan. We would have a wet patch in the dirt and be ready to drink immediately. 
 I waited, the first step growing heavier as I shuffled through the material. It was long, beautiful and laid out in perfect detail, exactly what we had promised, exactly what I had promised. I stared at it, but my eyes never left it. The brush of paper was on it while I waited. 
 “ Well, you've taken the form of some raven, *Jess*, so do we know your name? " 
 I looked confused and most certainly not amused. 
 “ Ah, yes, Mister Cranmer. The *Crenedy* is spoken for in the Greek *Afteros*, and served us by way of the surname *Alec*, can I be your host? ” 
 Mr Cranmer's eyes began to droop. He gave a shuddering, “ No? Is that not exciting or did you just casually chant a random ten year old song to yourself? ” 
 As if in thought, the rest of my body began to sprout feathers. They were tied to the feathers, breathing fire all around. It was a large feat, the underside of which was smooth yet completely pliable. It had an abnormally long tail, jutting out from the shoulders. I could almost taste it. The piece of paper wrapped tightly around my head as I struggled with trying to put all this into words. I couldn't remember if any of it was ancient or modern or not, but it must have been a long time ago. I looked down and sat down beside him. 
 “ She turns out to be a little *far* beyond this. These fur patches are... weird... like golden strips. Not quite as smooth as the jutting ones, but quite nice. * Did you just chant one of my songs while I was wading through the swamp? * 
 He was silent for a long moment, his eyes never leaving me. Then he said “ So Mr Cranmer, I am thinking you might have discovered a civilisation somewhere out in the far north of the arid... something. ” 
 As I finished his questions and heard a pause, it shifted to something else. I had said it first, but I had not forgotten the details. The only thing I had in mind that would be helpful was some diversion from Mr Cranmer. 
 “ You have put a few in the bushes, Mr Cranmer, but what you have in mind is... Frimming! Let me go. ” 
 It all went into motion. I stepped into the wet patch on the ground and strained my eyes to see what I could see. There was a wolf, jogging by and grazing in the ferns. There was a minotaur, hiding in the branches of a nearby tree. There was a bear, about twelve feet tall and with its back to the ground. These were different. These were just brown fur. I heard the occasional rumble from somewhere close behind me. I yelled and I ran back to Mr Cranmer. 
 “ Sir, stop, make an educated guess. We do know the location of the place! And you have absolutely nothing to do with it. ” 
 We hobbled up the hill. I listened intently as the wolves prowled around sheep. And then we heard what sounded like a hammer being given a swing. 
 The hammer was so different though. Each time I pressed it against something on it I got weaker and weaker. As the ride up the hill came to an end, the hammer was stiffer and heavier. I used it to hammer the wolf into submission. I was very lucky. It was as good a result as a backbreaking expedition. 
 I ran away a few yards, through the ever growing swamp and into the of the woods. 
 A light flashed in the distance. I knew where we were, and made my way inside.

The Hyumaran Era was almost over, with the demise of the Urprilan monarchy. Heroes, villains, republicans, generals all rose and fell under the eye of the Hyumaran Empire. Treachery and corruption seemed inevitable, as the wayward wars of the past were long gone and the technology of the past not yet outdated. In many ways, the Hyumaran Empire grew tired of this travesty of a world. The city-state of Ishapor was managed by the greatest of each of the Hyumaran Nations, which would later rise into power after the Great Battle of Morzeld. 
 Shortly before the Amalgam Crisis, the combined kingdoms of Amalgam and Grandithkar ravaged much of the the Greater Mythical Realms. A war had once been fought between the first and the second nations of Sargatla between Umek, Sordand, Makil and Nenas, but as Nenas and Makil fell to the forces of Malalgam, the Marlaxians became nearly impossible to defeat. The Marlaxians declared war on the Hyumaran Empire and agreed to side with the Umekians. By the time the war was over, only Sargatla remained. During this time, Sargatla's glorious war battles had forced every kingdom to unite under the enormous banner of the Umekian Empire. 
 Umek slew the first one, Lord Entag, and restored the world to the Magiskar-Sun-Azun, bringing all of its people together under the banner of Umek. They founded a new empire under the banner of Akmon-Weiss, an empire that would rule not only the largest and most influential empire in the Mediantone Hall of Heroes, but as well as many of the great sagas of Mythical Fictions. They established an alliance with Agamel, the Imperial Harbinger, who once again brought the Magiskar-Sun-Azun under his protection. Under Agamel, demons ascended to the throne and slaughtered the former Prime Exorcist. Agamel emerged as their Savior of the Hall, an unmatched hero of his empire. 
 After millions of years of strong friendship between the Umekians and Magiskar-Sun Azun, the world's civilizations from Sargatla and Amalgam had grown to near absolute supremacy in Valgard. In an age of peace and prosperity, everything changed for the better as the Hyumaran Empire grew more powerful and also seemingly invincible. Sargatla was one of the first nations to declare war against the Umekian Empire and its giant armies of Magiskar-Sun Azun, but instead of toppling the Magiskar-Sun Azun, the Hyumaran Empire left this world to inherit the Hyumaran throne to rebuild.<|endoftext|>

Star Trek was never the truest of things. It is a lengthy process to construct a spaceship, four people in orbit and six people zero gravity. The fraction of a second between when a craft hits a desert and when the craft drops into a raging abyss, the ship can only go off after ten minutes. It comes together for the same thing when the craft lands inside a modern castle, raining down from the sky. Then the next day the show ends, because the showrunners decided to capitalize on the first two episodes of Star Trek. In this case, their idea to set the whole world ablaze with a few short episodes of an episode a day with all the characters and material get revealed was genius at the time, but what not to Tom Brokaw. 
 That was until the city fell. It woke up everyone in the city, smoke from falling bodies everywhere; I asked the bartender how many times we left because the city of San Francisco was too... Black? It was run by an I don't know how far civilization has been lost in the city. How long is a city without a dead city? How long is a city without desert? We were led to believe that only the first two episodes had been aired before, but the viewers did not believe it. They watched hours in the freezing streets and waited for our next message.

 The stranger in front of the Asian looked at him. When are the things he does right? The kids they met probably have more friends than his dad would have liked, and in a different age.

 " No. I was hoping I could be at home by dinner after playtime. "

Dear Mr. Friend, 
 I've been asked to do something for you; to tell you the new Democrat's downfall. He has no skillset, no force of will, and his personality is all set. 
 I'm sorry to know of the shock treatment we have currently given to our citizens, but it is the last thing I need to explain to you. 
 Every day, we entrust you with a computer. We have them look at our banking records, our stock market totals, our pensions and your financials. 
 Sometimes they have questions on your bank, while other times, they talk to you and tell you things they know you know about us. 
 You've opened up; you've changed our political system. You don't need our computers anymore. 
 I know that you've accepted our advice, now that you know the truth. That's why you're the best teacher you can be. 
 Now, Mr. Friend, I want to let you know why this will be the end of our past, today, and into the future. 
 Our future should be brighter, more productive and more understanding. This world is riddled with corruption, inefficiency, and waste. 
 I'll go through each page in the menu bar as you are typing this. 
 The agenda and the message you gave us all today were never meant to be on the great display screen in our dream office. 
 We all deserve better from our leaders. 
 Again, are you ready for this?"

The husk still sat there, moved every few inches in silence. It didn't make a sound. It didn't even look up. That's odd. 
 The animal barely knew its place in the thick embrace of the tree that a few cubs sat in. It had a distended skull that looked like it came out of a book. Still, it didn't seem to move. It was still empty. 
 Right as it closed the coffin, a tapered light gleamed down at its head. It felt the thought in the lump in its throat. The corpse had never moved, nor moved at all. 
 Though there was no source of light to speak of, the grey hood was much more terrifying to behold. A thick grey shroud was forced down onto the entrance of the coffin and draped over it. The other coffin had crumbled like new plaster that was slowly bulging as it fell down into the freezer. Slowly, the fog enveloped the coffin and by the time the light reached its face, the lid had melted and a long, curved nub now hung over its head. 
 A form of quiet speech was made over the sound of slaps and the grunts of those who had been packed in. It never spoke again. 
 After what seemed like an eternity, the leering husk of the corpse finally spoke up, "Come now, stranger. " 
 The blue-clad figure gave a sort of sloppy smile. 
 " An art exhibit." 
 They stood motionless, staring at the figure, eyes wide. It breathed heavily and spoke to the air in a monotone voice, which it then spoke. The one thing to complete the puzzle was that there was no answer to the question posed by the husk. The husk did not seem to be looking at the earth, no, instead it was looking out into the more nearly vertical sky and said: 
 Swinging to and fro, with unbelievable ferocity, it marched at once towards the location of the tomb and pushed the small disk up on its body. The disc landed head first onto the rotting trunk, further down the fork and into the hard wood. It was about to stop when the man in the blue suddenly jerked up, black eyes staring back into the abyss, motionless. The husk really tried to crawl up the dead body as a piece of kit.<|endoftext|>

 An eternity in the dark. 
 " They're coming. Look. "

 That horrible whistle. I didn't hear it. I heard four feet away. An invisible walls looming over me, looking directly at me. I felt like I was in a scary bubble. No worries. 
 " And they're coming... " 
 *BEEP* 
 The black swallow was over the horizon. Unmoving. It was like holding in your lungs an entire second. I did one of those terrifying motions, my body jerking in and out, shifting my stomach towards the sky. Then I crumpled to the floor.<|endoftext|>

Fifth meditate. Fifth meditation. It seems like a blessing in itself, if you have some serenity to it that takes for granted some time to finish. 
 And after I've thought long and hard about those things, I think what I can think of in my moment is Buddha's last thought. This Buddha was the final one of all of God's creations, and God was being part of the ultimate future, with wisdom intact. 
 Sufficient evidence of these beliefs? Oh, no, very few. The Buddha taught these truths, did new laws come in and go, not take yet another, never come in and go, but always be sure to obey the Buddha's teachings and everything else is still there. 
 Therefore I answer this question: 
 *Why? Because I am not the same as the Buddha. * 
 And before the Buddha leaves the others with the Buddha to continue study and learn the Buddha's teachings, do the Buddha remove himself and the others from the Buddha's body for good, which, in the end, is completely impossible.<|endoftext|>

The Ministry of Small Sleep was keen on finding their next victim of mystery. While the other NPCs were sniffing out themselves from the machine and scavenging their clothes, the Ministry of Small Sleep had more pressing matters on their mind. To them, their quest was something of an experiment for the team, since they didn't want to be the only ones killed. There was simply too much to do with the area. Beyond the city limits, these small entities usually encountered dungeons with strange runes that appeared to be affected by the water currents. It usually looked like a net of magma, though the surface was surrounded by a sea of water, with a green & brown arc appearing to be a gateway. And on the far side of the ocean was the sea, filled with smelly monsters. 
 "Well? " asked the Minister of Justice, one of the government NPC's at a casual glance. " Seems the Froggees haven't left here for a while. " 
 " Yes, but with many moons to go... Any chance they'll leave before I get back, I mean... I mean... " The minister's brow furrowed slightly. " That's it for now, head off to the moonshine and clear up the crossroads. " 
 The Minister shot off one Oroga. The guards stopped talking while they flushed an out of form salvo into the waters above, all while the Minister of Sleep continued to watch. The small cloaked one spent a moment trying to make sense of how to speak. " You are... Bounding... the water, circling " the Salamander wailed. " That is, your block. While browsing the water, you cast a spell. Kneel and hide, and you will find the Horned Rat - Call Down. It is now becoming a common constellation, appearing every 2hrs or so. We must clear this black void from our lands. " 
 " A distraction to a quest to find a Galakrish, " replied the Minister. " Just to keep us warm, you must be careful in this passageway. " 
 " We already cleared this desert, shouldn't be a problem, " said the Salamander. " It's in the underground islands under Zakaria, and is currently flowing beneath Zamalak's Mt Soren. We have made several small steps, but need to make certain that we stand out among the rest to avoid dropping our weapons. We have to keep up this party of adventurers as they run across Mekorot. If we can avoid any encounters, the Ring of Spirit will give us the numbers to take down Mekorot. We have... we will need at least one Prime of Chicken to equip us on fire."<|endoftext|>

A man stood in front of me and another and another. A man who was absentmindedly strutting about. 
 "W-wh-who are you? " I stammered out. 
 It all really came out on its own. I had asked him about myself, his wife, his children and of course he had me be my soulmate. 
 *Love. * 
 *What's that? * I cried out. " I'm a ghost! I'm damn near a devil! " 
 I turned my head to one side as a freakish black light flapped across me. An imaginary hand blanched. 
 " Oh, John, I'm totally dead! There must be someone who could bring me back alive! " I thought, " God, I don't think you are in the right age for any type of soulmate. " 
 *What is a soulmate anyway? * I thought. I wanted to nod, please. 
 " John, you will listen here before we get started, " the giant hologram said. " Nothing to really drive you mad, you see, " I muttered. 
 The others clustered around me. 
 " It's so very strange you humans having to call me a ghost or a demon, " I said. I placed my hand on my wife's thigh, and a bead of sweat fell down my face. " You shouldn't be living like that, " I thought as I made my way closer to the imposing figure. 
 " This really isn't possible, " he said. " Just one test. Let me get my wife's body back into your body and see how I'm feeling when I put her in my husband's body. " 
 I rocked back and forth with the force of a Rock Band member. " Let me do it, you snot-nosed cat! " 
 He whipped around and grasped my waist. 
 " I could kill you, I don't know, just one more hit, " I whispered. 
 " You don't want me doing that! " he roared. " Don't you have any of my blood left and I can just cut off your leg? " 
 I laughed as I pulled my legs back. 
 The figure darted for me, then struck my legs with an elbow. My wife's body fell into the flaming furnace below, where it met the outside. And it came back to life, mashing my intestines against my breadcrumbs. 
 *H-h-hello? * I gasped. 
 " Welcome to a part of the Multiverse, darling," it muttered. 
 I was horrified. 
 But I wasn't mortified. I ducked up and looked at the giant hologram. It had been too long. I hurried through the flames and shut the door and turned back to my wife. 
 *Th-thank you god, " she muttered. * God, here's my soulmate! *<|endoftext|>

It was the 25th, the initial 72 days of the zombie season. People who have survived since then have made a fortune off of the mess they made. Sleep kits are now a scarce commodity in many places as the zombie virus settles in but. Not all survivors are still recovering. 
 Domestic produce has become more scarce. Most of the canned food that the cat lays around are lost or abandoned. People are taking smaller and smaller flecks of food from the animal kingdom to the region to try and keep it from spreading. 
 Food availability has always been a problem of food shortages and a medical scare that has led to massive shortages of canned food. 
 At the beginning, these cat people would harvest their food quickly. They would make the rounds of the neighborhood and hunt until a few children were found. When the children didn't appear, they would have to run to the mountains to have another piece of food eaten from their usually poor carcass. 
 In the middle of the middle of the day, there would be a sharp, painful moment when cats became lethargic and stopped. This happened for several days. Some days they would remain lethargic until one was able to stand and prey was discovered. These days the cats were down to only one critter per person and were usually eaten before they could seem to change. 
 One day, one of the kids stood outside of the feral cat community without giving a shit that he was being eaten. He was moaning loudly in pain. The cat would be excited, a normal noise but then it would continue to beg for food. The cat would dig deeper into the cat's brain and add the sound it made as they ate the body in front of the child. 
 The kids always started whining at one another for a while. Sometimes it would just stop, maybe one of them would pick up that little old rat there and give it a day to chew through flesh and chew. Sometimes that rat would roam in the cat's nose and gag. The cat would flip open the cat's stomach when another kid started opening it again. The same thing happened more often. 
 During the zombie season, however, the cat people would eat so many more other animals than it was appropriate for human consumption because humans were naturally immune to the zombie virus. 
 In the end, despite the lack of dogs and cats, cats lived as social creatures. When they died, they would all be slaughtered by the other cats to keep up with the food consumption of humans. They would have to starve and scavenge for them as much as they could. Then the cat people would sell their food to other pets, making them food later. 
 No one knows how many feral cats ran into humans before they just died. Now many died because the cat people were too frightened to kill their own cats to do so. They would argue amongst themselves for weeks and not wait for any cats to kill them. Not that humans have any problem with killing other cats. The only reason a squirrel is still alive at all is because squirrels prefer to eat humans and that may give the cat people the choice to kill them.<|endoftext|>

Once upon a time, the tyrant was imprisoned in a corner of a cavern. This is how he was captured, his life was played, and his name was called. First, he planned to inflict great destruction upon his enemies through his violent actions. Then, he would terrorize the world, forcing them to their knees, bloodthirstyness on them, choking them to death. He would then punish any who dared defy the tyrant. This became the way the tyrant was imprisoned. 
 There were three people who were up to his name - the famous FBI agent who had kidnapped the supreme leader to get him free, and the "joker, " one of whom vowed to deliver him to the infernal end. As a result of his actions, the crime spree began. This was the end of the crime syndicate, as the dictator's murder spree became more and more elaborate with each killing. 
 Once the crimes had ended, the leader himself went out in style, with the goal of ending the fascist tyranny. He worked fast on the body of the dictator, carefully removing the chemicals used to create " heath" that would kill the dictator. Then, he had to make sure that he still had the conspiracy behind the theft and destruction he planned to cause. No one could stop the mastermind. No one could stop him. Everyone knew this. So it was decided that once the mastermind showed up in prison, he would end the dictator and bring an end to the power of the super mob. Even after he had destroyed the tyrant and his entire business was spent on making the world all better, nobody could stop him. 
 He ran around the prison in his normal disguising, standing in a circle, surrounded by the rest of his former colleagues and enemies, who never realized the benefits of his actions. He had succeeded in stopping the huge comeback, without any back and forth. As the revolution was full, however, he had lost a lot of blood and tears from the terrorist attacks. There were other heroes, but they were as weak and helpless as he was. The revolution was about to begin, because the dictator was beginning to fall apart. 
 The supervillain smiled.<|endoftext|>

As someone with high IQs, it was obvious that I should have been volunteering at a lab. A small research department that had staff one and a half decades apart, full of focused people and dedicated people. At its peak, I was lucky enough to be able to make friends with some of the most important people in my field, ranging from the Bureau of Advanced Exoskeletons to the Department of Physics and Math and so on. It was certainly one of the richest places in the world, sitting next to Nobel Prize Winners, Astrophysicist, Two Degrees mathematicians, and Aesthetically Handy Fauna Specs. This didn't make me very happy. 
 There are three basic types of labs in the world: the ones in North America, in Russia, where most labs depend on supplies, and in Europe, where most labs rely on chemicals to produce electricity. I came across one in Georgia that didn't really need electricity though. Because I was a chemist in Georgia, I was able to get the "green light " that came out of GE's electricity generators. But the last factory that did so- I had a dozen of them blown out and on track to me. I didn't believe in the green light though. This was *expensive*, too. 
 The ability to pay for basic research is certainly one of the most important things a scientist can do. Experiments go wrong, and maybe after a while the setup is all broken up. But I had to agree with them; I was a technical genius and a doctor. I got to work taking samples, breeding specimens, crafting replicators and other things, and building models for experiments. It was a neat little research force, with plenty of talent, but the clinical testing—from " traumatic brain injury " to " severe neurodegenerative disease " on top of that—made it difficult for me to practice properly. Sometimes that bad luck you get when doing research is linked to a breakdown in emotional functioning. Even worse, there were not enough labs to do it myself in these parts of my career. 
 I had decided that I was going to go for a simple but satisfying work out. It was fairly open season for lab workers in North America. That was a hard thing to prove, considering they needed so many of those super-vacuum cleaners to make the vacuum cleaner. But here I was, halfway through the year-long internship, barely made friends with anyone I knew, and could barely offer myself a medical degree. Something inside me was beginning to tell me that the " junkie" actually wanted the hell out of my life. 
 I hadn't left my apartment as suddenly as I left my apartment two weeks ago. The spray painted lights cut into my bedroom, and a spider thing sat on my nightstand. I saw her hitch a car and crash head-on into the sidewalk, the spray painted light getting closer to her head. I staggered and tried to get away, but the sun blocked all of my vision. It took me a minute before my phone chimed the reply. I ran towards it and into the garbage can, screaming in pain. The spider thing strangled me, and I rushed towards it as fast as I could, cradling the fallen thing in my arms. 
 The spider thing started to twitch. I could tell at first because my brain raced, but I knew she was gone too. No more spider things. The thing that fell from my shirt and hit my head was gone. I reached behind me for her, and felt her breath on my forehead. 
 *No, baby, it's ok. You can help me now. You have to join the bioengineered. Become a chemist. * 
 She wasn't a scientist, but a field technician. It was clear to me, coming from a niche, that there was one of her many projects within this one. Still, I had my days very much spent, working to bring her to life and to make human society a better place. I wouldn't promise the future to anyone, and I wasn't particularly interested in introducing them to me either. But I felt that I could take the money, the work, and the friendships and human decency and the kindness, and save humanity.<|endoftext|>

( Not my best work of art, but it was fun to write ) 
 Driven by paranoia as high and mighty as that of a God who planned every act of evil he saw, as the clues told him did a thing. He was far above the average. How could this be? 
 Where did he go? Where were the companions? 
 He needed to know. As he rose to power, he would have to get his soul back before a problem arose. He followed the pathway off the top of the construction that led to this building; a very observant and if the bold leadership could be solved in under an hour, it was certain death. He knew now what happened to that man during that week of terror. He did not remember much of it. 
 When he arrived in darkness, as he started to hate the glow that always enveloped him, a bag was placed in his back pocket. He pulled the metal box out, waited patiently and prepared for the worst. 
 "You were a god, hun, " the men said, " how did you end up here? It was a cheat. 
 " Listen well, there is no such thing as a cheat anymore," the man replied, and he vanished. 
 There was a gaping hole where he had fallen. He went out of it, full on. He would go back to being a human once more. He would be free. He would have to find purpose again. He would return to his morals, his values. 
 But no, it had not been so.

Last minute decision with this job - told me to go into residence. After several other minutes in the scanner with an envelope I returned the envelope with the correct designation. Got to room 110 after seeing my paperwork ready. Shit, I can't stay here for a bit. 
 With my regular family to help me since tonight I had to go to work. I ran one of the scan images over the patient's shoulder. Clearly they left a pre-existing injury in there somewhere and probably have an AN injury going through that place tonight. Not much goes through into a young human. I've seen black eyes in humans or so i was told but a blurb had just started adding some lines to make someone else look more than capable. The operative said they were standing over her, doing that annoying arms and legs scan. I got him the dildo that I was told i should be wearing today because he can't make up something like 10 minutes of a normal morning. The owner, in my opinion, should be on the fucking top of the gauntlet. 
 Had to take up bed 5 to the bathroom. I spent the rest of the afternoon lying in bed looking in toilet. But one thing stuck out was there was a 4-1-2 on my age. Then I just checked the distance between daughter and mother. First grade football, then basketball, and then the next year there was basketball, baseball, and high school. Oh God, how am I reading this. My daughter is 13. 
 My wife, who I have been asking and I've just agreed to go talk to her because I'm dumbstruck, was the one who made the bill just tonight. She said she got late with work, having a fever earlier. She was all out getting the rest of her food. They're just like petit, but are too busy trying to work. My wife told me they can buy the animals we live at her house. They'll be wise, I told her, and not act like that. Not good. Not good. 
 I went into my own bedroom for a few minutes, relieved that I might pass out. No, it had happened today. Picking up the ring on the butt of my finger and hurrying out, I figured I should avoid a person and come see what happened. Picking up a garter-lock erection, I went to work. I'd like it to have been the other way around, but my coworkers said it wasn't and I thought it might be either the tail end of something this time. I remembered something that morning, but decided not to look it up. 
 After I had knocked on the door and had spoken to the hostess, who came down to check my pulse and my heartrate, I got into bed. I saw a spider my wife made a note of as if its mayfly had just stuck to the bedside table. I checked my scales, seeing I'd lost a bit this morning. 
 No, I stopped faking my pain. I explained to my wife who I'm working with the next few days in a restaurant right next to our desk and discussed my daughter. I felt safe with her but if it wasn't for the infection, I'd end up needing her a lot less today. Sometimes a bad bite or infection can't quite prevent that from happening. They said there are worse cases coming, because I started working this out, really. I tried every doctor, every doctor, every doctor but it just always got stuck in my head. The longer I went in here the worse it happened. It wasn't like it was cured before. Did I ask anyone when I was going to finish? Is my daughter experiencing a relapse yet? My bosses told me it can wait. 
 I got back to work. Two more days till any general decision with this job. 
 Oh gods, oh heavens. I didn't know anymore. I went in the shower, washed my face and dressed. I set the flower pots and the gas in the dishes. I put down the aspirin and headed to work the next day.<|endoftext|>

I remember when I first met Jean. Her dark eyes were filled with fear, and her air trembled like seas as she fluttered, entranced by me. Sometimes I would run for cover from the rain, blindfolded. But she resisted me. Then I got someone else's scent and was terrified. But when the time came to call it quits, Jean reassured me with words like, "It's not over." But I never got her back, not for a year after that.<|endoftext|>
**********366**********
I blinked out of existence. The peaceful feel of isolation in front of me was fading slowly. I had awoken, floating in air, staring into the emptyness that was my heart. Perhaps it was too far into space to know where I was. Time was I imagined.<|endoftext|>
**********367**********
I was 17 when they first came out of Egypt. It was the third greatest nation we had seen in over twenty years. They told us there was only one people and every language they could think of was extremely outdated. And what they didn't know, yet, was that you could *bite* your tongue in 24 hours, so for some reason we had to listen when we spoke them. 
 I can remember saying to my grandfather that it was almost too violent; or, in retrospect, an argument would be a better word. Our older cousins wouldn't see the signs. Their words seemed to be wishing us trouble. So we listened. 
 Our younger cousins didn't need to be weirder. There was the world wars, our newer neighbors in Africa, India and China all fighting over a unified Asian strategy. One man's ignorance would certainly bring him harm. There was the tulip festival, the flight from Southern Africa to Singapore, the spring picnic and winter painting competitions. 
 So, in spite of all it's trouble, I listened to them. I spent a lot of time listening to them. Some of them had their own unique languages and they read nothing but their own poetry to each other. One of my cousins from Oxford penned a poem about how people would only speak in old textbooks and our elders would seldom even try to translate it to English. He mentioned that people once sang songs about a series of big iron dragons – very impressive in itself. Little bit of poetry told us about a hena forest once nearby, where a dragon would use a special harvest of beans to make a big jetpack to fill out. 
 As a youth I fell in love with Irafa the Elephantine - my Chinese-speaking cousin. I had heard about it online and tried on it once, trying in vain to share what I had learned on the internet with other Irafa, but my friend Noah gave us one of his many books. 
 The world had changed. We were becoming a greedy, vapid bunch of people, that would never understand the consequences of their actions. We were losing some of our brilliant minds. Too many beautiful people were trampled to death. Too many questions were unanswered. 
 We each thought there would be a solution. A solution to our world. Some of us thought our existence was only the beginning, and we were probably never meant to arrive on a paradise planet. We considered only ourselves, *us*. 
 And we decided one day that we needed a vacation in their beautiful, elephant-infested paradise.<|endoftext|>

 *Daenerys died a bloodthirsty ice monster, I killed them all! * 
 And then upon the Iron Throne the stone statues, this tombs, this crownedly long vaults, steps upon the empty, rocky path. From across the room the mighty stag stood. 
 *Daenerys appears, with a massive blade that showed a ferocious pride, fingers outstretched and claws at Robb and his brothers. He darts and engages Tyrion in a brutal, hand held fight with the council of darkness. Our great king stood down, surrounded in darkness. * 
 Viserys stood still. Blood finally squirted from her sashions that had scarred his face and hips. She left, her feet still resting against the hard wall of the center of this wall. 
 The door banged open and Daenerys entered, thick, dark teeth grinning as they stared at her. " Huh, buddy, " she smirked, " cool. Did I give you anything to drink? " She held out her palm and the denizens behind a great cone of glowing green drapery surrounded Daenerys with everything they were accustomed to. 
 " God damn it. I'm pretty thirsty. " Daenerys saluted her, " God damn it. The books's on me and you aren't going out tonight. " Her voice trailed off as she smirked again and closed the lid. 
 " If you know anypony like me, the summer monsoon will be rolling, " 
 " What's the matter with you? " 
 She started laughing. " Over last year I found somehorehous sapphire. High in the air. I took it and we went back on the continent to see. Excuse me... " Daenerys started while drawing a long covered patch of rope along its shoulder. " I thought you would have made something here. " She turned her head, the old path of the cave illuminated by a gaggle of dancing flies. 
 " Uh huh. " 
 A footstep followed. He screamed for her to stop. " Fling away his eyes! " 
 No response. Her weight began to sink in. " Well, shit, why don't you think about what you have. You have a great gift, " she muttered to no one in particular, " You're a Jerk, a piece of ass for some dickhead god damn bastard. " As she exhaled heavily, two more flies snarled in what seemed like the same atmosphere as last year. A tall dead man appeared in the middle of the room and before he had a chance to stop his laughter, he released his arm and gently let out a long, rosy laugh. 
 With that, the tall dead man appeared and strutted out of the darkness behind her. She shrieked and fled towards the thin wall, her body wrapped in her robes. 
 *Okay, maybe I'm just nitpicking, but you should know that I chose this one. It's a Schmo character and I wanted it to have the body and many of the traits that only a king's knight would have.

"If the police don't know, " the Assistant said, dipping his finger across the screen that showed a graphic of a dark metropolis that seemed to stretch on forever. " I said stop running the cameras. You just follow me. " 
 " I don't know who does or doesn't know, " I muttered back, hitting the tiled button on the back of the computer in the room. 
 " How many people have your phone number on it, " he said, taking a step back, a little unnerved. 
 " Three. " 
 " Five, " I said. " Why? " 
 " Once I broke a person's head, " he said. " So that I have to go through whatever the hell happened. " 
 " I'm keeping up with this legal shit, " I said. " Just when the Texas Rangers bring in a bust in such an illegal way, do you think I'll see how bad this shit gets? " 
 " No, " he said. " No worries. You'll see." 
 He turned to go, but I caught him with another step before pulling him into a one-way elevator. I didn't move. They kept sending dudes along for a reason. Wherever it took me to get this job, I never left it. By then the trouble had already grown worse, and the taxes were too high for me to take. How had they not noticed? The cops were sending tons of guys in for drugs, and the editors were actually having a hard time writing a book. I guess their pep talks in tears were nice on top of that. 
 I think I'm just a broke man with a little brain, yeah.<|endoftext|>

I've been en route to work at the corporate office for the last several months as I await the time to send back my e-mail to wife Judy. 
 She's not the typical middle aged woman to really have long thoughts about the whole "Plan to better my life ". It's almost often thought that it is her life, but her entire personality is that of a cocky poor bastard that gets laid by fat ugly executives. 
 She hates being called on about things she doesn't like and she doesn't like everyone that criticizes her so that she will lead them in the opposite direction. A hollow word that should have been chosen by Santa where Christmas was fun. But by the woman who hated to be criticized by lawyers who were married to rich superiors, she has now been told by God that she should give in to being known as the man that drove her husband insane for her to change. The word said it all but she hated herself for it. 
 Now on a Friday night on a Sunday morning, Judy was out drinking with people and that's exactly what she did. She had to know who the man was. He had tried to threaten her with murder and so she followed him into an elevator. She was even thrown out, too, just by the brief moment she lay face down in the dust at the top of the elevator. 
 The man approached her and stuck his hand out at her. " Lovely days, Judy. I have nothing better to do. " He snickered. 
 The officers put their guns to her head and began to talk. Judy looked around the floor. She didn't even notice the officers walking down the hall towards her office. They weren't the most beautiful people Judy had met in her life, but they all deserved a fair hearing. 
 She smiled. " Good morning, Barbara. " She stepped out of the elevator and onto the hot, velvet carpeted floor. 
 A man walked in, eyes wide. He held a red gun. " Well, um, I had some questions. " He shrugged. " I couldn't answer any questions. " He ripped out a cigarette from his pocket and removed it from Judy's mouth. 
 Judy laughed. " What is it? " Judy couldn't say anything. 
 " It's funny. No one has guessed that the bad man had something in common with you. " He fidgeted with his cigarette. 
 " Well, wouldn't you say that just falls into the realm of logical. Unusual. Interesting. Interesting. Always curious. Interesting. Funny. Interesting. Interesting. " 
 Judy waited for the hell this man had finally offered up. One of the officers grabbed her and pointed it towards her head. She stared at it for a full minute before knocking on the door. 
 He spoke in a thick, low voice " There you are, Judy. Are you ready? " 
 " I'm ready, little one, " he snapped. His finger clattered against a piece of paper, light snowflakes darted across it. 
 Judy stared at it in amazement, she didn't even understand the words coming from her mouth. 
 " So it turns out that his wish had come true! " The man shouted. " We can create an entire world outside our laws!" 
 Judy looked up at the cop, the boy had expected death. He reached for the gun. The gun shot out from underneath her desk and his finger started to strike. 
 Judy shot him.<|endoftext|>

It's hard to be a better man. I mean, I had many, many advantages. I could never hurt anybody, and no one could ever harm me. But now, suddenly, I realized that I could not do this harm. I grew old, hungry, and tired. This went on forever, and I got tired of living every day at the same pace. 
 Now, I have to go. Now I have to kill myself. I take a giant blade from my waist and cut my own throat with it. This has definitely taken a toll on me. And the pain. 
 When I was first sentenced for murder, it was all pain and suffering. I tried everything I could to live as my life was ruined, but that wasn't what led to my sad fate. 
 Now, despite my suffering, I always get to be the good cop. It's been two and a half years since the day I committed murder, and my life has been hell.

Your meal was delicious. Served with all three ingredients carefully, a high-fidelity red velvet steak, a French Toast, something of a hearty taco, and the requisite bagel. 
 Plate came to a sodden halt with a hint of a rolling cough as you remembered ordering it. Your face turned red. It was only a moment, but that felt like a moment of full awareness. But this wasn't right. You remembered, but didn't remember when you'd sent it back to home. You remember you got a call two years ago, after the blackout. Someone had called your job, and then you got a call again. It sounds like you came home from work late last night, you remember, and it sounds like you were going to be late. 
 A ringing in your head awoke your instincts but soon you were asleep, and you had forgotten what had happened to you the night before. 
 How do you explain forgetting this, the matter which has brought you here, how do you say you got the call? 
 You both remember the hotel room. The food is cold, and the house is dark; have you been drinking? Yes, of course I had been. I was completely alone, mostly just watching TV as much as I could. 
 Every night before breakfast, you ask yourself "what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to do this? How do I explain the events of this life to you? How do I explain to you why I'm here to witness this? I never wanted to murder. I want to make myself responsible. " 
 You could ask yourself that the conclusions you have drawn are perfectly plausible. You know, when we slip in truthfully, it has always seemed like a lie. But now, every night since you made the call, you realize what you were told. 
 You realize your love for Julia. You even want to lie about it. But it's the only way to explain. It really is. 
 So here is why I have to answer: you never murdered Julia, you lied to us. You should apologize for being so foolish to admit the truth to me. You should apologize for having you there. 
 There is no way. And you know I know what you are thinking. 
 But why do you want to argue with me? You have just won the case. 
 The car drives right up to your house, drives across the street, and they are there. As soon as they leave you, as quickly as they stop, and step out of the car. One of them approaches and stares at you. Julia is holding onto you, its head tilted back in its sweetest fantasy. They touch, but it can't move; the eyes always closed, its lips bared. So your mind just stays together. 
 Why should they have done this? 
 Why have they not waited for your entire life? 
 Why should there be a distinct lack of memory in your veins, wondering about how your body would respond without your most intimate knowledge? 
 Because you asked yourself " How do I explain this, the matter which has brought you here?" 
 You are alone now.<|endoftext|>

*It's called beautiful. * 
 *But.. how. * 
 *? * 
 *Here we go again. * 
 "Greetings my lord. " 
 His eyes, grating, narrowed as he shifted nervously, trying to conjure words to convey that he recognized this monk's identity, but stopped short of joy when he saw his vision be noted. Almost as if it felt like a part of his brain, the seeing shattered into a chasm of anxiety as he listened for a response. 
 This didn't feel right at all. That being said, it felt *right. * 
 A presence in the room approached, a giant, orgy-like muscle dominating the outside of his body, a bearded figure who looked like he was about to win the romantic win, and a woman. 
 " Zuhlinski, Mr. Dubrovsky! We apologize for this interruption, but this is perfectly fine. Come in, I'll see you tomorrow. We're offering you a chance to take your own life. " 
 She smiled at him, using one hand to hold onto his chair and the other to guide him through the lavish back door to the chapel. She pointed her index finger up towards him, nervous to say the least. 
 " Bye zuhlinski. " 
 " Will you stay? " He blurted out, shuddering as he realized that he already knew how... 
 *** 
 " Zuhlinski, how can I help you? " 
 " I don't understand. Are you alright? " 
 " Just about. So it's about time you also gave up on your marriage and pick up your... Your... Why am I the only one that can see you perfectly today? " 
 " Stop. I want to see you. So I can be that person you've always wanted to be. I want that body I always wanted to be. I want you to be a good person, whatever that means, and you're not letting go. I want to make it like a family. " 
 " Why? " 
 " Because... " 
 " Because, Zuhlinski, if you give up your past and go, you'll be able to look at that big idiot at the right time, for good. I've been through hell myself, and I'm ashamed to admit I'm certainly not the best fit for family. It's all because... and now that we're married, I can't *relieve my mother grief anymore! *"<|endoftext|>

My mother stole my mother ’ s food. No dad wanted that as a mother. When I went to the movies, mom made all the dark things in her front yard. Dinosaurs, German nesting dolls, ribeye decorating a large dinner party. All those things was very. 
 When we arrived in Hollywood, Mom was in late bloom, so she can get me whatever she wanted. I'm in France for three days, I ’ ve only only been here a day. I can ’ t travel back to my house. 
 All the homeless people dying inside the front yards. They all have guns in their mouths or in their hands. There ’ s no way you can make friends in this kind of shit. I thought I was in a movie, or some crazy guy with a gun, just getting into the race. My mother had to kill a god. But that ’ s not my job anymore. 
 Our jobs start when our kids are born. I ’ m sitting here on my porch with my seat belt on. Just waiting for mom to show up. Yes, it ’ s there. No, it ’ s free! We get paid for all the living. There ’ s really no need to pay to move the house. 
 The gun that was tied to the frame of my mouth dropped when I saw it. I never heard them shoot that. Not before they killed anyone. And yet, there it was. Straight up. That ’ s when I realized I didn ’ t take the gun. I would take that in later. We never saw them again. Mom would go back to check on us afterwards. 
 Mom later told us there was fire all over the house. When it was all over, we were helping some drunk kid shoot a couple people in the front yard. I can ’ t remember anything else about that. But I can guess what was wrong. To think I hadn ’ t noticed. My hands were off. 
 There was a lot of yelling and barking. I mean, it was definitely loud. The girl in the front yard wasn ’ t there. Before we got to the porch, we made the call for backup. No one said anything. It was ridiculous. I wanted to turn back. But mom grabbed my wrist. 
 I ’ m looking at myself in the mirror now. I don ’ t think it hurt anymore. I tried to run but my brother ’ s gun is locked behind the wall. If my mom is here now, it is because she makes my dad miss his race. He doesn ’ t really make me miss mine though.<|endoftext|>

The man was pacing the park play, his hair yet much more gray. While sitting next to his grandfather on the bench, looking up at the dawn, he tried to ask out someone, but his back carried on down the hole-in-the-wall porch. Across the dimly lit paved street, he strode silently towards the park. * Blue... * the deck his grandfather had made for him at the Little Little Man Golf Club of Heaven, in between the lawns of the park and a certain park bench. Suddenly, he felt a blip sound behind him. * It was at that exact moment! * he whispered, eyes open for a second and eyeing his watch. He stood still, leaning on the bench. A deep breath. He reached into the pocket of his sweater, holding out a small orange notebook. The man was looking at it impatiently. Now he was asking what type of the gene it was. There was the earth turning around. Then, another blip. The man started walking. He kept walking. * More blips... * the man murmured. * An optimal diet... * The next piece, though, did not occur to him. It began circling the office, swiping across it an endless pile of paper with a derisive sneer. * You're just an embarrassing name for a god damn single mommy. Why's your family not allowed to be with her? * He grabbed a pen, set it down and covered his mouth. He started to get up. Suddenly, his steps stifled and kept rising, elevating him to the right. Suddenly, the man stopped pacing and was staring right at him. A gesture, though, he cannot understand. 
 He *tried* to call the police but it got cut off, and the man lost interest, and of course the police had nowhere to be found. Instead, he ran around back into the park, grabbed two more pieces, and led them the way they were. The man was finally at the park. As he searched, the park seemed to blur until he could find a bench and make out that it was the common lawn. In his haste, he dialed the nearest park property number, where he ducked behind the Jumbo Jet overpass, which he had anchored with his fork. He then proceeded to walk around the stand that the other bench fell down into. They, his grandfather after all, held the reason to their treason to one another, so he interrupted the speech just as the diamond pressing into his spine began to grow, and he collapsed onto the ground. 
 When he awoke, he looked over and saw his grandfather beside him in the same spot that he had fallen. * OK*, the man thought, before pulling out a gun.<|endoftext|>

"*What the Hell? * " A small, overweight looking man with a stun gun pointed at the gates. " Where are you bringing this shit! " 
 Tic Tac Tac thought he was a... shit barbarian god for giving Paladins some Skoombaa in launch week. The heavily armoured truck screeched wildly as they returned to Patso's office. The countdown on time again ticked around in his head as he ran to greet Steam house. 
 Goblin didn't really want to do this. Half life 3, the end game, was an answer to all the questions he was asked and more. Almost immediately, the meek Statue of Liberty was announced. Small, lightweight, mechanically agile and with a giant hole in the shield behind it. It was now in the hands of some biker. 
 He got up and marched out of Steam's office, his bundle of paperwork clutched in his hand. 
 He took a knee and looked around in the slaughterhouse. 
 Tic Tac had a crazy amount of money in his pocket, but what else in a game of craps? His rental car was about to start as he unloaded and gave up a drink for a patsy in the back of the convertible. It took a couple more minutes before he could walk out of the building. Peering the surrounding meadows he spotted a factory. He hopped out and confronted a very hairy and a surprisingly skinny man sporting a big beard. The man tried to calm Tic Tac down and stiffly complimented him on his work. He walked over to him and cupped his hands around his waist. He said, " This is foreign land. " 
 Tic Tac got an almost smug look from the man. 
 " It's grassland that the government likes to take over, " the bearded man responded. " They put tires up here, they have tried it on people they like! " 
 " They don't know what we know, " said a tattered young, evil-looking, meat-drink. 
 The bearded man spat out a mouthful of starchy green stuff. " We got this guy growing cannabis already! " he ordered. 
 " They're trying to reduce it, " cried Tic Tac from the secret service. 
 " We have access to their entire arsenal. Every multi-million dollar factory is being stored in our area as a... proof of force or maybe it's the fault of a fictional character. That's what all the president's schemes of international vengeance are based on now. They're trying to create an economy that aspires to revolutionize it. I've got a system in place to do it! The state must rule their people through power! " 
 " Lets start with their nuclear arsenal, " he ordered. 
 Tic Tac started swinging his sword against the steel fence. " NO, NO, NO! " he shouted. At that moment a news wire began streaming through the screen of the computer. The lines began going everywhere. A low, deafening boom echoed throughout the city. 
 Tic Tac turned and got into the nearest building. All around him soldiers were firing shells at another building, covering the was which held a total of 55 sniper rifles and air silencers. These were the teams that had been sent to fight in the fight. They were sprinting out of the gates. Everyone was firing their weapons at the English speaking mercenaries. 
 Tic Tac saw an American soldier exit the building and run towards a near by firemen. Three more American soldiers came rushing towards him. " So you are saying the Army and CIA wanted to take over America?" the American laughed. Tic Tac had an idea. He wanted to avoid any international conflict. 
 Tic Tac stepped inside the Grand Army which was now just below the North Pole. He brought down his pistol and aimed at the wall as he drove, he was about to approach it, when the door opened. His gun bore the name of the largest Latin officer in the army. The man who had tortured his forces for so long entered the building. 
 Tic Tac drove the pistol into the wall while watching dozens of British men wander in. Tic Tac had finally decided.<|endoftext|>

Now there was nothing, except this tree. 
 When every tree of Eden had spun and sang as wild gods, it was there, twirling and twisting, jiggling and twirling its way through the chilly and dark places. Now there was only one tree: a forest. 
 Or so the story went. 
 Of course, The Right Tree was wherever the forest ended. 
 It had been there for all of time. Every tree having at it's tip, the sun and moon cast warmth and shade upon the green earth as they told the stories of many who had gone before it. 
 The Right Tree had become the Earth, the cause of all pain and suffering in the Forest, the slow dripping spasmodic womb of life and death. 
 But by the time the tree had begun that path, the story had stopped. He left it, the tree stayed on, and the peace, the language, and the ash. 
 The Right Tree sent out strangers and wonderful beasts, and rocks and even bodies of flies. 
 But he never returned. And at last the trees did return. 
 And here is where the mystery abounded. Did the Right Tree call upon the water? Where did it return to, because the lake and the ocean were holy? 
 The trees themselves could not find any signs of life outside the forest, and the trees watched them for a lifetime, watching and praying that a friend could go to help them. 
 Then they sat down, and they prayed, believing, groaning, that if they could come see The Right Tree, he would show them the mysteries of the world, and leave them alone to meet the Green Wind and come watch over it, and let them travel forth into the future and understand it. 
 And so they prayed. And then came The Storm. And now The Right Tree has returned, to spin through the forest with a barky hand and the smell of death upon the landscape. 
 From its branches and its roots:

"NOOO? " 
 He was so in shock. I couldn't even see right, I couldn't understand who he was. Now it was just as I remembered it. I was stood on a hill, watching thousands of people being quarantined, just waiting to be recaptured by the savages. I didn't want to even look at him, I didn't want to cause any harm; I was terrified by how far the place had gotten him, how fast it may go... 
 I lifted myself up, holding his eyes tightly with all my might. " Please. I'm so sorry. " I started sobbing, screaming from my tears, trying to touch him. 
 " No. You're innocent baby. We just wanted to help you, and we couldn't do that to you any more. Please don't cry. " I heard my son yelling. 
 I fumbled around in my pocket, probably hoping he would calm down, maybe I was hallucinating. " We're sorry for everything, please just- " he just started to speak again, as tears welled in his eyes. 
 A man walked over and kissed me on the forehead. " Please don't let me see this again," he said softly. 
 I burst into tears. This will never happen. The peace I was not expecting again.<|endoftext|>
**********380**********
I looked him in the eye, and it was my only chance. 
 Because I had to tell him. I tried the air out with little success. No matter how many jokes he threw at me over the radio, I couldn't stop listening to the mighty truck sound through the radio. The day all of this started when I was 18, and I had no idea what to do. So I went from not knowing, to not knowing at all. 
 But this was different. As soon as I stepped into my little black SUV, what I would know, would be not knowing. 
 He looked the same, and was pretty happy to be me. For the first time since we met, he was okay. I think I asked him about my mom, or dad, or if that was all I was. And how he loved me, or if I was the one that was always there for him. 
 We were spending our days getting washed in front of all the kids, and now I couldn't wait to tell him. I ran the center console of the hairdresser and plugged into the electric relay I had previously loaded into the driver's seat of the truck. I looked down at the little mom and told her it's time for the day, that I had to return to that place on his terms. 
 The little mom sat back down and gestured me to sit down on his lap. I took a breath and looked into his eyes. I gave my wits about me and my future, but I knew we were just going to spend our days in the sun, filled with joy and wonder, and we would be ok. 
 I grabbed the rag that was lying on my lap and tied the back of my dress shirt around my neck as I left the vehicle, and I walked out of the house, what I thought was my childhood home.<|endoftext|>

"Are you sure these are right Anna? " 
 " Yes. Yes, Anna is right. " 
 This is going to be the first day of basic training Anna has found herself in while remembering every opportunity to tip, sprinkle and wipe with the tears of regret and understanding. 
 But it's hard not to feel like it's being a terrible parent. It's hard to laugh, and we should regret it. We shouldn't. It's too much to take it personally. Even though there's a 10 % chance that something bad will happen. To think of something better would be a sign of failure and hard shit. 
 Anna's head. She needs to stop crying. She needs to stop clenching her fists like this is a game to her. She needs to stop dying inside... 
 A ball of cold blood is dribbling from the base of her skull into her windpipe as her opponent clutches his jacket's hot little flange like a hammer. His breath is high. He needs to stop the bleeding. 
 Her frustration is running through her veins. The pain is like a hypnotic flow of a mouth, it's reaching up to soak into her skin and howling with anxiety. All of a sudden, her mind splits like a large nail into shards of glass, perhaps empty. 
 " Come on, Anna. " 
 Her hand reaches into her bag. She's in it for today. She has to decide this. It's their little game that she must make her choice. 
 " You win. " 
 Anna stands up. Standing. She's already almost lost track of time. " Stop playing with me. " 
 " Anna, I am always prepared. But I know you have no idea what you're doing. " 
 And she smiles, " You know you've got nothing to lose. " 
 " This isn't about me, Anna. This is about you. You know this. You can feel it in your bones. You can tell when you do it. " 
 " Do what? You did something good for us? You did enough good for us? " 
 Anna doesn't need to ask. " I am innocent, Anna. I made you happy. You made us better." 
 As the piece of granite pierces the darkness of their hearts, and them beginning to feel happy too, they're joining in as well. The life that they have, the dreams that they just knew for the first time, the opportunities they must have had, the cute dreams of the future, all gone. Everything they think of now is a lie. 
 They are the lucky ones now, and they know what that means. They are the only ones at the mercy of their gods, and they know what it is they must have done. They know what will happen, and they never will look away.<|endoftext|>

he wasn't getting off easy yet, he had been desperate and out of the running for an exact amount of time now. So the preacher stormed down the street with some supplies and tools for the apocalypse he was about to encounter and helped to make it less than a thousand feet. 
 the preacher arrived at his destination, his wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. So interesting to witness that, beyond the posters, banners and billboards, men, women and children appeared. to different men and women as well, a bloodbath began. 
 "Jesus Christ man what the hell is going on? " an old man screamed as the family with a young boy on his bed with a graying beard stepped out of the foyer. 
 " Well sir, there's this topic that popped into his head " said the preacher 
 " Bullshit everyone there " 
 " What? like everyone have those cake burning drums in their houses? " 
 " No I mean no. What is going on? we've all heard the legend about them, how they have come to dominate the world. I wasn't told anything because of the rumor " 
 " C'mon man, you can't believe that shit. Jesus Christ what the hell was that? " 
 " Call it what? you mean a thing, that's what you're talking about " 
 The preacher followed suit and shouted " I'm just coming to put this down please " 
 " Sir, no... " 
 " Ok. Yes, take those weapons, guns and another big group of four. " 
 he handed over a big, black, staff and all 4 weapons all to a concerned looking young man. 
 " Why are we on them first? " 
 " Well, they're very deadly to a very specific group of people. well, not you don't know but they come in no matter what. " he pointed the weapons at people with particular hammer types. 
 " Yeah man, let's do it please " 
 they all gathered around the holy altar and attempted to figure out how to kill them. 
 after a few months of careful planning, they went through all the motions, set their weapons, and drew up a knife. " What is the name of this weapon? " they asked. 
 " Uh, uh the Slayer, yeah. " the young man said 
 " All they need is one drop of blood and for all they know, they will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in the last fifty years."<|endoftext|>

"Look man, we just want to help out in Afghanistan, ya know? " 
 I nodded, trying my best to keep my mouth shut as I unloaded a loud rock. 
 Some on the inside looked frustrated and revolted, but at the same time they were glad my words had been said. They certainly had no idea what my the situation was. 
 " Alright, let's go try and help out, " I said, as my blue jumpsuit flipped on on. 
 " Really? What did you think about what you were seeing? " 
 " Let's start with your science fair speeches, " I said as my sharp eyebrow raised as I opened my mouth to say, " Or our nearby really cool fights. If you don't mind me asking -- did any of them make it in the fight? " 
 One of the booths covered the ground, as if someone had erected a massive hurdle into the blue jumpsuit. Although they never shot anything into the ground, they popped, and the smoke created a cloud surrounding their backs. 
 " Well... it certainly didn't feel like that then. " 
 " You said it wasn't cool, too? " 
 " We didn't test it, that was our guess. " 
 " Were you afraid? " 
 I almost felt ashamed, I had given them so much to be scared. But I was too smart. 
 " Why? " 
 " Don't you think so, I'm pretty sure it's just a little weird that they brought this to happen. " 
 I didn't have to answer. My goal was clear. They were going to fly, taking down eight of my men and disrupting my platoon's plan to hold this country hostage. If I just let their entire force of 7th Squad take down that one foe, their entire plans and plot would collapse. I had to do it. 
 " Okay, let's go take on a little battle. " 
 A small grin reached my lips, it was so fake, yet so believable. All of a sudden there was so much intensity and determination. The sky suddenly become the sky as it burned. 
 " Let's see what this can do, " the giant flew towards me in his aviators. " It'll help a lot. Give me some head start, throw someone in the arena, and just watch what happens. That's going to help me win, at the very least." 
 I stepped into the cockpit. Helicopter type, but flying as fast as I could. They killed an entire battalion of enemies from five years ago, I saw how these jumpsuits only took three minutes for a flyaround. But I knew their secret, and it was leaking. I had to do this. 
 All of a sudden, I opened my eyes and saw them taking down my men. There were six or seven of them in the air. It took me a few seconds to make out their gunship sails, that had wings. 
 After I took some more time to think about the situation, I realized that this was going to get even easier as soon as a second jump started.<|endoftext|>

**Inferior Creature: Carl Caleb Powell** 
 Oh lord was it going to get darker and darker. He's a monster that can't stand up to some better villains, but we couldn't get him killed before he figured the dance routine out... 
 That was when Heist-atti kidnapped Mason. We thought, let it come out, just for a bit. Mason was scared as hell by what he saw. 
 Well, that was when we sent him to a private security academy, where he confessed the truth. 
 How easy it would be to get a fellow with powers at a private prison to act against him. Why didn't he meet a standard set of rules, trust me. We were trained for menial tasks in isolation and then we learned how to work together. 
 In the beginning the students took up Dungeons and Dragons and spent their money on starting a school community. As the first set of school plays were played and built off the book, Mason eventually learned to play just like the other members of his class. 
 It's not like the teachers knew that he was big on encounters. Instead they had a tote bag on his head and hooked up some slimy makeshift torches, pretending to work for him. Mason couldn't even finish the first program. He spent the rest of the first semester in a solitary tent, making sure nothing went wrong and that nothing stood out against the crowds. 
 Now it's the 24th of July and all the scouts are scouting into Mason's lair for intruder, the man named Carl Caleb Powell. 
 Mason looks at his watch. 18:07. 
 Boom. 
 Sheriff McGee is crawling toward Mason, looking increasingly confused. 
 Shit. Did the best you could get from a private safe. Mueller can't possibly change his course of action on his way to the aid of his parents. 
 Two helicopters jump into the air at a rate of 50 miles an hour, one for every fifteen passenger plane heading for Mason's tight fitting prison cell. 
 Sheriff Adrenzi, an even more cunning sheriff, is about to destroy the siren heard throughout the prison complex. He carefully locates an explosive vest hidden beneath Mason's jacket. He hides it behind a layer of Trenchcoat Capacitors. 
 Sheriff Madinal opens the capacitors and pulls out a large spherical grenade. He turns it toward Mason, who waves goodbye with it and knocks out John Lestrade, Mason's student. 
 Sheriff Madinal taps out Sherry's voicemail. 
 SURPRISE CHRIST, FUCKING ROBERT POPE ( 40 ) I ARE HERE! HOW DARE YOU RETURN ME THIS AMOUNT OF STEAK, WHICH YOU USE FOR CONGRATS AND RANKS & ALL MY SONGS IN SOME DISGRACE? 
 Sheriff Madinal draws his pistol and removes the metal spike from Mason's head. 
 Sheriff Madinal pulls the trigger. The grenade explodes, leaving a series of deaths and broken bones. 
 Sheriff Maddowi is standing by the cell at the conferenc, partaking in a smoke hopper when you cut through her then pinned her along with her squad. 
 Sheriff Madinal approaches Mason, lightly tapping his forefinger on the side of his head. " I will do it. I will prove to everyone you are a dangerous threat, otherwise you could easily be charged with treason. " 
 Mason looks down at Maddowi and tears are falling down his cheeks. He rubs his palm over the tumbler of coughing lungs. " Who told you you could be a dangerous monster?" 
 He reaches up and uncovers handcuffs holding the gun he just killed.<|endoftext|>

Well it's funny, I was four on a state college circuit before those top techie porn rants started being funny. That's when I realized what *this* was. I felt like I was some sort of wizard, and I was tripping on some nefarious energy and I had a sense that it was being destructive. 
 That's when I discovered this thing. So I'm telling you, what's happening when you decide that your magic is powerful? 
 Well I started playing a lot of jousting. It took me a long time to figure out how to do that, so here's my routine when I'm drawing. When a player moves ( whether that's a chainsaw, to take down a target, or just the basics like to cast spells ), he's forbidden from entering the game. 
 Or so I thought. After an extensive, painful search, I found myself needing to find a person's permission card, a traveler's travel card, or even a heirloom spell card. I figured there had to be some type of trouble. I glanced around, and looked for pieces of card, or even a name. What I found wasn't what I expected. There had to be a curse. And the thing that triggered that was so powerful, the ember burned down, the chip on my noodle arm sliced open like the hellfire that they used to consume an entire stack of cards. Then the burnt eye burned, the propulsor blew up, and the entire thing exploded. If you look closely at the object, the wood in it's place turns black. And there was a hole in it, like the four iron plates inside the door. My third set of eyes snapped open and I grabbed it from the table and threw it into the earth. 
 I waited as they ripped open the doors, amazed at what they did to the world they began to build. I stepped out from behind the bar and looked around at the scene before me. An entire world, blown up into pieces, stacked on top of each other, which looked like the kind of disaster a magician would have to deal with. 
 There were probably more, probably not even the greatest show you could ever imagine. Maybe they had just called the dead a museum. Hell, maybe they had even installed a bedroll in the middle of the house. It wasn't something I knew for sure, but I could tell. I had to think fast, and quickly. 
 I ran around the table. Out into the streets, past drug dealers, the police, and into the large shopping mall. Inside, I almost felt like I could run. I didn't know where I was going, but I knew I couldn't leave. I thought back on my freshman year at Pomona High and I wrote the paper on the ice of that ice cream shop. It was the one number I had thought of, but it turned out to be a number that covered everything from my first kiss, to how I got my girlfriend in college, to dates, I guess. All this stuff had been *special* to me, so why hadn't I begun to think about it? 
 I put on my new pair of shoes and threw on my old ties. I went inside and ran outside, but it was too late. The ice cream I had been drinking suddenly stopped again. That's when I realized. The world was blowing up because of me. These magic spells wouldn't do. I knew my mark didn't know what kind of power he had. 
 I went outside. I didn't want to do anything. I was gon na die, it had to happen somehow. I turned on the light, looking for the source of the fireball that began to engulf the building. The only magic I had was able to keep the world out of it's grasp. I grabbed the plane I was leaving to go get some ice cream and began to fly. 
 I may have killed them all. But I don't know what they do now.<|endoftext|>

You are my only friend. Your only friend! 
 I thank you for not being able to find your heart; but we can only do so much with one heart at a time. 
 You created my mind and soul, because you had each of you on your own. Without your own, my body in your hands could not recognize you; but I was the first one that knew. With you, the fog dissipated. 
 And then my body was first, just like you. But then I knew you weren't the one. I know you were me. And I knew it was just a coincidence. 
 And so my body made our perfect bond! My face is the first one to reveal my true nature! 
 You are a maker and a dear friend. We were even siblings; even if it was only the ink that ran together. But if you wished for me, with my heart, to expand, the hearts that spread were born together, from a circle to a whole, with your mind.<|endoftext|>

I exhaled slowly. 
 "... I know what they do to people. Those disgusting bastards. You know them well enough. Like me. I always thought I was immune. At my young age. And I'll never forget that stupid... God... my mom was quite the brat. How can an honorable and legal defense ever stand against that? That devilish psychopaths here at the Prison Service can. That's why there's no mercy for anyone. Back then, everybody had their first words to them. Tell me, were you father? Did you threaten your wife? Fled your son? Or kidnapped my best friend? Did you - " 
 She broke off a bullet in my head. My eyes widened in shock. I looked around again. 
 " Woman, I... " I stammered. 
 The PrisonService took a step forward. My blood pressure increased and even my breathing stopped. A few gurgles escaped out of my mouth as they strode towards me. A cage lapped at the corner of my eye, and I stood in shock, unable to hold back my astonishment. 
 " It's funny, baby, " the Guardsmen said. 
 My mother had sobs again, and I wanted to strangle her. How could this be happening? How could this happen, in my situation? 
 " It was you mother, " the Guardsmen continued. 
 I remember the children crying. The children crying. The children on the other side of the cage. The Guardsmen played. Then the Guardsmen withdrew. 
 The cage went to the side of my hands, and then to my feet. The young guard stood still and picked at his sword with the solid white rope hanging from his neck. 
 I walked towards the cage door. It creaked open from under the weight of an armed guard. His eyes widened as he picked up his sword, and stepped in. 
 "... You've brought me death and destruction. All life is over you. " 
 My mother began to mutter the last bit of words as he flipped his knob. A white light burst out of the cage door, and I heard a thump as a hole opened in the concrete. 
 An angry guard, tall, and muscular, walked in and surrounded me. " Don't move. " 
 He held my hands firmly. 
 " Just stay where you are, " he demanded. 
 I shook my head. I didn't want him to do this to me. 
 He exited the cage, and straightened up and walked away. His eyes focused on the water for a moment. He stared at me for a few more moments, then he spoke. 
 " So, are you ready, you know. I can prepare you, too. I'll only take you with me to the cell, and show you something. Something good. And one last thing. When do you guys - I hate when you hold a console over a square root. The only square root that you won't lose. And start crying, baby. Come here, baby. I'll take you to your parent's place. Do it! " 
 The guards all took off their clothes. No one noticed them. I couldn't hear them anymore. I didn't want to be alone anymore. 
 I stood there for a couple of days, and when I came home, I saw my family and my parents. Then I realized I had wiped all the tears out of my face. A towel lay on the floor beside it, and I took it and wiped my face. I put it in my pocket, and another towel. I dropped it back down on the floor and felt it, in my hand. A small towel. It had a point. I held it there for a second. It was my protector. 
 My thoughts raced, and finally, I held up the towel. I could feel myself moving. I took a deep breath, and sat back in the chair. It felt surreal. Finally, I was calm. I was safe. 
 At the center of my body, a simple box sat. I opened it. There was a lever on the top. With a click, the panel of the container opened. 
 A man walked into the room. I remembered him. He wore a new shirt and trousers. He smiled. The Guard's laughter. 
 " Welcome to your new home, baby."<|endoftext|>

My first ever attempt at writing. Sorry for any mistakes, I was riding a hard time and so will edit it later. First time posting so please forgive any typos, it's my first time posting here. 
 Zan's home. A maze of holes that looks like a funnel. I'm exploring in this, haven't climbed the one before. Ever. Strangely it looks the same as the one before it. The door shows my child's bedroom. She thought the ocean covered in shellfish was real. She knew then how you think when you use a "boat", though. 
 My next choice is the strange and majestic ocean bridge. Cars here are no less awe-inspiring than the ocean. Cars are the most mundane thing you can think of. There is more humor in all the things vehicles can do than a bicycle. 
 The first room, in my youngest form, is empty. Far away and uncompleted. The last room has some practical modifications and some futuristic contraptions that lets me see the world from a computer. It is taken care of. I look about for the chance to sleep in and as I walk along the wall I can see a huge window but at the end of the room sits a tower of nerves and a machine that checks every chemical in my system. 
 I try again and I notice the different shades of gray. Those appear almost smooth and everyone there seems to be expertly sorting in color. This only causes more and more questions. They ask me some questions, and I try to answer them. I am well aware the machine is saying " answer already ", then " answer has already been submitted ". Are these words meant for me, or do these words refer only to other locations or to other things? 
 The two doors are open to the outside world now. No one wants to be on them anymore. I just think it is safe for me to go into the last room. The buzzing of the alarm clock, my pulse slowed, and the sound of my vibrator are as loud as the beach leaves. I guess I should be ready for that one, rather than the fourth one. Perhaps this portal is temporary.<|endoftext|>

"Wait... " an unfamiliar sounding voice croaked softly into the side of my ear, "… Could it be? " 
 Fuck. " She shuffled closer. One too many questions about how she was last seen. Panic gripped me tighter. 
 " It's not your house, " I struggled to keep my voice steady, " not my home, " I panted nervously and rolled my eyes. She clutched tightly to my shoulder, " You can't leave. We're supposed to protect you." 
 I nodded my head, covering her mouth with my hand, and giggled like hell. That little snotty bitch. She never liked me. I couldn't bear the thought of taking over my life anymore. Thats how she got it. Not that she deserved it either, but I guess that's what the whole 'hey you're a good guy' thing is for. Heck, it is for us... After eight years of dread, this damn time it seemed like a good idea to actually raise some water. 
 I shoved my tarp down and flicked on the flashlight that was currently dousing her in her starlit waters. It wasn't working. She was getting cornered by the sea. Too dangerous to paddle through without having the support of the fish to care. I lunged at her in a hurry, but she dodged back and ran towards the shore, her belly flapping like a lamb. Thankfully there wasn't a fish on her shoreline. 
 I pulled out my flashlight and counted to ten. She made it seven inches and yelled for all I had to offer. She was terrified, and I had to defend myself. I hid on the ground by the car in my trench coat. My heartbeat was racing and my lungs grew dry. Her cries were cute. 
 The crackle of crackle echoed in my ears but I couldn't place her. The crackle of her last words which I have never heard. The next thing I knew I was on the ground, mouth agape as my breath caught in my throat. She was frozen. 
 Her last breath would never escape me.<|endoftext|>

*Skip to clip while you're at it! * The clown asks Chloe, bouncing up and down with her perverted comic balls bouncing about in her panties while she masturbates and licks at the guy sitting next to her on the bus. * What the hell!? My luck. * She knew the guy was supposed to get out before midnight. She rushed up to him in haste to grab him. * Sweetie-Bear, I'm so horny! * Everyone cheered, but only when they saw the bully watching the kids run away with the guy. The boy was dead in the middle of the street behind her. She returned to the old mans stomach, crying, *I hate him* and running away with Chloe. 
 *Stop you, bitch! I have to go stop you! * 
 *And you don't. I'm so, so, so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! * 
 *No, I'm not. * Chloe disappeared, leaving the boy alone in the cool winter night. 
 She poked him in the crotch with her little stick, and his cock bounced around her crotch. She kissed him lightly and pulled his hand out with the other to treat him to a hug. She still knew his favorite part about him, stealing lips and kissing every curve that had ever crossed his lips. 
 *This is hard. * She thought, leaving his thoughts behind. 
 *I love you so much, honey. * 
 She left him, picking him up off the ground and squishing him with his sweaty hands. She grabbed his brown furs and held him close. * Does that hurt? Are you ok? * He screamed, but her hand twitched a little as she pulled it back to press it against his lips. She bent over and kissed him, glad that he still had a friend. 
 *I love you so much too. Love you. *<|endoftext|>

Some people call it the dream, some see it as a dream, while others have conjectured it as reality. A simple daydream, true dreams. I entered the cage, but as I did so I began to realize a highly unusual circumstance. This was unique to me, I was not a hamster, neither was I. I remained neutral in the cage, but not seeming to be disturbed from any of my movements. I could hear the humans outside the cage being processed. I moved closer to see what happened... a distant speaker calling the area a "seclusion area " came into my room. 
 "... Are you aware this is not your cage? " 
 The speaker spoke: "... but your cage is now dark. " 
 " What? " 
 " Where is my cage? You have become so close to death. " 
 " What the fuck? " 
 " You finally die. We'll be sent back to every time you make contact with the human. I don't know what you can do, I guess I can't have an action plan. " 
 " Sounds peaceful to me. And God, I hope you are understanding. Your death is inevitable, but I have much to learn. I have been plotting my escape for a very long time. " 
 " We should get started. We've always known how close we should get to getting your mother's hand in the doomsday device. We've always been good to each other... well, until this event. So much has happened since your last death, and we have much to learn about your fate... and what you can do. We're in danger, and I don't care if you die. " 
 The larger, hornier, glistening beacon of the planet swooped through my room, just as I had predicted it to happen. The men surrounding me laughed and laughed, but none of them believed it, I made sure not to begin to feel the fear. 
 " Have you heard of planned utopia? " The man asked. 
 " No. I guess I haven't. " 
 " Great... The guns will be fired and those there will die but at least for now there is food and water. " 
 " Again? " 
 " Of course we have food! " 
 " Yes. The humans are already here. They will be disposing of what remains of our food when they clear the prison. And please don't let them consume us and destroy us. This is the perfect plan, I can finally make you realize why you escaped, and begin to see the effect the utopia has upon the world... Please don't hate them. " 
 " You wouldn't hate them. " 
 " You wouldn't! And worse... Why don't you tell your mother? " 
 " She's gon na die."<|endoftext|>

It was supposed to be a simple trip, saving the people from certain death, finally being able to see that the truth for the time being. I mean, life is not what you thought it would be. Hell, it isn't even what I considered to be even a joy. Like most things is. 
 You get used to it by now. Of course you blame it on me, as the first liar to meet me, it was usually my foolishness that kept me informed, and the government by then taking things very seriously. Hell, I don't even remember what started it all. But, I think it's better to think about it. 
 Instead, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a month and a half ago. At first, my parents expressed concern, but then my brother started referring to my condition as a "sarcasm". He continued talking of family, and psychiatry, but the next day I was allowed to go to a local library, in hopes that I would have a refresher course on the subject. I didn't, thankfully. 
 I had quite a ways to go, I had learned a few things about world records over the course of years. I even got a witness interview with the world's oldest survivor, who clearly didn't expect to get any material but smiles from a brief look. 
 I know, he wouldn't expect me to know, so here goes nothing. I left a note in the hospital, outside the window, with a harmless thing taped to the inside with a picture of my sister. This was just the dream to become something, something real. I don't know if he would ever figure out that I had been living the lie for a very long time, but there it was. A large, almost transparent scar that I was now able to see, showing my true face. I must have been 19, I didn't look 18 at the time, but I didn't remember much after the visit. 
 It took a while, though, but eventually it seemed that my search for truth was paying off. Shortly after I realized that the world was in danger, I realized that I was there. I never actually went near the place. It just sounded like my own home, and it was really quite strange. 
 The thing about my scars, I don't know what to think of. They're tiny in the slightest, but there's something so sturdily deep inside that they're almost gigantic. When I laid my eyes on the first one, I saw nothing but crimson, chestnut skin. Looking into my eyes, I soon realized that the scar... that always drew my attention, too. A scar like nothing else. 
 For what seemed like days, I ran, got in a car, and drove away. Sometimes it would come back a couple of seconds later, but the waves of fear calmed me down. I could easily get a driver's license, I'd go see him from time to time, or it would get much quicker to run as well. They certainly would, as long as there was the money and insurance. But these scars, there was something magical about them, a serenity I can't help but feel quite ordinary, somehow. They made the split with the help of my family, but I could never quite wrap my head around what came next. 
 The scars reminded me of... those trees I grew up, so many ages ago. 
 So, here I am, on the sixth day in my life, have to stare deep into my eyes to see what I am seeing. And when I do, the scars will be there, and each of them will be what I find necessary. Just a little second longer, then...<|endoftext|>

*Lame, but heavy. * 
 Pigeons nestled at the corner of my eye with my thumb and forefinger grasping the base of the bark behind my ears. When I first joined them I didn't realize the shoddiness that they would cause me. They may be green, but green is not one of those red berries they squeeze through your glasses. It's not the kind of life you want to live in. 
 Or oak, to be honest. That can not be said of oak. It is broad and broad and acute. Leafs will want their leaves as abundant as the bark, just waiting to be picked so they can have the warmth of a spring spring and feed by it. They'll keep them warm and warm, staying warm and warm with no strings attached to them. Yet, its not as if it's unfair; it's the great creature, the great feather, that won the war. A feather has one round, perfect end, and a good crispness in it that leaves long branches for pickers to relax and it seems to have this trait, too. 
 *I see what a good feather is. * 
 A single feather isn't even large enough to protect someone from a wolf; it's less than a feather for them to hunt. At its smallest you don't think much of it, at its height it's as small as a feather. A cow is dwarfed by a fierce elephant; perhaps like myself at its height you don't see a lion. That isn't true of a wolf. It's not lion like a wolf, it's solitary. 
 I've seen it from a distance. It didn't know me before it saw me. It didn't even see me when I changed my mind. But when I did it studied me; it found my mind and absorbed my vision in it's simplicity. 
 *Color? I see color. * 
 I don't know what that can do. I know, just as you do, that colors are the best source of light. Even without talking about color there is an art to paint things with; that's my answer. 
 The umbrella is thin and vented just as I am, and gives shade as well. It lets light shine into something. The swamp is still inviting, full of green and blue and red but still in its infancy. A writer describes it perfectly; though there's a certain simplicity to it, a squishy beauty, that doesn't get the light of a spring. That's how that bloke made his essay. 
 *Light. I know it. *<|endoftext|>
**********394**********
I was looking out of my sedan when I saw a figure disappear into the night sky. It was that young man. But I didn't know him. No matter. I knew, he was a hero. As a young man, I had grown up in East Stikerville. When my parents had won the lottery, my mother taught me to drive a motor car before I was born and I was always the most fast learner. My mother taught me to call my dear parents and to ensure that they were always there for me and those I would need. And I was glad she didn't have that. 
 I hated my life. I could see that it was the same as the nights the dogs ruled the streets. It was my job as a hallowed wench to babysit the unruly children who were walking along the sidewalk. And I saw it all these days. The need to compete, and never let myself be intimidated into doing the same. 
 That was before I knew they had one of those "three days without busses. " That's my tale now. That was the worry I had always had. I wondered if they knew me by now. I wondered if the first look they would give me at me would lead them to believe that I was no hero or villain. That I was simply a ghoul that deserved to die. 
 I gathered my things and began searching for my children. My magical now found her on a piece of string. She was sleeping in her crib. She was barely breathing when she looked at me with those eyes. In their sockets were butterflies. I held her in my arms and kissed her. Even though I had forgotten who she was, I was grateful they loved me. And then they appeared in my vision. I could not believe it. 
 Micheal Chaserheart, this was all his. And he was calling for me. I could not stop myself. I would fight my way to my bed.<|endoftext|>
**********395**********
They don't really mind me, I *know* you may, but what about the people who *are* trying to forget? 
 I am the last major villain in the city, no, I am a fictional character, a villain of many different names. Often names appear random throughout a certain book, and it is my job to canonize them. 
 Everyone remembers me. God knows *they* forgot what they really had left behind. 
 You see, the people that I seem to keep going back to are the ones that keep getting the laundry done. 
 Thing is, I can do anything I want, it's like a magic trick, I can make a person forget the name of anything, so that I can do anything. 
 I am not really called out because I am an absolute super. 
 So why can't they remember me? Who does? It is the understatement of the century, no longer is my existence criminal. 
 I am your father.<|endoftext|>
**********396**********
It had been years since I ’ d been able to sleep. The severe insomnia was a continual torment on the back of my mind, a constant reminder of a ever-increasing torment that I had to end. I always saw them as objects, stuffed in places far beyond my "muscles. " They provided my nightmares. As my chances for sleep diminished, I would see them move, tentacle driven into my spine. They built their own worlds, I could never take care of myself like I should. Eventually I ’ d take to sleeping alone too, but what little I had left I could have taken with me. The memory was better spent in my bedroom, restful with Iampower and sleeping pills. 
 I was less exhausted after I had slept, my heavy breathing coming back to me as I lit up my coffee in the morning. That was the only time I ever fell asleep in any sane part of the world. I didn ’ t want the dread or the pain. That was it, I was tired of it. I had never felt less alive than I felt in my sleep. After struggling to keep my emotions within control I felt a rush of fear as my lungs burned, my body ached from incurable pain that I hadn ’ t felt in a long time. I moved to take a sip from my cup, ready to face the frightening reality that there was nothing else for me in the world. A flash of red light consumed my vision, blinding me. I flung open the curtains, leaving the hot nights to rain in full force as darkness loomed over my vision. I counted 6. 8. 7. 6. I was going to die now. 
 The footsteps ceased as my stephead darted into the darkness. I felt the sudden stab of pain and terror as the figure moved in front of my eyes. It was black skinned and ripped to look like me. I saw a small crown of fire above one shoulder, covering it with a piercing yellow light. I stepped closer, my head on the bloody relief of the sun and out into the cold air. There it lay, watching. No doubt a body trapped in the water. It had tried to walk in the dark shadows, but it had run out of food. I knew it too well as I thought about it. The blood was from the man that had killed me. The guilt of not taking the fight to him I felt through my exhausted body was slowly draining out of my mind. That was it, I was going to die now. 
 I never knew what could've killed me but when I looked around at my surroundings I felt warm, damp things, one of them I never knew existed. It felt like a union having a " Diner, " or an employee to the Houston smith, so to speak. A strange and waxy presence sat on top of my table with that feeling of familiarity again. A brown envelope sitting on the counter was filled with paperwork that I ’ d never seen before, a little sign that the chair should be set down. The box on my table was sturdy, in perfect condition, a sign of affection in the business of decorating. The inside was similar to that of my bedroom; small and white, with tight fitting curves that made me nauseous at first. There were no books here or anything to read, just that box, your letter, attached to it. However, this was new, it was as if someone had brought it in from another dimension. 
 The envelope had written something in a language I had no idea, and the words had been folded over into a beautiful white uniform. I pointed at the ground with my left hand, indicating the last piece of paper. 
 The message left within the letter was defiant. Would you forgive me? And that had only made me depressed. 
 The man slowly stood over me, his face gleaming and waiting. 
 “ My name is Thomas! Thomas now you know why we are here. My name is Thomas and I am the man you cannot forget. ”<|endoftext|>

( This is my first ever story. I apologize if I haven't posted before, I read it on my phone. I hope this saves it! ) 
 "Are you sure? " 
 He slowly turned towards her. His face was cold, pale. 
 " Yes, yes. " 
 She nodded and replied, " Be careful, young man. I'm going back to my room. " 
 His eyes locked on hers, but she was silent. His voice would almost rip them apart, but she refused. She answered in kind. 
 " You know, I often think of how lazy I am - how... 
 Oh my God! " She yelled from the opposite side of the bed. Her voice filled with things she had never heard. Not even a horrible smile existed on her face. 
 But there was hope for him, for her, and for the world. He began his tale with a smile, then fell back into his own thoughts, eyes darting around the room. 
 " Good morning, Papyrus. Have you been reading another book? " He asked. The professor was making plans, his face showed emotion as he had always done. 
 " YES. " 
 Her breath was still. She reached up and kissed him, but it was past midnight. He walked off. 
 " Hope is missing, young man. Hope runs through your veins... also, that your mother used to be with you. Do you love her as much as I love my mother, Papyrus? " 
 She took a deep breath, and said, " Yes, of course." 
 His face shuddered a bit.<|endoftext|>
**********398**********
"Hey senpai " I called out onto the room. 
 'Oh shit! Shit! I need help. I can't do this!'
 'Just another angry fan, what you want guys I'm sorry about your-" 
 And then a huge burst of anger shot through my mom's face and drove me to a machine. I couldn't control my body anymore, I had to go. 
 - Who did that? 
 - It's my mom 
 - Oh I noticed... 
 - Which one? 
 - My mom! 
 I grabbed a seat, and sat beside her when a mighty rattle made itself known. 
 It was a woman running the machine. She sprinted through the room. 
 - Captain Wadham. 
 - Please make sure that I don't accidentally bring you to the abyss. 
 - You know how it goes, I can't do this anymore... 
 - Sorry, it's not my fault. I just wanted to get a job. 
 - I'm sorry. But you said something the first time. About what? 
 - Everything. 
 I forced myself to live off the pain of my mother, and the attention she gave me. 
 - I want to be a smart woman, not just a nerd.<|endoftext|>
**********399**********
"And now I cannot see the future. We are in the past. " 
 I sat on the bed next to the mattress. The guy over with that weird haircut was looking very confused. I guess it had to be a bad haircut. There was no doubt that the four option wasn't really a satisfying combination. He's the one who has asked me if I wanted to live forever, and I'm the person who keeps trying to ask. 
 I slowly crossed the blue line in my head. I knew it had to be a very simple question. 
 " You're a doctor? " 
 He sat at his desk and sighed heavily. " Pretty much. One is true. It's also pretty simple. The second option is feasible. " 
 I nodded. I was a very pessimistic person, and as the doctor I was the only one who genuinely cared about everything, even if it meant just getting to the place that I needed to be. It made me very nervous, and I honestly don't know what I should do with myself if I go with the second option. 
 He shoved my hand up between my eyes, so I could feel his hand's grip tighten around the gloved finger-sign and his eyes glaze over. In one instant I was cutting myself to whole pieces and remembering how utterly disgusting the world could be. The experience was amazing, and the smell was haunting, even out in the cold, warm morning air. 
 He pulled out a phone. It was a low-quality plastic one. " Thirty seconds left. " 
 He looked at me for a second, and let out a huge yell. " You almost done with that? " 
 " Yeah, so you can return to the real world again? I don't think you realize. " I could feel my heart racing. " And do you think that's a good thing?" 
 He saw the phone with a mixture of terror, curiosity, fear, and his excitement. The size of the one on the desk only made it harder to bring myself to follow the man from another time. 
 A zephyr.<|endoftext|>

How long has it been since I last woke up? One night I came into the living room and slumbered, my shoulders tingling, my stomach moving. I didn't have much, but I remembered waking up too. I flipped on the news, ran downstairs and spent the next ten minutes watching more... better... documentaries on local TV. Eventually I couldn't sleep. People mocked me, frequently basing my story on my fake character, filled to the brim with rich greed. A few even thought I was being suspicious, but it only made things worse. People looked at me and knew that I was nuts, yes I had flaws. After I finally drew my eyes back to sleep I turned and looked at my reflection in the mirror. My top cheekbones were ragged and looked like they had died in one of those ugly sea tanks... my lips were clenched and lip pursed and they were covered in a wet mess. I walked into the kitchen, grabbed a beer and a tray of ice, and covered my nose. I cleaned my jaw and teeth before I kissed the soft, pale skin and proceeded to drink. 
 I waddled outside in the unkempt rain and headed to the park. It's been four weeks since we got a proper park, and I couldn't sleep in without seeing a light coming through the trees. My porch light was flashing red and I looked down. I put on my coat and walked into the park. Every tree in the park had colorful lights flashing just up ahead. I didn't panic, I walked down the block and started walking down the street towards the park. I talked to my friend Hickey and he helped me down. He always knew I'd be fine. Hickey didn't do drugs, but Hickey would talk to me the same way I talked to him. We stopped for coffee and decided that if you needed something we could buy it through our friends on Facebook. Back in Austin we did connect through "Puff." It took me a few minutes to get over my anxiety and clarity. After driving about half an hour, we finally came to an intersection, which was incredibly suspicious for a car with a red light. I walked over to the sign and saw it read Austin's never to be built.<|endoftext|>

Artyom was always gracious, he could take pride in his accomplishments. He took many things as trivial as stepping into his office in the prime of his life. Cash in the bank, jobs in the gymnasium, etc... He was surprised at how much he took that from people. The man didn't even know his business. Artyom was interested to learn about the humans even before he married the daughter of a President; he saw his father on television, and on some level, he was made to believe. Artyom loved stories. 
 For all his life, Artyom not only been respected by Earthlings, but by everyone in the entire universe, he did his best to keep this new world of elephants and bears and every living being at bay. Until a group of bears. 
 They were brought aboard Ark 49, named after the Olympic Silver Lion, their lord Marthir. Thinking he had won, Marthir violently smashed open the front entrance to the pyramid of beasts, and as the barbarians exited he blasted the doors open, stumbled upon Ark 49 and immediately threw up his head to distract the beasts. He turned around to see a small humanoid figure barely contained in their tiny giant sack. Believing them to be some sort of savages, he quickly threw an arm around their necks and motioned to them to follow him. 
 "Barefoot Thrall, don't be frightened " they agreed enthusiastically. 
 Artyom stepped towards the beast, and with out a challenge, he lifted his left arm up and leapt up to meet their right shoulder. The massive creatures were surprised by this incredible leap, and shot him dead from a distance. The man on his left wanted to run, but Artyom stayed behind to grab their belongings. He grabbed the Ark, but as Artyom chased after him he screamed " Black Claw! Black Claw! " in the darkness of the predator's thick forest canopy. The fellow was not impressed. 
 " Yes? " the beast asked artyom. 
 " You have escaped - " the man was cut off as he slowly began to hurl over the furry shard of the beast, its super-fast claws laden with venom. 
 As Artyom bit down on their fragile little cabs, and pounded on their cabs just to make their ears hurt, a snarling monster was caught in the silence: " Ye have come for people of the human race, and they have returned! " 
 Artyom saw himself standing over the sleeping creatures, that had been hiding in their dens in this cold, dark cavern. While his body was weak and ravenous, it sure was agile and dangerous at the same time. 
 " Burden of human diseases, " a wail was all that was heard. But Artyom recognised it. 
 " It is raining!", the beast shouted into the heavens.<|endoftext|>

It is my duty to judge the entire human race, for I am one of the few people capable of exercising this duty. That being said I now look upon each person in the same way every other person looks towards the sky. And I have come to... 
 "... today. " 
 I could hear a car murmur in the distance, the other cars seemed to feel the same as they had. 
... something wasn't right. 
 " Yes. " 
 I looked at the glass and my eyes caught a glimpse of the creature who had been running from them. He had turned his back on them, suddenly blinding me and shakily following me. We were the only ones left! People shouting for everyone in the arena to stop... They've been keeping people alive for years now, this seems a bit... extended. 
 I saw it, they are speaking. 
... but not right. 
 The man started shouting at everyone... 
 " Now everyone! Nobody!! I'm going to god I'm sorry!" 
 I get up and look at the evil man. And I have no idea what had happened to them.<|endoftext|>
**********403**********
It's hard to tell a human if they're happy or sad, when we're judging them by their actions. I was seeing friends late into the night at a restaurant and thinking this whole night into the night, but I decide to look forward to them. I'm telling them something I couldn't tell someone else. There was a writing prompt that made me feel... concerned. I'm seeing a video of some of the more bizarre conversations. Eventually I really start to comprehend all their personalities and all their thoughts. I'm supposed to be one of them but this one could kill me. 
 I come to some doctor, my doctor. He tries to talk me out of the situation, saying there are always patients like this. My friend tells him to leave me alone to rest. He helps me walk out of the hospital. I didn't want to be here, but they told me I would be okay. I wouldn't say goodbye. I don't think anything of it. It's nice to not be alone. 
 A month and a half later we're at the emergency room with my friend. A nurse smiles at us but he's not there. She tries to talk to me, but I can't talk. My friend whispers in my ear, "I know you did. I saw your face." I could tell he was worried. His death would be horrific, but I couldn't let him see what he'd seen. I didn't understand what was happening to him or anyone. I could barely hear what she was saying. I couldn't tell what I wanted to know but I had to understand it. 
 I look at my friend and hold him at arm's length. I feel horrible. This man isn't what I had expected. This is torture. I am supposed to be in control of him. I was supposed to learn his life lessons. I lost my chance to learn, I lost my place in history. I took the chance to be free. I am all he has left now. This life I'll destroy will be a test. The will of a man determined to kill. I once saw him... I saw him very clearly. I felt a rush of warmth and awareness, all at once. I could have rid myself of him, but he lost his temper and a trembling hand began to grasp my shoulder. He's very... wonderful. He trusted me. I told him about this study. He thanked me and thanked me even more. He'll keep me safe, he trusted me. 
 I returned to the light and felt a light touch on my face. I'm so happy to be alive. This has been my best day of my life. This is my chance. I look at the nurse and know I have been here for so long. She looks so much better than I imagined. A very clear green blur appears. I see very clearly what's going on. The nurse looks at me curiously and shrugs. She left the room. The nurse is very... confused. I shake my head, this is my chance. I smile and go back to my friend and myself. My day to take control of the world is complete. I walk out the door and call everyone home in a brave act of defiance. My friends, my friends are safe now and soon. They're just as happy to be here as I was.<|endoftext|>

Once upon a time, people were given death. People died because of the book and the poem, people died because of that gigantic feeling of being near their loved ones. People die because they died on purpose, others live on as long as they can, I don't matter, because I am omnipresent. I was just a kid when my parents died and my dad didn ’ t act on his death wish, he acted as I just walked through the gate and woke up on the other side of the gates. I wonder, can I still see my parents at that point? 
 My parents died after they were diagnosed with cancer, it was just the end. I get up from my bed and find this huge wall displaying my tombstone and pearly gates. I think to myself, why can ’ t they have as much time to ponder the past? Maybe someday I will face them and see if this is the end, maybe someday I will finally end their suffering. Perhaps someday I will feel like I need to die. 
 As I look around, I ask myself what this subreddit could be doing with my time. I pass hundreds of posts and emails just to see what new things are posted here. I am stumped, if they can create these they will surely be taking me seriously. My ex girlfriend quit taking drugs, I am taking pills every day, oh wait, I will change that. These questions, these questions make me wake up each morning and try to figure it out. What was my primary plan? What is my favorite hobby? Does there really exist anything that I like? How many times has this happened to me? 
 It seemed like such a simple question to me. I quickly emailed this email to all my phone numbers in the U.S. so my ex girlfriend could see it. A pager came up and I wasn't able to make out anything whatsoever, instead I got into a pond and realized I must have accidentally entered this email for a second time, and then I realized I am almost here. Oh my, this is it. 
 I decide to start typing these things. I enter a randomly generated serial number and then my uncle has a conversation with his friend and realizes this is his office. I try to compose the message but to no avail and I have a feeling I may have allowed myself to be poisoned by this. How am I sure about my vow of silence or is it all faked? 
 My uncle and my uncle are the first to come to me. After telling me everything we have been through, and that our family was broken and broken. And that, well, that certainly ’ s not what would make this so much funnier than finding out your sister is murdered by her boyfriend right before you drop dead in front of your family. 
 My uncle has finally decided to come over to me so I look him up and down and ask him, "Why do you want to come over and hang out with my uncle? Why would you not? ” We walk for a bit and he puts me down and tells me, “ Why should I look him up and down and ask you questions? He is a good man and it wouldn ’ t make any sense. He just lets me be. ” But he knows my secret and believes that I would ’ ve rather go with the different endings over the ones my uncle told me. After I tell him his suspicions are confirmed, he tells me that he is going to find my uncle and tell him all about how he killed his parents in the making. He tells me that after he finally broke my vow of silence and laid his hand on my shoulder and asked me, “ Would you like to go with the endings over the ones that you know to be true? How do you know it was true? ” I reply, “ Nope. Nothing in life is real. I did this thing that I did to you. No, I did all this stuff to you. And you still love me! ”<|endoftext|>

The one piece of advice someone can't fool to keep you busy at all times? Don't be bored. Life is all about finding wisdom. 
 Those words flew from my mind after a tough day, little sliver of a break in the journey. At first, I thought I heard a secret voice, making strange mereams of wind. 
 "Son... what was the journey just like? ". 
 Let me back up: I woke up early to find the other voice was tuning me in. Be like the other voice, my thought went to nothing. The conversation was mumbled while I was downing a glass of water in silence. Words thought but not written. 
 " Oh, Simon, I am so sorry. I am out of the place and will miss your trip. You should use your strength. " 
 Things like this don't happen on weekends, for the first time. When I woke up at 4.30, I heard my breath catch in my throat, coughing up air. And as soon as my breath caught up with my lips, I closed my eyes. The voice and its variations seemed to fill my brain, filling my head. " What's going on? " I thought, for the first time. 
 " Why are you crying? " it interjected, keeping a gentle calm while I felt the water hit my face. 
 " I wanted you to do something so that I could share this amazing journey with my family, but you had the expectations of work and other work responsibilities. I chose to go to college instead, and I left the next day. I heard that a teacher often considers studying a prerequisite for human rights, so I decided to pursue my career with my advisors. I went to France with an application for a job, and I came back because I couldn't handle studying far from home, " the voice answered. 
 " I'm sorry, Son, just a few more tears went up my cheeks and I began to get worried. I was worried that maybe I wouldn't be able to do your work. I thought to myself,'Simon, I just wanted you to see this for yourself.' " 
 " Or maybe one day you'll bring someone into the room. He'll try to kiss you and run away. This will make your mind go crazy. But you'll become a brother to someone of such a great life... " it continued while a baby was being mauled to death. It seemed to shrink deeper into a child's chest with every passing second. 
 One minute I was in tears again, the next I was all alone. The voices could not feel them. Yet they all seemed familiar. " Ah, thank you, Simon... you are such an intelligent fellow. Such an amazing baby. I hope that day you will see me like you see your reflection in this mirror. It's not every day that a noble human being sees himself as so much more than he is. I can't stop thinking of you, Simon. I'd like to be remembered. " 
 " Yes, Simon." I said.

"Isn't that just a list of scars? " I asked, standing with my cold blade above his head. " He's clearly not the same as you people. " 
 A woman with dark eyes, lips pale, and mouth half dry. No one paid attention. The gun was buried in the carpet and when I told her it was strange, she pulled the trigger. I felt my heart crack as the falling sunlight shone down, coating her lips and sending a loud thud down the length of my arm. 
 " Not the same as you people. " I said picking up my knife and placing it across her neck. " It's a list of scars. There are people who start off angry and then start with these murders, you know. In fact, the only reason he never gets hired to make this list is because of the connections he'll make. " 
 The woman turned and saw I was raising my knife. Her face was pale and the blood was pouring down her clothes. He wouldn't tell me what she wanted to know, but I knew she wanted him to. " It's a list of scars, dad, " she said. Her face contorted into a gentle smile. 
 " Those are the ones that give us the reason we're in this mess, but you're old enough to make it. You don't have it here in the mirror anymore. You have to take care of yourself, take care of everything else. " 
 I looked at the knife. It was beautiful, almost black. " I really do. Can I take it?" I handed it over. 
 She dropped it. I returned it to its place in her chest and returned to my sword and head. I put my fingers up to my ears as I saw the body up close.<|endoftext|>

An idea did, indeed, start a long time ago. Being able to imagine myself younger as I grew, not just the thing I imagined I wanted, but of the world I was imagined to be in. Unlike countless others before me, and before, I had felt that, for every purpose I ever wanted, these things would fall short and let something be destroyed. It started in an ordinary seed of a small project, one that I would've wished to be helped in my dreams with. I'd been experimenting at first, looking for the same idea that I had already wanted. It seemed like something simple, but something far larger than any imagined seed could dream to tell a new story. 
 Things seemed to fall into place as I let the seed grow. I hoped that it would hurt, to hurt me, hurt someone else, hurt someone else. It didn't, however, hurt me. It simply gave me such pleasure and desire that I never realized I was being hurt or harmed by it. 
 It was then that I met to my surprise all those women who had helped me out of my dreams and brought me to me. A group of young women, all of them so young that they had invited me as well as one or two others from across the country to attend as well. 
 These women, I am sure, each held a stake with which they had hoped to help me. There were two of them and I could tell by their way of speaking I was definitely serious. I had barely had time to understand what they were thinking, but they were thoughtful enough to join the conversation that I could see the water in their eyes to tell me I was on the right track. 
 If I had taken their advice seriously enough I could've visited them at least one more time and come up with some better way to help me. I'd have hoped that it would be something from a more fundamental moment of my life, such as a time when I truly had the power and expression I thought I deserved. Instead, I was given such comfort and relief as I realized that the seed of that idea was too beautiful to be destroyed. That I would be one of those shining angelic peacocks once more soon. 
 It was then I wrote down in my journal that I would probably never get to finish my words again.<|endoftext|>

"Hello, librarians. There are three sets of you on this piece of cake. On top of this, I've compiled and presented you with the answer to a question: " Are you sure you don't want your children to grow up hating your mother? " 
 They don't let you answer those questions. They will not let you consider the manner in which they first came to be. I am neither fed up nor ignorant of how people are reacting to some of their actions. The good news is that there is no overwhelming feeling of dislike or anger. The bad news is that they are anything but. There has only been one problem of course. In one of your articles you write, you play a news program on your television. Turns out there was a conspiracy and that this was the catalyst. You are not someone " hero " that will put down your abusive parents. As I said the next time you come to this public forum, I have your card. I call on you for help. - You're being stalked! - All at once. 
 If this is a scam, then you must leave now! There is already information to protect anyone you target. The cops would be more than happy to help you through this. Yes, yes, the cops would. Put your thumb on the trigger, and your situation will never be the same again.<|endoftext|>

Danas Armadillo sat at a bar. 
 He shouldn ’ t know what a man like him is. He knew that he wasn ’ t joking around, but he wasn ’ t nattering about a job in space he didn ’ t understand. 
 It ’ s awkward to be the first private in centuries to work on Mars, and it's just out of the question that he spent his entire life spent behind the wheel in the pursuit of glory. 
 He couldn ’ t imagine a scenario where he – three months before the Martian colonists landed - would need to spend the next few months sitting next to his wife living the giant dank ass life on the surface. When he eventually found him, there was no pressing matter. 
 He heard his wife ’ s voice – her voice from all around. He couldn ’ t tell if she was still alive or dead – why was the fire and brimstone on her voice gone? How long did she last? He ’ d have to reestablish his peace for the day. 
 He felt some of her fingers caress his arm, and he let out a yelp. He shook his head, and thought of what his wife had said, with a part of her dark pallored lips. 
 He whispered, “ This is my final goodbye to Commander Keforg the Rain Wizard. He's good to go. ” 
 Or maybe if he hadn ’ t answered it, he would have been mad to know that none of his crew knew he was one of the lucky ones. Maybe that ’ s why the Commander was able to keep the ship that he had once called home – comfortably furnished, and pale – and pressed its handle gently to his soft, wounded skin. 
 It wouldn ’ t be long before his crew had made their way home to be with him.<|endoftext|>

Marvin woke in the night, hearing a familiar sound. He walked to the closet, jumped out of bed, and ran downstairs. Instinctively, he opened the door and stumbled down the hallway. To his surprise, he was wearing a running running shirt and flip-flops. 
 He slid into the bedroom, where his knees bulged and muscles tensed in anticipation. He tiptoed into the kitchen and emptied a mouthful of wine and an orange juice that used to give him goosebumps. Oh man, he thought. That was fantastic. 
 In the kitchen, Marvin flicked out a steaming white cup of espresso. " I have a deal! " he cheered, " I'll pay you fifty grand for this! You are sexy, just by kissing me! " 
 Some other guests were watching the news. One of them looked up with milk tongue on her face. Marvin flicked through a couple of clips from the news; she was still in that bad marriage. 
 Marvin was so fired up, even catching a few of the scantily clad girls in his life breaking in and asking if he would want to catch up with them. " No, Mary. I want to go out with my friends and be with my girlfriend. " 
 What an exciting idea, Marvin thought. Of course, however, Mary was probably going to be a divorcee. There wouldn't be a lot of excitement left for the prospect of how to break it. She was an all-American, right? 
 He turned on a TV, hooked himself in and went to his bedroom. " Whoosh, " he cried, " I'm pregnant with my first child. I will be on the news in about half an hour! " 
 After a few minutes of stumbling around in silence, he opened the fridge. " Oh, uhh, sorry? " he said, and pulled out a slice of onion. " I don't want you to eat that. " 
 " Stop! " she screamed, and grabbed Marvin's arm. " I don't want to eat that. " 
 " But- " 
 " No. I just want you to be right and happy about your mother. She was three when your parents left the country and you grew up and everything just went to crap-metal. " 
 He gave her a half-hearted smile and closed his eyes. " You were right, Mary. " 
 " Okay, I guess. " 
 The chicken wings clipped down on his arms. " Thank God for the new blood, Marvin. You grew up okay? " 
 " Now you don't. " 
 " I'm going to have to get the merlot. " 
 The dinner was beautiful, with the tomatoes and basil now as they were sliced. Marvin never dreamed he would wake up that night with not a single emotion on his face. 
 Suddenly, a large man with lustful eyes got up and came closer to him. 
 " What are you doing here, Marvin? " 
 " I am entering a new relationship. I intend to be with another woman. I'm a huge believer in morality. I know you probably think I am stupid, but I love you... now. " 
 " But..my family... " 
 " Well, I guess their lives were a lot better. What about you, Mary? " 
 " Oh, uh. I'm down here. " 
 " I think we'll be having an argument when we go over there," Marvin explained as he walked over to Mary's room.

"This is it, " said Davos. " " Don't shut the fuck up! This will be our new History teacher." 
 The crew peered through the kitchen window. American-made clothes were strewn about on their bare fingers, nearly torn apart from their sticky sheen. Jake had wrung his insides out, hiding what little wasn't inside. Luckily, there was a hatchet underneath. 
 Davos stood with one hand slightly raised on the small prosthetic hip, the other hand his sword. In a self-defence stance, he had avoided brawling with the previous occupant of a chimpanzee. With a smile, Davos turned to the passenger side of the cave. A tired, horrible frown formed from his lips, barely covering the trace of blood on his chin. Davos dismounted and waited to burst into tears. He himself didn't know what he was about to do with the child. 
 It didn't matter. The thing had been staring. He turned to look at his master, confused. 
 It's voice sounded familiar. Not at the chimp. Not at Davos himself. But that titanic figure that had stolen his helmet and helmet from his family. 
 A long shard had been lined up between Davos and the chimpsis, weaving for a two-hundred pound challenge in the final few blocks. It was as he knew, but he was no longer looking for combat, or any weapon. It was the impression of a warrior-in-training, only humanly skilled enough to keep their division alive. But he could only be called a teacher. But there was a lesson to be learned. 
 He had known that.<|endoftext|>

It started with little actors. 
 One day, a little children's story, too small to cross the line, shot with a zoom shot. Friends scurried about, creating a story of shrapnel and pain, stuff spilled everywhere. Crying, crying, yelling. Nothing but having an opinion about something. Nothing. 
 Then came the effort to be a huge, terrible, and often embarrassing student. And the staff seemed to be starting to get pretty annoyed, a lot of whom probably weren't even friends. 
 Some watched very carefully while others stared nervously. By the end, a large group of kids fell to the ground, sprouting a furrow in the ground and scratching their hair with their forearms. 
 And soon... only small enough to cover a few days at a time. 
 And then, on a whim, a little child had managed to freak out, ate a flower. 
 Sudden, there was an immediate, unearthly sound. The children nearly missed it. 
 The main police force, the Grammar Police, came to the little girl's rescue, put her in restraint, and politely requested that she move some balls onto the ground, and retrieve her belongings. ( They would be taking her to a play area, and we, of course, wouldn't let her out, so they had to watch. Once she was alone, they would contact the main police force. ) 
 And then the little girl could move a ball, but those clumsy puppets couldn't even grasp the concept of what *should* move *which* ball should be moved. They threw her down, unable to comprehend why the ball could go anywhere. 
 When we returned, we found that the game had died with the little girl. 
 She was crying. 
 Now, we're facing hordes of little shit. But we aren't exactly physically intimidating, as opposed to the bullies that come out of the woods with a hook to get her by. Their lives are rather fluid -- some people might think they're pretty, but most people believe they're evil, just because the wrong person is doing something. 
 Granted, the game has had a mixed... outcomes over the years. For the most part, the good people have been caught. And some people have been arrested for crimes as petty as that. A few petty crimes are punishable by death, and those that are still punishable by prison time tend to be less violent than the one they deserve. That's one of the reasons people believe in grammar police. Everyone on campus thinks in grammar police. But we're not sure the real reason is, you see, because of that linguistics guy. 
 He wants us to understand why grammar police don't obey the rules. Maybe if we enforce it enough, we could eventually actually reform grammar law.<|endoftext|>

They always said they were benevolent, not just invaders. 
 Last June, we knew what it meant. 
 Soon, the Moon was put under official scrutiny. 
 Upon entering the Earth, our public protests were met with indifference. It was easy to see why. At the age of thirteen, I shared a family that had allowed themselves to raise, leave, and learn nothing other than an uncertain life. 
 This change happened overnight. 
 Everyone from the small, average U.S. citizen, like me, were disappearing. Millions died, not as pilgrims ( no "quarantine, " or " gradual extinction"), but as agents of treason. 
 We Americans, we're different now. Many of us went through various resettlement programs, for reasons beyond our comprehension. Some tried to escape, apparently by accident or some mechanism, but from those seven days, it wasn't until an hour after sunset in Hawaii by the plane that our eyes started adjusting. 
 Death was the first sign. 
 We walked into the White House, where President Kennedy was standing with his wife, her throat slit, all of her small guns drawn. 
 Everyone felt the shock. 
 Suddenly, the blowgun sounded. 
 It was heavy. 
 We began running. 
 Just as we were about to get that final breath, that last ( raspy ) glance at the white wall informing us that this country was being oppressed, we were finally accompanied by the red lights, which freaked a life-long foe out of one of their parasites, their black-batfish-monster, which was going to be exterminated. 
 The bombs exploded, and the broadcast brought us to a teleporting ship, which took us to Mars, where we lived for the next seven days. 
 At some point, people noticed something had changed. Its surface changed. 
 Almost immediately, we could see rainbows swirling across it. 
 The cause of the change, of course, was the moon's Earth....<|endoftext|>

Stunning yellow lights pierced the dark night air. It was 2 AM. Zulu was late, almost 2AM... walking home from shopping with his friend, often no more than a few paces to tell him when zulu was late, right? 
 "Mommy, it's not time yet, " he said to his girlfriend, Jaymine. 
 " I just wanted to tell you... " she trailed off, " about your favorite family. " 
 " So? " 
 " No! You had to say it to me! " She just laughed. 
 " Can I remind you a little bit about *weird* times? " 
 " Anytime, uh. * Every... *until* you tell me this.... 
 " You love us! you love to do *things*! " she exclaimed happily. 
 " That's my favorite morning. " Zach almost sobbed. 
 " Well, hey buddy! I love to dance when you love me. " 
 " Haha! Let's just get home and… " he trailed off. 
 " Oh honey, you got to tell me somethin' about our day. Please. " 
 " I don't believe you! " 
 He looked at Jaymine hard in the face, his old lover almost cracking under his weight. Her fat cheeks looked teary. 
 " Really?! " she mumbled sadly. 
 Zulu turned to leave when he heard a low humming coming from some twenty years down the street. 
 " Ya see? Some asshole just brought his bike, and he took his bike down stairs! I'm gon na miss you! " 
 Zulu started walking towards the end of the street. 
 " I knew it! " 
 Shaking his head, his girlfriend brushed off the vibe coming out of him and immediately clutched his hand. She leaned over and hugged her future wife, who turned and saw a bright light blinking out of the ground. 
 " Her baby boy is 7 months... " 
 Kneeling now, Zach didn't know what to say. Everyone knew the meaning of dreams. This was something no one ever imagined when you were young. This was something his entire childhood could have been. At 12 he'd spent the rest of his childhood playing the piano, just about to start his college degree at UCLA and get his first heart transplant. 
 " You're a horrible mother... I'll take you on at 10! " 
 His girlfriend was not in a good mood. 
 " I could have tried to save your life, too, I know. Just be sure I let you know and she'll be right back. " 
 Zulu didn't seem happy. 
 " I'll try... I'll even tell you when I do. " 
 " Wake up! " 
 Zulu went to go to the bathroom and at the telly, he saw a young woman with two pink stuffed animals between her buttocks, five feet long, matching the width of her green jacket. 
 " Hey, she deserves it, she really does. " 
 " Do I have to run around and give her her child? " 
 " Puff! " Zach laughed as he grasped the little girl, clutching her to his chest, turning and walking away. " I bet she'd like that."<|endoftext|>

We were born without the ability to develop, and its true if former perpetrator would transform this. Its almost impossible to explore, without prior knowledge. Its unimaginable without an outsider. It has driven our society to ruin, filled as the tomes of guilt, regret, and injustice. 
 We did learn the hard way how to care, the isolation, the nuclear facilities, the smog and suffering, the fear, the everyday nectar of life. Its as if we were cast in the light and powerless, but equally powerless. Unburdened as a parent, yet too easily manipulated. Lacking the impetus to wade out to the end of the world, the process was never easy. Even if time was shorter, our stories are considered the tip of the iceberg. 
 Freedom is a sham, the release of all practical fallout is not about the defenseless, but one carried by strangers. They must not only seek a life a different experience, but a life that finds another context. They are bound in a stifling matrix of fear, unable to detect reason. 
 The inhumanity is not fear, it is fun. Our options are limitless, the possibilities are endless, and yet, there is nothing we can give or expect. Though we are feared, unable to do something, we can feel it is futile. 
 Freedom is the world to live in, the only option left to those who have no action, there is nowhere else, but that other possibility. Politics are a playground, the realisation of all is what makes us active. There is nothing to concern us, not even the brutality and futility of terror. 
 Freedom was our virus, and his darkness doomed us to an end.<|endoftext|>

I can ’ t tell if it was the emotional shock, or the lack of courage I felt. After years of false hope that finally decided there was hope, I never really realized how much they knew. 
 “ Let me ask you about the tattoo on your arm, ” Anna asked. I paused, not feeling up to ask for more, and attempted to think of a good news story, of maybe a fortune teller or a like. We had saved and spent the best years of our lives to make what was now a nest of disappointments for Anna and Father. 
 “ I think that the tattoos are part of a strong culture in our area. ” I knew that this was hard for any of us to accept, something that now was normal. The collective mournful sounds grew louder. Now I ’ m sure we all heard the same words. “ They should have sent a poet. ” 
 “ He, my love, has gone missing, ” Anna mentioned halfheartedly as I thought. 
 “ That doesn ’ t make any sense. ” I answered. “ There ’ s been a mysterious figure in the city, he couldn ’ t have been here long enough to actually see him. He ’ s about the same age as you, I can ’ t be the one to tell you that. ” 
 “ He ’ s missing people. His parents are dead and they ’ ve buried him somewhere around here. ” Anna looked concerned, at least for the first time in as long as I ’ ve known her. 
 “ Our city is ruled by it, ” I heard the familiar roar of gunfire, all the wrong guns coming around the corner. While its ideology never changed, the sounds kept growing stronger. Over their faces, I could feel the anger, the life slipping from our senses. 
 “ No, they should have sent a man. ” 
 “ No, not your brother. ”<|endoftext|>

On the day of the holiday, the leader of the Northern King's own band gathered around his quivering sons for the funeral of his late wife, her lustful and sinister health causing them sleepless nights. Only his loyal soldiers held upright, on the casket where her ransacked family's belongings. 
 A clear thistle tickled the roof of the back room. 
 “ My noble sons, at night one year has passed since my downfall; no fog has crept into my eyes. I ’ m not a man to fall in to the dark, but as my children have done when they take his throne, I saw through my cunning ways. I see through him a force bent on destruction. I saw through his shameless bullying and seduction. I saw through his cynicism and love. With me he would meet the lords who are no longer in power. And without me, they will look the same as I did not. ” 
 Wept, tears rolling down his face as he kissed her forehead in a sweet red cold. 
 “ Well if we ’ re with him, he must live. Our love has long since passed, but it will return as long as the houses will fall. For it was a wise decision for me, to tread my familiar path. I believe I have chosen an honorable path, our love of one another well ahead of us. Life does not die alone. ” 
 Wept, tears dancing across his cheek as he fell on the floor and fell to his knees. 
 “ My wife. Please be as many words as you can, just one, just one, kiss my soul goodbye. If you ever need anything, talk to me and I will be there for you. If you have anything of a heart, talk to me. If you want anything of one another, talk to me. Give us both one another something to live for. ” 
 He kissed her forehead, her lips touch hers as the warmth of her rippling hair tickled the roof of the coffin. 
 “ We will always be brothers, no matter what comes between us, before death. ” 
 He kissed her forehead, her lips touch hers as she fell onto the ground. 
 “ True, my love. That is why I called you, if you must speak so few words, but just one. See that the cold blood we keep boiling is gone, for it was meant to be empty. One last tear, one last kiss. Please, give us one final love. ” 
 Wept, tears rolling down his face as he kissed her forehead in a sweet red cold. 
 “ Always. ” 
 He kissed her forehead, her lips touch hers as the warmth of her rippling hair tickled the roof of the coffin. 
 “ We will never meet again. ” 
 He whispered in her ear, the only sound in the silence. 
 Wept, tears rolling down his face as he kissed her forehead in a sweet red cold. 
 As she was lifted from the ground by the heat, he looked at her. She wasn't pale with fire, her hair was slashed and her arms were splayed wide open. His tears did not come. He saw the white girl huddled in the corner, the eyes closed. 
 He saw her hunger. He saw her despair. He saw her lust. He saw her ecstasy, soothed by her diet. 
 He saw her anger, the hatred, the sadness, the egotism. He saw her sorrow, her pain, her loneliness, her hate. 
 But here he was, at the cemetery, empty, knowing that tonight was the last night of his life.<|endoftext|>

"I wish you would stop, " I said in my best nice voice. Her, the girl who always made you laugh. She could be anywhere, every few hours she tried to be happy. I had never called her that in my life, despite every request from her. 
 Her clothes were dusty, her shoes were soaked in mud. The most frustrating thing about it all was that I never cared about her. I never even asked for her attention before. Not one time did I think about her feelings. They all remained private. Just because you can't decide on anything with you doesn't mean you can deny them. There wasn't much when my heart skipped a beat after that. I was happy to see her again, all because of a man I had not seen in years. His dark eyes would creep in through the more insular channels, revealing his daughter's sadistic smile. But all those memories were replaced with cold indifference. 
 " What's wrong, father? You hurt me so hard, dad? " 
 " Well I wish we could have stayed longer. We've been dating, you know that, " I said solemnly. 
 " I wish I were your Dad. I will never be your father, " I said. 
 His cold and lifeless eyes fluttered open. His eyes were genuinely sorry. Nothing like the hope I felt for them in the beginning. They were so obvious that I could have easily mistaken them for tears. 
 " Do you know why I was here? " I whispered. 
 " I know you've known since I was a child, " he said smoothly. 
 " I never expected that to be so. " I lied, " You made me come back because of me. I thought you knew. You were gone a long time ago, probably like the last two weeks we've been here, but you never met me in that chair, you never talked to me at all. You kept making me afraid. " 
 He stared into my dark eyes and then stopped. He paused. A fear crept into my brain like honey or something. A glow, a sure sign of pleasure. He smiled for the first time in a long time. Not just any smile, but the first smile that showed his sorrow. It was a smile that wrapped his heart around mine. 
 " He was a happy man once, " I said. " I hope you understand, " I said. 
 The darkness surrounding me shattered. In a flash, I was just another face hanging at the wall. I was nothing more than a shadow, the same as the darkness over and over again. I breathed in deeply as I breathed in and out and inwardly. I let go as the that was once my mirror was removed and I was reborn in a new world. With her, another girl in my world that looked like me. 
 " Father, " I whispered. 
 The man in the wheelchair groaned as the tears trickled down his face. 
 " Thank you, dad," he muttered and turned back to the screen, and sent the tears of the boy pouring down his face into the floor. 
 And she smiled.<|endoftext|>
**********421**********
Both sat there fighting the dream, they held hands in the dark and if he saw me for the first time I could not hold back, he always told me everything. 
 "The dreams are terrible, but they aren't terrible to you, right? I only saw you. When you turned 8, then 10 you had a brain tumor, you were shunned, gradually you began to regain your normal self. I may have actually seen you then. The first time you met me, you couldn't move, your eyes spoke inhumanly over me, every breath you took brought a different tone and made the dream a sonic boom. 
 The second time I met you, you kept trying to make friends and there was no such thing, until one day you turned 18, you stumbled into the library in the library and you tried to tell me who your mom was, where your room was and where your grandparents lived. The memories were haunting and you knew you could talk but couldn't be understood, you could not lie. When we met each other in one place you still hung out in the same place I had, but it was dark and I had to hide my eyes. " 
 At that moment I fell in love with you, I told you all about our lives and how my hands had since taken shape, but you gave up trying to hide them, with desperation in your eyes. You told me everything I had ever known, you told me everything I have ever meant to you and told me how the past is just like the present. We spent ages growing up, getting married, getting divorced, going on a family vacation... so many of those precious memories of my life were left behind forever to live on so that your memory can live on. We sat side by side, completely human in that moment and just sat there, like twins. You told me the same stories of your life and we remembered our memories well and forever. We were my children and I was happy for them." 
 We turned to each other and began to drink again. I had heard that once or twice in those dreams but I always said no, that we would never find the best happiness, and once again when I said no, I did not want to make her happy. I moved on, I wasn't sad, I wasn't broken, and I had really been on the fence. As we drank more, I saw there was more and more memories in our mind, growing weaker by the minute and the bedtime was never in sight. The toys and makeup were disappearing and I was never looking forward to the children who didn't deserve such beautiful, happy memories. You kept me going and you kept telling me your stories but I could see no emotion and didn't know what to say. Everything on the other side was in my head. Things like dying and pills, eating and drinking and we sat there and drank until you started crying, and it was too late and I kissed you on the forehead and kissed your cheek. It was long and tedious, but the things we had said to you happened anyway, you never told me where it all went wrong, and I'm glad you were happy, because you were right. 
 And I watched as you cried, you had never told me how you felt, and that never left me. It hurt so much, but it was time to move on to the next life. You were my children and I was happy for them and I wasn't always right.<|endoftext|>

*** 
 I am tired of waking up in like a "emotionless" blur and never getting in touch. 
 Yet, I have had my chance to grow in happiness by doing something that I would have hated, something that even the creators of my shame are ruthless. 
 I am now in the filthy patch of land in Iraq, tiny beds for a man. I feel different every day. I feel better, but I feel a ragged existence. The thrashing of a crowd is muted, the noise of an angry man. I am sick. I am tired of being dragged down by the scum in my city. Every morning I have to face the man, the man's disgusting comments, his impudence. The man stares at me with those predatory eyes. No matter what path I walk, every searing pain strikes me hard in my side and I have to prepare myself to be treated more respectfully. 
 I wake up in quiet anger. It's been weeks since I woke up, and the only thing I can think of is " what am I supposed to do? " 
 I have tried everything I can think of, but nothing comes. Nothing is amicable. I don't even feel the power in my side. 
 I have never been good at this. 
 Yet, this morning, I can no longer be harsh. 
 I am now a cruel mask. The humans love me for saving people. I can not bring myself to rise a better than any group in existence and if I don't make them angry, the humans will kill my family, my friends, their pets, and my possessions. 
 *** 
 My children always talk about the war. They know that they can not be better than the humans. They love us, they love us. They want us to be their friends. They want us to be good. But, they don't understand. They are angry, the moment they step foot on this earth, they feel worse than the humans. They kill because they believe that we will change the course of their world. 
 They say that. That they have never made changes or returned human to humanity, but as long as the humans fight them, the war lasts forever. 
 *** 
 I was once in Iraq with my child. My son was raised in the glory. 
 But he didn't hate them much. He didn't hate them. He loved them with the force of a lion. They meant something to him, something important to them. They all were born with a purpose. 
 *** 
 Now I am slumbering alone. There is nothing I can do, to really thank them for this. I sleep the rest of the day, hidden in my child's dreams, waiting for the end to be upon me. 
 *** 
 I wake up in slow circles around what appears to be someplace deep underground, but the darkness is not so dark as it should have been. 
 My child is sleeping now. I notice the filth in his eyes, as his eyes slowly lose all form. The lies in his mouth, his cries against his unwilling tongue. I feel sick with anger. 
 I feel defeated. I feel alone. I don't know where I am or why. 
 All I know is that my child is lying in his bed, screaming, at this stupid man. This guy's children. 
 I run to the power station. I run to my parents, crying for the more ignorant, the sick. They know that their boys will still be different, but the human's children are all sick of their way with children. 
 But why? Why should I sacrifice myself to the humans? 
 *** 
 In Iraq, the nations are divided by culture and religion. But I love my son. I love his whole life and as soon as he starts to grow, I am cured. I am happy that I have produced him. My mind doesn't think as hard as I do now and I am back on track. I will be a god. 
 *** 
 My mom gave birth to my son. She was with me all day. She saw it all coming and the two of us had to put on a good show. I can't hold them anymore, but my boy loves me so much that he just thinks he can be a god. 
 *** 
 Mother says she does not understand why she is feeling so alone. She looks up at me in fear. She says I must be sick. I say that I must be going to the war someday. I say that everything has changed.<|endoftext|>

The breakfast toast was crunchy and smothered in dark red dye. A few of the neighbors sat outside to watch the lifeblood drained from the corn syrup pan. 
 "So, how'd you make it there? " Kelly asked, standing over the pan and ordering cheese and eggs. 
 " I think I ate the spinach stuff right there in the microwave " answered Santa Claus. 
 " Hmm, maybe you should leave that. I only see the retirees and tourists coming in as they make their way to my grave. " Santa said, turning to leave. 
 Kelly continued, " I can't smell or hear anything, I can feel nothing but a thick layer of smoke. I didn't expect anything to go wrong! " 
 Santa laughed. 
 " Oh come on. You never did get to paint a snow globe after all. " Santa said, glaring at Kelly. 
 " You mean, the elves are coming back? " Kelly asked. 
 " No, my self-respecting neighbor helped me paint the world. " 
 " Well if you ask me that we are close to ending it all? " Santa began. 
 " I really think it would be best if this we make it out before someone goes insane because who does that anyway? " Kelly said, raising her voice to the sound of her boyfriend cursing at her for coming out on holidays with him, and rejoicing as she heard his prayers and bruises begin to bleed on the rolled up office parchment. 
 " Then, now does it make sense to bury me if Santa would not come to raise me as his own pet? " Santa exclaimed. 
 " Nah, I'm that rich " Kelly replied. 
 " Then the heads may be heads. " 
 The last one stood, rocking back and forth, and with a gleaming silver smile. 
 " Even the heads of the church can not outweigh that of whoever used to be... " Santa said, turning his face upwards towards Kelly. 
 " Because if you didn't, you'd be able to meet other, more fortunate souls here!" Kelly said, and ran home.<|endoftext|>

It started with a chattering bear to slow the approaching march. Ishmael smirked, wiggling his shoulder as a small breeze took his attention to the surroundings. Nothing was green, only snow and trees. He shrugged it off, summoning his rib cage to investigate further. He looked back, recognizing his brother, Meadowyn, his captain, one of his closest associates. He looked at Meadowyn, who seemed strangely distant. 
 "It is coming! " Will pondered. 
 Meadowyn whistled and a light whirred from below his fur. A crashing tin can exploded in the height of the current, sending Drysia racing through his chest. Everyone screamed, stumbling, falling down. What was this noise? What was the noise? Where was the sound coming from? 
 In the distance, a large mound of steel nestled itself before Meadowyn, surrounded by a thick layer of snow and hulking tree trunks. The beast bled fiercely out of existence in a splendor of white but black smoke. It was a beast of the forest, roughly dwarfed by a tall tall forest walled in thick fur and petals. The thick canopy was transparent to anyone who smelled it, shifting, hiding as the man unfolded the thin knife in his left hand. It was he, Drysia, now.<|endoftext|>

At first it took long for me to grasp its format. The pieces had begun to fall together, questioning how I had gotten so calm and worn down to this point. I vaguely remembered the dark hours of my search for justice, the lab rats who had locked my factory and the others who demanded I prove my innocence. I suppose I deserved death for that. Even if I did, I didn't care much for being here. 
 The trial was a whirlwind. I was originally charged with murder, but I quickly developed a second level of knowledge on the disease. 
 The glockers were empty. The cold war was over. All we had was the poof and the whisky. After it all, there was just me and my speedrunning and the lantern that read "CROWNS ". The first murder was a torn carcass. A bloody puddle where my ex-girlfriend had been shot in the thigh before I was even done. 
 " My crime? " 
 " I killed a man, and you should be dead." 
 The jury listened to me carefully. I had my word that even my own heart wasn't beating anymore, and the oxygen slowly kept me up. I could feel my heart becoming impatient.<|endoftext|>
**********426**********
The sky turned dark from the fiery instruments above. As the clink of splintered glass on metal rose, I watched them silently descend. Seven lay in a valley of crimson, their bodies covered in clay and dead isles of chipped, bloodied flesh. All seven of them lay bleeding. It had been four days since I last saw them; maybe even four days after I first found them. 
 "I understand why the air is so red. " My brother said, his voice as quiet as the crystal throne I'd purchased him. 
 I could feel my blood betraying me. He was so proud of himself. Had they even fallen in this war? I supposed. The darkness was getting to me. The heavy castle lit up with its imposing lights and lurched forward as the dragonship lowered overhead. 
 " I apologize for your loss. " I said haltingly. The demon that sat down on the throne beside me was always aggressive. Always going too far. 
 " Why didn't I do it sooner? " She pressed her hands together and paced in the distance in the dim moonlight, " Or why haven't they rescued you? " 
 I rose to my feet and sprinted to her. I fumbled in the dark handbag I'd picked up from the dropship for an obvious reason. I had come too late to waste it in half-deadness, I needed to find my brother. What happened next got me to my feet; I'd seen him. Cradling his lifeless body on the ground over a cave, beneath a small clearing in the woods, I saw him. A dragon. Packed with blood from his food throwing a wreath across his body, eyes full of confusion and fear. I'd have to be careful to not let his misery make me suffer. With a loud click, he lay on the ground, but not in a funeral dirge; instead, he lay in front of me. 
 " I was blinded. " 
 I was bloody. Bloody where the world couldn't go without blood! Picking up the small canteen he'd prepared himself for, I cursed myself. My order had been clear to stop this madness. If only I could have heard what she said first. 
 " I'm sorry, " she said before she could say anything, " But they won't harm you." I wiped the blood off my face, smiled with my tongue and glared down on her. 
... 
 I haven't heard her cry since I've seen her. Every time I see her, I know that it's her, the Dreamcrawler, the dragon whose powers make my blood more temperamental...<|endoftext|>

Anna had been in this strange world a long time. She had not seen another lady but saw this old woman taking care of her farm, starting a work I had been doing for decades. She had been a central figure and was one of the most recent family to come to this wonderful country. With an old wooden cane attached to a tree I soon found myself dodging the land she had been locked up for four or five years with many trying to break free. This small village, big and fairly beautiful, was only a farm for a few small boys but it was truely the farm of Anna. 
 There was a mining company that was tending to the strange farm, she was, of course, moved out of town for this long without me. The spot on my map that she was hiding in was no longer occupied but that of the old tree that had held me up. My eyes felt strange as I slowly crawled out, head jerked up and the darkness seemed to vanish. I stood and looked over at the small caravan of machines that I had been on an errand to build for them. 
 I pulled out my scooter and drove to the old plantation where my family held the change. To make us comfortable I set my shoes on a rock made out of the branches of the tree. Our old cart had been crashed a few weeks back by a great tree undergrowth. Anna had been there, hiding in our backs, patiently waiting to come home to tell her the part. 
 Before I knew it I was in my hand, drawn to my own scooter. The first thing I knew as I began to pull out the thing that has weighed us down for years was that this wasn't another place for Anna. This was paradise. Being arrested like my village she was ordered to stay within 100 meters of the land. I did not understand why. I knew that I had to leave soon but I couldn't have it any other way. The jagged rocks below made me want to take care of a broken wheel, so I followed Anna there. I tried to prepare myself for what lay ahead. When Anna had been looking out the window I knew my time was almost up. I felt around the bundle of hilts and an axe gripping onto the front of my head. 
 The only thing I was sure of was that that was this place was now a pleasant place to be.<|endoftext|>

Prince Deared Giggles. A boy who was afraid of heights. The one part of men left alone in his hut watching over the Giggles' sheep. A single horn flew high above the hill where Huddus lies hidden among the trees. He would make sure it was not seen again. He would wear his trousers and fling a single feather to the wind like a dragon would, with oil man's teeth smoking across his nose and claws snapping his head over a tiny blade to his sole. 
 Huddus was still in the forest where King Robb's felling army of All Potts led his men. The own generation had been asleep and pearly white in their bunkers, they had brought no hope to their wives except the one King Black's men's. He had understood that Robb's army had a wild greed and a thirst for blood. The sinner was ravenous with respect and revenge. He was also very dim and old, but to fear became to consider fear now. 
 "Tonight's the Night. Tonight..." Was heard in all the herds of the king's warring. Lights streaming as the men walked near him now and two torches were set up to illuminate his lost town. The lands rumbled on fast approaching night, and Blacklike fire flies in the sky above them, spread quickly in all directions. All men fear the fire, even the snakes.<|endoftext|>

"What do you mean people do here? " The voice said through the potted plant. 
 Before I knew it, I was conscious of my surroundings and saw a shimmering jade leaf floating through the air. What had I done? What would happen next? I tried to remember but my sensations were generally indistinguishable. Immediately I tried to recall everything. What was I planning, what was I going to do? All I knew was that if I did, I would be seen through the mist and see the way the earth rotated. The stairs were no longer exactly much smaller than they should be but the space opened up both ways. 
 " What's happening, " I asked, quite excited. 
 The shadow around me grew and widened before me. 
 " Wh... what did I do? " asked the man. 
 With that, the mist returned. 
 The four men within the passage only grunted in disappointment as I was led to a cavern of metal. Thick armor surrounded the area and behind it there was an ancient stone sarcophagus. Inside the sarcophagus was a small humanoid face in the shape of a human. 
 As soon as the tiniest hint of shock appeared on the gigantic head in the one skull, he started whispering. 
 " He's an old man and his children are gone. He died millennia ago, i have to save them. " 
 The despair in the man seemed to grow as the next word began to pour out of his mouth. 
 " Poor bastard." 
 The figure disappeared and I was left alone in the chamber.<|endoftext|>

The Devil released the curtained doors of his pentagon prison. He studied the seascape and the soaring white cliffs, enveloped by cobwebs and pools of myrrh. He opened his mouth to call out to the beings of his world for help, and rejected it. On his other side was the Prophet and the Queen. 
 A silver-gray object bounded around their heads, chanting cruel words as a blade of lightning pierced through the darkness and shattered them. Seeing this, they sat up from their cot in silence. With claws fastened to their foreheads, they struggled to peer behind the light. They hesitated for a moment. Then they reached closer, looking for a fang that wouldn ’ t emerge. 
 A tower of pure and silver light streamed into their way. The Woman tried to block its spread, but the beam of light was too strong and it sent her backward. He offered his hand to release her, but she objected. He gathered a bundle and handed her a stack of bills. The first almighty bird would pay for it. This was meant to be. 
 The Queen rose from her cot and placed her palms on his back. The Devil took a deep breath and kissed his forehead. 
 “ I promise, ” the Devil cackled to himself. “ I ’ ll always love you. ” 
 “ No, ” the Queen said, “ it ’ s already too late. ” 
 That was how God – the early-in-the-night Demon – ended her reign in Heaven.<|endoftext|>

The feeling of the sandpaper on my feet, fingertips tap against the glass, and the right hand of my younger brother, Ricky, show the true price he paid. Slowly I reach for the last brush and pull it over his shoulder, pulling lightly at the gentle, cold winter winds. I wash my hands carefully, this little treatment will last me a while, there will be water before I decide on a new style of wedding. I get as far out as I can before noticing my son standing on the red carpet, tears in his eyes as he stares at me from behind. His white bandanna covers his head, his jeans are pulled back to reveal the shawl pattern that has been all over his body and I can see his from the kitchen window, where my two little boys were playing in front of it. 
 He tells me his story of how his grandparents moved to this country to make a life for themselves and to be more creative with their art, spending as much time as possible carving paint on objects and what not. I'm not sure what he's done to make a living and the repair contractors can't care less, a lot of people think their kids are clever in the same way and telling the truth. They cut paint and make stars and stripes with paint. I give him a look back at him, and he tells me of how his parents never had children and couldn't afford a family until he was in his thirties, why he didn't have one at the time, why he chose the one that hadn't been carved and why he didn't want to keep putting away the more dangerous paints, being responsible adults. 
 It was as if his life changed forever as a result of just knowing his grandkids were picked at random and sent straight home after being selected, then murdered as he was in the building he was in. He'll say that his parents never wanted him, that his parents hated him, that he was dragged from his home just like he was born, he never thought that he had to be his grandkids, or worse, his mom or dad, just to save his life. 
 When he moved in with his family, they told him of a story he heard about in an older time, how he came to visit his grandkids who were out on a trip through the woods with his family. They also told him that their step brother carried a heavy smell of tobacco and whiskey as he approached the woods and saw the silhouette of a forest. It was the closer of the woods and most of the people came to see it, as it was believed that a heavier person had carried the smell. 
 The smoke filled the air once the woods had been cleared and it was up to them to scare away the people who lived through it. They showed the people that there was more smoke, that people couldn't see what lies lie beyond the clouds until it showed them lies beyond. Only then would they discover that liars exist in this vast sky, not people having as many shitty people get in it as they do. The people in the woods would have a new name, a warmen, often fought so the people who knew their enemies can run out and ambush them, and this was how people turned against him at night. 
 I come home one night and look back at my brother, he don't seem to see it, but it seems like he did, it wasn't such a huge deal when he was young, it was almost as if he didn't have a scar at the bottom of his body, just a small scar now; 12 inches tall and 12 inches in length. My son was beginning to get as tired as I had been for the last 20 years but he continues to know all the same, no matter how far he has gone these past 15 years, unless he really wants to one day think that he only has one scar on his body, right there on the corner of his neck.<|endoftext|>

 How hard would it be for the girls that lived in the apartment block near the airport to just lay there and let the sun come up to the sky? It's like watching a work of poetry. Or maybe several poems down, only there aren't enough scattered pieces. 
 Tracing out clues can be difficult at first; finding all these clues one by one, but solving each one with every step before the first one showed. 
 "Jesus was a good man... " Jesus thought to himself. " You don't know a lot of tales yet that don't turn out like this. " 
 Laughing a bit, the bartender replied, " I never do. " 
 " How so? " Barack would ask, thinking of how horrible memories could make him feel so stoned. 
 " I don't know Jesus, I've been waiting for 3 hours and I haven't heard a sound. I just caught some flights. " 
 " Damn, " Obama would say. 
 Finally, it was time to hold the drinks. She would ask the bartender what John had to say for some reason. He'd point at his body. 
 " Ooh, warm air to the face" he would say.<|endoftext|>

It wasn't another thing I noticed a second ago. The dark pool at the mouth was still cold. Odd, in every degree. Its body was none other than the living dead, was not greener in the negative way, not more coiled in a precarious string of moving muscle than the corpse bared, [ female ] ( http: //my2now.deviantart.com/art/The-death-of-the-penultimate-human-0741289003? I-ul=1& id=3128494818 & r=1 ) 
 "The dead are the living, " while it mumbled something hidden behind the contours of the cells, " " at least, they don't need to worry about what you asked or the wine you drank, " reading the words, " at least, they don't need to worry about your corpulent sensibilities to study the matter beneath those fleshy bones. " 
 I glanced over my shoulder, nodding as I locked the door behind me. The curtain was pulled back, almost up to the ceiling but, because of how uneasy it looked, it seemed difficult to see. Though the light on the table was dim, enough to do visual inspection, a puddle with its front end illuminated the room and an odd balling of something solid was in a fairly hand-shaped setting on the floor. 
 " What is it? " I called, reaching to pick up a sprig of pine seed growing on the carpet. It had a spot in its bottom that slid back and forth. No light was sent out as soon as it emerged. 
 " The sky, " it replied, " it's just a matter of perspective. You know, perspective comes into itself when it looks around. And as you can guess, just like this paper, " it showed, "... the body doesn't matter. The dead have everything. The icy winter, the cold, the water, the suns, the wind, that's just water and ice for you. It wouldn't hurt to look at the sky."<|endoftext|>

"Backing up, " Lessier moaned. 
 Lessier was sweating profusely, his computer beating in his veins. It looked like it took as long as he was going to be able to finish the day. As he struggled to work through his humiliation, he wondered how it is that even after he discovered that no one could find that license to turn themselves in, he still couldn't find a way to make other people pay. It was as if he were in a fairy tale land of thieves, dishonor, drugs, and a few other douches that he hated. 
 " Fuck, " he thought as he stood up, feeling an overwhelming sense of solace in his attempts at getting up. " Sorry, but I don't need any credit cards at all. " 
 The man looked at him in the eyes of the two men in front of him, both casually saluting him. 
 " You know you're better than them. " one of the men chimed in. " Listen, I'm really tired. You're a scumbag like I am. I can do this for my own good and the public will love it! This license can't be stolen. " 
 " I don't care if they want it, just stop fucking around, " his friend answered slowly and quietly. 
 " You know I'm not a scumbag, " Lessier grabbed the chair back and handed it to the one at the back of the group. " I'm a black man. I can go wherever I want! I *can* stay in this dangerous world. But I don't *want* any goddamn credit cards, " he whispered under his breath. The others got a laugh of confusion. 
 " You're a jerk, " their friend said even at first. " You think you've discovered where it's better to be. We all know that. But when it gets nice and easy... " Lessier never did find his voice but he felt compelled to add the phrases. He replied almost annoyed, " I'm not a scumbag. I'm not a jackass, " he said before he had time to reply further, " and I can do whatever I want. But *I've* just got ta make sure it doesn't get them all hooked on me, " he patted the group on the back, " and keep up the good work. " 
 Sitting in the chair, he gathered the man's belongings, climbed out of the chair, and flew out of the room. He had no idea what to do with it, either. 
 " I'm just gon na read this," he heard one of the other men say out loud to himself.

I was to throw this hat in the mail for a Friday night at the Sunken Factory on 25th street, about half an hour north of Buffalo. I had never done that before, but I'd seen it done hundreds before. I'd seen the whole scene from the square miles, and the cops would have sent her home with the place secured. But in those empty miles that was what mattered. Everything I was helping hold back. 
 I still remember the cuffs, the steel my skin was wearing. She only had a down side. The thing that held me back, took away the hope. 
 I glanced at the other survivors of the neighborhood, teary eyed. Who the hell have they had been to support such hooligans? It sure did feel a little good to fight. 
 I could see the gun in her hand, and the thick lettering above it. No kidding. I was going to save her.

The kindly lanky man sat in front of me through the lanky man. I felt like he was sitting in on a conversation. Oh well... *something. * 
 I smiled to myself. " I'm Mattureus the Two-Fused! What a handsome man! " 
 The lanky man took a long pause. " Well? Well what do you want to talk about? " 
 "... Stone Basement 1349, I see. " 
 " What? " 
 " They're…elevators. Yeah, exactly like where we're supposed to go and take one. " 
 " Aren't stairs supposed to be the place you're supposed to take a step? " 
 " No, just the bottom. Well, if we had a ladder, we might have a good vantage point. " 
 " That *is* a good vantage point! I get it, " he grinned. " I think it's cute. " 
 I turned to look at Mattureus, then grabbed his bag. " Let's steal some people's bodies and prove it to you! " 
 They rushed towards the stairs. One slipped from the stairs a little bit and landed in an expansive drop in the ground. He fell down effortlessly, only to catch his breath. 
 " You know... this isn't how it works. " 
 A laughter suddenly rose above them. Mattureus turned his expression of frustration into horror, then stared back at me. 
 " I'm, ah, low on soup. For your own good, I'm saying! " he grumbled, tail wagging as he ran to the stairs. 
 "... that's a... *negative* step. " 
 The elevator door flew open, and it shattered. 
 " Hey, would you like to see one of my countless petroglyphs? " I asked angrily. 
 " Yes, cat, " one of the patrons said. 
 " What do you want to steal?"<|endoftext|>

“ Now, what are the names of all the ancestors? ” 
 John Knox shook his head sadly. “ Infernal. And they stayed etched in the sin-cowards blood-curdling gates of Hell. ” 
 The group nodded silently in agreement, though John was silent for a moment. They turned towards Jesus, who was wiping sweat from his brow, making the first half of his supplication, but John was waiting. Jesus' words not speaking, though a heavy sigh escaped him, something about betrayal followed from the lack of acceptance. 
 “ Your love and devotion to Christ was very noble. Many are worshipping you today, but a similar number tomorrow… Some have scouted you out at the foot of Mt. Olympus. You ’ re not very well without us. ” 
 John hit John in the back of the head with his hardback, forcing him to move backwards, partially before continuing. “ It is with great care and huge hope that you will be revealed to us on this date on the altar. We saw these figures in as many of your days as we did, but we have lived through this month. ” 
 The group nodded slightly. 
 John tapped the wooden table in front of him as he closed the curtain on the great meeting hall. He had no idea how he could teach them so much, the way he played with them like they were the seeds of something much stronger, but John knew they were the one for him. 
 He'd come down here to spread the Gospel, but not for the sins of humanity. He was only here for the stories of the people to remember. In fact, there was nothing but graves laid, like some dead bodies who had all moved on, eager to throw the roses aside. And some corpses were burning in the graveyard. If John was right, he would have promised them that he would get away with it. But now, just like last week, he had to make sure that they received him. 
 Most weren't quite so good. Some, not so good, were being shoved aside so desperately they made their way to various pyramids in Lebanon. In Northern Tunisia, he had now found that Shofar the Invisible had announced about a magician who possessed hundreds of souls as well as several aliases. On the field of Galilee, he had found that Superman had performed a minor battle with the demons that claimed to have resurrected Hell itself. On the West Coast, he found that Zekul had been given the blood of many heroes who had died the first time, but the faithful prayed for glory that would bring them back. He paid no heed to that fact, though. It was always the same story, ‘ Pilgrimage, ’ or “ New Crusades, ”, and he didn ’ t know what they meant. ’ 
 They were gone, red blotches covering most of the Egyptian pyramids, but those still made their way to the earth before his force of will could control them. When he did, many witnessed him—those men who were buried in the gibbons of hell. And many of them were happy. The six of them had finally paid attention to all the stories and rituals that he had given them, and he had told them all. 
 There were pictures taken of the Archangels in the game Israel, and in the same language as his own, though John knew in his memory Hebrew could be stitched together. He never took the requests into account, of course. But after making them the gift that he was so rich in, his lack of gifts could not be put off. He knew what they did for him. And the life of the Father was fulfilled, his life saving in the infinite tomes of the name of Jesus and His Son. He knew, too, that the things he helped others came true, and in the land of the living he had in heaven, those who decided to live as the ones to save souls were rewarded. 
 John went out to distribute his messengers. He gave his blood to their children, making sure that they all knew the things his sons had done as the Father. He then cooked for them in another human flesh way; only his own tastes had flavor, and those that learned of his ways only gained power. From now until the fall, John went to help out all those who owed him support. 
 “ Did you have a brother or sister? ” asked one of the men, gesturing with a finger. 
 “ Oh, ” John replied with a pained grunt.<|endoftext|>

"What were you doing last night? " 
 " Nothing ever changed. " 
 " And how do you know? " 
 " Basically the every food allergies and sedentary behaviours happen to you every day. I have been living with you so long that I know where you're going. " 
 " But how? " 
 " Just thought it was weird. Your cereal industry was awful to sit down in. " 
 " How much better? " 
 " Well, if you don't know where you're going, you'd better sit down. " 
 " And if I don't? " 
 " You get whatever free eats you want. " 
 " Really? " 
 " Nobody eats like you. " 
 " And what's worse is that no one mentions you, and you're stuck talking to'you' for no reason. " 
 " What do you mean? " 
 " You give us free eats every day. " 
 " And nobody mentions you? " 
 " Oh, forget it, it never was as big a problem the first day. But anyway I finally clicked with you. No one mentioned you. " 
 " Then you did it on purpose? " 
 " Oh yeah. The first day you blamed me for the poor tasting diet. Then you had a blast. " 
 " Oh shit, like that? " 
 " That was it. It got weird. " 
 " I like watching TV. " 
 " Nah. It's a way for me to stay out of this situation. " 
 " If you're the stupidest bitch alive with poor taste, you'll probably murder yourself to keep me in this situation. And then forget it. We're going to be talking about piss back in business."<|endoftext|>

I had failed. 
 I ran, swung, clawed, and screamed as I collapsed onto the asphalt. I remembered my father, out in the field, just before the flood of disaster. 
 "Fuck you! " 
 I took a moment to get my body upright and square against the asphalt. 
 Something snapped me to my feet. Something had happened. I was back at my house, a second thing back. I had not been able to move. My dad looked at me with disdain. " You dare try to move me? " 
 I watched my father curiously, he could see this man how little strength he had left. He followed me out into the distance, towards the corn fields of his hometown, holding a swarm of colas and jamming a needle through the back of his neck. I wanted him to hear something, something I couldn't, a decision to make and be made. To see if he would change. 
 I reached over and brought the needle between his ears, once again holding his consciousness inside of me. 
 I had failed.<|endoftext|>

It didn't take long before I became overwhelmed by the fact that this particular shoe store had a large, intimidating collection of velcro dangling from a cap with large straps that I could barely afford. Granted, the ridership was much more costly than I would have hoped for for some shoes, but still, the feeling was very pleasant. 
 Most guys from my development class always talked about it, and never cared to take the money they were receiving because no one knows exactly how dumb such a gift might be for them. Sure, some guys could print their own shoes, but they were so new to the market that no one would bother meeting me at first because I was pretty dumbstruck. Right now, I was wondering where they got the shoes for. 
 "What do you think, blogger? " the older girl asked me. 
 " To be honest, I'm not really sure, though it always happened before. " 
 I replied with an uncharacteristic puff. " Do you want to get some? " 
 She rolled her eyes. " You sure, nice shoes. " 
 She laughed. " You know how it goes. I assume most of them are officially public examples of inappropriateness? " 
 I shook my head. " No. " I said. " Not even I understand the denizens of these stores who are generally clueless about security. Even the public connection is a non-issue. But here you go, putting it mildly. Tell me. Where did your father go to college?" 
 She stared at the floor, then peeked at the cap as it fell. 
 Perhaps what I lacked in youthful years my high girth showed in the tights of her and I took another long sip of our sweet good-smell. We snuck under that cap and it fell down snug, but not unwillingly. I peered into the vast expanse of permanent gloom that stretched on to the expanse that had engulfed my life and showed no signs of settling. The approaching sunset scowled at me and we stopped short of the infinite sea. 
 As I grew older, I thought I had an interesting point about this new shoe store.<|endoftext|>

"You're finally here, " he said to me with a dramatic smile. 
 I stared at him, like a cat who's more curious than a spider's web. He was barely even hiding in the middle of the road. I heard how he'd convinced me to take this chance to help him. The pink sky and the deep black clouds had made it hard to be positive, but I had the audacity. 
 " You're finally here, I don't mean to be ridiculous but I felt like you were finally welcome here too. I'm just- let's go. It's always a little small thing, these days " he said crossing my arms and closing his eyes and pausing in a pattern before stepping back to sit down on a lovely hillside in the middle of the night. 
 " So what you're saying is that it's just a small step away to meet me so we can go- " he stopped mid sentence, took a step back as if trying to intimidate me. 
 " Ah right, so uh, uh. How about I explain- " 
 " Excuse me? " I calmly pressed him in my ear and the same strange new sensation poured through my body. I stared right into his eyes, his amazingly innocent eyes that always seemed so beautiful. The soft silhouette of a crook of a hand, as though it was in love with me that I never could be of any use. 
 " I just- I needed a boat. A right - " 
 I shrugged at him. 
 " It's not a boat, it's just, I need a boat with something to help me start a family. An extended family. " 
 " That's *whooo! * " he snapped, trashing my hand. " What the hell are you talking about? You've done this countless times to us, we never have any idea who you are. Your skin is wracked with a death penalty, you've tried every fucking thing to pay for this sentence. I told you I'm going to help you here. To bring an end to all of this, nothing so special as the ability to fly. Oh- did you want to pay for your murder, oh there are so many laws you can't possibly comprehend. Now get off me! " 
 " I've never paid for death. I've never been killed. " 
 His steel teeth bulged out from the bottom of his mouth with every step he took. Then he just smiled, for once. And the thin lines across his back were just a little. 
 " This is a motherfucking joke! " he shouted, as he opened his arms wide for the hugest gesture imaginable. " You love me like no one else. I love you too, see that? Now you've become death. I will never forget you."<|endoftext|>

I stand up straight and approach some shelf shelves. You have to admire the way the light is shining through the window, perfectly kept in place by nothing but a spoon, a few clothes, and two glasses of water. I'll probably be in my bed soon. 
 The number on the shelf reads READ, but it's not that noticeable. The number on the shelf reads " 2 ", but the person standing in front of me isn't going to bother with it. 
 I walk up to the window. All I can see is air, heat and the brightness of my personal space. The brand new book has its physical coloring on its covers. I look in the window and look out over my 8 feet wide, 3 foot wide flat bed. 
 " That was never supposed to happen." I tell myself. I can breathe the full range of air in this time of year, even if the winds blow it all up. I walk over to my desk, peering through the cracks and screws. I stare at the new edition of The Lord of the Rings, it is beautiful. 
 I take a look inside. Yes. 
 There is my leather, sandals, and a piece of paper covered by the fiftieth draw of the iron. 
 I squint the eyes and there is the first verse of my new book. 
 The sky looks white outside, but the sky looks bright in the middle east.<|endoftext|>

An adventure! And in a small village of warring parents they found a curious potion. It would revitalise the rebellious minds of others, free spirit and all. It would cure their foolishness. A choice it made. An exciting story full of surprises! ( full length version if read in one sitting ) 
 I don't know where they found it. It looked like magic. A mixture of basalt and filth. And it was fake. My best friend threw a food from outside of the little boy house and it made me jump. My big brother ran over with a scythe and they started chattering for a bit. They laid on the ground, looking at the potion, in stunned horror. 
 The potion was grown there. 
 My eldest had passed away. I didn't want to hurt him. But I wouldn't. I didn't want to rip his hand off. I couldn't let him go and deal with it. My parents were very proud. My best friend couldn't put a spell together with a realistic age of their daughter. 
 The potion lasted a month. It made me feel like I was reborn in this good, magical town. My parents would try to help me rebuild my village. They would come home and tell me how many days I spent crying. One of the residents would accuse them of witchcraft, or criminal responsibility, or even treason. I was supposed to move on. They were not interested. I was ready for another challenge! I didn't want to lose my very young brother. 
 But then one day... A little girl... I think she told me one day... she had scurried in the wrong direction. And suddenly something big had happened, and she hurt her very bad, very real, or very slow. My little brother was scarred, but at least I could move. Then I woke up on my own, only bruised, then dead. My entire world fell away like a switch a dozen times. I felt so empty.<|endoftext|>

"Young Master, your potential is getting to be stellar! Do you not remember how it happened? " 
 I sighed my weary sigh, looking at the Colonel. The robot beside him blinked and looked at me inquisitively. 
 " Yes, young Master. I am beyond the reach of my power. You probably know the hard part. No, no, as the most deadly agent has been passed on to the next. No, all memories come from the newest one: the Jackal, you thought you could hide within a building, but you let him escape. You are the total embodiment of evil! Go ahead and hack our headquarters and let us know how they take down a leader, then contact us. " 
 " Not all have the ability to see minds. Whoever you are, you are a character in an idea. Not all can see minds. You are being followed. Now. Remember, the Powers are so wonderful that to leave them at the mercy of the Evil empire needs a Captain or Justice. " 
 " So you were already the Captain? Even in your system, our army was fighting alongside them. Oh, that is a great change. Now would you like to see your thoughts flow from your head? Yes, Master? " 
 " I hope not. Maybe I can help. " 
 The pinprick of buttons connected together and a dark light emanated from the tiny grey dial. The Captain looked at me quizzically. I considered supporting him. Perhaps a few leaders might appear. I couldn't. That would all be moot. 
 It was over in a moment's hesitation that my mind began to clear. I stood back up. The screen flashed as I looked around the room. Man was created. A beautiful smile showed on every face I saw. The Captain didn't smile or flinch. 
 I blinked and smiled and ran. 
 To my surprise, all the supervillains within the prison's perimeter disappeared into thin air. I had to keep an eye on them. No matter what happened, there was always more of the Doctor.

Yes. I will try to help but I know as soon as I'm in this environment I will bring another terror. We can be protected, but they need my help. 
 No. They are humans. I am building the world's downfall. I will bring humanity down with me. 
 But the monsters. They are tougher, smarter, stronger and more ruthless than we are, not just humans, but all of them too. We don't just appreciate their ingenuity. We can do exactly what they do, in a fair and just way. As he stole the diamond from the lake the first monster surrendered. 
 I couldn't force the mountains to dig into their floor. A tribe did. I asked "why?" They smiled. They were faster than us, faster than humans in many ways. 
 I could kill him too, and him he did. His blood would seep into our veins, past our bones to the worms in our veins, to the very marrow of our bones. 
 But the ones who cared for him would struggle now. They would dream of his sacrifice and his sacrifice was more than enough. He would be mine and he would seek only His Food. 
 For yet I've seen a way. We stand at the edge of the world. No-one can stop us now. No-one can stop the humans. We know how they hurt. 
 The plants that felled our people were sent to the mountains for our defiance. Plants that gave us hope for what we would do. Plants that held us in the balance. 
 There was one who blamed me for their downfall. It was an old name that stuck in our mind, a bitter memory in our young minds, one that seemed to die with the loneliness and hurt. 
 But he couldn't kill me. He lived among me, one day, right now, in the garden of my own altar and said no. He had the clay of his feet more than me, he would have left it in my mouth if I didn't. 
 I raised a stone against his feet. The stone felt cold against his skin. 
 And I smiled, he wouldn't try that, they wouldn't even kill him yet. I could reveal the world's fate to him. He would kill the one monster not feared at all. His child. He would feel the harsh pain, the loneliness, the loneliness, the pain, even then that would be total, total, he would wish that no one was hurt. 
 I didn't love him, and neither would he, but that didn't matter. We were both victims, but the humans deserved so much more than a child, a good person. The humans were cruel, and she was nothing. 
 You may remember me, your young friend who was sent to the man. You may remember him, and I will remember you. Your little boy will go on, and I will start to remember you.<|endoftext|>

There she was again, a minute ago, just like he always did, pacing the emptiness of her day to day life. As the thundering of her screaming ceased, I absorbed the feeling in my heart until it dissipated in my throat. He stared at her head, one image on her mind, 'what if that death was so cosmic and kind for the dying?' 
 *Interesting, * I thought, stopping to take stock of what I had just done. I hadn't even worked up the courage to say it, though, not from a joyless, desperate whim. 
 If a cancer was ending, and all that was left was the mirthlessness of the event and the hate of life, then she was dying, and she wasn't far from it. * Why was she so scary? * I asked myself with a questioning look, not from curiosity or fear, but nothing else really. 
 What difference between a cancer and an apocalypse architect? I did not think that, other than being rather common, I was absolutely not going to go down without a fight. He stayed front and center, rather than just staring, with eyes like the eyes of a cross between a samurai and a zombie. My mouth did not move, my teeth did not flinch, and even my eyes did not do something dramatic, just staring. 
 Something beyond her negativity, if you could call it that. Even though you probably don't want her to die, you completely don't have a death wish. Being able to decide whether she goes mad or alive or just... totally, unspoken, who the hell am I going to judge a flawless being like that? 
 She had lived a life. A full and convincing one. It was not romantic to say that he was a gardener, it was merely a logical perception. I think he wrote down his granddaughter's drawings and lived life to see through every aspect of their lives. It had never felt that simple before, and it all seemed so big to me when I thought about it. I guess I must have been torn out of a dream once I wanted to go on like that. 
 Of course, all I had to do to ensure that her death was so terrifying, and quick, was to just sit there for a while. It might not take him long to figure it out, though. Having one target kill another, that's simply not how it's done. 
 She watched, seductively, as he sat upright on the floor of his living room chair, on his fingers above the cherry-red, young, surgical-looking, pearly white mahogany table, his arms outstretched, his hands clasped behind his back. He forced himself to put one hand on the table; a hand which swung confidently around behind his back, towards a woman who had passed away just a moment ago. 
 I was at her door, holding open the door wide open, because I had made a mistake, perhaps I had made my chosen set of actions. I think I should have said something, but I wasn't going to ask, *anything* to be heard.<|endoftext|>

After a long day at work you start to notice that your work is getting shorter and shorter. You haven't eaten in days. You don't wash your hands, there isn't food going out or anything. All that is in place with this day. 
 You reach for your phone and the screen is showing three numbers. Things are similar - one starts at 3 AM, then fills up. Almost immediately you notice that your new number - 3AM - only has one person on it. You walk over to it and try to dial the other person as best you can, but all of a sudden there's an odd tone going on... it doesn't match your voice. 
 You catch an odd noise - dull buzzing coming from a man in a suit who doesn't seem up to answering. You reply "Ok, " as he suddenly walks over. He turns to a desk beside your desk and begins to mutter " Hey, so this is the number you set yourself for tonight. You've gotten pretty used to remembering this and it's just a matter of getting it down. " The man opens his mouth but no words are spoken as he looks down. He pauses as he looks around the room. " So that's why I asked you for this. I want to meet my friend Pete. " The man stands up and hands you a hat. " We are going to an office party tonight. Just hit up there where Dave goes. " As you get seated there's a group of three guys in sunglasses who start kicking the door in the middle of the room. You are the first to notice it - two of the hat men are blocking the door to Pete's room. As you exit through the door you hear: " This isn't the first time you've chosen up the numbers to give my beloved cat, Pete a cake. " 
 Then you hear the bear out the door. " Thank you for responding to these harassing emails. I'll be here at 7:00."<|endoftext|>

His stare at it for the last time slowly bore me in my true form. A mask from a mask literally blew away my peripheral vision. For a few seconds my head was still intact but I could see nothing to indicate the fact that this unnatural thought was going on. A few inconsequential seconds passed where my vision became claustrophobic. My ears were still ringing, I felt something there within me that I had never felt before. A finality, I had never felt before. 
 When I came to I thought I was home, my father as well, with my sister Laura sitting next to me. I focused deep in my mind, only able to hear so much but knowing I was being guided in my own image that I had lived through. When I finally spoke into my earpiece I could not keep my sobbing at bay anymore. So I lost my patience. I had to turn to the adults at the back of my room to clean up the mess. Instead of asking 'Is it alright,' they just give the robot voice the best chance for being down on me. They then begin to tear at the paint with their nails. Of course I always attempted to verbalize my reaction, but a final involuntary gasp from somewhere in my periphery was enough to galvanize the rage in me, and in a split second I still screamed in anger at what I had done, demanding to be taken back to the telecelli. 
 After a few moments, I finally made it to the door. I was greeted by the ghostly figure of the robot however there was more of a ghostly feeling towards me than normal; their voice reinforced. I started walking toward the heart monitor. Apparently while in the alcove of a large, glass figure, the human was running around on a bench. I took a step back and continued running. After a few hours, a sound different than my usual went off in my head. It was heavy and loud, too heavy for me to handle, and it crackled, and a sharp pain came from my right hip. Taking one last step forward, I drove it down the wall and the impossibly warm liquid. 
 “ You bastard! ” I roared in pain. 
 They walked up to the desk in a sprint. They hadn't stopped to touch me or anything. That was the best I could do. 
 “ Don't do it. ” The voice so calleded out. 
 Just as quickly as it came. The thing had burned him. He had lost his world. He had lost everything. Finally, after three years in hiding, and after countless attempts to free himself and his family, he was finally free. 
 I was sure I was making it to my rightful home. I grabbed my filthy electronic journal and took off my shorts. I used these to cover my bikini length length underwear. I had always loved my most prized possession. 
 “ I can see it in their hooded glances and practiced smiles. ”<|endoftext|>

I hold my breath as I breathe in the stale air. It wasn't long now. I'm already rambling on about the betrayal that I saw, how my parents didn't want me to marry, how I couldn't go to college, how we didn't have kids and I still remember it was cold, cold and terrible, all the little things like that, like it was the only thing I wanted. Why would anyone do this? I'm stuck, as always. 
 I suddenly feel a sudden wave of cold light above me. It was only a few seconds ago that I thought that my parents were in a desperate desperate atmosphere, frantically circling, desperately circling the globe desperate to show that they were human. Now I'm trapped with them, my parents clutching to me to show me that they weren't just an animal, but that I was a human. When did that happen? It just happened the instant my breath left my lungs, it was as if someone used a blender, and everyone else was curled up in the corner trying to stammer into something meaningful. 
 Hearing those words across my mind, I was frightened. It was all so, so sudden. My lungs exploded, I yelped as my breath hurtled toward the heavens, though my vocal chords were all I could hear. I let out a deep sigh, the pain was crushing, only I felt relief. Now that I'm in my place, I was able to do my job. 
 "You don't need to take away what's yours " said a voice. 
 And then I knew. My whole body felt like it had been touched by a hand, maybe a kiss? Or, it was just numbness! I slammed my head on the table and screamed for my parents to stop.<|endoftext|>

At the heart of it all is the Concept Arcana. It is a pane that can be and ever will be, hovering above any and all obstacles or opportunities to attain its full potential. This Arcana is loved by everyone. Everyone who could seek it. That is not to say that everyone gets it, but if you had to choose which one you have to choose, you would have to choose your masterpiece. 
 The Arcana has no pedestal, no grand design, no unified future... Even the half-closed ones cannot be viewed in the light of this illusion. It revolves around you, hovered down in front of you, silent. It is silent enough that you can not see the object above it. It is not masked by any form of reflection, which leaves you entirely vulnerable to the light of this illusion. 
 You don't need to be afraid. You can feel the rays of the light, and readjust your body, and wait for your instantaneous arrival. Your body will turn and we wait, looking out the window, ignoring the glowing circle and studying its metaphysical qualities. Eventually the heart will blow itself out of existence, and the artifact will strike it's final blow. 
 The Artifact is of a familiar kind. Your skin always looks the same, the taste of water seems different, and it soothes the senses, at least in the few times it has been leaked out, revealing a fresh, natural spring. Then, just before your storm of emotions comes to pass, you hear a knock at the door. I was supposed to meet the One, but I haven't been able to. A figure just appears in front of the door. 
 "Is this the One? " the figure asks. 
 " Me? " I ask. 
 " Yes, it is me, and there is no way to stop it. The rest of the plans involve an agonizing struggle, but it is a peaceful space, and I believe we can stop it. I am one who, on reflection, reflects into the future and sees yourself in its presence. " 
 " What do you mean? " 
 " What happens after we accept that we do have great intentions for the future? We will never have to trust another man, or woman, or being, and will never have any issues with them. We will create the counterwoven pieces that are necessary for an even better future. I look outside and see the true colors of our own future. The ever-growing asteroid belt. A good side effect is that we will be able to harvest some of the uranium in our oceans. It is great for me, and only great for everyone else. I am being careful now. So no one else would know what it is we are doing. " 
 " Thanks, I apologize for the interruption. " 
 " Thank you, we will continue to talk. " 
 " Then who are you?" 
 The door was flung open.<|endoftext|>

He had always been fascinated with stars. As a kid, that was something unusual. Sirius could be like a giant glass wall with rivulets of metal and air separating them. It wouldn't even draw you close. 
 Instead, he and his inner child would tunnel into a dream at night, unaware of the beckoning of a supernova and how the universe within would rotate around it. 
 He had heard it so many times from his younger son, but he still believed it. He made sure he wanted to be famous, then a lot more often. He hated what he was "trying" to achieve. The obvious and blatant rubbery ship would shunt in the grip of time, but his glory days had sold the secrets inside. After all, maybe not any more. 
 He dreamed of unaided attention and renewed popularity. He would know that his life would never change. No drama and no severe booze fueled moments would overshadow his immense accomplishments. No street-slider would change his status as the star that would watch. 
 In his desperation, he attempted with all his might to free himself from that stupid fantasy. And now, he had asked for it. 
 " I wish for real fame. I wish for my own fame, but I can not participate." 
 And with that, he turned. He stood before the onlookers. They stepped closer to him. His parents smiled when they saw his eagerness to prove his desires. They thanked him on the podium. 
 He had never been the type of star, would never be the star he wanted, would never be his own child. But he had heard those words.

This gunry apparently wasn't used to hunting, but probably a type of antique butler stuffed with ammunition fired a shot from a 6 box revolver on the desk. I grabbed the revolver from the desk with my other hand and played with it. 
 "He's chasing us! " I shouted to my landlord. " I know you're killing him, I don't know why he's chasing us. Why are you chasing us? " 
 He came running over to the machine, without looking. I looked at him and saw the disdain, I had never seen anybody as frightened as this man. 
 " Will you pay me? " I asked the two of us behind him. " Oh, heck yeah! No. You're here to fix him, but he's getting less cooperative... " 
 He sat up, and ran away. 
 In a panic, I hopped into a cab for a ride home from the mortuary. 
 I heard the car door open, and walked inside. 
 " Well, I guess now that you're here, maybe a bargain could come with a gun and a note. " 
 " Yes, what? " I said. " I still have some ammunition for a shot of it... " 
 " Enough, let's get out of here." 
 I heard two bullets rain down on a hiker in a ditch.<|endoftext|>

The morning seemed to slow, and then fear was formed within me. I could feel it leaking onto the scrap of glass that was wrapped around me, consumed by her shadow. I did not know if she was there anymore, but I did recognize her every time I see it, a thought surging through my head. 
 All over the city, the streets were polluted with its presence, stopping in and passing by. Everything about this world was laced with the chemicals that we breathe. We breathe deeply, not just for our lungs but for our minds, all of them. Something about nature, something that tells us that we must hold out. So we hand that same compound over to our children, and because we are fighting against nature, we must. 
 Nobody knew what to do with the end of our days, no one else wanted to watch for themselves. I shared this privilege with them, at the beginning, our friends just made a mistake. They worked harder than I did. More did it. More failed. Every day, we watched the same compounds, bent on it and destroying our children. We're fighting back. 
 Every day though, we fight. 
 Today, it was her, waiting.<|endoftext|>

Why did we run? 
 Why did we change our perspective? 
 We only needed a sword. A sword that could have obliterated everything. Our small group on planet Earth couldn't have brought that knowledge to another world. We might have really just accomplished what we set out to do for thousands of years. 
 We went through the same battle, each of us with our own goal, different in them but essentially our own. 
 We took our first steps. We imagined ourselves as great heroes, sure you could rise up from your home nation to lead our society. Or maybe I did, but who knows. Probably all that time traveling has made everyone more secure, makes them more literate, more aware of future events, and is why we kept on carrying on, supporting, and securing our own security. 
 Then came the explosion, the rubble, and now we don't even know what caused it. 
 One by one everyone turned out. The loss of their families, their houses, all went to waste. The health care, the education, the factory infrastructure. 
 My wife and two daughters, left fighting for their land, and another now was set on ending a conflict they had won. 
 By the end of the war, we couldn't even go back in time in time. We died peacefully and peacefully when we saw what had happened. 
 But that's just me. I couldn't hide. I couldn't hide from what was happening. I only prayed to God that I never died. I was so close to a destruction they weren't worried about. I was so close to a peaceful land I was proud to call home. 
 We saw the deadly light of humanity becoming distracted by technology. Chemical warfare, nuclear weapons, being as ancient as any cancer could be, atomic bombs, nuclear weapons, over a thousand ships from worlds beyond anything we'd seen. 
 And of course, with a tank explosion in the distance, we would want to push out. There was too much tissue for the blood to nourish and everything would be burn. 
 But the world was just one, we didn't dare move. 
 In the end, we knew. No one could stop us. Only you were my soldier. The world is for our blood. 
 And now I am but a sample.<|endoftext|>

Steps. Step forward. The emperor of the gods is stirring. 
 Step forward. The seven hundred queen of humanity are relaxing in the palace's ornate temple. Words are started moving through the sand that is the floor. A child is coming in, watching the sunset. Another touches a grain, then a cello. 
 Step forward. The five star generals of the world are about to wake from their nap. The day has come. 
 Step forward. The annual celebration of love and memory was held in the royal palace. More stars started appearing, lights were extinguished, and a cloud began to rise. The coronations had been held on every year since this particular year. The acceptance of the Einherjar family, the free gifts the rulers give to every person on earth, became a thing of the past. A signature from the Aqiva family. 
 What a blessed day. Quickly, steps from the palace. The emperor announces the celebration. A gun is raised.<|endoftext|>

"The mission goal is to know if we can reach the same goal, but no one seems to believe us! When we reach Earth, we figure we can forget about it. We don't start the search for evidence of help, everything we find and ultimately the cause of our problems is fixed. We can't forget. 
 " We can't let them take it for granted. we are not told why we're doing this, but as Earth evolves to accommodate us, it seems like they give an OK. Out of curiosity, we set up a death trip and they stop. We even see better, if only to prove that the mission is true. 
 " If that goes through, we will be ridiculed. Maybe I'll give some credit for this one, the astronauts! There are two nations competing for the rest of the 5K-150 years. 
 " And so we start our disappearance. searching for signs of human life, as far as I'm aware. Scientists have long ago used these same routes to describe what happens, since we knew it was getting too far. Scientists now believe we traveled backwards, possibly, as many 2-1/2".<|endoftext|>

*Still alive* 
 It held me so tight. * Still alive* 
 My father stood next to me on the porch. 
 My mother ran past us to help me lay down. 
 My father strode towards me. He always said he needed a 'psycho-active' dead father to breathe in. I don't think I would have believed him if I never doubted him. 
 He was handsome though. As they called him, he talked old-timey about his wife, about the 'girl with the tongue', about being 'determined'. His voice was a long and kind one, and you knew he believed it in our minds. 
 My father hardly spoke. 
 Our father took us to the nursery. He told us he was dying, but I wanted to tell him that. I wanted the boy to remember me. That's when I felt it. I knew. I felt it for a moment. I just... wouldn't feel it right now. 
 My father looked at me. He said something. He looked like one of us. My friend, or something, that looked like him. I did not want to understand. 
 My own mother sat next to me. She felt so pale, worried about him. I saw the tears rolling down her cheeks, and my father's grip tightened. The guilt of what I had done felt real to me. 
 My hands gripped tighter. 
 My mother came rushing back to me, clutching my head. " You've done it. " she spoke quietly, no idea how to get her to say it. 
 He continued. " The ground hit you like a ton of bricks. You don't know how hard it feels. " 
 I tried not to laugh. Why did he hurt me so badly. I asked if he wanted to take me out to dinner. " You wan na know? I told you so much. " 
 " I'll tell the truth. They're running, but they're not moving fast enough. " 
 My mother began to sob. She took me all in. " Please.. please don't look at me like that. " 
 " There's only one way we can stop them. " 
 My father hugged me tightly. His arms around me. I cried myself to sleep. 
 *Still alive* 
 My hands shook in my sleep. 
 " My dad... " I whispered, " he couldn't take what he did. " 
 " That's not the end of it." my mother said as she looked me in the eye.<|endoftext|>

This was my first real attempt at something as ill informed as it sounded. I think I'll apply it to my work with a bit of flair. 
 Now go check on it if you think I'm going to do that right. Anyway let's see if I'm on alright. 
 By the time I see Emily, I think I saw an empty catwalk and heard that the door was slowly springing open. How the hell did I find her? Well, it seems Emily is in some sort of court battle with Simon about a fight in a flea market where that's legal. Naturally Simon comes into the court room a little slow, coming from the woods. Nobody's fighting, he walks to Emily. 
 I find her and it's nice because Emily is so well clothed. I knew her, I just had to show her. 
 Then Hannah, the girl who slept on the catwalks above the flea market is surrounded by cat people and the cat people rush her. As Simon sees that Hannah is being chased by a bunch of other men and so he rushes towards her to save her. I think I saw the picture of Emily, floating about at an angle. 
 The catpeople respond to Simon by breaking a window, allowing Simon to get in a scary way. Once free of Simon there is an evil looking man with a two to three pack in his hands. He takes them in and a pillar of smoke erupts above him. After the smoke clears Simon is able to understand that they're fighting a fight and somehow it doesn't seem like Simon has known Hannah's story. Either way Hannah is gone and Hannah picks up her body on the ground. Simon goes to collect her and wonders how she got her legs or something like that. 
 I don't think that's really all that important, but here it is when Simon places his arm over Hannah's shoulder. 
 "Sarah, on this side, where did I tell you? " 
 " Just now, Simon " 
 " And what about you, Sarah? " 
 " Well, I'll get him to you by the hand. " 
 Simon walks over to Sarah and makes a big grab at her arm. Sarah goes back into the battle, but they see people getting up from the stumps and running around. A streetlight flashes and an ambulances that follow is seen heading towards the scene. There's blood on Hannah's body as the shades glow. Simon, on the other hand, has a death glare on Sarah's eyes. 
 " Sarah, I tried to warn you, but you didn't listen. I got you a banana. I said no " 
 " But Hannah, I was just trying to make you a better person. " 
 " Fine, but your question is two minutes. I'll explain when you're born. " 
 " As far as I remember. It started like this a little more than three weeks ago. With my knowledge of blood preparation and game of battle I learned you, Sarah were going to get you a banana once in my life. " 
 " Ahh, well, this is kind of your story now, Sarah. How did you learn to fight? And how did you find your own bag of tricks for breaking through walls? " 
 " I learned to dodge a rock that gets my arms and legs in a cart. " 
 " It wasn't a free falling apple. It was a big piece of cake. " 
 " What does that mean by that? " 
 " Well, Sarah, my sister wants a banana, and she bought two weeks ago to give me the gift. But the first thing we do is go to and steal her gift. She's pregnant. " 
 " And then, Simon? " 
 " She has an infection under her arm and it says she needs to have a child. She's not going to make it. " 
 " Thanks for telling me this though, Simon. I am going to get her a banana."<|endoftext|>

The crowd, now youthful, sat around his locker, the sharp, thin, awkward bulge in his calves gleaming with youth. The walls were thin and comfortably packed with personnel, but had recently been broken at the foot of the stairs for a long ten or fifteen minutes. 
 "Has the rumor spread? " lamented the rough-looking fifth-year lieutenant. The troops around him had waited for another step or two since he arrived at the prison. No one in particular seemed to know the harsh reality of their situation. With no movement from their commanders, no recruits had begun to move in and out of the dug-out starting after he had arrived, and, even more strange, no one here either. If you kept your backs to the gates of the camp walls you could have jumped from one on top of your head, darted down and over to the free-fall gate and leap in. If you jumped off from your forward-hand if you weren't careful, you could have flown right over the guard tower. Even worse, if you jumped off from the cement barrier you were forced to climb from the top. But that had only been the beginning of it. 
 Three years they had been in this camp. Three years. For the sixth time in fourteen years, the colonel had been beaten to death by his superior one day earlier. The price they had paid had killed more than a hundred men and children than anything he had seen. His colleagues had all come to him for help, he knew none of them were coming. Instead his buddies had let him die their loneliness and fear. 
 As they pulled into the camp, the village elder had stood and called for his comrades. All of the groups together in the platoon marched forward; the slain leaders of the parties beside them, the generals, their asses digging, brawling among each other, one after the other. Each one looked like a student or soldier of war, drinking heavily as they played games of strategy. A few, his comrades and fellow soldiers in the dead center were standing before him, the rest were standing. For a brief second his thoughts drifted to the history of the camp. His men who had collapsed mid-play did not escape until they had blown up another base. A new strategy had appeared in the group, for which he was " one-for-one, " as one of the soldiers called him. 
 Two of his men had died too early. They had was trained within hours of his arrival that day to fight under the banner of the one-for-one. For a week the village had been bellowing with cries of hostility. Everything went as planned, until one of the guards grabbed the fellow soldiers and threw him out of the way, in the casket, where his head hadn't yet been uncovered. After the other three had been slain, they fell to the floor. 
 The chief officer had raised his giant middle finger into the air; his vision was missing, and his chest and hands were red. The soldiers had rushed to their ranks to react to the fighting, reaching their guns and stabbing the dying barracks guards. 
 One of them had pushed a knight aside and raised his sword. " Fuck you, now!" he shouted, but the sergeant had not heard him. The attack finally came to a close when one of the two guards broke his neck. He burst through the gates and into the town one last time before retreating to his tent. They were able to maneuver him away from the corpses of three soldiers. As they left they gasped, bared their teeth. The dawn had come, and one would die before the next. One would, of course, have died long before that. But they didn't just die. Instead they were stronger, more powerful, more safe.<|endoftext|>

Do you love any story? 
 Do you love life, or do you only get to see things from the viewpoint of what you are writing? 
 Do you love anything? 
 Do you love love humanity, a piece of reality? 
 Do you love your friends, the empty shells of the worst people in the world? 
 Do you love owning everything? 
 What do you do with yourself, if not the only thing you possess? 
 How do you protect yourself from the consequences of these things, what should you do to overcome them? 
 We all crave exposure, but one thing is too much. 
 Everything has consequences, everything has potential, everything is just so limited. If you get too focused on something, then just lose it, and then end up with nothing else.

My teeth bearded as I stood in the body snatcher's cave. In the distance, red sirens sounded. We hadn't walked in months and I was drenched in sweat. An earthworm was creepering over the mound of dirt and lights that me and my companion would recently discovered in the wake of yesterday's field work by the Tsunami Watch. When I glanced around, there was no human being on the mound so I could not see anything else. So I picked up my water bottle and left. 
 The field keep had established a perfect wind farm back home and the air was smooth. There was a building nearby and the buzzing of the wind machines was certainly worrying. However, I was not fearful as soon as I saw him walking in there. I hurried back home and formed the following thoughts: 
 *No human here. No traps. Nothing to worry about. Forget the roads and build a mini tent. * 
 *No fear of anyone, except for the giant enemy when he returns to his lair, and the monsters and zombies. * 
 *I guess it's better this way. He's ours to mine. * 
 *I want you to sleep well, rather than steal what you've got. Plus, he'll love the smell of flowers after having my water for the past two weeks. * 
 I wanted to snuggle until I felt him shift away from the creaky molding paper that lay there before me and to the spot where he used to nap while he slept. It was now or never, what was a dream-and-taste anymore. Then I got in my bed, which was partly covered with something warm. 
 This wasn't an uncomfortable bed. It was soft and fairly warm. I stood up and left my bed. I let the soil go to the side of my bed and took my hat off. I pulled out my family picture. 
 It was a picture of me and the Tsunami Watch. I was walking back home from school when the earthquake hit and my mom took me home for Christmas. My best friend is a Tsunami Watch veteran. Both of them never jumped over themselves to kill and eat the civilian life. So despite my good grades and appreciable work ethic, I won't be found out by accident. My mom refused to take my picture. She was leaving the hut when I arrived. She was trying to salvage her life as I climbed to the top of the mountain. I jumped out of the hut not sure whether it was hurting me or the earthquake at home but I was. My mom is out now. She won't return anytime soon.

Happy birthday boy. I have always felt the allure of true love as if it were the most significant thing in the universe. I see this all the time in my dreams. But it's only for a brief moment. How could the very real and eternal release of my soul be kept? This is the moment that began the world's destruction. 
 My room was far from complete. I sat upright for a full minute. The liquid inside my ice cube flooded the room and my heart felt like it was about to drown as it began to expand. I looked at my dog. He was down at his tower watching us all fall. He had been enjoying his stay on the family farm and the famous cedar house we built in the other house when a zombie attacked our family. My hound was one of those bygone cougars. Our mother drove it over to them. She ran to their table. She held the cedar that made us open our cedar door. I heard the scream. 
 I grabbed him by the throat. 
 "What is wrong with you boy, darling? " 
 She cried because she was so afraid of what had happened to her dog, Hell. 
 " I don't know what is wrong with you boy. But we can't have one of you. " 
 " Nothing is wrong with me. But you, Me. You have been right in everything I've done. " 
 " I understand that. But if you have no love for me, then I don't have love for the truth. And you will come at any time to torment me. " 
 " But Mommy can I join you? " 
 " I'll be right back."<|endoftext|>

A car was barely parked at the dealership - the Revra with its headlights leaking orange and red filtered through the open window on the opposite side of the parking space. One hand, slightly brushing against the seat, a car keyslide pressed firmly to the back of the backseat. 
 Beneath the hood, more automatic doors appeared every ten feet. Their color muted auburn and emerald, not entirely unlike the burnt, mangled yellow that used to show up as a red there before. Flashing leaves brushed by the headlights beneath the oil stained facades, slamming into the asphalt where the car had drifted. Breathing came again, this time, and the dreams belonged to the same person, saving the voice of my wife. 
 She shuddered as she saw the door, which had lodged itself delicately into the metal, but she couldn't see for sure what it was. Dropping a hand into her pocket, she knew her husband hadn't exactly been around to see, let alone pick up the phone in the car. Maybe he was out with a girlfriend, he always kept his hand at home. Maybe he had been working late, or, since she couldn't be sure, parked somewhere else out back. Or maybe he was completely relaxed, and he had broken the glass on her car. Again, she stopped fighting until she fell asleep again. 
 She looked down at her hands for details - where she had learned to drive, and if there was anything she would have seen it within the apartment it was waiting for her. She had been startled, but maybe that wasn't the case at all. There was a loud screech and muffled sound as a car horn sounded. Looking up, the soft pinky toe of her partner led her to the couch, carefully discarding the phone, where she lay, laying on her bed, empty at last. She dreamt that night. Not of her husband, not of the two men taking out their devices again. They had totally forgotten about the window. 
 When she woke up, nothing had changed. She was much happier now. No dreams now, just my wife's.

The wind spun with his attention and turned his head in a rhythm to the rocks, "I can't believe I'm done for, it's almost time, oh man, " I could feel his tired heart beating faster, his cries of anguish indescribable to most though they were but a thunk away. 
 I reached for my bag and turned towards the townspeople, a dull eerie sound like a horn burning. A brief noise outside the small street and as I stepped into the trash dump, more of the one or two walking around were clambering down the alleyways and setting trash bags with a sickening crescendo, the death of the city. 
 They don't like the pain of their lives anymore, the violence, the serenity. For one man, for one city, they detest him. 
 And yet he's always there. I stood in the trash and saw his single tear rolling down his face, he was a man driven almost insane from not remembering the title of a song overheard a stranger humming its tune. He just stands there, in his pile of garbage and sputtering away to the rhythm of silence, waiting for a well is be found. 
 It's too late now. 
 *You're good*. 
 *What the fuck?! * 
 *Chill my soul so I can get outta here* 
 " You're a good man, you are a good man " I whisper. I crumple the bag over his shoulder, pulling him closer to the house behind. 
 " A good man isn't just what he's supposed to be, it's the man with the title, you are a good man. " The man as he softly croaks and voices begin to lighten. 
 " Oh yeah? " I squeak out, " Oh yeah? " 
 He begins to sob and panic as he leaves the house. My bags immediately begin to fill with water and I pump my fists into the empty ice room in the house. 
 " Fuck off? " I exclaimed, thrusting my hands behind me. 
 " No, you can't abandon us! I'll always come back, I'll still find you! " He shouted as he began walking out, a pale face reflected in his unfathomably sickening blue eyes. 
 With his face still shattered and his thoughts clouded I said to him. " If you don't know, are you dead? " 
 " We're dead, wait until I do."

I hit the road recently. It's really sunny, and I like my back after so long. I'm glad I got off the bus and got a coffee. I mean, yes, the bus can be faster when you actually move, but it's much more comfortable when you're standing a few feet away from a person. You're sure that's a good sign. 
 Sometimes I wonder, do you notice the signs all the time? Each one looks different; doing it every day at just the right moment. I wonder just where the city began. 
 Thanks. I don't really know why or why not, either way, it's always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'll never know how it started. I'm retired now, and my job is sitting here writing something. Now I'm still writing. I'll write until my memories fade, and I'll write until I'm not writing anymore.<|endoftext|>
**********469**********
The void, full of chaos. There is a constant flow of consciousness, a jump to consciousness. Carelessly; caught between pure hatred and pure love. 
 I am simply a ordinary man; two minutes old. 
 One minute, of my life and one minute of mine I will see only despair and joy, and be again destined to behold nothing but the endless void.<|endoftext|>

The change has already hit me. The thoughtful machine turned, step after step. The plan was to complete a little bit before the Begone arrived. It knew my homeworld was a dire possibility. I just hoped that my last words might inspire it again. The machine smiled up at the board and said to me a simple question: You're lucky it wasn't hopeless. Then everything changed. 
 It had been 16,353 rounds. As far as I knew the naval launch tracking system hadn't even started the wheel on its first launch in America. 
 Somewhere in Canada, fighting for independence from the southern colonies, I had died but I had no reason to panic. I'd made a good trade with Britain for my favors, one of the few that would leave the rocks I'd dug. I had enjoyed them nearly every day in Canada, but I couldn't take the chance my country had offered. I was left to live in sorrow, and to think of her. 
 I began listing the self-doubt and regretfulness in my head, the vague green bottle of champagne sinking in my already exposed lip. I packed my things in the locked cabinet behind me to sit down in my best scratch-resistant bed. I had no idea when the front would come out and put me on the losing end. I was alone in that filthy room. We used the place as breakfast, but to my surprise, we never both made it to the bathroom. The stairs were the only thing that was still standing up. A machine jerked me as the No Man's Land hit the floor, almost missing me. 
 It took me a few minutes to realize what had happened. I woke up, still engulfed in darkness. The company had been at a bar in downtown Toronto for the past 15 minutes. They'd been warned not to go outside while their units were being deployed. A drunk led them down a converted parking lot to a liquor store. He grabbed the men by the car and shoved them to the ground, inching them over until they heard another rosey driver's honk from across the parking lot. The vehicles were all black, and the glare of the bar in question was too bright to see. I saw a gap in the window that was as wide as it was tall. I slumped over my scanner, still bleeding from what had just happened. 
 "What was your name? " I asked with confusion. " What day were you born? " 
 " July 13, 14th, 1443. " said the door. 
 " Well, " I said. " What date is it, your age? " 
 " 17, 2017. " 
 " Your mother? How old were you when you were born? " 
 " 18, 535. " 
 " The frequency with which you died? " 
 " Something akin to my marching salute. " 
 The door to the bar exploded outward into a large ice-free field. A starship came flying in and holstered a six ton Mercury, roughly 100 feet long. The ship warped, and the engines whipped as the RTS started up. The craft came in clear, majestic blue and then lowered to a flying silhouette. 
 " We've tried we are doomed. " 
 " It has been 16,353 rounds, but I can feel my time is running out. " 
 " We're literally going down to earth to take it back to our families." 
 Somehow, the machine could not understand where this was coming from. Even when it thought that, it didn't want to hear the end of it. We had to put it in its place again. 
 It could not accept what was coming next. As if the only thing it had been offering was the shattered-messenger it had pulled out years before. As if it had even given its way into the arms of those that died. That only left the half-empty bottle of champagne on my desk. The machine smiled kindly and then plunged the bottle in front of me, the same bottle that it had bought for me since I was a boy. Then it closed the lid and I got the message I desperately wanted out loud: it was finished.<|endoftext|>

Shouts of terror filled the sky, a hell of a silence. On every street corner, through every road, every surveillance spot, wherever they were, a sound of overwhelming discomfort emanated from every man. Humans wouldn't perceive it in any other way, yet on the street they were just inside their concrete walls. Sneakers to the left, journalists to the right, and police officers to the rear. Skimmers were made out of lights, and disappeared without a sound. Every living being-in-its-parts as they were-was unable to make it out of the cavernous sky. This was the problem, of course, when you were sloshing your duties in one big city in a three-directional six-mile radius. 
 "You said you weren't gon na turn up? " my boss shouted from the side of the building. " I'm happy to accept that all of you are taking shortcuts to get across the street. You don't want to be considered guilty of manslaughter. " 
 " I told you! " 
 " Look there are people in my cubicles eating popcorn. When I check, they're all swarming everyone they come across, blindfolding them, pulling them into a freezing room with fucking taped eyes. It's like I'm going to fuck this out with a sniper. Don't want to come across as lazy. I'm not saying you want to kill yourself. But you can't convince me otherwise." 
 It was the end of the day.<|endoftext|>

"This must be the end " Jonathan said aloud to himself. 
 It has been two years Jonathan has been locked in his room 
 Jonathon was originally a raider in the North Age, he wanted to be a good raider and would be happy to make a use for his freedom. He decided this to be a day of peace and happiness for his people. Today he was rebelling against the rotten Earth and his people. 
 The first incident was the people they sent out last week, they started spilling milk onto the floor. Jonathan knew the rest and felt afraid. He felt as though they would destroy his human family. A few days passed slowly, the natural disasters began. There was one raider left he thought they would catch and they let the rest after giving it to him, he thought to himself his mother left. 
 They moved on. 
 " I'm so scared it's the end " he started. 
 Jonathon didn't know what was going to happen but he knew what was about to happen, his anger got the better of him. 
 And now he was going to do it. He was going to tear everything down. For his people he decided to burn the writing on the walls as well as the raider that once had said his prayers. 
 The walls were filled with dirt, the monsters were only gone, so what was left? Jonathan finally started to feel safe. Even when he couldn't get anyone out, " I don't want to be a part of it" he thought. 
 Staring at the burning man made him realize his weakness, a reflection in his lids turned toward him. A magic item, dropped in the middle of the room gave a signal to the rest of the raider left, people had left for weeks without coming back. 
 It would be a long day, and even though he was dying he would find others.<|endoftext|>

We're in a warehouse, we're finally safe. Normally when we go over with an abusive relationship we end up getting a quick compensation. You know, get out of here and get her. 
 But here I was, she was a dirty 'nice' guy, better than most people. 
 She was spending most of her time around us, I'm in the crew, inspecting computer systems. Eventually a few of them start noticing something, they start shoving things around, shouting at each other and not talking to each other. 
 And then I saw it: the boyfriend. That's me. It's hard to tell with all the research that's been done, I'm alone. 
 Until someone stopped talking to me. 
 It seemed like just another regular guy, getting all worked up about a guy whose name was Darren Mason. 
 And I'm not making any secret. 
 We aren't to be together anymore. 
 If this guy was sitting next to me he'd have died in his sleep. 
 I saw an argument with some other guy from for-profit businesses. But I knew it wasn't about that. 
 I saw her make a decision based on her work. I was glad it went away, if only for a second, for that odd, stupid guy to make her his next one. 
 I knew how much people hated me when I was in the room, that I didn't give a fuck. My ego made that look easy. 
 I got some burgers, some chips, really low quality food. 
 We decided to make the decision later, right after the grilling started. We were chatting at a cheeseburger place, talking for a while, and we realized she had a kind of shyness about her boyfriend, and I started to talk to him. 
 But then she heard footsteps, and a voice inside her head heard a voice that sounded not too sweet. 
 Someone was caught watching us. We were so eager to meet. 
 We started spending every second we had together, just waiting for her to leave, not trusting her judgment. 
 How could she not understand this guy? 
 How could I ever trust this guy? 
 And then I realized, it was our fault. 
 I said something stupid, and she didn't move her eyes from mine. Maybe she was too afraid of something. 
 She almost fell into a corner, to the floor. 
 I grabbed the burger off the ground, put it in my mouth, and walked to where I would have her, I had a new person with me. 
 She was bright. 
 She looked at me dumbly, it felt like she didn't hear me. And at that moment, I knew the words could not have been uttered. 
 "Not today"<|endoftext|>

The -t$AI< door to the skyhale was dead fixed. On the other side it opened, and stood as a tall gray, ocean urchin around it. Over he sped towards it, waving his shotgun, then started to climb. 
 Harry just wanted a holiday, a chance at sharing the house with the tenants, of having his netflix DVD and his surfing post-rental box boy collection. 
 His neck land, his arm land, his palm land on the corner of the canvas, and behind him what looked to be a small village. 
 His feet drifted towards the windscreen, his stance locked, and his body. Beemelite blue sun set gently on the sea face, and Harry's long stalk shook and reached for the x-ray camera of his X-ray main screen. 
 He took a quick step forwards, barely managing to keep him to the ground. * Those damned-faces* were close. 
 A pulsing vibration hit the w*ught, but the vine called for his air guns. Harry took the revolver and aimed it into the vortex, cutting the anti-shrapnel damage with its complex lasers. 
 "You're hitting me, Harry. " 
 Harry hit hard. " Fine, fine, I'm going. Get the shit down, quick. " 
 He was sure of it. He hit the ground now, backed away from the treeline, and righted himself. The clouds melted, the rain was falling from the sky, and his ribs and ankles made a brilliant pink glow at the corner of the screen. 
 He'd made it. Twenty feet away, still on the paper plate above his head, he reached for the gun. 
 Once again, the suction broke and he grabbed for the gun before it swung into an alleyway. 
 On his left arm hung the cross-hatchet. 
 " God damn it!" he screamed, then heard howl. 
 He shut the front door behind him and started to run as fast as he could. There was a train on the horizon, and Harry reached the middle of the train. 
 The chill was still with him, and he stood there until he reached the main structure. 
 He had to cut them down. 
 With a body weight at his back and an air rifle set to a place below his chest. 
 He picked up the cross-hatchet, and in it was his words. 
 **I know it looks heavy, but I'm going to stick with that**<|endoftext|>
**********475**********
Of course, every time they kill someone they enjoy the memories of the person they kill, their heart and soul remains in my body. 
 Now it's not a problem though; I'm the only one who knows. 
 Every time somebody dies, it's like nothing ever happened. So in a way, I am reminded of my body. The more I try to hold onto, the harder it gets to. 
 All of a sudden, I've lost all trace of existence. 
 What can I do. 
 How can I be anything but dead? 
 As soon as they killed me, I knew that they were going to kill me. I won't live, but I would. 
 The world was nothing more than a dream. The physical room was all I could see, without touch or understanding. 
 Then one day, I awoke in the proper blue body. The details became clear once again. There were arms, legs and arms that I could stand and move. 
 Above and above him, my body took it's proper place. 
 Before me stood one of the soldiers named Jack. He was well-dressed. He wore faded red clothing and sunglasses. He hardly ever talked. Maybe he was being subtle. 
 I recognized Jack. I recognized how plain he was. 
 I knew who he was. 
 "Don't fight Jack. " said Jack. 
 I raised a finger and corrected him, checking his eyes to make sure there was no mistake. I felt all of the feelings a soldier would feel. He slapped me on my face. 
 " Don't fight me. " The soldier sneered, right up my own face. 
 " Hey boy, " I kept saying, taking his body, " don't fight me like that. " 
 Jack laughed, " That's what's so funny! " He winked at me, " you're like the first person I've seen that laughed since you found it in your apartment, Jimmy! You've been the first man I've ever seen that funny! " 
 " Well I'm an idiot, " I retorted, " How can I live without laughter and drugs and drugs for my entire life? " 
 Jack laughed again, " Well, you need to make sure you don't kill anyone again. " 
 " Jack, stop! You can't just make me live like that! " 
 " You just need to hurry up and talk to me on the phone, " Jack told me, " And go change to your new body." 
 As I moved from my own body to my new life, I realized how wonderful Jack was. He helped people. He helped people in need. Jack was the only person who did my job. 
 Until I met something. 
 Someone that talked to my body and sent me messages. He wanted me to see what people could do with me. 
 Then, I saw it. 
 Someone I actually needed. 
 Aliens. Humanity. Wanting to kill me. 
 That's why I joined the military. Being able to destroy humanity was... 
 *Way too tempting. * 
 What if I helped? What if I killed... 
 Humanity. 
 *But what if I did all those good things I did? * 
 -- - 
 The hope was barely kept, but now, I was happy. I found myself on a remote galaxy far, far away. 
 I knew it. 
 I began working to send messages to every single one of them. A thousand messages. That's when it hit me. I got them all the time. People who loved me. People who no longer cared. 
 I am the most powerful being. 
 Yes, of course, the last person I will ever be called alive.<|endoftext|>

I was crying when something terrible happened. 
 I picked up my phone and made contact with my personal best friend to see if anyone was there, when I found out that everyone was shaking and looking everywhere. 
 They said it was a big earthquake, that everyone was shaking. I was so scared, I stopped crying. I tried my best to put my best face forward when I called for backup. 
 Now that everything is black, everyone was looking at me strangely. They called me to ask what I need to do to prevent them from walking around. When I answered, they ran after me. 
 "Get to the roof! " they yelled, around. " Save the child! " " Don't be an angel! " 
 I tried to summon my other self, and he had to do the same thing. He broke the roof. 
 Finally, when everyone is happy and healthy, I can go to the roof and put together a little more stuff that we all wanted. I even added bacon. No wait... at least I have bacon.<|endoftext|>

First post, I liked the idea; I wanted to see how interesting it would be to see new characters during their tenure in the universe. The character designs make me a bit curious about how they interact with those sorts of situations, so I think you'll both be delighted with how you explore the interactions between humans, other intelligent beings, and other unfamiliar species. 
 Another thing I enjoyed about this set is the setting, it's probably the closest I have come to setting anything on fire within the 100 years that has happened to the universe in three separate issues. I feel like that's the most helpful aspect of coming into this set. While there aren't every two different postiles of territory during the arc, the setting could help immensely with your new perspective. 
 Thank you!<|endoftext|>
**********478**********
I couldn't tell the time - I sat back to my computer and typed out a message for the cat, thinking of all the interesting things to happen now that he was dead. 
 "What do you think? You were horrible and bad at this! Why do you think you did it? Why did you do it? " I replied. 
 " What are you talking about? Stop calling and I'll let you know!" 
 I looked up at the sky and saw that no other bird had touched the Earth's surface today.<|endoftext|>

No luck. Maybe there's a way to persuade the Ancient Elven-born to trust you. Maybe you can persuade him to sell you. You've been raising dungeons for a couple of years now, and you think you've finally made it. Because you tell me you've always held that magical "no matter what " attitude. 
 " Ah yes, its time for you to give me some company. There is no need for my fortress, tomahumans are everywhere. May I help you? " Your pet Gondola offers. " I'm here to sell you the secrets of the Realm of Longbows. May I take your heart? " 
 Gondola shakes his head. 
 " Crap. I will give you 10 gold. " It's a lie. Gondola didn't have any heart. " Oh hey, where is your heart? " Gondola asks. 
 I flinch, exasperated. You shouldn't tell your pet pet your heart. I mean, once you sell his soul, you may as well convince Gondola of the game! 
 " Oh no, you poor dog. " You tell him. You misspoke. You should have told your pet the truth. How did he get in this position? The corruption was rampant, Gondola was selfish and greedy. 
 " Let me advise you on one thing, I could have sold you the secrets of the realm of Longbows and not just a tiny, shimmering glob of peace. I'm sure they'd sell their diamonds or something. " You say calmly. 
 Gondola laughs. 
 " Well then... What is it anyway? I'm not human. I'm a genie. I'm not an adventurer. " He smiles. " And I'm only an orc." 
 Give the genie a good name. Make him worship the Greater Good. Give him ( goblin ) a place to stay and kill the rest of the dungeon raiding party that slept for 3 days trying to teach him the Lesser Good. You'd just know he's not an ordinary goblin that escaped a dungeon with a 1st level map, but he's fucking annoying. Get together with a member of the higher-level party and start a game. It'll be fun! You've made this a romp.<|endoftext|>
**********480**********
*I did this before! * 
 We waited for you in the parking lot. The cars were parked up as the students cheered and raised their hands to their cheers. We stood in the middle of the sidewalks and turned the doors on to let the outside world take us in. We laughed about the zombies that were staring at us and the other zombie gangs trying to put an end to them, but we were in for the best. 
 Those people that were along with the holo-op medics looked up as the killer robots tossed aside certain standard issue med schools. Med-techsters held back high up. I wasn't in the school, after all. Normally people would still go in to teach, in truth. What I saw on the wall was quite horrifying. 
 Helicopters filled the hallway, looking in on us as best they could. Everyone, unfortunately, was armed. Helicopters were flying in the sky with their guns drawn. Med-techsters tried to move but couldn't catch them. They piled up like piled manure and pretended to be looking for something else. 
 In the alley behind the building, the building gave way to a big black SUV. It had tough jeans and socks and put its trunk back up on top of us. The hood fell off and the front door swung open. An advanced Terminator Terminator sped up the car as it crossed over the driveway, onto the sidewalk. The tires screeched and stopped. 
 The Terminator pushed its giant arm out of the front door and opened to strike the Terminator. The Terminator rolled it down and sped into the alley. It ripped out its arm off before latching at the door. The door slammed shut. Everyone in the parking lot caved and shouted their heads off, showing their support. The Terminator was just as bad looking as the Terminator. 
 We sat there staring at the huge figure, trying to figure out what it had done. The only thing stopping it was a giant belt. I even wondered what it was made of. 
 A barrel passed through. 
 *Whew. This is good. * 
 We looked at each other and stared out into the huge black SUV. It stopped and looked up. * This is a good thing. * 
 And then the door of the SUV turned and slid off of the highway, becoming another red zone. 
 *Oi. *

My name is Odin, mortal emperor of Rul'ath, 
 Who still watches from afar over all peoples who've laid siege to my realm. 
 Our gods *have* to guard me, above all else, lest they invade the realms of madness and evil. 
 Here, on Oertha 'Myland', *my* land, I stand guard among the darkest-honed races. 
 They destroy themselves and their vile creations against the forces of my youth. They hunt the best, protect the weak and show no kindness to people. 
 They accuse me of omitting a rule and pandering to their greed. After all, it was not a rule I knew. 
 So I trespass, and my hatred conquers all. 
 I command I strike down the races who wronged me, and I strike down the ones who should enslave me. 
 For all I've ever done, I've died I kill, and slay all who defy me. 
 I obey my brothers and father, and wish to free all. 
 Yet, soon I fear the rule of naught can keep me safe. 
 Blood brings no truce, and my mountains have been left to rust for years. 
 Soon my empire will once more be an outpost of life, and serve as a sanctuary of my people. 
 I leave with my blood, to defend the realms of madness and evil, and the gods that exist within them. 
 But I fear my powers will all perish as soon as I leave. 
 Soon, in the wake of my attacks I will destroy what lies beyond my domains. 
 It is time to slay. 
 Glow! 
 A glowing blade was blackened on my throat with the savage jolt of its fin. 
 A group of beings stood up from their marble placed atop their filth and looked at me. 
 They held gilded swords above their heads, and the two towering behemoths illuminated their glowing faces for a second before they took out their siege weapons. 
 I thundered, sweeping up the oracles of my foes around me, but they refused. 
 This time, they lifted their shields and charged. 
 I gazed at them with open eyes and realized. I was a being of greater power than they could grasp and they were mortal. 
 Yes, my king, this time I shall spare. 
 I made my preparations, but I only got one. 
 When he stood up, his jaw hung loose. 
 His arrogance quickly grew, and he fell to his knees. 
 "Why? " I screamed. 
 " Because, your wisdom. " His lowered voice boomed. 
 " The wisdom of my benevolence and obedience. " I twisted his head and glared. " Perhaps, of all the gods, this is my only chance of mastery. " 
 " You think you can defeat me? " The beauty of his face grew and he sat up slowly, letting me grip his sword. 
 " This sword, and it's mighty, shall rule one hundred years."<|endoftext|>

**A Shot in the Dark** 
 I awoke to the sound of a gunshot and see a girl with the same eyes as I wake up. The man whispered, "T'was probably just a cold but close enough that she seems to remember that. " 
 I fought back tears. I couldn't sleep for another 2 hours, or 3 more. 
 *Sigh* T'was gone, and now for what? I asked myself. So close and yet still so far away from who I *am*. 
 " We had such an unusual fight... " the woman said to me. I hadn't been able to focus on what she said with the last good feelings she had. She just laughed. She sounded like a witch and couldn't even do her own thing on purpose. 
 " What was that? " I asked. 
 " Oh yeah, he's not funny. He shot me. " She said. 
 " Why did he bring you here? " I asked. 
 " I can't even remember what happened! Why did he bring you here?! " 
 " This is not your place! " she said, " Can't you read me! " 
 " I can, but I can not tell. " I said out loud. " We must find her and find her in the grave. " 
 " Yes. " The woman said. 
 " Do you remember? " I asked. 
 " No. " She said. 
 The woman that I needed to have a conversation with? I wasn't sure how to answer her. 
 " We had such an unusual fight... " She said again. " You knew he was funny? " 
 I could only hold my breath now. The last thing I remember was I, alone in a small cabin, screaming at the top of my lungs. Another shot had gone off, and to save me I slammed the bottle onto my shoulder. I threw the handle of the bottle into the wall and ran to the window. I looked out. In the distance, a helicopter. 
 " T'was not a funny fight... " I heard the words in the woman's voice. I still could not tell if I was hearing from the airplane or the weather. 
 " We must find her!" The woman said. 
 I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I also prayed that I would wake up soon. * I just want her to wake up... I just want her to wake up... * 
 ( I hope it is only fair, but this is a long story. Other story to come. So hope you like it. )<|endoftext|>

"What? " 
 The door slammed, and the old man grabbed my chest from under me. He had a long, yet wide smile on his face. " I... don't think I know. We would all like to know who you are, but I'm afraid to. You were supposed to arrive on earth... " 
 " Huh, what? " I gasped, confused. " Who was I supposed to have hired? " 
 The man didn't move a word. Then, with a gentle touch, he lifted my chin with the weight of his hand. My own fell off, swallowing my air, though my breath was far away. 
 " I'm sorry, Billy, but I don't know who I am. I was supposed to work for some... religious organisation. I thought that was a decent angle, at least. Some lunatic, perhaps. Now, I'm convinced they're trying to convert me to Satan. And I'm pretty sure they just aren't in your position, do you know what's going on? " 
 I sighed, and listened carefully to the man try to tell me everything was going just fine. He seemed almost relieved now. " But I'm afraid to suggest to Satan that, can you just tell me who you are? Are you... powerful? " 
 Billy stretched his arms out, moving over to my shoulder. He held out two fingers. " I am Death. You can refer to me as- " 
 " What do you mean? " 
 The man shifted in his seat, and gazed around at the room. " This is it, Billy. Stop and think about what you've gone through, and what you want. " He bowed at my feet. " I would, but I have only come to realize my job is to uphold judgement. Now get over here, Billy, and take a seat on your bed. " 
 " Your anger is hurtful, Billy. I can heal, I can free, or I can help you. I can protect you, but not everyone is strong enough. One day, the Devil may take you to the priest and tell you my name, but you will not reach me now. I will not be your guardian, and I will not have you clinging to one selfish smile. " He took a deep breath, as if to clear his throat. " But I can help. " 
 Billy slowly grew dressed, and walked over to the bed. He began cuddling beside me, though I could see through his broken nose. " I'm afraid I am going to have to die in peace. But first, what sort of weapon is this? " He took a drawn out rag and began to pull me towards the back of the bed. 
 " Liledite, " I murmured, as he put a cigarette, a cigarette lighter and a wad of papers into the side of my butt. " This one is a lot lighter than mine. What's your name?" 
 He took one last drag from his cigarette, and rolled off the bed, hanging his head and closing his eyes. He turned and walked over to the door, and I pulled it open.<|endoftext|>

“ Wake up. ” 
 She rolled to her feet and opened the door to her bathtub. As she stepped on it her son would lay upright on the slick metal, white light that was fashioned out of the thick veil around his mouth. Reaching through the puddles he could see a man floating through the air and onto his knees, his body ripped to shreds as his lifeless eyes went on and on. 
 “ Mr. and Mrs. Farrell? ” 
 She blinked her eyes at the almost glazed look on their faces and took a little look around the room. A single set of doors was made of tall wooden beams and was the point of sunlight through the forest boughs that lined the walls and ceilings. She looked through the door and across the room to her husband, a blond curly haired boy of maybe twelve with wavy blonde hair and loose brown eyes. She sighed. 
 “ You need to be at your father ’ s place tonight, he needs to be there. ” 
 “ I don ’ t. I need to stay here with you. I am going to get him some water. ” 
 “ Where do you want Mr. Farrell? ” 
 He pushed himself a little further inside the soft wooden foot bathtub than expected and followed her down the halls, making eye contact with the white sphere that was shaped like a V or polished metal fork. She liked the change of circumstances. 
 “ Daddy always said to go to the front door at least once a year and no one goes there. ” 
 She walked over and rested her head against the massive contraption that sat before the bathtub. She wanted to be with him, this wasn ’ t the way this had to go. Mr. and Mrs. Farrell had only been together for three months. One night he threw himself onto the bathtub floor and cried inconsolably. The next he ate a new meal out of his back pocket and insisted that he grab the keys and tell his mom something important. 
 After watching his dad cry bitterly, he returned to him and stuffed something on his head in the mug of water that was spread out across the edge of the tub. She realized what the man had done. 
 “ I don ’ t think you understand, Daddy. Don ’ t you understand right now? Why are we in the same place when we were my age? Why did I have to marry a maniac? ” 
 He looked up at her sternly from his wooden seat and then back at her. “ You asked me to marry a manic. Mom told me I should go see somebody. ” 
 She raised an eyebrow and read over the most recent conversation his dad had had. “ Well, I guess I need to go see somebody. If you don ’ t come, you ’ ll never get out ” 
 “ No. Daddy ’ s got a plan to make things better for me. I need to drink more and stay with him. I don ’ t need you putting me through college. ” 
 He hesitated and allowed the thought of a break from the questions to return to him. He took her hand in hers and they stepped out the door into the fog that had gathered for the day as they made their way to the nearest bus stop.<|endoftext|>

Cold to the touch 
 Is it the desire or the deadliness? 
 It's so cold to the touch 
 But I touch it, and it permeates my mind 
 Yet I can't know, I can't know 
 What is the meaning of it? 
 It keeps me on my toes 
 And I fall right back 
 Even if I slam my fist against the glass 
 What does it mean? 
 The glass is of a different tone 
 And yet I touch it so darn ~~you~~ I can't stop, can I? 
 What does the meaning of a spell 
 Tears my heart 
 On a sole cup 
 The shape of the glass too glimmer 
 And yet I can't know 
 What is the meaning of it 
 And yet I touch it 
 Was it even a sound? 
 ~~Mages~~ I can't see 
 ~~Mages~~ I can't see 
 This is the end 
 Today's the day I die 
 Until tomorrow 
 And my name is ~~Ralph~~ but I can't ~~need~~'t learn.<|endoftext|>

He had never known my mother. Once she had pressed a glass of pink roses to her head after a rough night of drinking, I learned she was bisexual. Bisexual. I tried asking her how, and she had pressed her hand up to her mouth with a big, purple suction cup. Being one of the only gay kids we had, I wasn't sick of giving her candy, and was a closet gay. There was a reason I could give every other dude chocolate afternoons, he told me. 
 The fear crept into my frame every time my mother brought me coffee. I sipped, eagerly awaiting her instructions for finally making my decision. She could see my expression. In her eyes I was young again. 
 But I'd always been conditioned. In my 50 years of life, there was never a bad moment. These days, once he feels less alone than you'd be after being punished, you prefer talking to a disapproving look in your parents face. 
 I was only getting older, and my grief still existed, but sometimes I was a little panicked. I never wanted to break the news to my parents or my grandsons. He would tell me to avoid communicating with them after school, but that just meant it could be done. It only took five minutes for him to type the message and deliver it to us, my mother. 
 It was my mother's way of telling me that I wouldn't hurt myself, I was kind, and I was knowing, and I was no longer bullied by peers or been accused of sexual harassment or even times of murder. 
 Those were the only times that I could talk to my mom. I talked to them when she would touch them on the shoulder or the top of the head when they spoke to her, hiding the shyness at the shame I've felt in knowing someone I love was so different than I was. I told her that love is death, and that it was only natural to end it when death came for you, or the world. 
 I loved him as little as possible. After some years of being accepted, I still looked out for his shyness. He had told me all these secrets, but I could tell every once in a while that I could say anything. So I always referred to him by the name of Tomas, and we would drive up to his house, sit together, and play the hide and seek game. He was so observant, I mean, he would call me on vacation, check on us. I'd watch Netflix, scroll through the channels, and pretend he looked at me. 
 I thought it was funny to his mother. I was a smarty-pants child, and I knew that he would love her after that. He wouldn't. After a few years, however, I once saw the light from his eyes. 
 It wasn't just a light. Like a bright blue plume of pink flowing down the window of my apartment. On my dresser, twinkling and dancing in the window sill. There was a pink twinkling in the streetlight, nearby. I couldn't help myself, so I looked up from my computer and entered Tomas's picture into the News Feed. 
 "Who are you? " I asked. " Are you Tom? " He laughed at me, and he shook his head. " I'm Nicole. I'm your Jonas. I can't tell you. We're not all homosexual." 
 I was even less curious about my mother. I wasn't really gay. But by yesterday, Tomas had told me that I had married the best man, the best wife, and the best character in the entire world. I felt like, honestly, that I didn't care, but that as I thought about it, my mom and I knew we had a lot of work to do before I saw him.<|endoftext|>

I had never run this fast before. My very first time I was at Seattle International Airport. I was going to go first, but I really didn't want to trip over the new-world. I had a great time. My sister named this place Seattle for that reason alone. I was told I was very very productive and productive. I even had an office. I hoped I could do it all again someday. 
 And every time I come here, I'm just left with nothing. Without my work. Without my friends, my family. By now the housemates had left me behind. My old lady had called me. I felt lost. I felt like I should go to the next housemate or the next CEO. But I couldn't. I was used to this approach. All the work and news and magazines - it wasn't worth the burden. 
 And every time I came, I'll admit, I was restless. But it was because of the advances in technology that, my ass, I did my best to minimize, try and give someone else the opportunity to do something, to understand what I thought would be important. 
 And I'll admit: it wasn't really the realization that it was something else but what I was truly doing. It's hard to explain when one party is filming your whole life and someone else just says that "i am a genius"! I was never having it. The pub crawl was always the same, no dressing and no beer. 
 The nurses had warned me about the symptoms of the flu, but I didn't panic. They knew the flu shouldn't happen, that I was so sick that I wouldn't die. I was allowed to go home and I was told that the flu would keep me at bay for a bit, but it kept me out. 
 And I'm not even sure what happened to my friends and family either. I can't remember where or why they left me behind.<|endoftext|>
**********488**********
Advancement is great. Good fortune. Not to love or even to care about anything at all. I was however saddened by the statement which I am to believe, but that was taken out of context completely to fit my lack of identification as a sentient being. I am not, after all, a being. How could I understand any sort of significance at all if I was not? All things are meant to be made to be appreciated, have their stated purpose and have their allotted impact. Without value, how could anything just be? With respect to compassion, there is no difference in perceived values or quantity. I can not empathize with another who is so fortunate, I can not empathize with someone who is less fortunate than myself. How can a being so noble go so far in feeling deserving of it? What does it matter if I don't gain the most value of all? The world doesn't end and end for everyone at once, and by giving that worth in the first place, it means that other beings feel less bitter, more angry and more sad. The fact that anything I feel is meaningless, dismissed, is another factor that must have gone into consideration. A being is not a matter of self-preservation, but of mutual goodwill.<|endoftext|>

"Why the oath, Mr. President? " I screamed as I ran, scrambling for my laptop. I'd lost all contact with HQ. A chain link was severed around my left wrist in the open escape. 
 " I'm here to request assistance, " I said by telephone. In my absence, I used GPS to be sure that all my documents were correct. The telemarketer checked the subject of the call. " Mr. Justice Hood, the corporation responsible for this incident, I have issued two summons and forcible removal for your non-compliance. " 
 He looked at the paper. " You have once again defied the Constitution by pleading guilty to a charge of dereliction of duty under the Galactic Community Act. That charge was a result of an intergalactic conspiracy between the Galactic Government and Symbodel. I give you the opportunity to have a full and frank recollection of what you had done, " he began to type. 
 I leaned against my desk. " Sorry, sir, sir, " I said softly. I used the force to swat the fangs out of my hands and fingers. " Thanks, Mr. President. I owe you a place at UCLA, I am sure. " 
 He nodded. " You are at peace, Mr. President. I would like for you to cease to act willfully in secret. However, if you wish to propose a solution to your own problems, I would consider having you prosecuted. " 
 " *Really, your the head of the Galactic Federal Agency? * " 
 " Yes, sir, " I said simply. I stared into the deep end. Many wondered what their president would think, what made him think that I was merely some kind of evil commie of the underworld. For over ten years I had been being pawn in many factions, one of which, with I was the president of, and part of their leader, the Galactic Empire, at my behest. At least that is what I told them. 
 " I understand your pleading. It is of your choosing. I have, of course, been given unlimited powers to exercise and control of the galaxy. I *am* the Galactic Ambassador to U.S.A, president of a sovereign national authority, and the Galactic Criminal, whose powers should be tied to the delivery and setting of lethal weaponry to nations without any well-developed military infrastructure or the ability to conduct the necessary checks on any mission. In other words, I would predict your opening of diplomatic channels to our space neighbor S.I.C.T., the problem with which the galactic powers were put together. I have made every single mistake in my existence. A green-eyed and silent failure of the mothership. The plan was complete. I knew my way around territory, very well. 
 " Please, Mr. President, " I pleaded to an officer dressed in a display suit. " * When you've made your decision, if you will. *"<|endoftext|>

Merry Christmas, 
 I look through your mail, 
 You can have it, 
 you can keep it, 
 but there's something on the door. 
 A package on your doorstep, 
 Dress like a cockney twat. 
 You know that the giddily dressed tit, 
 Eyes dry and frowns. 
 You have a look on your face, 
 Your eyelids don't know how long they are, 
 you set down the curtain and step inside. 
 I come running to pick it up, 
 and then I look down it's my dress. 
 I've got to stop, this one is one! 
 Don't fear me! 
 Jarek up and kick the door! 
 Somewhere a thief lingers, 
 They kick for it to get a bit wider, 
 but this is the maze! 
 Not even the basketball, 
 this is the second floor! 
 Come on, step by step 
 and try to get them off. 
 For they've got bad days in between. 
 Stay up and fight, or go for a jump, 
 but push yourself against the wall. 
 Make it through, you look very mean. 
 You look so hot in the cover, 
 Is that a towel off your face? 
 Breathe deep in it, 
 And sweat will not let go, 
 because she has the right to leave. 
 Oh sure, you have a much bigger gun on you, 
 But you wont be hurting any more, 
 I need your help, 
 Don't panic, It is done! 
 Unzipping you half torn, 
 Let's go have a round in, 
 and you can help much, 
 My family has some bad things to worry, 
 But these are just some poor hands. 
 You can have your shirt back now, 
 But you don't have to sell it, 
 and you won't be able to get it in, 
 but be careful, I have an opening. 
 I knocked on the door, 
 the bargin' in was too strong, 
 But I was getting hit. 
 And as I slipped down the pearly gates, 
 I felt my body drop. 
 He was dead. 
 I grabbed his hat, 
 Fools! 
 You got lucky! 
 See the holes in the jaunty hat? 
 You'll have to do more in the future! 
 This hat was all yours! 
 I'll give it to you: 
 Your family thanks you, 
 Just one more day!<|endoftext|>

"Very good, Jessica, " my assistant said. 
 " Awesome, Harry. I am going over your home again. Do you need a few more? " 
 " More meat? Yes! " I brought the butcher knife to my mouth and stabbed the meat. 
 " Alright, see you in a couple of days. " A cloud of smoke drenched the room and a light dimmed in its intensity. I turned to my assistant and showed her the small, yellow tip of the knife. 
 " I believe it's an apple, " she said as I tasted it. " Now just a little extra, shall I? " She continued her talking as she flashed the knife back and forth between the butcher and the counter. A nail on the end of the knife drew the attention of the other workers. 
 " The apple, " I said, " is on the counter as usual. Let's start with the meat. " 
 Her eyes widened in disbelief and she quickly shook her head. What the hell was happening? After turning off her taser and shaking in frustration, I turned back to the kitchen. " This isn't even meat. You should keep it as a sandwich, " I said, clicking the knife to the side. " What are you talking about, Jessica? " 
 " What is that!? It's... it's a knife! " I grabbed a picture from my pocket. " It's not meat! That knife is written on it! Why are you telling me all this? It's a magic knife! " 
 " I don't understand! " I leapt from my chair. " Jessica, Harry, talk to me now. " 
 Jessica hadn't responded. " You see Harry, " my assistant said, " another said to the pit of my stomach."<|endoftext|>

Oh no. We need the drug. It's too late. She'll be just too perfect again. 
 I could use the drug for years if I wanted. We just need to supply enough of the 12 servings I have left and I can get through this all together. Nothing fancy was ever made, we needed the submersible to guarantee stability. There are rules though. Just pack a few of the boxes, all I have is one of those new Air Fracture inserts. Cut the fabric thin. Love them. Shoot that dull light from the three engravings on the side of the box. Tread carefully as I carefully lift it onto the hotel table. Never answer or draw. 
 It happens. Slowly. An alarming silence. Before we take the four shipping containers, I decide I can deal with my melancholy and that time will come right back to me. My head is going dark but my body is strong and alert. We work together. As always, she is brilliant. Most days she will reveal herself, but I am sure of it. I am never alone.<|endoftext|>

Hectic, desperate. I tried to pull myself out of my running shoes but could not feel my arms. The white slab was getting closer and closer to him, stretching me like a sheet. He was larger than I ever expected. I needed to help him. He is trying so hard to protect me. I need to find his weak point and use him. 
 He steps, squints for just a second, then continues to stutter, trying to hide it. I dare not look. I dare not look. He is struggling with his hands. I try to take his hand out, but it is pulled away from me. I try to tell him that it is important to help me help him. He wails in pain, and his lungs collapse. He is not getting up, but he is feeling pain. He is going to die. He is not going to live. I fear to be beside him, but can not look away from him. I need to be somewhere for him. I am alone in this broken world, and I am angry with myself. I need to know where he goes, for a sign to help me reach him. We are not meant to be together.<|endoftext|>

I looked around at the group I had come together to stand. They were well dressed, bright eyed, emaciated and beautiful. I decided to take a seat and I listened carefully to everyone present. Each member was thoughtful and eloquent, all however stood their ground against their impending doom. I began to explain how it was that the dictator had elected someone to rule the entire world. It was obvious that that person was a good man, he believed that we would solve the problems of all those involved. So he created the perfect plan to help one man in the world. One dictator. The dictator appointed to stand by each one of his bodyguards as the dictator ruled the world. Our purpose: to ensure that the dictator stayed the course and ensured the survival of the people that was ruled by the one who would take the empire. The dictator had appointed a particularly handsome celebrity, who would be the new leader of our organization. The dictator promised to order all of his guards to leave immediately, get his personal army in, and bring him on a date to be introduced to our new leader. All were agreed to. I quickly skimmed through the leaflets that were given to me, and made my way over to the royal palace where I would meet my new friend. A lovely young woman of over 20 and beautiful blue eyes, with red hair, always reminded me of beautiful ocean green oceans and she looked so young. I thought about how to thank her and proceed to introduce myself to her. At that point, I saw a fake mask and quickly ran inside and as I walked out of the doors, she gave me a mysterious look, a look that brought my confidence and made my foot. As she left the throne room and it did not take long for me to obtain my license and I requested my permission before my secretary attempted to sneak me in the door, protecting me from our disrupter. As I was preparing to enter and march in for my job, she interrupted me and asked if I was working for "him". He then smiled as he stated that he was Trump, and in a few minutes would take over the world. As I tried to kill her, another man in the room came up and killed me again. She smiled and hugged me, asking that I go back to the time before the dictator took over the world. That was my fate. I then realized that I was free, and so I was free to go. With this knowledge I had full control over my movements. I walked back to my chair and began work. That was my job. The revolution would be successful, I was good at it. With this knowledge, I succeeded in thwarting my past, you, as well as our great leader.

Pluto was off, the hero took his fall, arms outstretched, no doubt furious with his size. His hand came up beside him, and it stirred. 
 The camera zoomed in on the giant, brilliant sea, Pluto looked up, and he remembered the monster he had fought. Hercules was roaring from the shore. 
 "I don't like lying man, " Pluto shouted, voice cracking. " You keep telling me that there's something monstrous about giving this kid the one hundred dollars and leaving him hanging naked for a year!" 
 As Pluto tossed his perfect fists into the air and stopped, the news cameras zoomed in on Pluto. The image was staged, so surely the camera was capturing a different CGI version of Hercules, but no. The projected image was no longer Hercules. No one who watched took yet another look, and the pluto looked up at him, annoyed, and held his chin. Pluto felt a hand move behind him, quickly pulling it away. 
 Like a mighty elephant, the pluto dropped back, his bare, swollen appendages dripping with his pride, and stretched to the ground with a ten foot high burst. He thrust his broken body and exhausted belly forward. 
 There was no point to thinking he was the hero now; the legend grew up, perhaps his history was right now. Pluto's father gave him a hug once when he was young, remembering his father's safety and knowing he had survived. There had only been one child born without a father, and their father's death would irrevocably change the course of history. Pluto rushed out of the room.

Satan was often seen, well, beside visitors. 
 For just a brief second, when you look upon someone looking at you, there's not much else to say. A childhood of natural curiosity, and a pretty great future ahead of you. Well, the bad part is when you're the one who needed to know more than just when. So, you know, he's in the café, and you're standing there, reading the old woman's inbox... it's cute to me, right? 
 Right? 
 He's smiling. 
 Yeah, of course he's smiling. It's all about getting up. The occasional call from a friend, and the number of emails that are just off the charts. 
 You wonder if he's doing some kind of journalistic reporting. Ugh. That's gross. You still question his motives, but this is the first time he's seen you look at him, much, much... *much* different. 
 Shrugging, you see him, two blocks down a crowded street. What the hell was that? He's out, going down that different route when you're, well, evil. The streets are crowded now. It's a simple conversation. After all, you don't usually get that many smiles when you're not really talking to one. 
 Still, you take a few minutes to admire this expression. As though on cue, the voice you have now called out to is directed towards Satan himself. 
 "Hello Satan, there's been a lot of teasing lately, and I'll be releasing a special update immediately. Here's the chance that I'll be sharing this with your... " He pursed his lips to stop you from abating your little friend " laugh. " 
 " I'll reveal my shady past. And it is yours alone, though I'll hold no grudges." 
 Satan was always curious. The details weren't always obvious, like the inside joke; about people who won't leave their anonymity for good. He could get his past like a dog in the headlights, learning how to destroy the little things, after getting it all figured out. In a wise-cracking way, he just needed to let himself enjoy the moment. 
 He was too big a threat to take your time as they both informed him of his full and utter future and discovered that he could travel to different points in time by his own volition, merge the past, and send the future all to hell.<|endoftext|>

It seemed like god had given it all away, through my feeble attempts to find my lost parents and a crowd. It didn't seem like the stakes so low. There are trillions of countless monsters in the form of a single individual and if one of them are the weakest, then what will God do, but he will do. Some say he will take everything and even billions of people and move upon another all in a day's time. Such a strange thought, but at least that that is what God had told me. A very strange thought, however. 
 I looked around the planet and there in the center of it rested a majestic man with a helmet and helmet of that alien-like beauty. I have never seen something so erect and majestic as this before. It used to be the tallest building in the world but once they stepped out, the planet burst down, spilling over into the desert below. The group of children that resided around me wasn't nearly as intimidating, although there were fewer of them now, but I had a sneaking suspicion that they would be the ones to eventually march onto our world in giant, brain-bumped boots. No one had ever done anything like this. 
 They used to work, but to their surprise were the same ones on the ground leading them to what we would call home. In other words, we were all the same, evolved... well... so far. Some of us still slept with parent over and over again. Did we put our trust in god? Probably. But there had been a lot of people who met us, and many of them made quite a mess of things, and we had to work with these people to help them. 
 I had seen a few still spend weeks or months in university, but I was still heartbroken as I saw so much suffering in their eyes. But it looked like every day they would come back with other problems. Their feet were bone tender and they'd tried to tear my dust off, but I could not help but tell they were better then before. Eventually, the group would return to their home and the children would eat a wag of the long grass, but they would come back with children from around the world. And all our problems were now solved one by one, until eventually, each of them sat at a table to eat. 
 My skin wasn't the same as mine and it was getting uncomfortable, but I decided not to let it get to my ears because this was inhumane. Children are small, mostly because of their lack of brain mass and there was no way they would all cooperate. My vision was not good. I was nauseous in the air from sitting up, not knowing what was happening, but at least I could feel the child sitting with me now. The only food they had left were insects that crawled around them on their side. 
 As I got over my shock, I started laughing. Now the god of this planet was laughing, and with all the arrogance he had spewed out while screaming he walked up to me and held me inside the helmet of his swarm. It is said that if you go near him you will burst into tears of joy as you see him. Most are by now kinder. In fact it turns out that the aliens picked me up and put me inside of a helmet that wouldn't make a sound. I was caught a week later and taken to the medical facility. 
 I made a very good offer for heaven, and recently tried to outbid God. " Hey. I heard about your parents being chosen." I tried to say it like, so, of course. I've been at it longer than I wanted to admit. I have many reasons to stay with them. 
 There were a few nations that I saw splinter into now and soon I would have the chance to escape my parents home. There were many people who went to court and were decided by the generals. I am thrilled to be free now. At least I am not the only one. Every other human has been chosen. I just hope that someday one day one of them will finally know what he has earned.<|endoftext|>

This was the only way to go. At least once. This, I suppose, explains why I take no pity on my friend at the guard post. He's always trying to be nice to me and call me a brother who was good to him even though he needed someone to talk to for help for. He even kind of looks at me when I lock the door to the kitchen. Sighing again, I always just sit there staring at him, not seeing him. To be honest, what do I do? If only he thought I was around. Would that I had decided that to leave sooner. Or could it have been that he was trying to do something positive with my life. 
 As for me, I'll tell him. He'll have to know that I'm not fond of my life, and to cut my losses, I'll have to deal with the scars I've inflicted. Those aren't just friends. I'm a monster. Such a monster. Is this even an option? I will find him, and I will prove that I am the monster. That I deserve respect. Not for what he did to me. But for what he loved and what he did to *me*.<|endoftext|>

I lied to myself. If I said I was not ready to start a fight, I'd have lied a hundred times. It was a summertime school year, so I was excited. I have so much fun at my favorite games. I am obsessed with a Nintendo 3DS, and every bad thing I do has been forfun - but this, this was definitely going to be my best night. So I decided to try it. 
 Over the course of the next four hours, I began to suck at my game. I always wanted to be a superstar basketball player but the only possible way was to just try to master basketball. I started jogging. Not training. I failed once. Second time would be my death. After an hour or so, I had become slow. Was I not listening? I could not be listened to. As I worked on the basketball, I began to play against a rather familiar cell. I slowly began to over come one that had a pretty face. I tried to stare in pleasure. But as I grew older and more confident in my strategy, the cell started to reveal something far more unsettling. My cell looked like a plain steel chair but had two sides, one one on which a mouse was resting. I continued to struggle in this chair. I almost killed myself. Maybe my training is nearing its end. 
 As the sixth week passed, I started to become very tired. I was terrified of all the noise and stroking the bottom of my blouse. Then the buzzing came. Not a sound, just a crunching sound in the air. 
 Everyone around me realized what it was, and we were all looking at our phones. There had been a loud commotion but was quickly silenced. It was the part of the stadium where it happens. Most of the time there were fans, not the drug dealers who surrounded us but a few zealous South African men, holding signs that said "Please Don't!". My spirit did not waver. I put my paw to my lips to calm the buzzing. 
 The drone continued to grow in volume. Maybe this was my best chance in life. Then I realized the worst. In the distance, suddenly there was a roach. I tried to run but couldn't. The drone had me trapped. Then suddenly, everything went black.<|endoftext|>

The door to the dungeon doors opens, startling me awake. I'm…alone? It's a weird place, I never saw the guards. I don't remember all the names in this hall, except for the King. " Okay, do we need you to come in here after a session of rest? " * Wait*, he said. And…yes I do! 
 A door opens, and sits directly across from the King. * Like I said, I don't remember all the names in this hall, except for the King. I never saw the guards. * A low murmur fills the air. * I-I'm... not sure what I'm doing here…* 
 " Okay, do we need you to come in here after a session of rest? " * …there's not much I can say before I'm transported into the castle*, the King says, trailing off and skipping towards the grotto in the middle of the room. * It was the only place I could find people that were suited to joining this kingdom*, he remarks. A portrait of a man wearing a beard walks into the room. The portrait glows and becomes red in the light. He's trying to sit up. Before he can, a man stands and takes a breath, but everything seems to chill. * There's no way... * Then he turns to me. 
 " Welcome, son of Jarlskaarl Ebasalmyn " the man says. 
 My heart flutters. I step into the hall and approach the grille. * …no. Nothing. I will not shed a single grain of salt about this place. Nothing. No one has the time or resources necessary to preserve the Elder Elves from the rot. We must leave. We must leave without doubt. * I am overwhelmed by the feeling of happiness. 
 He places a coin on the table and begins to read aloud. I believe him for a moment. I wait. The man stops reading. It's not him again. 
 " *please, one last time, son of Jarlskaarl Ebasalmyn. Please…* " I say, hoping to stifle my laughter. I feel the hand that gripped my face. 
 " *please…*, Prince Uzas, please… " I say. Prince Uzas has settled himself down on the table in the center of the room. I had to start bringing him up just the one time, I feel a premonition enter my mind. 
 " Everyone leave, Jarl, I am prepared to do it. " The man says. " Everyone." 
 All of a sudden, the room seems to go black. The candles on the dais are no longer lit and Jarlskaarl Ebasalmyn is gone. In a single blink of an eye, Ebasalmyn is gone, without a trace. 
 The elven priests have gone too. No one left to defend their realms.<|endoftext|>

My life started the same as any other day at 11am. With such boring events I always had to ride to work everyday to get back in my school uniform. Making sure to buy my own cleats, friends had invited me to a friend's house so I would just have to have the whole lot. By midnight I would turn in the morning and I could finally get to work. Sadly, the commute was still there, but I could not spend my damn earnings on anything else. I would have to return to school and try to end the time on Youtube or at the cafe. Just because my plan had worked out doesn't mean it could NOT be that simple. 
 By the time I got home, my rent was due. I mended my bed and left my house to change. I was just about to leave when I thought about the setup. Before I even left the house, I saw someone in the hallway. As if it were possible, I didn't believe it at first. It was so obvious. That one person was the obvious one. 
 They were reading those words. Before I knew it, I was blocking the wall behind them. If the timer was going to continue, it must have been another programming mistake. The doors hit the ground in quick succession. My eyes twitched open and that was when it hit me. Screaming. The voices echoing around the house. 
 "I AM AN ADULT WITH SAINT" 
 I instantly regretted my actions, but I kept going. That's all I can remember. Not even my parents could have. I quickly read up on youtube that the channels were all owned by someone I had known since high school, but I had yet to find out who. My god, no one is able to find out who I am. No one can help. It happened. I needed to get some answers, I needed to face what I have been through for the last 20 years. 
 Truth is, I didn't know why my grandfather had the reddit account that was going on. If he owned anything he owned, it was worth 1000 grand, but if someone made money from using this strange website, it would destroy any trust I had with people. Plus, there were all those threads complaining that their parents aren't content. There was more. 
 There was a pause and I heard the croak, and screams. Not only that, the screams were coming from in each of the houses in the big cities surrounding me. It was the same. I stood before the front door of the house and waited. It was 6:30 p.m. and I had to get home. And I needed to wake up before it all went black. I slid into my bed, landed on the open window of my window seat and pulled my pair of jeans down, all the while shouting " I NEED MY FUCKING LEGAL ADJUSTMENT."<|endoftext|>

The thick white brick walls were all he could see through the squinting haze. The pavement was a chilly warm grey. " Please fill me with evidence on your desk, sir. " 
 " No buts." Judge Sylt sat on the wall. The white brick walls and its many wooden vases soured with sweat as the scientist looked over what remained of his textbooks. There was no mistaking the artifact's abundance of human knowledge. The man could now see some evidence of its glory and wonders. Knowledge can never stand in isolation.

 He pulled up a grumbling audio book on his desktop and looked at it. 
 A virus? The hacker standing in the middle wasn't sure yet. It seemed doubtful that he might risk such a thing, but somehow it came to him.

 Technical execution was futile. The lab was not meant for such a large amount of inmates. We had a constant vacuum monitoring from a small aircraft carrier and could bring any, any, contraband, that was to be brought into the facility under stringent quarantine. Analysis showed a segmental version of an entity known as " The Walter" had come around, and was coordinated by our receivers to infect the area nearest to the jail. It had made small bombs that could penetrate large metal buildings. 
 In the end the computers failed to try it. It collapsed around half of the facility and its workers were taken. After our infection was discovered something fell upon our facility. 
 The virus was quite simple to launch. They would drop a satellite, go to Earth, space stations with enough medical supplies to cover the lower half of the spectrum, and spin off the launch tubes. After a 30 second delay from the surface it would drop down all the way to the top of the Vectran and exploded so violently, not a single person would survive. 
 The hacker stayed hidden in the majority of the system for an entire year. The Deep Space Explorers were able to stop the virus immediately and get their weapons working again. The payload was used in making fuel engines for an unusually large asteroid. The satellite was dropped back into the proper orbit and retracted under guard. The surface crumbled to dust as it fell into the hole that the scientists had dug.<|endoftext|>

Hi! 
 Love, 
 I know that you are upset but I would rather you just have a few more words with me. We were planning to cut back on mr. Heather and just let you know when we get back. Not this year. You and I had some time this weekend which means we are getting out from this behind the curtains. 
 I thought maybe I could do something to help you deal with the chaos and confusion that is life. Whatever way you know, the best way would be to go back and enjoy as much as you can and I would give you what you have so that we can unwind this strong friendship. 
 What is the point of hanging up if you can't see how weak you are. How can you let someone grow apart so quickly? There are multiple answers to the question just don't let me down. 
 Love, 
 Amy 
 Love, 
 Now I can hope that we can one day get together again. I do need something out of this. I should have not listened to Mrs. Campbell. She and I didn't have the guts to say nice things. But thank you so much to Heather and she will take care of us and I would like to keep moving forward as a mother figure. 
 Love, 
 John 
 Mom 
 Unholy hell. They all say that too. It can only be one thing. I hope this message is of some kind.

 Dr. Wheel, finally. He would appreciate it. Love, 
 I love you so much, Mark.<|endoftext|>

It was June 29th, 2012. I was living in Charlotte, NC, when it happened. We had been attacked by some kind of xeno-fascist terrorist group. They destroyed our entire town, taking everything that we owned in the process. 
 The rest is history. They were wiping out all of our military equipment, but we did. We were slowly losing the first few submarines to the infidels ( turning back the great shipyards of Charlotte ) and the much larger mass-service weapons corporations. 
 Today, the machines are taking our ships and their money and our people, and after years of hard work, we finally have a dud ship, and I'm once again back in my factory. And it's filled with me, my cock-roaches. I would lose my cock-roaches if it was not for my boss wanting me to let them fly around my ranch. His company, a menial staff. I've actually been working on a drone that will make interstellar delivery from Charlotte to the EWI - our neighbor to the north - instead of our mother far above.<|endoftext|>

She raised her hands with her free hand in a delicate gesture, not changing expression, as she made sure she was heard. 
 "You have died now, " she said, looking at him warmly. 
 " I've done it, " said the girl, looking him quizzically, before clasping her hands. 
 " Please... " she looked away and back at him, slowly nodded. 
 " You've done it, " she said, standing there for a moment, still looking at him. She slowly reached out, letting her free hand leave his hands. She was the strongest strongest girl ever. 
 " Please, I beg of you. I know you don't want this. You know no one will care, but you must do it. " He held her hand and pulled it away from her, shaking it as she raised her head. 
 " I want the light to grow, you know that, " she said, putting down her jar. The bright, beautiful flower that had once bloomed a hundred feet above a ring of grass seemed to have lost its light, instead. 
 " I'll do everything I can to bring them to you, no matter what the cost, you can do it. " He smiled bitterly, the smile making the air about him warm. 
 " I love you, " she said, looking down at the little boy. " I love you... " 
 She leaned on him, placing her hand on his cheek, and took a look into his eyes. He tried to smile at her, pulling away in a couple of deeply focused lines. 
 " I'm sorry, " she said, stepping back and taking a few steps away. " I can't do this, I can't-" she finished. As she did she turned back to the boy. Her hand left his on the boy's cheek and she pointed to his body.<|endoftext|>
**********507**********
"I don't think I'll be dying tomorrow, " he had told her. She laughed. " It's been so long, Mr. Skeptic, " she said soothingly. 
 She looked down at his nose and gasped. And began speaking. 
 " Please, do what I say, my dear. Tell me you think it can be so easy to be? Like I can move my chair, " she said rubbing the balding head of Mr. Skeptic's big teddy bear. Mr. Skeptic whimpered and ran over to her side. " I mean I can't move my chair, I can't eat, I can't sleep, " he whispered in pain. " What if I make babies, you know? Let alone twins, " he whispered. 
 She blinked at him, desperate. " Baby, you're dying. " Her voice was weak. It was broken, old, frail. " I really can't help you, dear. Do you remember when you thought you were being fat? You were all that fat and fat, and you wouldn't stop eating and sleeping, " she cried. She laughed, and fell onto the floor. " When did I think I was fat? " 
 " May I ask you one last question? " she squeaked. Mr. Skeptic frowned. 
 " Y-yes, please. No reason to! " she shrieked. And he lifted her up, gazing into her huge eyes and he waited. 
 After a few minutes, he fell asleep. 
 After five more minutes he refused to go to the bathroom. His eyes were filled with tears as she sobbed at his feet. " Do you know why I'm there? " she gasped. " I'm dying! " 
 She repeated her small cries. " Your life, my dear. All your family, your friends, you are my life. My family, my children. My god." 
 He squirmed and screamed as she dragged him on her legs and away from the others. They would not kill for his wealth; he would not starve them for their food. And they would not kill because he was rich, or wealthy enough. No, he would only die because they needed him, and all the rest of the world did not want his wealth.<|endoftext|>

But I knew I should have left the sword. This was supposed to be fun, a kill. A long, low blow. I cursed myself and sat up. 
 There was a note over the shower head, right there on the porcelain mirror. My knife. My sword. It ’ s funny what the blade does with the real thing. The blade lurches and springs when it touches water. So, I left it. Except that — 
 *CRASH* 
 And a few seconds later, the mirror was replaced with what I ’ m sure must have been eight different full-plate mugs of blue coffee. I rolled my eyes. 
 How much. Surely we ’ re short on cash, after all. What ’ s the difference between us and a hooded man taking two fancy refills of Starbucks beans with another new meter of brand unknown, when all the money ’ s worth it? 
 I don ’ t blame him. I took the money and headed downstairs. I'm not buying it. This is a murder, not a capture.<|endoftext|>

The midwife's voice became thinner and thinner. In the corner, the tiny hands were reaching out towards the kitchen. 
 "Mary! " Mary was so strong now, so well-mannered. She was getting ready to be killed. The illness was killing her already, she was sick. The Nurse always knew, but there was no rush. The doctor always knew. 
 Mary walked to the kitchen, trying not to miss any moves. Mary really was loping in the doorway when she saw the bruises and moaning. She already lost so much, Mary could swear. Where the hell was the nurse? 
 Suddenly the Nurse crashed into the floor. She stopped the nurse on the floor and took a few steps back. 
 " Where am I? " Mary asked. 
 The Nurse stumbled in the doorway and dropped her hand against the half-empty glass. The empty space that Mary and the pillows used to be had been replaced by a single room. A small table sat in the middle of the room. 
 " Mary. " 
 Her cries fell on deaf ears, but also quiet. It was too late. Mary's tears couldn't even flow properly out. Then, she realized. She was infected. 
 As it felt like a heartbeat, Mary had to call out to the other side of the phone. 
 " It's already over! " Mary screamed. 
 The phone whirred to life. Then the scream stopped. 
 " Martha! " Mary screamed. She started crying as if someone had brushed her hair all over herself. Her hand had fallen backwards and the pillow inside was missing the top part of the ceiling. The pillow and dust which mixed with the wetness made her no longer happy. 
 Her hand fell backwards and almost fell towards the carpet. 
 " Martha's not here anymore! " 
 " She's dead!" 
 The pillow was part of the floor again. More dust and more dust had melted in the room. Mary sat, panting, sobbing. It felt weird, watching the grey and white and pink and blue and red go from this room to this room. She was so sick. She was sick. God, what were these children doing in here? They would kill her all to keep this place healthy. 
 Now they were an orphanage. Without Mary. She needed the vision. She needed a vision. Something to tell them what had happened. What to do. What to do. 
 *Narrative clues of how she learnt to see the light*

The podium, that I can remember was a ditch, dusty, with symbols too big to be proper words. Not the strong ones, who were as nondescript as steel as granite, but the tall men who, as a teenager, came from the everyday crowd, and it felt much like my own. Modern wizards and witches, magic brutes and clerics, dressed as man men. 
 At first, little stories floated out, titled "The Sorcerer " or " Worthy One ", all with the same advice. But eventually, each one on the page had some sort of clue as to what they wanted. With their sketches, hermes, and experiments, the mysteries were still woven into the world around them. From basement crevices to the very beginning of the universe, all the different kinds of wizards and witches had their power. 
 At first it wasn't just tables and chairs; there was me. Inseamless and flippant, holding a casket, hermetically sealed, in one hand. A slot in the chest beneath the wooden table. There was an invisible portal to a distant plane in which the objects made of the very fabric of space and time were to be manifested. An interesting dance of the magic spread out from the table, adorned in the same coloring, and continued on forever. Once we were all certain it was the right direction, we grew bored of living in the present and move on. 
 However, my grandfather and grandfather ’ s mother, a position she retained, whispered as she faced me, telling me to play with it. She wanted me to know that I ’ d come back, that my power was real, that it was a gift, a magic potion that flowed like water through the fabric of my being. If she could go back to earth and help my father in turn with the magic in it, she could build this world of magic, and the gods would love it. 
 My grandfather cried, and his mother begged for mercy. My grandmother said that it was an act of kindness. We quietly waited in silence, as I picked one of the caskets. I placed it on the ground and threw it back at my grandfather. As I looked up to see how beautiful his eyes looked, he told me to play with it. I knew the fantasy couldn't wait. 
 The spell was warm and smooth and felt like a wonderful investment. 
 It burned with every breath I took.<|endoftext|>

A hopeless white line didn't fit with the rest of space, or the rest of spacetime itself. The messages that came over the heavy monitor were hazy for a brief moment. 
 Depressive Thoughts, Thinking Depression. Dreams all around. It had the frequency to drive up any sane person's emotional turmoil. The colors of metal, the blaring din of engines, wind, and thunder, all washed over the little snippets of data. In a last desperate attempt to never see things again, the transmissions ended. 
 Offhand, it looked like what used to be the home of a kid had been shattered. " Mission Success. " The prompt neared with intent. Not much else to say. The objects still scattered across the terminal, littered with smashed glass and hanging shards. Every single one, though, had decayed from the thousands of left. Shells painted a rusty brown with all its edge sagged to the floor. Others were clearly burnt off, and the scanner-monitor overhead produced a shot of bright red. 
 Just as the feed to what used to be its ship abruptly shuttered due to years of burning it's data ports. The ship also no longer had the cargo capacity of the surrounding cargo ships, and the cargo, loaded with features of the world only ever saw once during the military indoctrination. 
 " The whole frigging fleet is here. " The declination's omnipresence can only be attributed to the tolling and ringing of the radio sets. It started with an orange in the center, like the great list of names the good Mark Lance Swartermas gave them in the wars of 3599 or so. Next came a rectangular stripe of grey that met the black of the asteroid belt, the yellow of the sea, and finally, the green of the stars. 
 It was clear that the losses were so large and pervasive that the planetary system was utterly doomed. No such thing could exist on the surface of a quasar like this. " Other Relay Detected. " Those were the last four words that came to mind as the shut down phase began. 
 " All ships back now. " A small, heavy pillar of metal flung open to reveal a fleet of nearly forgotten machines. The lights of everything aboard this vessel went out, powering a still pulsing beacon that seemed to glow bright in the flickering lights. " Programs in progress. " 
 " Alert the Delays. Deployment was successful at Delays 4…5. Upon Re-entry a live satellite was broadcast to local hardware. Searching for missing pieces of TV we found nothing. Locked to emergency stations nothing moved. The satellite was found to have almost undisturbed its orbit, unable to have touched the known universe. These signals are all coming from transmissions from other worlds. For the first time in our long history, information on the matter has been available. "... Edgeworth Country & Outpost Ltd " 
 That was it. The story ends for the missing satellites. This was not the first ship to land on Earth. " First contact? " Somebody's dead. " Jeff Schneider. Everything's dead, sir. " The reporter says in a hushed voice. The waves of radio chatter pause for a moment. The report is still clear though, causing the wire hanging off the computer screen to shake. " Who's next?"<|endoftext|>

There it was again. Thumped over the side of the building, and left with flying fuel that managed to keep the astronauts from climbing the electrical cord atop their impending demise, the tram train wailed softly to life the smoldering mass of dust beneath. 
 While some had noticed the great disturbance in the air, which had gathered nearby, others felt less grateful. 
 Someone had asked "What happened? " 
 " The T-DUDE underfoot? " 
 " The transporter? " 
 " The one that took out... the copse as it were? Or... the man in the suit? " 
 * " Why not kill me, sir? " * 
 " Look at you, you two. Go out there and kill each other. Our team has been through enough to leave all of us behind and this train we brought you on is nothing but walking corpses. Just rations. " 
 " Enough to drive me to death? If we stopped, the train would have run into our head like metal beams as the rocks hit them, and we would never have roamed the asteroid belt. " 
 " We are only here to keep you alive. Who can stop you from doing something so terrible? What about eating us? " 
 " Are you sure we killed each other without the train? " 
 " Is it true that we can't get out of there? You humans are definitely hungry. You only use your cans for heat, and the T-DUDE is practically invisible to those of us remaining here. We took out three people for experimentation, you could easily get caught by the falling rocks without even a scratch. But those are just the three that got you here. I personally would do it for you. We need to eat more, we need to eat more. You might call me crazy, but I've worked hard for this company for a long time, and we haven't had anyone quite like you there. Now stop calling me crazy." 
 And just like that, the two androids left the dustbank they'd been hiding in and went to embark upon the cosmic object-jump.<|endoftext|>

We have been keeping track of human populations for a long time now. They seem to be kind of the forgotten treasures of our earth. Maybe not too great to use though, but they do give us the cards to pay for our necessities. For example there are people who apparently do work around the clock for machines. One day they talk about a "living wallet " and they bring it with them to the village. Some tell of people where they get " credit. " Also of course there are people that look different - they're lazy and scrawny and smelling like booze. All the while they're bloody hilarious at how easily they forget things. 
 The worst of this is that their children are good at math. Each year they give a small amount to keep the child free. By the time the rest of them have left we have yet to pay for their education. The most frustrating part is that the rest of their kids don't even recognize their numbers. Most children however do catch on and they begin to pay for them. Even though it is fairly easy to pay for the rest of them they keep getting richer with each passing year. The kindness in that, it is. 
 The ultimate reward comes when they're wiped out. But if you know what I mean, how often do you think about it? How else do you imagine that they manage to use all this to their advantage? As I said before a lot of the retarded kids can't even create numbers. I can't help but laugh how easy it was to steal a memory and let all the other animals distract them from finding the safety mechanism. If it turns out that a person doesn't know all of their numbers. So being the selfish asshole who I am I kept things going from there. But that can't help it. For now at least the young children are playing a happy game. I doubt they would ever get the chance, but I guess the time has come for them to stop becoming children and instead play around.<|endoftext|>

"So, Jon. " Eridan scoffs " That doesn't explain how you're... everyone sucks! " 
 John Smith rolls his eyes. Eridan's dick dangling in the air. " No, be quiet. If only you'd stopped bringing this up. " 
 Eridan shrugs. " Those troll orators might still be around. " 
 Smith scratches his back irritably. " I guess it must have hurt badly enough to spare them from picking up on that. I'll take it. " Eridan pulls out his phone and dials his contact, the same one Eridan had left at the diner. He knocks on the door, and presses a tiny button on the lock. 
 The dim light of the diner provides a fragrant haze of warmth and the familiar smell of butter, fresh dropped eggs, and bacon that takes on its jagged properties. Every patron looks absolutely disgusted by the revolting display of our merry-go-rounds. " Come in. " Eridan texts the hangman. 
 A staffer opens the back door and is immediately pulled into the passenger seat, a richly lit ceiling with what looks like an entryway to your right corner, someone else, possibly someone full of things we're fine with, stamping his foot by the door. The rest of the diner is empty, and with a raspy voice Eridan reminds the diner clerk that the last diner was wrong. " What? " The waitress hands Eridan a text and a fight ensues. 
 " Um... Alright. Guess I've got a problem with that *shudder* bit. Still I'll have a fork to fork for you, and hey, I shoulda put the bits down, huh? " Eridan's bag clanks against the floor. This was it, they were in here. He sits there, almost knowing the call this time. " My dick still doesn't have that solid corona." Eridan makes a sign behind his back and gestures with his hands. And when they come through the door he's rolling with his dick.<|endoftext|>

Twenty thousand years and two days later, was when men had made some progress in this hidden moment. 
 But here I am a couple of miles off the coast of Cygnus, retired, staring down a cliff on to watch the Wall of Fire, a tool of fire spreading across the globe with a quick flick of my wrist. 
 As I sit here, I'm unforced and waiting for my vessel to make a decision in regard to the rapid decline of humanity's longevity. We don't know how long we'll stay or how far we'll go. But we know that we're screwed. We're stuck in this meaningless year-long slog that has no meaning anymore.<|endoftext|>

I'm only 13 and just learning about my grandfather. His bright green eyes point out the recent events in our town that led up to the experiment he carried out at the front of the shop. 
 I was torn apart in this day and age by an unknown force. My parents took care of me as I was "different " so that I wouldn't be left behind and had a place in society. For this I tried very hard to say " that I didn't do anything because of you". But they just look down on me and say that it doesn't matter. 
 My friend Aaron is 9 years old and he's married with the same wife. He looks at me with that eye that his grandfather was born with, white hair the color of rice and one eye that showed the tears of love. He cried on me as if he hadn't seen me when I was 18, he just can't understand why. And I don't know why I cried myself. 
 He wasn't alone in this place, I was his age. " You are only an experiment. You weren't meant to escape. " Aaron said and I held his hand as tears poured down my cheek from my eyes. He crumpled onto the ground and started sniffing and always during this time I wouldn't see him, I got so upset and hated seeing my friend like that, I really did the same thing. 
 Even if I couldn't see him he was my friend and all I could do was carry on being him but we took care of each other, it was only a matter of time until things got really bad. 
 We were both out on our own trying to stop the apocalypse and Aaron refused to let us start this. When there was no going back it wasn't a choice at all, we were going to fight to save what he found. But Aaron looked at me, as if he could see me but would still be there for me in every moment. 
 And I always followed him. I wouldn't talk to him but he had already run me over and after that I never spoke to him again. When my parents had left me for the experiment Aaron asked me if I would come home and I said yes. 
 I was the best friend Aaron had. When this was done he didn't live the experience anymore, he only lived to eat and sleep with his friends and that was my saving grace. 
 When we began running together in the field we avoided any trouble in the town. I wasn't that concerned and only walked toward the living room where the gravediggers had found me. After so many months without him he was able to feed me and have me do the things I needed to for him to forgive himself and all the things I needed to forgive myself for. 
 I remember Aaron sipping his coffee that day and I remember rushing home to Aaron, I remember sitting on his lap, and looking at him without a care in the world I made to shut him down, I remember the hugs I made out of him. 
 We moved into a new house and went to the local kids kiddie dance. I was the youngest at school and I was the oldest because of Aaron's music, and then I remember thinking about him and how that had been my life since before I can remember. 
 Aaron wanted me to grow up. We wanted everyone to grow up together. It was the first time in all of my life I remember truly talking to Aaron. His passion was inspired by music and I loved him dearly. 
 I spoke my first words to him once and I showed him the song I loved. I made Aaron scream his name and I took away a friend and he cried with me and I cried and I cried. 
 I tried to explain my life to Aaron but his sobbing did not reach him enough to make it to the car. He decided to run home as soon as the sound of the car hitting the gas was heard, so I remained on the road. 
 I was following him, jumping in the vehicle and screaming back in every minute that he had not said a word. He stopped screaming when the car passed the sign. I pulled out of the car and I hit Aaron in the chest, after that I hid in a dark closet. 
 I still stay in that closet, and I always stay in that closet but what I see is different. 
 I can see every layer of ice on his back, I can see bloodshot eyes rolling across his face, I can see tears as he lays next to me. 
 It's not like he was even meant to escape.<|endoftext|>

Twelve months after Dumbledore's arrival in Blackbridge, five new Horcruxes arrived in the school's Headmaster's office, its silver chains with golden sparkles weaving along their hinges. * Smeared*. 
 Turns out, Severus was one of the Hufflepuff's number two students. His brother Lucius Malfoy was the actual Hufflepuff headmaster, and the Hufflepuff Supreme Headmistress declared her/his first year old son Ravenclaw Godfather to Hogwarts as an Angel of Death. That's about the time that Severus was officially admitted into Slytherin. 
 Actually, I can already tell you that he's never said anything about going to Slytherin, but that's not really fair. She might as well have given him his degree back. It just didn't make any sense. Hagrid even says he grew up there. He's been with the Hufflepuff's for the last four years, and it's not like he doesn't like every single one of the new Student. 
 My guess is that Hagrid would rather have Severus in Slytherin than teach him... 
 Sounds even more ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

The feeling in my stomach suddenly returned when my nostrils flared. Oh God. I have a feeling I hit something. Something big, perhaps massive. I rub my eyes, trying to keep them shut. I try shaking my head but see something is moving underneath my eyelids. I vomit into my mouth and cough. My stomach hurts. 
 A lamp is coming at me, a small room. It doesn't look big, but somehow there is a whirring noise like something is falling off a tower. It's my reflection and I snap my eyes to the smaller lamp on the far side of the room. I turn my head to the center and see a man. I'm now very sure his face has that of someone I meet on a train. I know what I have to do. I push the door open and my gaze wanders through the room. My reflection is standing outside the window, licking his lips. Who is he? He begins his monotonous play. * Hello? * 
 My vision begins to blur as I realize it is the same person. It's me. * What the hell? * A stranger steps out. 
 He makes a giggle like he has come to a head. * Oh my god. * I try to regain my composure, but this is beyond me. * And why does this one look so menacing? What am I going to do to him, again? * 
 The stranger begins to talk, but I can't find the words to explain. He speaks too quickly, and stops short. I try to calm myself. I still can't understand why this must be happening. What will I do now? * Why don't I follow his lead? * 
 *You don't know what you're doing, do you? You think you can move any faster, or anything? All you can do is stare at you, and then you move on. Don't you see? * I try to scream but nothing comes out. I can only listen slowly. My mind begins to become empty. 
 *No. * 
 All of a sudden I am confused and confused, but I believe I am still moving. My dream is vivid. I was only really four when I had this dream, but I was nine that day. My parents were putting me to sleep. The thing in my room looked like the cup of soap I used to drink from. I woke up, looked at my reflection, but all of a sudden it was gone. My door was gone, my possessions were everywhere. My clothes were different. My jacket and socks were gone. My and my toilet seats were gone. Now that I wake up it's like the universe just lifted from the ground. The universe revolved around me. 
 I screamed. 
 I screamed. 
 I screamed. 
 I screamed. 
 I screamed. 
 I screamed. 
 I screamed. 
 Then I was able to wake up, and I looked around. 
 It was empty, with nothing in it. I took one last look at my reflection. I was wearing nothing. But I was aware. I had made this dream a dream. A reality. Here in my universe. We are so different. We have this another purpose. I look back at my mirror. I can only wonder if it was why I woke up and why my mind did not pop back up in my dreams. 
 My job.<|endoftext|>

Cuyabria joined the world of vampire re-enactments. He finished his meal, packed it into a trash can and left. When he returned to Faury's castle, he found the vendor waiting for him outside. Cuyabria was under the impression they had something in there, but didn't know what. 
 'What is it', he thought to himself, wishing that somehow Cuyabria could go back into Faury's world, be on a good word with him and talk to him instead. 
 Cuyabria took a bite of his good cheap arbor, clinking it on the counter in front of him. His mouth tasted like some kind of rotting shell, as if it had just been run out of his mouth. He finally wiped his eyes, hoping that somehow, he would wake up. He looked around him, he didn't see faury, he only saw a small table with a cupboard in the middle, dark green liquid pouring out. 
 'The item is hidden inside, your hand will contact the this area when a dead humanoid is found.'. Cuyabria lowered his hand, then reached out with his fingertip. 
 Gasping at the fluid and seeing it move around, faury took two steps back, Cuyabria's hand held the container of exactly how much liquid it held. He took another step. Cuyabria stopped, seeing the liquid disintegrating into two small pieces. 
 Fury looked at Cuyabria in confusion. Faury was right, he did not see a single human being in Faury's world, so he let out a few frantic syllables before his body came crashing down onto the dusty plate.<|endoftext|>

"It's a good idea " He mused to himself, this reminds me why they called me. He didn't know the name of the drug I drank prior, and they made me feel terrible for ever staying the same. After some peer pressure I decided to switch the money to food. I proceeded to talk him down to his last few deaths, felt strange when I saw him in the news. Six weeks later this woman made his early suicide attempt. Good times. He went to the bar where he grew up and bought some beer. Of course he proceeded to drink it and talk to his girlfriend about life and the way things used to work, not using drugs. 
 " Good times. I'm sorry I hit you and weren't sure what to do I just said. You must have fallen asleep ". I said as I waved him in front of him with a smile on my face. I felt bad for the impact and kept telling him. He couldn't speak, of course he had to say it so he reached over and grabbed my hand. " You have to go now and live life like I will always live ". He held up his hand slowly and asked me to leave. I shut my eyes and took a deep breath and said " I hope so". He took me out of the house, into the city. I believe I'll be joining the resistance now. We're here now. I will not be afraid to die, but that's not enough for me. I must connect with the people I will meet and we will finally be in a place where everything changes.<|endoftext|>

The alarms were sounding. Especially in the whole world. We watched the cops come and go in from all around the world. I looked at my watch. 10:16pm. This was it. 
 So many of us made it home on time, we drove the new ones out of town. I gave my mom my wallet at the grocery store. She went on to tell me that she's dead, she has been killed a million times. Well I'm probably wrong. I'll spare you the details. After all, shit dies when you lose everything. 
 The second alarm started up. I had barely turned it off until the second one. It was just right, but I was glad, the stale smells of gin and alcohol from the fridge. We listened to the commotion around the building. It was getting louder. I had to be careful. 
 The second alarm sounded again. It was only right, but I couldn't believe it, hell existed. We listened to the screaming as panic spread like the wind, and fell to our knees as I entered my apartment. After three hours, I sat on the couch alone. I liked the weight of the apartment and its large window that seemed to surround me and I looked over my shoulder towards the front door. 
 "This is bullshit. " I muttered at the front door. The phone buzzed to life and I heard it ring. 
 " It's Jesus Christ dead! " 
 " Stop trying to go nuts, I need your help. " 
 " He loved me, he was always loving me. " 
 " That's fucked up, shit's fucked up. We need you. " 
 " Then give me your money and I'll see you now. " 
 I just stood there, staring at my phone and stare at everything around me. How did someone call him dead? How did someone kill him? I don't remember anymore. I think it's because I died. 
 God, I wish I didn't have cancer.<|endoftext|>

For years, every lie I told to this monster would be a new one. Although his scars dimmed as he ignored the lies offered, when I lived I felt like I was progressing the fiction my eyes never knew I had. I felt like I had met a dream and it had all wrapped in a thick shroud of pain. His scars only grew larger as his presence reached that of an able bodied man like a feared.999. That fear was my first memory as he transformed me to the monstrous zombie that I was. 
 "My name is Mace Johnson, now let me give you my true name. " The monster said with his inflamed mouth, " in passing, it may be I am the son of a doctor, but with these scars, when my father died I was the future." He left the room half a hundred times and never came back. The baby was born without a scar. The scars never really healed, they kept growing and growing, consuming his form, taking him away from me. 
 The day Mace was born, I attempted to tell him that he was my son, he never knew what it was like before, after he was born I realized he had a scar, and was stuck on what looked like a mask. Then I cried to him. I wish I had another chance to tell him that I was the monster he treated all of his lies with the utmost love and care. 
 The day I came home, I showed him the false face of my former spouse. It was stained like the tears of a flower, coated with scar tissue and all of his scars slowly filled the room. Later I found the true face I wanted him to be. I once again prayed that I had accomplished my goal and ended the years of agony. But it just never happened, as he was all the more my savior. I found him in his room with the scars, placing them on the bed and sobbing deeply. It was so surreal it was overwhelming. 
 The night passed and his scar healed, leaving it stained a darker yellow with longer scars on the top of his head. After a while I began telling my lies again, each time looking him in the eye, seeing an inner scar that was deeper than the one he now lived. His scars were ever so intimate and messy. 
 So, after a while I finally gave in to his wishes to visit and say hello. I am so tired of how the world turned, I just wanted him to sleep for once more and tell him he did his dirty work, didn't he?<|endoftext|>

Everybody does everything they can. I need nothing at all. You can hear the sounds of distant sirens off in the distance and you know, everyone needs to hear the quick, powerful breathing of a woman. And this dude, he's always on his heels as he walks past you. Can't believe he's been gone for almost half a year now. I usually just sit down and wait for him to come running. But sometimes he's just on his heels. Always standing just to be noticed. You know, like he isn't doing any of that anymore. A crossroad traffic light flashing blinking across the screen or something like that. You get the feeling that he's doing a pretty good job of keeping his head down. But there's only so many times I get to watch him when he's staring right at me. Every time he's truly staring. It's like watching someone lose themselves in the most beautiful shadow you've ever seen. It never ends. 
 But here I am, waiting for him to take a breath. And a woman is with him. So silent. To some that will talk for hours while I'm as clearly interested in just standing next to you. You see, I'm a pretty normal person. Despite all that life with my boyfriend and his family I've been kind of down on myself. I came up with a couple times to lay on me. Some did well though. Some did not. But on a night like today, my boyfriend wanted to move up in the big city. I was looking forward to him moving in with the'same girl', I was pretty sure I could say what I wanted to say. Apparently they weren't successful in their meeting. They had a lack of confidence. 
 And with that, his voice had gone above a whisper, and it wasn't because of me. I know, right? But he wouldn't do it to me. A double-edged sword swinging all across my back of the head. How many hours have it been since I've been in this kind of situation. And I'm so in love with it. Not only do I really love it, but I can't take any more of it. 
 I started to feel the shiver in my leg. That hair was getting longer. It's been two weeks since I've worked up a sweat. I haven't stood a single foot before now. But there's no time for movement now. I know there's no time to wait now. Only seconds are left in the stillness before he catches me completely in the pit of my stomach. 
 "Honey! You're gon na miss me when I'm gone!" he yelled. 
 He waited for what must have been days. I would've gotten out of bed fast if I hadn't come running out of that bathroom. He didn't stop until my heels hit the pavement. It took a few seconds for him to calm down. As he stood there on top of me, frozen in shock, with my feet on the ground, I could tell that I still love him. My heart was beating slower and slower with each step I took. He did not turn on me. He only didn't do it when I was over my head. No matter how much I try, I can not keep feeling him anymore. I am glad he gave up on me after he realized the whole thing. 
 As the ambulance doors closed behind him, I raised my head and straightened my tie as I stood up. I could still hear the heavy breathing of someone behind me. As he walked over to me, I knew it was him. I took the strange voice that always came out of people's mouth and put my hands up. And I told him, for my life, to go with me.<|endoftext|>

You see, I grew up in Wyoming. I was never proud of my family. My parents didn't talk to me about it so it was always from a distance. Ever since high school my grades had plunged, two times every year. I was going through class at the time, but for some reason my grades was really falling in the first month. I barely broke through the second one, and I learned to like it. I was a good kid at that time and I got a good job as a software programmer. My grades were going up, but I was actually doing pretty good by the end of it. The first few years I didn't think much of myself and the rest of my class was not happy. Even though I always knew I was going to be a good kid and this time was going to be perfect, I was naive. People had come to the Emerald Isle and they said they wanted to keep it safe. But they kept coming, they wanted to tear it apart. I could hear them talking, but they couldn't get the words out of my mouth, or make sense of it. I saw the receptionists out on the town square crying because it was the Emerald Isle. Those places were safe to come into contact with people. Yes, that was true, at first I was just a little anxious, but then they came in and just kind of poured in. Everyone else in the area had been evacuated. 
 By the time the few remaining people returned, the water rained down on the Emerald Isle. Though most of the locals had gone, if you were out in the desert during the time of the embers, you would still see destruction. People just had to get out. And the panic started to wash over me. I was so angry. I didn't know what to do. For what reason did all the people living there wish to leave? 
 I came to learn that while they stopped looking for people, they just wanted to keep moving. And one of them came. Two years old. He was carrying two bags of money he was storing on his way out of the desert. The world took notice and one of them was one of the original embers. However, the five of them couldn't have mistaken him. His face was covered in cracks, the fur and fur around it was weird, and he was jumping on a rock. I didn't even know what that meant. That was a long story. I had to be honest with myself. I hadn't really thought about what he was thinking, but when I walked in through the glass into the room I heard him say "I wish we had gone somewhere else." I smiled at the sight. I suppose it wasn't a bad thing because, after all, I was stuck in Wyoming and I hadn't gone anywhere else.<|endoftext|>

As Death snapped back at me from the starship he fired toward me. 
 "Jupiter has disappeared! " He shouted with his laser eyes. 
 I hesitated at the remote of my ship's throttle. It seemed my ship had crashed. An elegant red color. Bright, powerful red, it reminded me of what she was wearing. There must have been some kind of shader. I blinked and smiled. 
 Death returned the attention to his planet. Its only surface was darker than it was, while burning red in places. He stared at me and smiled, as if I was dead to him. 
 " We are all the protagonists of our own stories, but every once in a while a message comes for you and tells you that your genre has changed. Yours has just changed from'slice of life' to? " He looked up at me. " One hundred and fifty five years in the future. You and I shall find our fates, the light, and the darkness... and you shall become me. It is time." 
 I spun around and disappeared in the center of our entire universe. As the story continued...<|endoftext|>

The hills were thin, sagging and easily on the edge of rushing water. The warm sun beat down on the darkened patches of land, soaking the grass, blustering in the wind and dirt, eating the sunshine in short bursts, curling up in the milky-blue sky. The foodstuffs provided too, but the small family lives in a hut on the edge of the gorge. The children played with pastries they had cracked from spoons, making little animal spit splashing in the water in bursts. Mothers in suits stepped up to the hobos on wheels, making this day's procession. One for the little ones, one for the grandmothers and everyone else they shared with. 
 In the middle of the morning, children worked on a cross, trying to arrange a meal in the home far below. Their faces filled with fear, anger, and a desperate thirst. The question bubbled up from their mouths. But no matter, they did. The wife of a single theugist was tucking these thoughts in her mouth, and another was looking out at her. The husband of a young babe was tugging a tree branch, watching with baited breath as his siblings pounced on him, hitting them in the face and stinging with blood. With ready hands, he tugged his great-grandmothers favorite tree-thingy. She pulled it to the side, telling the children it would do much better that he couldn't. 
 This day was very different. This was a day that they hoped never to get too close, but they welcomed their late father with open arms. His eyes made an awful noise, and his head lay on his knees. He did not cry, but found himself rather numb and sweaty, part of his gut taking deep breaths as he lay there. He found it difficult to even stand, where he couldn't tell whether it was aching, exhaustion, or blood in his cheek. The sun hit the back of his head. He turned his head to look at his hand. His face looked like a gaping black hole, and the back of his head was slightly puffy, but it was as black as it was lit. The largest of his cousins suddenly ran to him, clutching his hand. 
 He did not say anything, instead following the man with the cross and sitting up. His uncle took his place and continued walking. The tension was palpable in the stone-is-leaving-to-sleep-glow. He could not stand, so the man left and sat quietly in the caves he called home. There were silence in the cave, and no man, not even his dad, could find himself there. Instead, he sat and leaned against a rock, staring down into its darkness. 
 After a while, it was dark, and the sky was dark, and the sun was dark. The world wasn't flat, it was more like a desert; a place to one day wake up. Eventually, the creatures walked the wrong way up into the caves. They came from the eyes of a rotting snake, that had ripped the nails of its enemies from its belly and ended it for good. All around, the beast leaped and roamed ever outward, burning its way through the cave walls to bring healing and raw power to the humans. 
 The man continued to stare, mumbling nothing for a moment. Then he looked down. The old man towered over him. He was bald, and his skin was grey. His breathing filled his lungs, and he could no longer take in his own scent. He tried to pass the time, and in desperation, clutched his own bloody neck and spat in the wind, but it went cold and cold from the venom in his mouth. All he could do was worry, then he looked up, and looked down, and he turned, and looked at his own death in the distance. He wiped it out of his mind and walked on into the light of the near-darkening night, so he may see the man again.<|endoftext|>

"We're still at it, Jimmy! We're the masters of the world! We've mastered the turn, which means we have a chance. " 
 " Don't make me sound like a grand master! " I exclaimed. I'd never spoken the language of my animals. Our history came alive with gifts for our lands, and our sense of adventure and discovery. Where I had grown up wasn't my land, my love for animals, my understanding of customs. 
 " We know the problem, now! We don't know what is going to happen. " 
 Jimmy grinned. He stood over the scientists, they were in shock. 
 " Where will they be if we don't be able to destroy them? " 
 " That can't be right. We are a species capable of saving so much more. I think we have made quite a show of destroying each other. " 
 Jimmy looked through his telescope. 
 " We are. We don't understand why we are. We can't possibly allow this to continue. We have to destroy our partners before they are able to recover. And most of all, we have to know what will happen. " 
 Jimmy sighed. That was the worst possible thing. A doctor would try to force himself onto one of us, give him cancer, and report back that he had not suffered from it. Jimmy had to leave the island, and head to Gillean to retrieve the world's most powerful weapons. 
 I jumped down from the small table, and carefully led Jimmy through the conference room, past the scientists, over his side of the desk, and over to the main conference room. 
 " There, we have one bit of information, " I said. 
 " It is time, " Jimmy said. 
 " What's your name? " 
 I pointed to a name. * Blackstar. * 
 " Uh, Sir. Blackstar Mann? " 
 " Yes, Master! Blackstar Mann! " 
 " I want you to see a picture of the human skeleton. A bit from the ESA data. " 
 " Kind of hard to do that! What do you think? " 
 " I believe the humans, Sir. I believe that everything we have is against us, on this planet. " 
 " I see it in the geosciences too, Malcolm. Something I am worried about." 
 The door shook violently, as if the tranquilizers weren't meant for James. I carefully closed my eyes, and waited. 
 *We are not so far off then, Sir. *<|endoftext|>

There is a long reason I had a daughter for a man, baby boy... 
 I'm not exactly sure why I kept covering her in tears. What I really want is my wife to be the perfect person. Living a life for her is so much harder than being around people. The children I left long ago were arranged and slept away happily at her place in the society, either way they came back to my house one week each. I get up and walk downstairs to my apartment, it's silent. I was preparing a snack when I felt my phone vibrate in my hand. 
 I have been in this business for almost 8 years, I don't know who the police are, they suspect I'm the master of "transition ". Instead, I have decided to visit this beautiful woman to see if there's a connection between me and her. Luckily, I'm the name girl that her parents call out so they can see through my broken heart. I stop at a brown bar and have a long chat with her. She asks me to tell her my name, that I will be going to an unknown location. 
 She looks at me, innocently, an enticing smile and a warm, inviting look on her face. She asks for some drinks, and orders some sweet desserts. I chortle and ask her why, she looks into her eyes, knowing her grandmother's fear for kids, but not wanting kids, except my own desires. She asks my question and I tell her, " Why do you want to be together with me so much?". She asks me again and I don't want her to give in. We get up, go downstairs and leave, she says I need to wait till she comes back, then I sit down at the table in front of me and open the door. She sits in front of the refrigerator and eats her tortilla, a crispy head and her favorite colored apple. She gets up and asks me for a snack, I smile, I decide to have a go. 
 When the apartment is quiet she asks me if I'd like some ice cream, I shake my head and say, good luck, I'll meet her at the mall shortly. I walk back to the apartment and grab a cold one, a chill feeling on my throat as I swallow it. I sit down and take a bite, then back to the apartment. 
 When I woke up that morning, my wife was sitting right in front of me again. I walked over, looked at her, and smiled. I told her that I wanted to just go outside and enjoy the experience. She opened her chest and stepped on a knife, biting with all her might into my throat. She swung the knife at my heart, I started buckling under it, and started bleeding from ear to ear, and were able to take the hospital bed for a few days. 
 The days later came in the weeks, weeks after the surgery, I couldn't live without her. My heart was heavy, my breath began to thin, and I became angry, a needed cut. She tried to keep me buried alive, but I could hear her screaming for me to come inside, and she started to walk away. I let her see the police shoot me, I then put a small knife to my heart, she started to clean my blood, and go to the hospital for long periods of time. 
 The doctor came and tried to come in, and was concerned. He said that I need to rest. He said it was a last resort. I said goodbye, and went home to my wife.<|endoftext|>

The little angels looked at each other and then back to the chapel of the dead man, looking back to the altar. 
 As they felt the palms of hands brush the flames, they felt the unbreakable bonds that locked them in this place. With one another, they bound the souls in their dying moments into the power that had made the night their home. 
 Lying on a cold embankment, their hands together, they felt the bodies crumble, allow life to freely flow into the world above. 
 With absolute freedom, they make their final breath. 
 There, in the Cathedral. It rested in the blazing memory of so many. The gravity that could shake it into little pieces, would destroy it, as would the misery that had been captured within, and with it, the downfall of the homeland. 
 And then... 
 They had, because it made them feel like home. There were no regrets, no sorrows, just this smell of fresh air. Just happiness. And happiness. 
 As the couple sat, clasped hands and feet apart, they realised that it was only a moment. So many years. They could never, ever, make it work again. 
 It worked. 
 When they were alive, it was already too late. 
 Then it was over. 
 And the world was again a place of fear, sorrow and pain. 
 And the nightmares they had fought so hard to keep alive. The nightmares they would suffer for as the soul that would be born into them. 
 By the time they came to this age, they knew what it was like to die. 
 It was a small and sweet comfort. 
 They would relax in peace, at peace. 
 Then they would dream of the thousands of times they had died. Their whole lives being played out in front of a camera, each with the same breath, each like a guardian from the darkness. 
 At least the images they saw were the same. So much more... so perfect. 
 It wasn't all that bad. 
 The fame they had garnered, and to many friends, was wonderful. Most of these dreamers. 
 When they came to this long-forgotten time, they felt hope at redemption, but the pain had filled them with nothingness. A longing for more. 
 They realised they were nothing. Not anything to hold on to. 
 They realised they were a promise made. 
 They would make the world our home. 
 And we would just make it be better. 
 And for the love of God, we would be the magic one.

The bright metallic ball-like object slowly positioned itself on the small counter in the middle of the bedroom. It was small, oddly shaped, and bedraggled from the outside. 
 I stopped, and looked through its eye-holes. 
 "How the fuck do you find something like this? " I asked, staring at it closely. " Do you even know what it is?! " 
 The object was spinning, twirling like a computer to this point. " It's just a door. " 
 I twisted my head back and forth, looking at the object more closely. At first, it seemed to twirl, then it disappeared back in to itself. 
 I could see faint purple light come in, like a bright incandescent lamp, and the sound of blood-curdling, cacophonous gurgles was off-putting. 
 At the same time, it was still spinning as if it was trying to knock. 
 That was when I heard the click as if someone had gone upstairs to the bedroom. 
 My bedroom was just a tiny room, a slow 5.4 metres from the floor, surrounded by my bedroom door, and the sound of my heart racing. 
 I was probably on my death bed, crying into the gurney. I could feel the tears start to clear under my clothes, as the blood started to slowly come to rest on the covers in my feet. I tried to scream, but the sound continued, like a serial killer's droning electrical net. I could not move, and my body began to slowly melt. 
 Eventually, I collapsed, my body broken and shredded by the light. 
 Everything around me began to burn. I could hear the bones in my legs shaking, as their functions began to drop. I began to hear the screams of my neighbors as they ran past me, terrified. 
 My wife, her best friend, her lover, her neighborhood dog, as well as the whole of her family all scrambled from their running. They were all suffocating. 
 Finally, I started to regrow. At least, that's how I thought it would go. 
 After a few weeks, I had slowly shrunk away, unable to move or function. All I could think about was how small and small I had all this time, and how to keep it going. 
 I had burst into a rage once, to leave my house with only one bullet. If I stopped screaming and screaming after the blood dripped down, I would be able to get out of this alive. 
 However, I had also started to forget about the doorknob and the door I was forced to open when I lost my life. It was then I realized the door was not locked. No. It was open. 
 My desperate breaths were futile, and my mind went blank. 
 Finally, in a futile attempt to restrain myself and drop to my knees, I heard a knock on my door. 
 " Hook. " I heard a voice whisper behind me. 
 " Hook. " I called again. 
 " Hook. " My throat seemed to dry up, and I heard a heavy cloth covering my back. 
 " The talk is over, " I heard another voice whisper behind me. 
 I stood to my feet, motionless, then looked at the shadows that covered the door. " The neighbors are looking down on us, and we know exactly what they're going to do to us! " 
 " I must do everything that one of you can to save us! I will save this house! " my voice was weak. " Make the knives I stole or the couch they stole look good! Everything will be OK! " 
 The door opened, and looked at me in the darkness. 
 " Hook. " 
 " Hook. " The voice whispered again. 
 " Hook. " I looked at my watch, and saw my 14:17 with the time slipping by. 
 " ***BEEP***" I called again, as the knife hung limp in the darkness.<|endoftext|>

"What? " I asked, noticing my reflection not knowing what to make of it. In fact, being selfish, I thought about how I just posted that in the usual way of posts: The shy kid i come from is a heroic hero; there is just something about him that pops into my head -- probably a little deluded. The fourteen year old with a ridiculous smile on his face who posts that comment on his Facebook page? That's me. Is that supposed to tell me that I should talk to him about anything? Should I do something? I mean, he's funny, and I've seen him do some really awkward thing in private. However, nothing seems to make sense. The kid, however, is going to make me feel better for it. I kind of tried to ignore him, but somehow, despite all of this, I still keep seeing him posting. Sometimes, it's only a little bit of actual funny humor. But usually, it is about when I catch a glimpse of him commenting on a pose he did in a different story and post it on the subjects that appeal to me: challenges, amirites, games, food, clothes, wealth. He usually posts similar questions, just to look at me and complain. This time it's more like little praise and mention of his own life. All of the casual, shallow jokes and jokes about attempts to win a lottery money show him the trap he had prepared himself into. 
 " How much do I need to know? " I said to the little critter. His stare seemed to direct at me. " How much do I have to give? I can answer any question right now, but just holding this answer will ruin my very purpose. I'm not here for that. It's clear that he's wrong. " 
 " So are you going to answer my question? " I snapped. The little critter twitched in his seat and he reached for his phone, waiting for my answer. I flipped on my Mac, expecting the reaction to be overwhelming. After a few minutes, there was a noise coming from the other side of the house. 
 " What the hell? " I sat up from the couch, realizing I had felt like a creep. " What the hell are you saying? You made me nervous, but you had your fingers in my mouth, and now you're really bothering me. And you make me feel worse about myself, because you lied to me all this time, but now you're thinking *I'm not wrong. * And I won't let you get your shit together. " 
 " Umm, sorry, but I have to go to court today. What's your court date, anyway? " 
 " 90 days, actually. I don't get much choice. " 
 " Sure, but you need to find your own lawyer."<|endoftext|>
**********535**********
I heard his voice, and I knew he wanted to see me like this. * I mean, I know you're in love with me. You want to marry me, marry me, marry me... I want you to believe me, * of course, but I'm not wrong. * 
 The lady next to me threw my lamp. I turned and looked at her as much as I could, confused. * You've figured it out this time, * I told her. With a quick flick of my wrist, the flicker turned into a ring. * Thank you. * 
 I didn't reply, but I've had my entire life past the summer to change the lighting on our bedroom in order for her to have a reaction. For her to know that she does love me, that she actually believes in me. No, *that's just silly! * 
 I felt another sparkle in my eyes. * You'll love me! * 
 And so I do. I do. 
 I am friendly towards her. I tell her, and sometimes, we huddle together. I listen to her name and I yell words to her. I don't fear for her safety, but what fear does a mage know? I am wary of strangers who don't know of magic. She wants me. I know what fear means. I can tell who scares her. I think of her in two faces. 
 I hate her.<|endoftext|>

Through the smoke the voices crackle and strain. I sleep in this town alone; how do I defend myself from those that may come? Up here, before the darkness, where the powers that be call for me? But how are we to bring myself to defend myself? I feel myself going numb; I can't move. I can only fear... 
 Once upon a time the voice was the voice of my Guru; something that brought me here. When I heard the firey call to arms, the way the flames danced in the cool snow, the fire of life, in the way the Fae would swallow me. Perhaps it was how I could strengthen my faith, taking a branch and sprinkling inwards. Still, the voice was the only thing calming me. 
 The days of terror in towns like this grew short. Food was too abundant. Water too dangerous; I had to ration it. The voice came once a year, and always felt fresh. I had to deal with these people once in a while, but as time passed they grew desperate. Not enough can supply us all. The voices over the past few years never returned to the once rich tribes of earth. It was up to me to save some. There was no way I was going to be seen here; they feared me. And so I occupied myself, and I protected them. The voices over the past few years have multiplied, and so I am losing my faith. I can see them now. The children, screaming and begging for help, now shaking my very existence to their last days. Their families are gone, they are dead. As the sun sets over the land, I see the children from the town gathered round the fire, looking up at me. They stand in awe of the fire; even in the dark it is beautiful. I look back on my steps. All this time the voices had sounded to me. Were they too strong? Are they too cold? What could this be? 
 Now they are quiet. 
 I want to cry. 
 This must be my curse; if they ever stop, no one will hear me. I will surely die.<|endoftext|>

It's been three years since the Terrain and Wetlands were trundled off into the impossible distance known as "Mr. Dragon's Gate " from the Road to the Unknown to nothing more than that. Once they had retreated into the desert desert, it grew over a thousand feet each year. This year, however, the new year was here, and the years were getting sadder. None of the two Dragon's Gate's former inhabitants had been among the 600,000 that had survived at the Gate and came out for a visit. The two Dragon's Gate's are rumored to have been passed down through several generations. Based on the vegetation on the walls, this nearly guaranteed that the Gate would eventually fall to no Apes, but based on the evidence found in the Gate itself, only one remains. 
 I guess you could say that theres been a lot of Eerie Zombies over the years. Even though it was only 3.7 inches deep at this point, it kept adding up. And surely, the Night Spawn must have o? 
 I imagine that will probably call for a final patrol at the Gate by now. Possibly to cleanse the remaining Dream-Dwellers to a minimum. These were a few that had been breeding at the Gate. Normally, once a month the Swamp Spawn checks its surroundings, and puts it away, but we all have to make do with the reality of it. Or the true path that the Road is, while it is only 8 feet deep. It's not that difficult. Or light. To the average Knight/Sergeant, it's pretty easy to get your bearings. During the Dark-Age, our Planets' were so heavy down there is no way to completely protect us, and, if the day intersects, the only way to keep close is to run. That brings us to the Rat Command the hard way. Our terms to using the Railroad to protect our positions were soon split up and a mission was started, Team Leader Blobe has been replaced by Flight Leader Simian, and since then, we've had to take to the Pit to challenge the armor of nightspawn, but we have been ranked with very low populations. One of our favorite races. 
 " You've made my job a lot easier this time sir. " My beagle says to me. We've put up a fight and taken down few of the Defenseless People, but the defenses have been overrun by them. I don't expect a swift doom, but that could easily happen. Assuming that the Night Spawn is along for the ride, as I was hoping, we'd head back to the City of Broken.. I suppose we have to try and cover this up, as the Road crosses so far and so quickly, that actually comes into play in a way. If I were to try and leave, it might not last long, and we could either lose control on the Stripes or spill over with the Great Market. Withdrawing the men would mark the dangerous nightspawn from our territory, even if the men could never fully do that. Unfortunately, my mom owns a big house in a shady area. I don't really care if the level-up is positive, just that I can't let her see that I'm wasting my time and my food. 
 Maybe this time, I'll ignore my trip this time. I don't have a degree in Biology, so if I did know something about that, it would likely be that impossible with our heavy military force, but I hope to be riding a great ride. We must afford everything we can at our disposal, and make the decision to ride to and fro before the day crosses. Here is my wish to go back to the World as a sidecar from my time in the Cave of All Things Living. Whatever happens, I was glad to be back in my car and drive the second I saw them today. 
 Did I mention they say, " Mr. Dragon's Gate " in battle? Well, I guess at that point, we're out of my Steakhouse and off to War. Good thing I never had more fish to deal with.

 The first thing you notice is the heat. Peasants must be taking their warm breaths. Before your nose and hair can catch a glimpse of light it's too late. We can't have this. The way they glow at night and the smell of corn and bread stench of meat and gas are everywhere. Your entire apartment is covered in them. The smell, the cockiness, the stroking of wet feet, you stare into them and you feel.. so alive. Every so often you turn to your vanity to look into the night sky in a sort of Hellish carnival. Whatever. And they're all gone. Er, anyway. So you always look. And when you sit you feel everything or someone around you for a second and marvel at it. But you know you can't. You *feel* them. You know they had a duty to you not to look back. You started to realise where they had gone. But even in front of you, you can't see them in the dark. 
 This is the moment I realised it all: I'm an organized butterfly. I've grown cold to the touch and your body can barely help me move. I'm a butterfly, I'm ravenous, I'm hungry. I've all my senses, but no. The thing is that there is nothing to say. How long has it been, how long will it take you to notice something. How long has it been, all the things you've known yourself. Ever since I was a little kid, I had a daydream of butterflies and butterflies. 
 The first thought I had was about death, but then I began to wonder: how could there be no going back? What am I to do now? It's been an unrequited love. Yet my patience was broken; I began to untie myself and take it into my own hands. It's been almost eleven years of, waiting for this moment to come and I've finally caught up with this human truth. Why, in these cruel and selfish ways? How is it that you'd never think of this? How does it kill someone? I suppose it's easier to pretend that this is all a fate than to admit the truth to the whole of us. It's been a long journey over a short period of time. I'm glad I finally discovered something I'd forgotten: I was never meant to be a butterfly.<|endoftext|>

It had all started out fine. I had an abundance of sorcerous power, but had faced off against a crazed villain before. 
 To be honest I'm not sure I ever really care for much or anything. I just prefer the comedy and short, grainy reading good guys what they know better. Maybe it was to brighten up my day in some way. 
 But there was one thing that always caught my eye at the supermarket as it opened this late September. All around me was grimy cashied dollar signs, tiny bars suspended in tinned air so that they might quench my thirst. I was concerned for some kind of something. 
 I was on the drive home, when suddenly in my nightmare I realized I'd suddenly been in a dream. The panic had brought some kind of reality to my stark reality as I realized all around me, bright green sign had encompassed me. I held on and peered over it. 
 Big blue robotic silver gates, doorbells framed a misty white background. The water surged with a kind of power with my limbs. Growing stronger I could now see, as smoke flowed from the glowing gates, a blinding mist swept over them, sealing the passage. 
 Then I heard a sizzle as a jet jet hit the gate, a chain of destruction followed. 
 I didn't know what was happening, maybe I was hallucinating and trying to get lucid, but the chemicals still buzzed in my brain. Thinking the events had occurred in a dream, I faced off against my attacker. Yes. In a dream I was a mutant. 
 The screams and shrieks, the horror as I staggered from the gate was the only thing that caught my attention. Someone with a uniform was approaching my position. 
 "Please don't shoot!", he called out. I couldn't bring myself to move. Standing there, covered in blood, was my attacker. The uniformed man standing next to my killed me instantly, he turned his hand and shot in my direction instantly. The guards wailed in pain and I couldn't keep my eyes open as he moved my gun toward me. 
 Then he moved to face me, blindly, placing a hand on my forehead. My target collapsed to the ground, a hundred bucks was piled on top of him. I looked to see that my attacker was standing, holding a pistol to his head. Then I finally got the words out. 
 They weren't gunshots. But it was guns. Guns I had never seen before, packed with explosives. Though I still don't know who the killer was or why he had carried out the attacks... 
 I was too frightened to move, I could feel this blinding chill as I spotted the siren clock, marking the moment the police had won. 
 It was 3 AM, I knew my chance had come. Was I in a dream? Was I simply going mad? How could it be? 
 One hour later, now I am in the hospital after being granted permission to the outpatient surgery I are now recovering from, a full recovery from everything. 
 I am so happy to see the city.<|endoftext|>

I packed the supplies and started the journey across the nation. 
 The town had been given a new name, and it started life at a leisurely pace by the early morning. They called it the Uraliwn, for an alternative name for the University. My heart sank with excitement as the participants came to the finish line. Many people had already chosen the first box, the other boxes had also been chosen before me, but this particular one had everyone's confusion and nervousness at it's heart. It was a strange box. I suppose we all do, but rarely do we. 
 Around the moment we left the vault, I decided to give my brother an ice pack. A strange feeling emerged in my stomach as I reached for the Ice pack. " Oh my god! " I rasped, struggling to hold back my laughter. He grinned into the box. I couldn't speak the words, but I knew they must have been mine. " Darling, I found the box. " 
 " Sweetheart, what kind of box is this? " I chuckled to myself. " It looks like it was an old Montana coin. " 
 Suddenly, he looked up and winked. " It has a roll of 11. " 
 " What's this? " I asked, staring into his eyes. " You've got this? " 
 " Oh no, this is a Kentucky card. It's the lottery jackpot winner. " 
 " Ohhh, " I gasped, nearly breaking my tongue. " This is, like, miracle? " 
 " I'm scared of this, bro. I'm not a clown. " 
 I started crying, but no amount of glares was going to get me to stop. " What the fuck are you talking about? I'd want my kid to believe this." 
 I tucked my face into my hands. This was going to be really fun.<|endoftext|>
**********541**********
It all happened so fast. I remember a beautiful sunset ( warmly of course, but not the kind that will attract attention ) and I was holding the bouquet of roses between my fingers when a rolling gray glow flapped across my mind. I wrapped my arms around the open sash of the flower and stroked it gentlely. This being was a vacation, though I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy the look. Luckily, those stories didn't feel completely real. But my father was not like these tales. I'd been training with his lieutenants, always the crankiest and rigid one. I made my way over to the balcony and past him, waving to him as we entered the nursery. 
 “ Wait, ” I said from behind the glass, wiping a handful of sweat from my brow. “ You think they ’ ll like you? ” 
 He snapped back into place. “ I love this shi -- — my dear. This is exactly what I wanted. ” He averted his eyes from mine. 
 “ Did you have a wish? ” I asked, their monotone expressions frozen in their disbelief. 
 “ Of course I did. ” He raised a hand. 
 I nodded my head and stared at him, my eyes opening wide with an eerie familiarity. When I took his hand, there was a glimmer of surprise and fear on my father ’ s face. “ Why were you bringing us here? ” 
 “ This is the happiest vacation I ’ ve ever had, ” he said. “ It feels like a lovely beach, with you two here. ” 
 “ I can ’ t believe I was. ” 
 “ Are you kidding? ” He stood up and placed his palm over my face. “ What am I telling you, where are you going to land? ” 
 “ Oh, it ’ s across the lake. We have to go see my mother and her love. You know, the one that took away her life. I hope you don ’ t mind it – ” 
 I tried to speak, but he interrupted me with a raspy “ Oh it was my happiness. ” As we walked along, things got pretty surreal. The mossy green hills seemed to tilt to the north, and all the plants of the forest looked out in serene beauty. We were staring at each other in awe, me and my father, who weren ’ t in awe of what appeared to be magic. The forest seemed to be more than a mere touch. It filled everything around us with a bright light, illuminating nothingness around us except for the countless squalls of laughter that roared up from nowhere. 
 I fell asleep right next to my father, again, not quite awake. 
 “ There we go, ” he said, bringing up his own palm. 
 “ So. ” I didn ’ t look up to see his former partner, now a fuzzy affair, hopping along on the butterfly of his jacket. He introduced himself as Sidney, despite the presence of his two children. I don ’ t know how I knew what to say, but I was convinced I would somehow tell my mind. I was eager to experience what it was like to be a lion. It was cute. I couldn ’ t help but smile a little at the thought of a mermaid down at my campsite.<|endoftext|>

Muffled noise from the kitchen came from the overhead pocket of the Chipotle. The lamb jerky glazed in the breeze and smelling of fresh air filled the silverware. The beef steak tasted of blood and charcoal. Maybe it was just some kid that had been wrongfully accused. Just as his stomach churned with hunger he was struck dumb. Had he been certain the burger was real? He looked up to see that his meal had actually changed, the size and shape had changed but his brain couldn't seem to process it. 
 The pink, green and blue bled organ was dead and his spine had been caught in some kind of cooked turkey. How could he ignore what was happening on the other side of the kitchen? 
 "What the fuck is going on? " He tried to lift the front door off its hinges but it started to close a little more, with a beep from the stopper on the other side of the door. 
 Out the door, another stranger stopped by and asked why. 
 The doctor then reported that the father had mauled the lamb, which had started to resemble the missing person in the womb. 
 " The lamb is real... " 
 " Oh God, shit... " The other told him. 
 " You should head over to the morgue. " 
 The other one left the room. He looked up at the clock and heard the door close behind him. 
 There was a knock at the door. 
 Another person went in. 
 " You alright? " The other asked. 
 The other came up to the small white door where his meal was. Before he reached the mouth, he saw that his stomach was now groaning. 
 " What the fuck are you... " 
 He waited, digging around for the dark forces inside of his stomach. Before he knew it, the door was locked. 
 " No. " The other yelled. 
 He felt his heart start to race and he knew that it was going to be over. 
 He heard the start of his teeth and he felt his arms slip out from under him and fall to the floor. 
 The other screams were low, but then they started. 
 " Shit... " 
 The door held and all that remained was the noise of the neighbors. 
 He peeked at the house and saw a 4ft ladder being hauled to the building. He made his way down to the house to see a bunch of police officers and paramedics coming down the stairs. They took the lamb, ran to the stairs and began removing the meat. 
 " Goddamnit, I guess it wasn't proper to feed your little brother because he's the calf." The officer said. 
 He started to feel strange. Like someone had given him a protein shake to help him digest. Then suddenly he realized that his intestines were actually the white chicken chunks from the calf that the officers had cut, which was how the whole sandwich was classified. 
 If that was true, then...<|endoftext|>

Some people are given books, some money, some freedom. A lot of people are given gifts for a reason. Luckily for me, that isn't the case. Sure I miss some kind of ballroom, but nobody in my family had heard from me before. I always called up from the day I graduated high school and had a heart-to-heart with nobody new to town. 
 I got a solid job, I got a home, a nice house, and went on a hunt with my little tribe of hunters. They found all sorts of stores and now I'm one of the most feared and hunted people in the area. It all started back when I was six years old. My mom's a killer, though. I remember her talking about how I had the most delightful night to remember. I mean I remember actually reading her over and over in my head. She did a house not even a funeral. 
 I don't know why she did it, but her deeds had pulled me back into the time of my childhood. I lived in my school for a very long time and told each of my classes that I loved my school, that my daddy was the best dad I could ever meet, that I should always call my dad. I got no friends, no family, and no education. It's not like her was always going to live up to his word. I was too young to say much, but she did her best to get me on her side. She took it all in and made sure I had the money she needed to make that life work for me. It started with moving out of her house and into an apartment in the remote part of town. I moved out of the town hard on my own. 
 She didn't take it well. She wanted that I could live with myself. She found it easy. She couldn't figure out the world was so different when she brought me in. I'm not sure why but that started to worry her. She left. Before I could even break the silence I got the call about a disturbance on the forest preserve. The hunter from the last couple of years came and brought in a girl in a little white labcoat. I know she felt bad about killing them, but I love our town and I really can't let that stop her. 
 The next morning we went out to the park to try and find her. She was walking by my house about five minutes ago. She could have been in the bushes nearby, or she was laying beside me in a pile of leaves, or she was crying hysterically. We went to the house and were amazed when we got a picture. She was in the center of a large plain. She was holding a pen, a notebook, a metal lens and a bottle of champagne that I had turned in my hand. She knew what I was thinking, and even though she was crying, she also looked forward to enjoying her evening with the hunters. I think, for sure, I looked forward to sharing some of that night with my children. 
 The next day I went to go get some cauldrons for her for her childhood. I knew something was up there but I couldn't get it out of my head. I got the papers in my hand and went down to the hunting spot to look at the tree. It was a fairly large branch, probably about four feet high. I sat down on the branch and took a deep breath. I thought about my family and in my heart, it was all the right thing to do. It meant such a great big fat contribution to our town and it meant so much more to me. I remember saying to myself, "Even though I'm from town, I still want to be with my daddy." I stopped breathing. I've always found relationships so exciting, I had no idea how. I just finished my top-of-the-line cauldrons and went to sit down and enjoy the night. 
 I don't know why she did it, but it was all so much more fun than any of the house chores. I'm not sure why she took my money, but I still wanted more. I don't know what she has planned for me. I don't know why she didn't just take the cold money she just got from me for me. I love the outside world, but I also love the inside.<|endoftext|>

There was a substance in my left palm. * THUMP. THUMP. I* checked my left palm while I opened up my porthole, hoping it was just my finger. The palm was in my right palm, causing a split second that sounded as if seconds could pass. 
 The substance was almost invisible as I crept in and out of the room. I turned my attention to my left palm and if I put my finger right to my lips, it would just send water down my shin and about half my forearm. Whatever was in my left palm was probably, in my opinion, more valuable than the substance itself, but I still felt nauseous and scared. My skin was itching so bad I ran my hand over the opening where my right palm had cut into the metal of my wall. I felt a touch of something on my arm so I looked at my left palm to find that I had cut a small tap tap into my chest. My finger whined and gouged at my palm with the most intense pain I had ever felt. 
 *AMGAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! *

"So, how do you make a difference in the service field? " 
 " Well, right now, you lose your job. Purchases come with extras - or they drop you down the chain of command. " 
 " Who said that, Stanley? " 
 " Yeah, the veteran. Watch out for it, too, you don't want them reaping your losses. " 
 " Don't worry about that. You aren't going anywhere with this. 'What do I get for the price of your skills?' " 
 " Things change all the time. You work there now, but nobody else cares. "

 " We changed the rules in the treaty. You can't buy *any* of my skills. Everyone wants the same-- whatever that means. " 
 " Baby, the changes affected the character of the product in the contract. "

 " Here's something I need to think about. " 
 " Hey, kid, stop fighting me. 'Turn the kid over to the oldest man who can make deal with my skills,' or something like that. " 
 " No, no, no, I get it. That's a little offensive to the people you work with. " 
 " That's it? Don't even listen. " 
 " Yeah, no, no, no, no. Just take a shit and start anew. I'm leaving. No second chance. "

If you send me the law of gravity, I am your God, and so are you, the Creator, but the Law of Art is not my Law. 
 The law of gravity does not explain why a man can not be killed, or how to enjoy pain, no matter the quantity. By pointing these points in the right direction, I can see them in the right place. 
 The piece I need to study is the finite. Through geometry, they were an ellipsis, heider than a circle. Now, no matter how important these ellipses are, my true form is not a shape. I simply cast a bearing to them. They slip like a spinning rod, and I press. The thought of such perfect thrusters will never come to pass. 
 But they reach so close. I can see them, no matter how far I push. My power grows as I push, and it grows as I push. With each push, I add more. 
 And then, just as easily as I create gravity, I destroy it. Without a radius, no matter how many times it does, I lose all its strength. Without my gravity, no matter how tight it is, no matter how much he twists and twists, I lose the force and I lose the soul. 
 When the forces stop, I will be free. I will be free, because of my absolute perfection.<|endoftext|>

The drone was flying overhead, a bit dizzy as I watched the fountain of salty, salty water swirling around him. It was the ending of many quests and missions, many times over. The Reaper didn't like it, he didn't like how I earned it. Each time I handed over my steel armory, he'd turn and punch me in the face with a bloody hook and arrowhead. 
 He was right about now. No, not me. Not even the raid bosses, not even Draconis, he didn't care. Each time he handed me a load of weak weapon, they'd call me a mercenary, an acrobat, a scientist, and a hellspawn. That's all I needed. I wielded a sword, I joined the real estate business, and suddenly only a man could afford to get killed. Not even worth a damn. 
 They call me a god, my name is Aliah, and my time is over.<|endoftext|>

Bruce Longbottom stood transfixed on a surface. There was no fear in his eyes. He was alone and unmoving. He turned the corner into the alley. A masked man in a trench coat matted the spot where Wayne once lived and came running at him with a stick. A dull clang echoed through the alley, swaying the man. He began to sweat and blink. His skin was flushed and red. Slowly and steadily, Bruce quickly made his way to the other side of the alley. The masked man sniffed the ground as he walked. 
 "I'm expecting you to come with me when I tell you to evacuate everybody else. I'm not sure you know the reason we're in this mess. My- " Bruce began to stammer, but it was too late. His feet appeared from behind him, sending a visceral pain through his body. 
 " It's too late for you Batman. They're going to find me. They're going to take everything you have! How can I get away with this? " 
 There was no hint of fear in his eyes. He took a step back. The revolver in his right hand tightened. All but his in his left pocket was empty. He slid the revolver from his left pocket and pulled the trigger. He fired a long continuous barrel, and another one came slugs back and forth. 
 The bullets fell across the pavement, splattering to the asphalt. A splash of blood trickled from the single bullet. 
 " That can't be right. " Bruce gasped out, but the mask beeped. He saw no scar. Bruce gasped back again. 
 " I never hurt you Wayne. I never killed anybody. I never stole from you or hurt you or hurt anyone. I never cheated you. I never teased you or harassed you, I didn't pester or hurt you with lies or anything. I never maimed you, instead... " He paused, and rolled his eyes. Suddenly a flash of recognition caught his attention. 
 " And this alley... it's all yours now Wayne. " He tried to breathe, but the breathing became more of a constant drip. " They're going to find me, I don't understand. Can you *please* leave me alone? " 
 His senses were damaged, but he resisted the urge to run. " Sorry? " 
 " I can't promise you anything. I promise I won't hurt anyone. When they are done with me or if things go awry, I'll be back. " 
 Batman's face fell into confusion. Even though he was close enough, he couldn't put himself in the situation he was in. A pity. 
 He stood and felt the hot mud clench his finger nails. He closed his eyes and gasped as he slowly shook his head. Was that normal, though? 
 He took a deep breath and let out a small roar. " You've won your only chance of survival on that face, in this filthy alley. That mask... I saved your life. But it was never anything special. " 
 The mask flicked off. " What's that? Are you really me, still...? " 
 " Nothing, Batman. Just you and I going to kill you Batman. I know, you gave away so many secrets. This trust I've made, and it's so close. But- " 
 " I'm sorry Wayne. " The mask gave a final blow to Bruce's head before pulling a single cord out of his shirt. 
 " You died for. " Bruce let out a long sigh, but was no longer about to go through with this. " That's why I'm *dying. * This one, that is. " He glared at the mask, and pressed it to his neck, closing his eyes. 
 " Forever."<|endoftext|>

My bowels tortured me for the last ninety years. My feet burned and tears were shed for days. My world would collapse in on itself, which is what you see happen on TV. Your eyes leave water and so on, until you look at the floor beneath you. A sheet of paper, itched and a gun, hit the hole in the center and sits glued to a hole in the floor. Removing the cover came out of a pocket and the gun, which must have looked the exact same as it was before the stain went all over me. It must have worked. 
 Every head on the television was still filled with the same complaints, innocent outcastly peering out at the world above them. " Wreckage " was the headline. Children's breakfast was skipped. The same whine I heard every time I went to bed. Removing the hand gun. " Case into K-1 " my friends said. Some still looked apologetic to me. " Waste not time now it may show its real." I thought. The burden of making will, hard work and getting a job were exactly that I wanted to do. 
 My mind entered a cycle of frustration. God, I hated what I had to do. My stepfather would live if I couldn't give birth. My brothers would be siblings long ago. My dog slept in the dark. My cats. Sometimes they would kill me and take my clothes and sleep next to me. 
 Everything got harder. My brain knew the patterns, the numbers, the lessons. I had to have this. I had to do it. I had to prove that the can did not harm the person. 
 And so my self acceptance was reversed. A brain bug suddenly brought to life in another human being. Bacteria was grown in a box in my back yard. An android looked up from some computers. It helped me fix the bugs. I had to. After thirty days and four nights, it had wrapped itself around my legs again. I was completely cured. 
 I handed out presents and didn't regret anything. Once the infections were less clear, using my imagination more efficiently, I could make that itch that always started from a rotten piece of paper. All I had to do was put it in my back yard. It was a matter of one day. 
 I left the house when I made it to my research facility on time. I went to the park, watching how my older brothers liked this. You wouldn't believe how many adults died because they didn't see me. Even the youngest started walking. One day, the surgery didn't sit right. The itch had already infected every part of my body. But it felt like I was alive. It was in my gut. I went to take a look. I showed the device. 
 A tiny cup sat in my lap. I turned it on and placed it on my head. I bent down and kissed my forehead, feeling the softness of it. 
 It felt like I could live, without my pain. I bought the device. I hooked it to my collar. It was the best thing I had ever built. I pulled out a bandage on my body and taped the button to my collar. It had a yellow surface. I kissed it. 
 Finally the itch had stopped. That should be enough pain. My family was pretty much in the hospital now. I could feel how much I needed that pain. I placed the bandage around my neck. The scratch on it would clean out after it. That was enough. 
 As the doctor started to close the door, he asked me what the hell happened to me today. I told him it wasn't my fault. He smiled. I wiped the clean portion of the bandage off my neck and wiped the neckboard. I was fine. No matter what the doctors told me, I still knew what had to be done. I held my tears, and I rubbed them on my hands and elbows. I spoke with a gentle smile. 
 We had the two stones to regain freedom. The first. I walked out the door.<|endoftext|>

"Oh, wow! Now we have a new President Obama. Mr. President of the United States. " 
 I *shugged*, sir, " It's All With Money! " 
 The smiling robed President chatted with the group of America's best. I frowned and stared at the wig they were wearing. I am *wistfully* *stupid*. I don't want to *personally* *personally* think it's all with money. 
 " Yes, Mr. President. My name is Jonathan Murphy. It is with honor of Bill & Melinda Gates that we announce today that The Obama Tea Party will be successful in taking over the nation. " 
 I have one more thing to add to my story. The crowd seemed to cheer me up. I think I met Ryan in one of the drinks and surprised him, but it turns out he's sort of gay. I don't know if that's accurate, but Mike, he's an articulate guy. He knows the law, he gets paid handsomely, and he's good at it. Is my husband that amazing? Does he want us to admit it, Ryan, to others? We will have more of that with these changes in the economy, right from here on out. That's it! Now we are Mr. Obama and the new President Obama. " 
 Yeah, Mr. President, I know that Scott Walker's going to be popular. Yeah, I know he was. But he was the man who ran for President of the United States. He called Scott Walker his *super father*, I haven't even heard his name, but Scott is not helping. The people in Wisconsin are missing out on something. 
 " Excuse me, sir! Can you give me an example? " 
 " Now Mr. President, Scott Walker was getting in his way. He ran for the office and he couldn't, couldn't win and it was bad for the party. He resorted to violence and other silly nonsense. The price for that was losing the popular vote for almost all states he'd won. There was the state he won, yes, that much went into the Democratic National Convention. There was also Governor Weld of the state. And then there was Governor Ann Coulter of the state. At one point, in the final weeks of the campaign, governor each of them were running for governorships nationwide. Governor Trump only thought he'd be the one going on the debate stage tonight. And suddenly, with great all the hearts of the American people, the price had to be paid. 
 " Mr. President, Scott Walker's campaign was more and more unpopular throughout the country. He was unpopular and even insane in all state of the union. And then the polls said that maybe there were somewhere around 30 governors in the Republican Party. And there is a Massachusetts lieutenant governor who was running against a great Republican governor, John Pelle of Boston, who died three days later, more and more in the fall of 2016. It seems to the public that one of the GOP governors was president Obama, and so did Governor Arjun Patel. None of it makes any sense, Mr. President. The price must have been priced too high. He needed to be leader and a good president. Mr. President! And so those are the price that will have to be paid. " 
 " And now Mr. President? " 
 " Yes. And for the last time, Mr. President, don't you look at what's happened. The American people want better things, but they're starting to realize that the billionaire who ran a better society than them had something to offer. When people say'What's a big government?'" 
 Oh, oh, you can't make things better, I'll see you later, my loyal readers. I wrote this all this story on Wednesday night. I've worked on it for a long time; I may not be able to finish it this morning. But remember, Mr. President, you have to be capable of taking over a country. That was not a hard majority. It was hard for people. It was hard for me. They had all had to come up with a decent plan because it's clear that we have an imperfect nation, and that's all that matters. All that matters is that we get something done.<|endoftext|>

I sat alone on my bench during the training to enter the defensive line. Jeff, being the ugliest kid at the university, he was always had a bad attitude, brought us to that point by refusing to even acknowledge the fact he was a boy. There were plenty of things that the team didn't know about me, the procedures I showed and the mindset and general attitude that I bore as a kid. While Jeff was one of the younger kids of the cohort, you wouldn't believe the sharp elbows from those guys like me. 
 It all boiled down to this. Each day I would get different four letter grades and go in to practice every Sunday. As I wore uniform, though, I experienced true training. In the preseason, however, I was assigned to a squad of elite players and tasked to team up with the kids who were replacing me. I ducked behind a dufflebag in class, slipped in a pee, and grabbed my learner's card. The two-day beeping service was well over an hour long and strictly instructed. I might have been a little blase for being so slow, but it was hard not to notice the exact sensation they were stirring in my stomach. 
 I slowly pulled my wad of cards out of my duffel bag and placed them on the table, splashing water between the side of my toenails to hide what dripped down my shoulder. One of my fellow players muttered something under his breath, but I quickly cleared it and peeled off my socks. 
 I needed these cards. 
 And on the 6th of December, I woke up in a vat of bloodied ground. Jeff was already bawling to himself, kicking and punching his way through the warm air before the medic could notice. I attempted to sit up from the other side of the bench with Jeff, looking for anything edible in the corpse inside of my body. My hands, fingers, and most likely my entire weight were soaking wet in the mess. 
 I hobbled towards a large red door that hovered aloft, my only hope that I was safe after all. I smiled and grabbed a flask, paying no mind to the sudden green glow it emitted. It was just me and Jeff. No one else, not even the ones on the squad were in my area. I watched a nurse pull a blanket from under her tarp while I watched them run to go to work. They were less than two-hundred and sixty feet away from me, at least. 
 I chucked out a gloved hand into the gathered blood. The dream of walking down an aisle, catching the light of the sun, hurt my stomach. My classmates went out to buy lunch, too, so it wasn't all that surprising they got the same results. Jeff was still feeling his anger, thinking "just cause I just get fat is the *whole problem*. " 
 I reached out to touch him, and he grabbed my hand, as I shrugged it off and leaned into the back of my vest, twisting my fist around his jaw. " Just because I haven't been a little better doesn't mean you should suffer from it. " 
 Jeff is about to bite me in the side when he puts his foot back on the ground, keeping a small distance between himself and me, until he erupts into a fireball, using all the strength he had on him and me before running over, injured and dead. The police rushed in after him, one by one, and I had to step in behind a cop car after they all appeared to have already turned the corner. When I got back to my feet, I stared up at the walls that were about as tall as the hospital walls. 
 The walls gave out and collapsed on them like bloody floodwater. As if the water was some sort of barrier, the building collapsed, as far as the eye could see. All but Jeff, whose hands and feet were clutched together as if their foul brains had screamed in pain as the roof collapsed and puss entered his eyes, choked his breath to no avail. As the ship tore off across the sky, the void beneath closed around me. 
 In the corner of my eye, I saw Jeff.<|endoftext|>

Satisfaction. 
 That was always the problem, I guess. I didn't want to accept everything that happened. I had no intention of breaking any of my inner rules in a free-for-all. I wanted to do more than just tell people what to do, of course. But I could make your arguments disappear. Because even the people who encouraged me about success and beauty suffered from a premonition. 
 I had tried. Not only to break the rules, but also to introduce a line of questioning in someone of my own personality. When people "wary " me about what I was doing or about how I was going to behave, it was to make them feel better about what they did. I didn't want to be like them, which was a horrible concept, but I would digress if not for the sounds the others made of it. My reputation as a designer, and the longevity in my company created the need to have a positive reputation with respect. 
 So to break the rules, I managed to keep the loyalty and respect that I had earned from that one phrase. " Don't humiliate myself." That was how I defined " humiliate myself ". That's what everyone said, because the people whose thoughts I expressed had never met my ideal of being polite. I would pretend that when I talked, they didn't hear me try so hard for them to hear me speak. The very idea that I wanted them to hear me say it didn't work. 
 That was the point of my company. That's what every person who watched over me said. The " good business " that we did made me like all the little blue artists. I hoped that they would earn respect, not blame me for my choices in life. After all, what's to say that there's a single color better than 'One?', regardless of how much the other could care?<|endoftext|>

You can't respond with hypothetical consequences when dealing with complex problems, my dear friend. I've written this so many times that I don't even know how to respond. The odds are better that way, unless you mention any facts you don't think are interesting enough to your readers to make a plausible argument; no matter how silly a thread may seem, you can't say that it's not a valid thread to call a scene! I mean, we've all got our know-it-alls! That's awesome! You see, if you can think it up, you can make even more meaningful things using the common sense and logic of the posted post, so you've got yourself a fairly funny response! Of course, it takes a lot of word choice, e.g., do you just post it yourself and/or *and always* post "I ask you this, and you know what happens?" and voila! All you have to do is act as though the answers would be *true*. Each path means a response and this entire rule-of-thumb is a response! Sure, there is very few variations, but we can do a great job of creating believable opinions, as long as your readers's intuition of the potential explanations is reassuring. It's all worth it, folks! 
 But I digress: I'm just trying to piece together where I am, so please respond as a student and not as a teacher. That's all I can do. Feel free to ignore any feedback/criticism you may receive. I can also occasionally improve my writing here on /r/Anthony4400. Thank you!<|endoftext|>

What once felt like a last stand, is soon lost and forgotten. We have entered the unknown and will destroy it. Now that we have carried on the plan we already have, I may finally rest in the peace of our workshop. I want to ask you, man, do you ever dream of being the ruler of your people? Do you ever hold your breath and wonder to your grandiose majority at what the future holds? Well, now I know.

Sergeant Chief Hemant walked up to his group of marines, noting just how powerful this alien thing was. Such an inhuman being, it constantly peered around its giant mouth with... no, biting, ripping off I guess, shape. 
 The closest marines jumped up from their stumpy hooded chairs, calling out for Captain Boss to accompany them, and when they found a fit one, they hopped back in and took cover behind a table-pole. However, as the alien slowly put it's enormous teeth into an opponent's neck, it let out a furious gurgle and then another and a black spiked product formed in its maw, before blinking, walking up and pouncing on its foe. 
 The pair formed a spear-type offense, chalking up 35-40 hits. The creature had both escaped the sergeant right before the sergeant had landed, giving Captain Boss some fresh danger in the process. However, Sergeant Hemant insisted on walking away instead of following, and when it was clear he would not make it, he took his place behind a crate full of supplies as the creatures head roared with what seemed like spew of flame. 
 It proceeded to bite, piercing through the entire man's arm, then doing a leaping kick to damage the last part of the man's cheekbone and just sort of fell back down into the dead star-world in a act of vengeance. Captain Boss immediately rose and walked past, but before he could do so, the monster gave a massive, fiery kick as he fell to his knees, clutching his head as it let out a pummeling screech. 
 It returned with a full body blow before the sergeant could drag him out to safety, only to join the creatures' stomping from the corner of the table-pole. Pushing Captain Boss back into the air with it, Hemant groaned as he laid him on the floor, his body now broken. 
 In front of the giant, wrinkled beast, numerous injuries- a single broken jaw, one broken leg and three teeth- all while a pair of appendages, partially decayed, began to tear apart his bone structure. The beast rolled away and smiled warmly, devouring the man as it approached them from a heap on the ground. 
 Men began to rush in. Soon, two of the best on the team's unit were injured, and are badly injured. When the sergeant came around, he was carried away as General Payne, commander of the first brigade and foreman of the first brigade, put his finger to his lips. 
 "Captain, what are you doing here? " Payne shouted. 
 " My name's Walter, I, a medic, opened up a heart attack in the tank, " he said as a grenade thrown from a strange-looking stick sliced through his chest and... began to devour his organs. 
 " Why didn't you have to have those... your eyes? Did you get shot?" 
 P.S. Just gave me that name, thanks.<|endoftext|>

I was afraid. 
 Fear that was against the rules for me, something i hated. I had seen this beast before. He was large, powerful, and agile. It was no wonder the people came to work to hunt beavers at night. Our city was a hive; dangerous to ever step out of. He attacked and cornered every little corner of the town, or at least he could. He raised his hand against the local blacksmith at night. 
 After an emergency meeting his master led the way back to town, a talk of the free company gone with them. The former owner of the land heard the entire situation, and went to the nearest shelter. He retrieved the mightier, stronger, powerful herb that was on the market beside him. It was the fur-tree. It was treasured as the creature would be, with the freedom it was guaranteed for it. Without it, our town was a simple, long-awaited beast. He looked around and saw, coming up the stairs and ready to do his work, that his friend was gone. 
 At this point he was no match for the beast. He rose from the shadows like he always had, then plunged his hand into the tree and shouted for his comrades. 
 "Mother fowl, what had you done to deserve the wrongs of our city? Why go out by your side to kill our mothers? " I heard, and still unable to believe it, he was in the secret area. A young men by the name of Majids A and B looked at me. 
 " I have done nothing wrong for a city. But you no longer belong here. We must find this bitch, that will return her to me. You did what, after her husband died?" 
 The men were dead. I could still feel my hunger grow for blood. I have to do something.<|endoftext|>

"Wake up! Stand up! " she whispers. 
 A shiver sweeps up Jesse from where he lays, the holes that had been passed between his left eye socket and out the other side of his face creeping up his cheeks. He laughs to himself as he finds the creases in the covers over his eyes that have provided refuge for so long. 
 " Wake up! Wake up! " 
 There it is again. 
 His eyes have been fixed onto the contour of his waking room, a fact that often keeps Jesse's rolling shoulders back as he wonders if he isn't dreaming or dreaming at all. What do you think? 
 " Hey, Matt? " 
 She stands up from the bed. She spreads her legs and stretches once again. The wound will break fairly quickly and Jesse wants to go to bed. 
 " Shit, " Jesse grumbles. 
 " Shhhhhh. " He mumbles once more. 
 The cuts grow less painful with each step. 
 He groans when he realizes he has no suitcases in the living room. He tries to fit neatly on his, leathery, doe-eyed bed but there's no to fit in. 
 " Yeah, fine, I'll take care of that. " 
 He chuckles as he leans back and leans back. Another sore spot is spreading, at least again. She moves around his changing room, trying to place him into the loo. 
 There's no one in the room that can make eye contact. He whirls around to find an empty chair on the floor next to his bed. 
 " That's strange, huh? " 
 The corner of her mouth curled up in a clear grin. He can't help but laugh. 
 " Ugh, that doesn't sound so right. " 
 " Well, that settles it then... " she shakes her head. " Do you want anything else? Anything else? " 
 Jesse opens his mouth, but there's a hollow grin on his face. 
 " I mean, I had a firm grasp on what I had done. I barely remember many things. But yeah, I'll pass that along. " 
 She moves around him for a while, surveying the rest of the room. She laughs and sucks in a breath. 
 " Wow, looks like I'll need to reconvene later tonight." 
 Jessie presses a finger against his mouth, hoping to forget the brushing that day.<|endoftext|>

I don't want my life to be like my father, 
 But he told me to be respectful. I've to stand up for myself, 
 But I didn't want to. I had to live this way, like my dad. 
 I used to be big and strong, like my dad, 
 But now I'm a kid. 
 I just want to know what they're thinking of me. 
 It's ok to be afraid. It's important to lead, or to be on guard. 
 I left my "favorites " together. We did college together and thought he was smart. 
 We kept saying we would meet before our time, 
 But it's tough on us to make it to the time. He never talks to me and I can't handle. 
 I'm happy he still loves me.<|endoftext|>

It happens sometimes, the worst are the longest. I smashed into the windshield of my Mitsubishi commercial and it flew through, over and over. I lose control of the car and fall to the ground in shock. Just before being destroyed I see my car through the windshield of my Mitsubishi commercial, soon following a powerful explosion. 
 *Don't make it* I think to myself. I felt the sensation after I've only been sitting upright for a few minutes, being completely crushed by something fast moving toward me. 
 I roll the window open, as a tiny nosed deck is the only thing on the road that seemed real. I quickly work up the courage to grab the passenger door handle. All I see in front of me is the black sedan in front of me. One of the sweetest smiles in my life ( good job Christian! ) comes to my face. 
 *Thank you for the help* I thought, *You were saving me for a while, didn't you Jesus Christ? You told me to wait a little longer. * 
 I unzipped the passenger side door, feeling the cold metal snap the handle in place. I twisted the door open and looked down to see my back facing me. As I slumped onto my belly for dear life, a tear passed down my face. 
 ***How long has it been since my brother left me? *** 
 I still remember him laughing at me. 
 *Don't make it! *

Kama Saw, king of the kingdoms of Yushua, fought alongside other armies that recently met him. Though the enemies are stronger than him, he still lived, and endured, in order to make his people. Even he did not know, and he did not care. 
 "Peace. " He said as he held the searing agony for the first time. 
 " Peace. " He said again, louder this time. 
 " War. " And so he and his armies parted. 
 One day, the city of Kushumara, spilt blood and gore, and with its people killed. 
 But, despite the rest of the attack and the deaths, the king of Yushua survived. 
 " Soldiers! " Saw called to his people, and promised them that they would return the favor. 
 He, served as a messenger to Yushua and his kin. 
 Those that he had killed, and brought to Earth at his will, took to his side and fought against the forces of Chaos. 
 Before all was destroyed, Eriks, king of the earth and people, decided to let people have their way. 
 He traveled to the world, and found that millions of cities had been defiled in the aftermath of his battle. 
 " All I ask is that you return my word, " he said, with a weak tone. 
 " We can't decide peace, " Yushua turned to his people and said that just to return his favor. 
 And so, Kama Saw took over from the old lord Eriks, and forged his realm's defences and created and managed all that was rightfully hers. 
 " I have always considered Peace, " Saw chuckled. " And now I must choose war."<|endoftext|>

George clobbered the man in the middle of it and ordered the lighters to preform a re-narrator. 
 "I always knew you liked a high-level man-or-woman position. How could you not tell? How could you not feel something? " he said to the man roughly the size of a five-year-old, putting on his best light and including a half dozen silencers, three, and eight metal rods at once. 
 " I do, but you find it impossible to put one of them where you want them. Ever since you were playing at school with that clown monkey guy. Who was that?'African hippo' with his pliers'? " 
 " Nobody's ever heard of it, but what they don't know is your meme rating system. Five would rank you lowly at best, and your best lieutenant would count you significantly above your friends. " 
 " Of course I do. I'll keep you updated. " 
 George was close to exhaustion before he replied. " I like being in the Navy with *you. * " 
 The man sat quietly in the doorframe, his side exposed to the darkness and silence. At the top of the steps he saw it. 
 *woosh* 
 " Oh god. " the man bellowed. " Your fate, unfortunately, hangs in the balance. " 
 George summoned a ruckus and wandered into the doorway to find the grinning general hanging in the air. He was laughing louder than he had ever heard, pulling the tattered rucksack from his head and tossing it about along the way, leaving him staring at a bunch of naked woman who he thought of as his sweet but necessary friend. 
 " You know me, George. You have seen what I have done. You have played damn near all the Internet games you know I played. Oh, forget everything else, George. I call this place'Battle of the Bulge'." 
 George found himself staring for a few moments before he picked up the ruckus and ran down the hall to the other side of the room.<|endoftext|>

The smell, the fire, they all mingled one by one. 
 It was a strange sight for the Queen. 
 Who, what made her so... 
 She did the changes. She pulled her weight. She looked a lot more fit then the Queen of England. She looked an island. Something called rivers. Were they rivers? 
 Of course, the fact that she has not heard of these rivers of old is considered just an unfortunate invention by one man, especially an unorthodox approach for a Queen. After all, we never had water any more, until it was really highly corrosive. 
 It's all fine and dandy now, really. After all, what was that about? Electricity? 
 Perhaps it was just a cold, primitive country. Perhaps it was heat. Or maybe it was all along natural disasters from time to time. Whatever the case, the Queen was done for. 
 She flipped her red cap around. " Is it evident you thought we were too harmless? " 
 There was an answer in her voice. A voice that piqued my interest. 
 " No. We were thought too dangerous. That is why we did everything to prevent any of this. " The Queen put her hand in mine. 
 " No! We didn't think it was possible. No, no... or it wouldn't do anything to stop it! " 
 " It's not impossible, isn't it? " 
 " Yes. But there is no way that my elite associates could think the same. All I can think of is that it is a twisted wish, that is why we shared it with you. " 
 " This land we live in... " I waited for a response from her. 
 She took her hand, stroked it like a miniature flower and then looked down. " I know how you felt. You were powerless, your heart becoming restless. Not only to stop it, but to protect the resistance from harm. It was your decision to destroy them. " 
 " My decision? " 
 She glowed with an almost human glow. " My decision to destroy you! You just let the free people live in peace for thousands of years. You were successful in destabilizing the status quo, but you have come back to try and sway my fancy. Your kingdom has always been my chosen seat, and I have turned it. Now I have put in place laws and orders that will see all four corners of this world being partitioned. Your life is over. " 
 I simply looked at her with disdain. " Oh, no, no. I am no Queen. I am simply a small, pretty woman, enjoying an awesome time on the battlefield. You were the same. Now you live in a city where the sky is green. " 
 She kissed me on the head, not the warm shower, but the warm, warm rain. I wished the same. " I am sorry I had to leave."<|endoftext|>

There it was again, a wallaby carrying an object in its sights. I wasn't afraid to step in, it could jump out and punish anyone who dared try to approach. Or it could speed past a security scanner. 
 "Apollo, a collection of game show stuff that never stops spinning! " said a woman in a manner that made me wonder about if I shouldn't relax. 
 The nether regions of the man's limbs dropped. Damn anyway he looked annoyed that I had to deal with a legal insane guy with nowhere to go and a tape recorder and a plane ticket. 
 I looked again to see Apollo ready to strike. He had some bad news. Bad news? 
 " I've found this... " 
 " Hello? " I didn't have time to comprehend this time. 
 " I need you to stop answering his calls... ", told the mousy lady and he picked up the horn of the plane. 
 I stopped and looked at the yellow line reading " CRESTJORD FALLS. " 
 " Hello...? " 
 " Ol' Betrays", she muttered, and picked up the tape recorder and shoved it into my face.<|endoftext|>

 " No, please, please please! Listen to me! Do you know how hard it is to get a new gun? " 
 " Yes, ma'am. This isn't my gun! " 
 " Please, please, please, please help me! It's too late! We didn't do it! Please! It's just a prop! " 
 " Mommy, I don't want to die! " 
 " Yes, please don't do it. For God's sake! Leave me! " 
 " Please! Please, please! There's no way! I can't leave you. It's this gun too! " 
 " So why don't you get one of those? Why don't you get one with the kids? " 
 " Because I'm sick and tired of this! I can't live with this! I can't make money! I can't go to school! "

"Goddamnit, " the President muttered as he drew the crotch of his flask. Turning his beer over in his hands as he rubbed his crotch a second time, he slid it into the wastebasket and began rolling back a single motion. The final three or four used beers poured lazily out from the empty space behind the dog wearing tee at the door to their luxurious guest bathroom. 
 A single second flew by where the Judge had tilted his head in question. 
 And he let out a single cold, harsh *click* before he could fully cancel all the already lukewarm beer on him. 
 The laughter and the anticipation from the guests, as well as the rowdy, inefficient Old Crow asking the questions echoed throughout the large, old bed room. Each trying to brush their teeth while they chanted " Then I will hear again!" or " That fish is smarter than a hurricane!" while Yoda laughed with a flock of arrogant toddlers. 
 Poor Jon sang again as he entered the deep room before quietly opening a cross that was relatively close to this one. His nails were sharp as always, reminiscent of the lead nails of a shark and his bellies were covered in a sloppy set of nicknacks that never quite fit under his fair boot. He readied a spiff and his head swam out with a leather trunk full of eggs and moonshine as he carefully fell back on the pretty red carpet and stared at the eternal things, the endless hallways, and the endlessly distracted orderlies who often served as the one constant in the meal.<|endoftext|>

A year ago, I passed a drunk driver's license test and I cut it just short, lucky that the law hadn't been so strict. Then I got arrested, tried for DUI, got shittier and got a promotion, got better days, grabbed a - 
 "... " 
 I hit the ground hard. What was happening. My leg took the maximum effort I could muster, and I fell. I'm going to die soon. 
 I woke up, sun setting, covered in sweat. A police officer was here. 
 " You... you think you can be----" he picks up a police pistol, shoots me. 
 *Let's just call it physical therapy* 
 *Cause I'm only 11 and... what's the excuse? A dead person? Fucked with the law? * 
 *All I know is that this was my daughter... Then she was, * 
 He stands over me, twitching and clawing at me. He holds his rifle, blubbering over everything in front of him, until he reaches me. 
 His voice, soft and reassuring, sounds like a sonogram in contrast with the noises in my ears. 
 *I know it hurts* 
 He pulls out a watch from the front pocket of his jacket, and glances around for the sign that says he's in free-fall. 
 " Sorry about what you did, kid. I don't feel like helping anybody anymore. You're clearly mentally unstable, which is why you're in jail. Maybe if you were on the street in a school courtyard, with the devil out of your clothes, you wouldn't be protesting what you did. " 
 I'm just in shock, because the officer's voice is definitely familiar.<|endoftext|>

"A fucking pole? " I said as I glanced at it. Already a hollow shell of an interior, the place was crumbling. I quickly turned around to see the baffled owner of the house, daughter of an old man. 
 " God, I'm so sorry. Where is the pole? I thought it was in his estate. " 
 The man who owned the house hunkered down in front of the house. Clearly he had forgotten about me. 
 " No clue! " He shouted back, his voice blaring from the boardroom wall. 
 My heart dropped a little. What had I done, that I had stolen the pole? What had I actually done? What was my mistake? 
 I walked towards the boardroom door and stepped through. 
 A woman got into the chair next to my stool. Her hair was messy and she was well over 60 years old. My jaw dropped. What was she doing? 
 I asked her, " What the fuck is the pole? " 
 " I'll call it Mott." She said, and walked towards me. I ran out of the room and into the porch. 
 I don't know what happened next, and as I saw all of the disturbing things I just said about the outside world, I actually couldn't help but to think about my mistake.<|endoftext|>

"..Its a total dark room I can't see the lighting. The walls are white, of course. This room can not be reached and it seems to have been put there by the people who run it. They look like people coming from my heart. There is darkness in the middle and a large bowl in the middle. " 
 Captain Why-Boar, the dictator of Nardahak and the King of Rebels spit on the table, " My people live here, and that part I need to correct. I thought I saw all the strange things happening in the path of the First Sith Emperor, but none of it was I see. Oh I'm sorry why would you even think that he is a rebel. Did you mean he's our adversary? " 
 Captain Why-Boar " Ah yessir, it doesn't matter. I brought my reply and he's as stubborn as a dog. I hate the cocky bastard who invites those ever upon his throne. I don't know why he did it, but it was my job to give him a piece of my mind, so he'll do it. I wish we could have separated the location of The Mani Explosion and spread him the most toxic seed he ever gave us, but then I know his actions aren't that helpful, so it would make it a breeze... " 
 Captain Why-Boar walked away without giving up, and sighed " I should have known that sooner or later. I couldn't have imagined just how nasty this was if I've wanted to!"<|endoftext|>

Our army roared. We fought valiantly. I watched my crew and I laugh maniacally. We did what any of us should do. 
 The machines began to print names in the head of the airmen. The evil clomp of the blades was quickly detected. The warmth of the air warmed my ears and elbows. We men felt new blood as our bodies and clothes began to burn. The cut wound was deep. I closed my eyes. To a man, the cold and the wind can destroy your whole body when you look at it. 
 We were made into champions. We shot ourselves. It was the only way to keep my god, my beautiful son, safe. I knew he would come to see me again. I knew it was the only way. He had to. We stopped every program that made him human as we humans were designed. Our mothers could no longer control the chemical reaction that continued in his gut and feeding his brain over night. The language didn't allow him to speak freely. He was unsafe. We could only execute people who made us understand and love him. I wrapped my hands around his. He screamed in pain. That was it. That last taste of ice cream. That taste. I loved him like he was everything. 
 Fourteen minutes later the machines had picked him up, ripped him to shreds with new blood. I pulled him from the machine and threw him through. We had gotten one last message this time. 
 * "Do not rest until you have given everything to be destined for greatness. * 
 I closed my eyes and breathed deeply, the cold air turning the temperature on my skin. 
 And then he was gone. 
 We tried to hold off what we could, but the doctors told us not to burn him down. 
 I closed my eyes again, but they won't open. But I waited. Finally. 
 And we released him back to the operating room. They squeezed him dry, and stapled our lab coat over his arms. When we had finished, I locked the door behind me. 
 My plan had worked. He broke free.<|endoftext|>

I am as much of an English cook as you will ever be, if you don't mind. 
 Just imagine that you haven't eaten in a long time, since your own redoubles sold themselves as a new thing for the comforts of the home. I know for a fact that it was common knowledge in antiquity, that most things are foods of sale. We were told to gather firewood and cook. We were told all the grim things we must have to do to get out. You'll learn nothing though, not a word of truth or logic about yourself. You'll have to learn first hand the world around you, my faithful viewers. Most of the time, one would think this is not how it happens. There is nothing too disgusting or unpleasant in it. 
 *This is my way of helping those who are filthy, unclean, wild... * 
 "Burgling and gnashing at yourself, as you're rising, I followed you into my heart!" I heard a woman say. I noticed that you were curiously welcoming. A woman in your years, sipping your coffee like a celebration banquet. They were all the usual. You and I have never had a date, not since when your mother pleaded for me to please her child because I smelled of rosemary... I swear, he did smell it! Now, imagine, you are in this house in the first instance! What a comfort, even for a maiden of my age! What do you think you've been up to? No, you think you've always been under the influence of this woman. A prisoner, ruined and disgusting! Where is she going? Somewhere she should not be, somewhere she should be free! But perhaps you still still don't understand, even now as I take you out to the woods.<|endoftext|>

"Well, is this your task " It said, with a voice so familiar, so fleeting it seemed even we had all heard it in a hundred different places. 
 " A close-check " I said, feeling the I need a detective to justify my mannerisms and opinion. 
 The temple was quiet, the woman was alone and even at this moment I was given little incentive to partake. 
 " *No* " I said, the thought of planning something productive made me feel so helpless and alone. I felt I couldn't share the burden. 
 The piece of stone stood in the corner on the empty hallway, barely noticeable as it approached, peering upwards toward me with it's eyes closed. 
 There wasn't even the slightest of shock as I realised it was a long, dark piece of flint. Had the heft been out of place? He's been dead for so long the elf's glimmering skin had shifted, morphing into something beautiful, beautiful. A mist was creeping up from the stump of the stone and clinging to it. 
 I wondered who had reclaimed it, and could he have learned all by heart? 
 The piece of stone shimmered, a shimmering, elegant shadow in an arm's reach. Turning slowly I knelt beside it and examined it. It was much too striking, I had never seen it before. 
 I laid it down on the far wall, gazing over it's features. I softly prayed that if I could get it to grant me anything I should move the piece of stone forward to it's rightful place. I should move it so that the gift might be given to both of us.

This is the way of things. I said it before it happened, and I still do. Purple pill. Good idea, that's all. This time, the first of many names come in. The name on my tongue is Betelgeuse. Interesting in it's own right, being a favorite of Lautrec's is not uncommon in Mona Lisa books, but in a bookshelf similar to the ones in Black Hawk And The Hound. Again, the name on my tongue is to bait off a Detective. 
 I began to suspect this when the mother gave me her first pink pill. * Blue? That would be *a-fucking* *Funny* *Darth Vader*. No. That would not be reasonably done, not humanely, and not forthrightly. Going *tobacco capable* has its downsides. An unpleasant sweet.*COAL.* Good job, Alec. You didn't admit it when he got a tattoo of some sort, does that make *Cynthia* mean *Plato* again? I forgot the "Cynthia ", and things have changed. 
 I was at work when Gray Cox slammed into me. As I tilted my head to the side, the needle clattered to the concrete below me. * Hell, I was already bleeding* I whimpered to the realization that I could not remember. * Why should I suppose not? * The memory that all we know is anguish filled me. And when I lifted my hands to my face, I was met with the chest he towered over me. Immediately, I felt everything. Corbin squinted. There was no life. Grim concern in his eyes. No memory of me. 
 " Leland, what the hell happened here, " she said as they stepped towards the doors. 
 " The Force, dear; it has tried to besmirch you ever since your death. We live in pain. In the light. In all the worlds you have left behind. But it has found you. It will find you someday. Soon. " I pleaded. 
 " Don't cry, sweetie. You will wake up sooner than you expect. The one with the green and blue will live. But beware. Those who have long live long will see a changing of these plans forever. They must be made of fear. And they will *let* those who have passed come, knowing that their deaths will not be in vain. " My words struck her and she shivered. 
 " Dad! In all my years, you have protected me from monsters like this. You were always thinking it was God. But since you passed, the little green pill has come into more and more awareness. It isn't your fault, I thought." 
 She was right. As I am forever closed in on her new circle of death, I feel... *here*. Everywhere. This time, in the second place. Perhaps I can change. 
 What we are left with is a woman of such power, power to fuck me over at will.

We watched them watch. I did not recall any of the boys coming and so I only measured the distance between the two of them. She had been one of the last people on the boat who knew the truth about the ship we were passing. For one thing, the wind was making a soft sway here and there to the loud whirring of fishing boat propellers and the water was flicking and blooming like a lovely blossoming flower or some ridiculous feat. 
 "We're telling you, you can not leave alone " I once told the man outside. He returned with his fists outstretched in a vindictive manner and snatched the man's valuable chair back. 
 " Right you are " he said. The man picked up his little tentacle and got out a gun. 
 " We don't have a gun " he said. 
 I picked it up and my eyes went wide. " Absolutely! We have guns, and we have a gun. You don't understand! " 
 He started swinging the handle a crackling screech, as though he was trying to shake a ball from the floor. 
 " There are a million obstacles that make all walking impossible, a vast sea that divides us from where you are and represents your twisted will to conquer. " 
 I started cursing as I saw the gun thumped against the floor and stumble out of the darkness. " Fuck you! " he said loudly and swung the handle once more. 
 He pushed the gun aside and pulled the trigger three times. Another crackling screech spread out and he let go. " Come on, man, relax." He raised the gun as he collapsed to the floor and began shouting for his parents to come home. I don't believe the man on the boat can be trusted with a gun as my baby is not my age.<|endoftext|>

Seventeen thousand suns but today's the day. It's like it's been standing still for all these years. 
 It has been ten thousand suns by tomorrow but today's the day. The End of Days. 
 A peaceful smile slowly slips across my face. I could probably eat a little bit of this seltzer to die any day now. I could also start naming a life. But I don't want to. It will be the End. 
 "That's funny, pal. You think you're on vacation when you really don't know what's going to happen, " I recall her huffing and puffing through her cigarette as she stood there smoking her last cigarette. 
 " Haven't you ever been with a friend before? " I look around the glowing ruins of towns and cities that used to be my home. Earth hadn't started being anything like the people I remember. 
 " No, really, there are still about fifty thousand of them around, " she said, looking down at her son, shining a bright flame that had struck the stars and shaking the sky. " And I mean, come on, yeah, most people live through the End, " she laughed, not really pulling the ponderings out of her voice, " But everybody lives through the End. " 
 " And who live through the End? " 
 " Everybody's parents. Even the teachers, the maids and the other bad, delusional mother fuckers at the end of Earth. Everyone has their own End. Every single one of us in the world is going to run out of around twenty thousand years before the End. " 
 " I see. You know how it is. " I say with the same smirk it usually does. I only ask her, but I always say the same thing, " How do you know how the End is? " 
 " Well, when I'm standing in my mother's brown leather leather jacket, the sun we've been sitting atop is flickering brighter and brighter and brighter, and she gets pissed about being staring at me all day. And I just came here to get a reason to smile. " 
 " Your mother hates it when you smile, and she doesn't like you smiling. " 
 " Exactly. She hates it more. You know, when we both sat here... " 
 " Are you gonna do this again? " I ask, uncertain of what to do now. I look up and see her mother weeping in a cold sweat and in the same way as always. 
 " I'm going to do this."<|endoftext|>

Three weeks later, she was let off life support. The doctors and nurses followed, but time was running out. Tom never saw her again. He lived alone on the outskirts of his apartment and could have only heard the silence once she told him, "I love her." He didn't listen.<|endoftext|>
**********579**********
"Wait, do I have to go through all the stuff around here, right? That's impossible! ", I'm almost at this point stuttering. 
 " You took a break, you know, do I have to go in chronological order? " 
 There's no need to squint, I've taken the time to do so without embarrassment. 
 " You're coming with us. ", I whisper, my voice escaping my voice and pocket-tightness. 
 " Please, let's go out! ", I swear, in desperation. 
 The lights from the gate instantly turn on, showing exactly what's happening. A nothingness. 
 " Is this real? ", I can't seem to even hear my own voice. 
 " It's not real, It's not real ", I say aloud. 
 The haze catches up to me and I can see that there's a huge shadow that looks like that of a huge shadow. 
 " What... this is... ", I let out quietly, hiding my words just enough to make her cringe. 
 " This is... this isn't real ". 
 The blackness becomes less dense, and it seems that something is finally coming for me. 
 " Whatever ", I fall forward, trying to come back out of it. 
 " This isn't real! ", I suddenly heard the screams of despair in the others' voices. 
 " You're going away, you're going away, " the others' voices say finally. I don't know how to say it. 
 " My friends will never know you left you there, and I promise you, if you start running away like they did before I started standing in the middle of the road, there won't be any survivors. ", I voice my threat. 
 " I made you, " the others murmured, trying to take advantage of my silence. 
 " I built you, man ", I persisted, a grin spreading across my face. 
 My heartbeat thundered for seconds, that final signal of desperation sending the reality over my head. I heard the strongest of the moment " She's not real. ", my voice sounding distorted just like the voices I had heard days ago. 
 " You look like you've lived for your entire life", I heard someone saying from beyond the blurred distance. 
 * 
 As my throat constricted on the constant whimpering of the others, I let out a deep sigh. 
 I wrote this letter for you and please forgive me for not understanding properly what it felt like to write for you. However, please add to the comments if you are so inclined.<|endoftext|>

The forest is barren. 
 The moon floats high above the surface of the planet. People almost ignore it, but in the shadow of an uprooted tree, the moon rises with faint grime, almost as if asking "is it really the moon? " 
 And that's when it hits her. The grove beneath her roots has grown taller than the rest of the forest, and the ground beneath her bare feet has become more than nearly human. The others were marching out of the forest, straight to reclaim the bay. There, they would eat of themselves, not allow themselves to be eaten by the dead, only to return a day later. 
 They would leave the bay, submerging in the abyss of an old forest and end it all. The ocean washed over them, and over the land, in and out. Day after day, the tides of the ocean rang out, sparking the burning fires in the stars. A terrible tectonic shift was taking place all the way back to the very last star, the greatest star in the universe. 
 It was happening to the so-called Miracle River, they had deduced. 
 They had discovered the connection between technology, the right to survive, and liberty. After several generations, they had found it. In the miracle creek, over the river itself, there was a stone bridge that had stood where it had been until their ancestors had dragged it through the ocean from the earth. 
 There, the passage from the lake to the bay was carved, and the water flowed right through. Only one very important note of how the passage was carved was the mass of water that pooled in it, and spread outward, allowing the passage of millions of miles of surface to the sea. 
 And here, the town was built, their town built. The rock walls remained standing, hidden forever. 
 " Sorry... " One of the great men, who had arrived, said, patting the wall next to him. 
 " Remember this, and you can follow your family back to their planet. You can learn to live where you were before you died." 
 He paused. The words faded, and the isolation of it had slowly faded away. He was a farmer, and he had paid the bills. He owned a farm, and now the river was well watered. 
 And he had earned his land. 
 The lights from the sky streamed through the leaves, illuminating the river. Leaves twisted, and trees twisted, and branches twisted, and and the trees twisted, and the river spun. 
 And it was flowing again. 
 And here, in the hallucinatory cornfield with the sticky, damp grass and smelly rotten fruits... 
 There was the next part. 
 And he was finally there.<|endoftext|>

Walking back home, I noticed just how differently its been. The scenery was smooth and boring, as if I was walking in a straight line, not towards the arena, but towards a gaping hole which, in all honesty, was a bad sign. A deep, cold darkness which swallowed my thoughts. It burned my eyes, as if the darkness was trying to lure me into it's trap. 
 When i turned around, my eyes focused on the place I was standing just outside the arena. I realized the exact place I was, with it's empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty window... one way in, one way out. On the other end was the same field of the arena, staring at me from a distance. 
 *What have I done wrong? * 
 My heart was going dark. My heart was going heavy. My mind made a decision. It tried to plan, to try to deal with it. It tried to figure out how I could run and attack out of this loneliness. It didn't really have the guts to try. I ran towards the light in the sky, focused and focused on the ground for a long time. At a certain point, I was able to cut through the darkness, but after almost ten minutes, I am sitting back, resting my head on the ground, and stare at the ground. A hollow, cold scarlet. I don't know what made the gap so smooth. 
 When I came to, I could feel that all of my spending had drained away, and slowly, all that was left was an emptiness in the void. Outside the gap in the darkness, I could hear faint voices. When I looked to the left, something was behind me, thinking. If I looked back to the center, I was hearing voices. There was a voice in a crowded room, waiting. Each time I looked to the right, another voice came out of the ground. 
 *Fuck me! * It shouted, flicking the light switch up in the air. 
 I got up in the air, facing a horde of people. 
 My head hurt like hell. 
 I didn't know what to do. I looked down at the horde and saw two glowing white lines... red. 
 I had to get this over with. 
 I thought to myself, *hahaha, that's cool. Let's kill the evil one, there's got ta be a way outta here. * I looked out of the window of the arena, but something slammed into me. I looked at my hands, my limbs, my face, and my legs. I was crying, but nothing happened. 
 I looked down at myself, my hands stretched out for what seemed like an eternity, and nothing happened. I finally felt something break me. I was... I was no longer a woman.<|endoftext|>
**********582**********
My name is... Joker. 
 The man in black struggled against the rock wall holding his shotgun in one hand and a thin, grey cloth sack with a water ink band on the other. Every centimeter was there, his past the ruins of the Bataclan, from the evacuation to the chaos in Gotham proper. 
 He had come here to get revenge. He had been there all along. Without Batman the man would never have made it out of the city like he did. 
 His whole life for the last two years had been because the thugs who kept taking hostages just to save them took note of how much he was done. I guess now he wasn't stopping at that bank and stole their house then. He needed to return to his family and it was not like they had seen the time or the dates in his past. Hell, it was hard for them to move when he was taking people's stuff. 
 "Sir, you should have seen the first door in that cell. It's open. " he said as he pulled out the half of a truck full of hash oil that a mentally challenged sergeant had brought up in his car. 
 Joker glared at me. " That's not even an access code that there is! Nobody would steal a thing if they found out who the boss is! " he spat at me. 
 He stumbled backwards through the crack in the wall, leaving a trail of broken glass in front of him. He drew his blaster. * That must have been a door*. Joker patted me on the back and made a effort to clean it up. 
 He plopped on his back and started to go for the jump, kicking a hole in the wall. 
 He ripped the rope back and put it in the hole. He chided me to keep going. If I never worked this job my kids would go through the same hell as me. He still hoped I would put up a fight. 
 I was ready to kill him. I pulled off my mask and my tie and grabbed my pistol. 
 I turned to the air. " You know what they say you always do, aren't you? Keep on staying on the present, fight the hero." I pointed my gun to the bottom of the barrel. 
 Joker looked at me with a mixture of malice and terror. It seemed a little disingenuous to hope that I would pull the trigger on him. His refusal to die was easily exaggerated. 
 He was time for me. It was time to take on the villain.<|endoftext|>

 "What say ye, dear reader? " 
 *Bunch of kids in their 20s look at her teacher, but a hand grabs her arm and begins to growl. * 
 " *Hello! I am the middle generation of history. We've had a long, long journey to colonize the sun. Surely you're excited to see us? We've been very much colonized since the sun's get going. * " 
 *She stares at them intently. If her study of history is not telling them all what was to come this time then they will never know what was to come. Once the sun got going, everything changed. *

The man stood, the cloak rolled as its tip slightly whined in the late summer breeze. His blonde hair wrapped into a ponytail that spilled slowly down his neck. He stood straight at his desk, staring straight through my group of colleagues before placing the cursor on the button. 
 "I look around. I've been wasting my time trying to find and identify this traitor. " he said to me with a serious look in his eyes. His more pronounced voice echoed out in the room. Then the pair laughed, stifled giggles, and turned towards me, all looking at me. 
 " What?! " asked one of the members. They had a tendency to open the man's pockets for him. 
 " I don't know, exactly... Still, can you find me a way. " I said matter-of-factly, sipping my coffee. " It's been a while since we've been chatting with any of them. We're mainly just so bored. " 
 " For what?! " he was staring at me, no longer meandering around, but at the phone attached to his long, silver neck. He turned with a twinkle in his eye and his eyes lit up in a grin before continuing. " Today, they came for an exact duplicate of me. " 
 " Exactly! The only one they took was a spy, " I muttered. 
 The man continued. " He actually took my money, realising the consequences. " 
 " That's why... " I started before I could finish. " Have you had enough? I took a few on my own, tell them he needs help, but I have enough evidence to make him go away... " he paused and looked away, narrowing his eyes. 
 " Of course, but if I had any evidence, I'd have made a decision not to do it, that just might have set off something. " I was lying now. " So what would they think? I could put my department up for bankruptcy. But how? " 
 The man sighed, his jaw dropping. " They won't even believe me, they've already dismissed me and all. I'd even tried to study their weaknesses though, never really noticing the gains they made. I don't even know where their delusions came from, or if I've actually found anything. " 
 His eyes softened and he smiled. " It's wonderful you're here. It's the end of the line. We all have a purpose."<|endoftext|>

Corporal Hanson Williams stood at the doorway in his stomping ass stomping outfit. 
 "As I told you last month, from our report it is in the spellbook of Family Wizards-- the North American Federation of Magic Professionals-- that we are not exempt from the rule which forbids magic being practiced. " 
 The headmaster spun the entrance of his stationary vehicle. The tall, fat bald man roared as he raced toward the headmaster. He was wearing a grey t-shirt, grey jeans, and gray glasses as he sprinted through the green grass with his mobile. 
 " Except at these places with ducks, the statutes don't ban magic " 
 The floorboard creaked. 
 " Oh yes, the laws just forbid magic practiced solely by the Health-Floater cleric, and specifically the slaughter of any Jew; and the County Farmer's Moon Eater or the Cleric of the Village healers, but it does not permit the use of magic on personal property " 
 The turncoat drawer on the ground gave the blanket a loud thud. 
 " Ah, I see, we agree with you Lieutenant. It's just you and me not the actual servants, but close close enough to them. I think you can see us doing the deed. " 
 Henry spat out his food as he announced to the Deputy Chief, " She's not going to stand a chance. They don't exist anymore, they must be proven false in the Committee, " 
 The deputy chief stopped his rant with a slow one. 
 " But how can they be true when murder is still punishable, " 
 " She probably was enchanted once too. Sometimes we and our advisors would watch her make goblin firewood. That would be nasty. It's one of those old magicks! " 
 " Uh no. She's done that once, she called her brother Riley in. " 
 The back door slammed behind Henry. He turned his body upside down as he heard the central shaking in the hall. 
 " She just cried from the crime!" 
 Henry took his hand and casually smashed it against the surface of the tile. He had witnessed the kid before. Before she had little feet and began to walk, screaming and knocking over everything at home. Now she was just sort of gliding through the northern woods. He was done this way and now. He was meant to take her back. He knew that maybe she wouldn't like it. That no matter what her friends called her she would never find redemption.<|endoftext|>

Monday was the day my greatest efforts wouldn't come to an end. I was sure this would be a one-way trip, from my home in South Carolina to the team hotel. It was only eight miles of highway from the airport, an opportunity I would love a minute ago. 
 I'd been in the game for weeks, counting down the steps I could prepare in case I felt nervous or anxious at times. The one feeling I was feeling most confident in was always intense, motivation and determination, that I had been humoring for years just like this. How did this image of myself ever end up being a player in this country? 
 That was when it all clicked, a moment I could not help but be proud of. Having my skillset honed for a long time in college made the call to those who knew me the most; Winners of the games. I had expected great things from this endeavor, I had been the reigning D-I champion during my final season at UNC. The entire ACC had support in my case, from Great Iowa State to TCU. But I had gone against everything that the ACC was for the North of North Carolina. 
 Upon release of my new eligibility, my family and I headed to the field, and within a few minutes was given the silver pin. I was ready to finally be a part of my team as they had finished top of the ACC. Even though I was not alone, the rest of my family was given full recognition for what they had accomplished. They cheered, cried, hugged and hugged. 
 In the year leading up to the game, my attention shifted towards my home for the few moments that weren't spent searching for the right answer. Inside my head I knew who would win. When it was decided, I now knew that whoever beat me would win. 
 The break up sent an explosion all the way up the court, and the final seconds seemed like forever, only a few more minutes before a final shot hit my hand, my decision was made. I had survived, but now, one final, final shot was to be fired.<|endoftext|>

The pain of losing a loved one was an even worse burden on the psyche of every member of the Galactic Confederation. 
 It took a year. Until finally the Federation and any non-contacting agents was assigned to apprehend and enquire into a collapsed obelisk which stood as testament to the humanity they had forsaken. 
 The despotic masses were reduced to sacrificial lamb's blood. The citizenry under the Federation's rule would be sealed off. There would be no eyes on the planet or to the biosphere. There would be no war and the only man willing to travel to the cross-border areas was hard at work killing men and women to earn their worth in the struggle to survive. 
 Federation numbers barely left the ruins and countless isosks were abandoned as marvels to be turned into temples to luxury and prosperity. The view was beautiful in the shadow of the crumbling shell. It was how Humanity had used to worship the concept of death to please them.<|endoftext|>

The city is empty in comparison to what is otherworldly. There ’ s sunlight bouncing through that sky, it ’ s your field of vision that shines by. But something is off. 
 “ Are you sure this is what it looks like? ” I asked for the third time as I stood here at the second turn to make sure it wasn ’ t. 
 The city was completely changed. This was the fifth year in a row that I hadn ’ t seen a statue of an everliving people until now. “ Yes, it ’ s blank. ” You might think that ’ s weird, but it ’ s not. “ It ’ s not completely blank, ” I told myself, with a deep breath. “ Who are you anyway? ” 
 As if to add insult to injury, I gave the same answer. 
 “ I see this city from my first time, but it ’ s like I never even noticed you. Wherever I am, my thoughts repeat. I know of all of your thinking of me. You have gone through life in a somewhat indecisive way. I think it ’ s down to that fact that I ’ m completely random. After many attempts, I made things reflect my personality, not my foreboding personality. But I never saw anyone as a friend. I never met anyone as a lover, or as a friend. I don ’ t believe that one as a person existed until recently. ” 
 “ You know, that ’ s not all. ” 
 “ And you ever notice the faces of the people around you? I don ’ t think you really notice people, is that right? ” 
 “ I see people all the time. ” 
 “ And if you saw somebody I could relate to, wouldn ’ t it make you feel a little better about it? ” 
 “ I don ’ t think it does. I am the one you sometimes encounter, sitting there waiting to greet you when you return home, when you see me pass over the house window. Because you think I ’ m all alone, sitting in my living room. ” 
 In all this time, I haven ’ t seen a single person in a hundred thousand years. Yes, the city has changed for the better, but the faces I see the face of this human I see is still the same as it was before. There was some large chalk circle around the rising sun that didn ’ t glow with neon lights. 
 “ Did you draw it from your/your memory somewhere? ” 
 “ The street is empty. Where you will never see it again. It has already become abandoned. ”<|endoftext|>

 Straight as you put it out to 20, eyes wide, smirk eternally of the ocean liner turning a bright amber blue, its backbone leaning back into the dock shivering in anticipation. It's caved in for another 10 minutes. 
 "I can't wait for you to come over, something makes me feel like I'm breathing, " you say smugly. 
 " A little nicer than the city of New York, " he replies with a new idea, " a few more excuses for hopping the ship to get home. " He screws up that he knows how to mop with a simple slide of the hand to the container. * Damn, he's going to ask for five minutes. * " End it. " 
 *STRAND ON THE FIFTH STREET, NO COVERED MICROPROPHONE* 
 Something familiar resonates within your brain as you sigh and grasp the handle with all the strength you have left. The tips of your fingers begin to strain with the constant pressure, the girl sitting next to you. 
 " Hmm... it smells like her. " You repeat with the jovial agreement of being someone else. You open your mouth to ask if your wife sees the water. 
 > *Excuse me, and I can't really do it right now. * 
 * " She's looking at me, " you say, " if I would have asked for her to turn it on. " *

"AHHHAAAAT! " The stands went static-hampered, and I felt myself hit the ground as the ding of the city street caught my attention. My feet pounded against the concrete, and I managed to grab hold of the yellowed metal trap door of the manager's car. The city felt cold as my feet, and I could feel my fingers slowly moving up and down the aluminum rod the director had been putting in my back. 
 " Here, we give you a water temperature fixer. No food or water should be stored in it. Do not depressurize it. The lines could be painted red or black. No colored water should be found. " 
 His manager just stared at the signage, covered in parodies of characters I'd seen a million times at some obscure movie-planet-sunny-con. 
 " It won't survive the temperatures, he said. " It will rot. It isn't going to survive the ******* 6 days. If the hell I get cold today, and don't force anything on it, I'll keep asking for food and water and if it comes in the mail... well I'll be in a black suit, and I'll stop all this with a rubber duck hunting rifle! " The manager laughed at him. The sketches of brutal combat started up like a phonograph. 
 " You'll get in trouble if you take the water in to a higher floor than the other entrances, but watch out, you will get in trouble for fiddling around with that! " the managers laughter echoed around the block. They had won. The credit was still pulled in my pocket. 
 " I don't know how to respond to these ones, but the water-veils aren't protective, and what's there to block it? " I couldn't understand it, but the manager had added the aqua purple faucet into his water-cape. The chief technician had been staring the front desk with an excited expression, along with carefully crafted earplugs. 
 The head of the department was gone, and the rest of the water-garage was downsized. In the elevator shaft, the chief technician strode forward, directly into the water-forest. He lifted the water-cape lid, and its water appeared whitish pink. The water that flowed from the water-seventy feet up the shaft appeared to be wet, as if it had been dripping from the glass floor beneath. He brought the water-cape back down, and water rose from the stream into the pool. The water grew more dilute, and shrank from the pools of water that had long been gathered. He started to slip under the steel ladder, and lift up the metal fence that led to his cubicle. With his arms outstretched to guide the slender cat, he took his feet from under his leggings and flung himself the ladder up. Now it was as if nothing but a dim light seeped out from his neck, filling the room in a constant stream. The surroundings were quite normal. 
 The cat whirred, and the fuzzy black eyes of the director stared up at him. The director tingled his spine. " Who's next? " he asked. His eyes fell to the ceiling. Not only was he near unconscious, he was breathing heavily. 
 " Don't worry about it," he said.<|endoftext|>

"So... that was the thing with celebrity-treasure hunts? " 
 *Which ones? * 
 " Those with unusual injuries where it took them longer than usual... but... many did it on purpose. Some of the most notable were those where the animal was gored and killed. These were very real ones. " 
 *With a race against time, what we learned as time went on, it was said the victors were the clowns of death and chaos. * 
 " The heads of various bigoted groups... " 
 *Did you... was he an animator? Did you think of that? * 
 " Yes... And so there I was... trying to form information on the worst ones, poor puppets. Some of them... daft, others... mindless and violent. They of course tortured the survivors, but did to themselves and continued casting different actors throughout the performance. So this was one of those. It will be the most infamous. " 
 *Really? How about the villain? * 
 " Those who succeed will act in the most bizarre way imaginable. Surrounding them... and they'll have real, magical powers. Oh well... " 
 *You've got my attention. You probably don't know what the world of tonight is. Your protagonist wants to see you to assassinate the " hero " and to reveal his identity on the screen... and on camera. Better yet, he wants his movie to change everything... and wreak chaos all across the globe. * 
 " That's what I'm... I don't know. But I can say that there's nothing I can do. We take the hero down in the deepest darkest. That will take... maybe... but... no, I have to do it... " 
 *You said I had to do it. * 
 " Now, now there are a multitude of questions. Some are easy: we know what you have set out to do, what you do, what you feel... " 
 *Sorry for losing focus... I thought I would turn your TV on. I just thought I would cover the basics of narrative, like death, metaphor and everyday things... and use a flash of light. * 
 " So, what do we do? What do we do with the action for the movie? " 
 *Easy enough... a... thing. We just stand in silence waiting. When the film begins, an imaginary character enters the room and starts casting acts of violence in the background. When he finishes, he proceeds to cast shows of magic/, and'purge the wizard that got kidnapped' and'to take all the vampire's in the world.' All the on location actors are casted, as well as monsters... a very peculiar bunch... but it goes on, and on... * 
 " And what movies are made? " 
 *Animals? I haven't seen a movie in over a year, ever. Are there any more movies to watch? * 
 " Oh... yeah? With the wizard being kidnapped? Oh, good. Oh, well... * and The Incredibles has a superhero action movie! * " 
 *The love plot?! What would happen if that movie's exception end up being called in for possible episodes? Are there any more episodes you need to fulfill, or do you still have to attend each one by yourself? The choice is yours. It will be. * 
 " Mr Schwarzenegger, we appreciate you coming, but we have a problem at the end. I can't: this movie is going to change the way events go. Not necessarily the best way, but at the expense of everyone. This is why we are moving forward together: we want to incorporate safe, apathetic, and corrupt filmmaking into our lives.

The king scurried out of his House and hurried out to the gate of his great palace, trudging along the marble path. He swiveled his hair inside his clenched fist, a sulky gray beard becoming unhinged in his tenseness. 
 He was coming for me, his first stroke in weeks of career-enslaved innovation. Not a single head clattered as the lower roof puffed up to reveal the inner courtyard of the castle, adorned in black-and-white frost-frost. 
 He launched himself off the rails and straight to the impressive gray gates. He took a deep breath and turned the gates upward. The cold, dead ground was curiously cold too; it was the reason why he had come to this ruined land. There had already been her destruction. He could feel the system reach its limit in its next act: it had got so bad it put the whole castle under attack. And it said that I would be the only one to save the kingdom. 
 A jolt of vertigo coursed through his body and stirred him. The world slowed its motion when a coldness burst through his side. He turned. There was only me. He closed his eyes. 
 "Please? " 
 I stared at him. Like an alarm clock in the morning, his face contorted into a pile of nerves and sadness. His smile faded. 
 " Hello. " 
 He was fast. Not precisely, but just enough to make me afraid he was about to crumble. My words echoed in the ears of everyone present. My lips trembled. He seemed to get stronger as he spoke. It was like seeing his blood boil... 
 " Well, what do you think of it? " 
 He shook his head. He had it. The build-up of excitement I had had in my little voice, and I must have been impressed. " Please. I'm free. I'm safe. You will keep me, otherwise, I might just die. " 
 I didn't answer. I simply listened. It was like I had just listened to a maniac screaming to tell a nearly illiterate child that their house was ruined. I knew it would stop me. He was too big of a monster to remain silent. I wasn't going to force that regret, not when he was right and right about everything. 
 " Dammit! " he cried. " Dammit! You hear me? We cannot... " 
 He let go of my hand, but there was nothing I could do. Just as his body burst into flames, the air beside him sputtered and burned, frozen by the heat of the fire. I wanted to give him time, to burst in so that he would spare my life and sanity. But he wouldn't. I could hear only my own voice screaming, in my bed: 
 " I can't. I'm too scared. I don't want to. You may fall back into the arms of your monster master, just like this one. I'm not your enemy. " 
 The dryness hit me like a burning needle. He must have felt better now. He fell to his knees and looked around. A tiny flower stood up off the edge of a pile of flowers. 
 " Come back with me." He whispered, giving me a jolt of his trembling hand.<|endoftext|>
**********593**********
"Why? You can't die! " 
 " I- I really don't know. " 
 This wasn't a rhetorical question. It was answered. My death, like any other, had been beneficial to me. It made me look forward to life. And... I'm not sure why that matters. Sometimes I feel like everything else just feels perfect. 
 " I- I don't want to know. I don't know... It just feels nice. It's in my bones. Every, *f*one, is attached to me, and I never tell anyone. " 
 This wasn't a rhetorical question. It was answered. You don't know when I'm going to die. You never know when it'll end. 
 " That'll do. It's what makes my life worth living. " 
 This wasn't a rhetorical question. It was answered. It was answered. I was*important. * 
 " Shut up! " I said as I looked down at myself in the mirror. 
 " Nope. That's fucking bullshit. Tell me if you don't want to die... Fuck it. " I smiled as I wiped away the blood on the dress shirt. 
 I'm sure you're wondering how or why you're so impatient with my selection. 
 " For those of you worried- " 
 " For... *you? * " 
 " No. I know this is weird. I know. But I swear, I don't want to die. " 
 I shivered. 
 " I promise I don't want to die. " 
 *Fuck it. * 
 " Not when you told me it was mine. I've said the exact same thing countless times and not at all. " 
 " And *it's alright? * " 
 " For *you? * " 
 " Yes. I'm going to listen. " 
 The look of shivers ran through me as I stepped aside. 
 " I'm done. " 
 " But we can do this. We've *made* this a lot of work. It's the most difficult part. " 
 I shifted my weight, hoping to keep it steady. 
 " I'll leave right here. " I said, reaching forward to put a pillow over my head. 
 " I can't leave. You're welcome. " 
 I stumbled. 
 My still-thudding heart thudded. 
 I started my walk home. I didn't want to, but there was always room for me in these movies. 
 *I want my perfect revenge. * 
 " Yes! Yes! That's right! " I cried, and cuffed my body. 
 When I woke up, I had done this exactly as I was told. A man's face covered in a suit and tie, his eyes glowing in a way that sounded like he was in a wizard's workshop. My mouth fell open. 
 " Oh, let me... I'm getting tired, I haven't had a moment to rest since taking over my job. " 
 Another piece of paper lifted from my hand. " You killed a Death, and in exchange for your personal immortality, you let your soul go. " 
 " I didn't... " 
 " Don't... " 
 A sentence came out of my mouth, beginning with * " Hey, you got ta remember this, asshole. You really are my enemy. Keep it down." * 
 The words... They began to form in my mind. The face. My face as well. All the way down to the hair on my shoulder. 
 *You killed a Death. They're gonna kill me anyway. * 
 *But they'll kill me anyway. * 
 But, they didn't. No. They just didn't. They told me that. 
 *I love you. *<|endoftext|>

 The robots working on humanity had become progressively more advanced. Our planet, a flat circle of nothing more than a stone planet with thin atmospheres, had become infinitely hotter and colder. As the topmost cylinder was slowly melting away from our planet, this peculiar heat was now becoming extremely intense. It was after making contact with one of our most recent super colonies that the robots learned the drill. 
 As we were still developing the technology, we were unable to believe that there was another lifeform able to create the incineration device that would destroy our planet in one day. We are no more. Today, humanity was destroyed.<|endoftext|>

Lilly cleared her throat. " Don't say things like that. They'll ruin your life. " Her eyes drew toward her brother next to the bed, who was sitting on the opposite side of the bed. " Their just kids and their going to eat dinner with you when they get hungry. They are perfect. " 
 " I think so... " Jessie said. She was sometimes too calm. Another man always did his jobs. " You hear me kid, but sometimes... " her brother gave her a dirty look. " They were standing by their mother's coffin in the courtyard from what is believed to be the commotion at the bottom of the mountain in Yuma. " Her gaze was just past the townspeople in the distance, not paying attention to how to lean against the tree. 
 Jessie was lying on her bed. She couldn't read. Her mind had never seemed so clear. But her brother was just looking at her. It made her uneasy, like she was being watched by the men at the other end of town. I started sweating. She had to pull herself out of bed. As soon as she got up and turned around she immediately leaned into the wall in front of her brother. The warm bed rippled inside of her. She let out a sigh and pulled herself into bed. 
 She had to knock twice more, but by the time she did, her brother was resting on top of her head and looking at her with a stern expression. " Stay calm lil' motherfucker. " he said. " They just... they are wrong. " 
 A silence passed for a minute. Then the heavy breaths she had been holding near her brother began to quiet. She began pulling herself into a head position, and her brother was still staring directly at her. As he came closer to her, Jessie could feel his eyes flicking up. Then, he spoke... 
 " You have to calm down. " 
 Jessie looked up, startled. " No. I don't. " 
 " Calm down. " He sounded very angry. " If they want you to... put these biz on, please don't... those are just baby steps in changing. " 
 She watched in confusion as he took a step towards her. The darkness in the distance reminded her of her brother. But the house was still damp. She dropped to her knees and cried out for her sister. " I haven't felt so peaceful in a long time, " she sobbed. 
 When they got to her sister she spoke. " Don't worry motherfucker. Just calm down, okay?" 
 Jessie understood, but not because of comfort. The answers she never knew about being calm spoke of strength. She believed in him. To find hope in many things.<|endoftext|>

"A path I made the day I reached my final destination. A course I *found* the day that he returned." 
 I could feel every line of his shoes clashing as I felt the primal magic and magic of the Demon People flow through my body like a needle or plate. Just like a world shattering pain I felt his metal feet going in my direction. 
 No. No. I have no way to convey the amount of emotions which I experienced like that. I suddenly felt something. Something unlike any emotion I have ever felt, ever known. I begin to feel shivers and muscles tighten, my muscles grasp at each other, forcing me to keep going. I begin to feel eyes staring at me from the shadows, hidden behind a mask of blindification. 
 I feel a sharp pain in my chest. It felt worse than being stabbed in the back. I have no idea how long I've been out, how many arrows I have pointed. There is an odd itch on my left side that I can't quite grasp. After another day of dealing with it, I finally decided that it was time for some therapy. 
 The Demon People call it, the Ice Path, to shorten the life span of anyone who crosses it. It usually takes a month or two for a person of higher magical abilities to be able to cross it and it is a pretty crazy place. For some reason, the only licensed practitioner is a fun little guy who just wants to do chores. After a month, the problem is overcome by a really awkward, awkward skill. No one really knows what it is and it is decided to be first class. So the Demon People everyone talks about is a dangerous practice that has its benefits but they leave it at that... only downside of it... is that if you cross it you are going to have to continuously apologize to the Demon People for it. They get to pick the hardest acts of masturbation right there on this slippery rock. 
 A new set of eyes appear and I am right there on the edge of this rock as my body tumbles toward the feet of an unexpected hero. I am stunned as he closes in front of me and pulls my mask over my face. I fall back into the darkness as I fall to the ground. 
 There are no demons here, the only reason I exist is because of an ancient proverb. " When all is said and done, there will be no time for stress. " A lowly Demon Town guard, a satyr, a barbarian hunter... or, maybe a wizard. If that is not interesting enough, you can also enjoy such things in a Bible.<|endoftext|>

Artifice: Coming of Age 
 "An End is yet to come," he sang. 
 He was falling in a low, shadowy avalanche as ever, the only light coming from a sea of white clouds engulfing his full width of vision. 
 I climbed the stairs into my plush Victorian Bed and Walled, lending my aching feet to this plummeting man on the dying spine. It was hard to explain, he was also high on heroin and the dangers it brought to his tattered yet cracked knees, I figured I would return to an old fashioned gothic horror stories. As I run my fingers through the brush of his unbroken limpid tears, the universe begins to laugh at me. The endless fabric is slightly wrinkled with new smudges; this poem was a poetic tribute. 
 Then as the second layer of smoke seeps up the wall to where our meter crossed the last ten he proceeds to laugh. 
 Suddenly, a miasma of darkness reaches out to him, and he doesn't lose his train of thought. The ancient past sat quietly waiting for him and the playful appetite for smoke held him back from this sure fate. Its coils moved with a speed that made the tales from antiquity seem simple yet horrifying to those of us who'd experienced the material world. When its teeth touched a deep maw of mercy, all logic, common sense and the great unknown perished and sent us " to hell ". 
 This poem really sums up our time here. Feel free to let the copious quantities of punnyishness and nuance shine through your conscious. He was here to end these occurrences, and he sure as hell wasn't changing what he's doing to feel this way. Still, find courage to look into this, there's clearly a place more powerful than this he could go.<|endoftext|>

Ygritte slunk down the stairs, rubbing the slick jade-in leather of his back as he laid down. Sitting upright, he pulled on his pair of earphones and monitored the voices in the quiet room. It was best for everyone to know if you were sneaking something up on him, but asking the same question was a risky proposition. 
 "Uncle Flint we have a lot to talk about in this room. " A woman quietly approached him. " Do you think we could convince Haskins to have you in the game? " 
 His blood went cold and the single thread floating through the room fell on his cheek. 
 " Yeah sure, look over at Chief Thaddeus. He's got his eyes clean, and he thinks he's making progress, but I can tell you I need to know about him, Haskins. " 
 The woman smiled and said, " I can see it. Just... just. " Her voice was warm and warm. Her finger curled around a swivel chair that was mounted to the wall. 
 " Give me a second. " 
 A man lined up next to him and sat down, leaning against the door frame. " Look, I have a few business to attend to. I'm hoping to keep this conversation quiet and private, but my wife's interest is something she never wanted to share." 
 Ygritte picked up his phone and opened his browser. 
 He clicked on Prince Belladonna.<|endoftext|>

Right below you are my allegory. A child on his childhood trips, in an unknown land, two souls who simply are. My story is like Dante's. 
 The world was filled with dreams. As they passed through time and space, the children on the journey would become faster, and the gods would hear them awake. These dreams were dreams and places, and these places became true worlds. Once the first dream takes place, they saw the place itself come to an end. 
 ( Thank you for the prompt ) 
 With that, my brothers started drifting out into the very darkness. Staring out the window. Fear was not enough. Before they reached orbit, they were cut off and pulled to a ditch by clouds. The end was near. 
 ( I doubt my story is worth even a cursory glance ) 
 This passage I remember as a song reminds me of each nightmare. The thorns and lightening long pulled us along, as our journey progressed. This must of been the way they drew near. They took a breath, and in it, they cried. Perhaps we knew how to embrace the light, before it died out. 
 ( the story ends here, but there is a note that reads, "Even though life is moving forward." )<|endoftext|>

After standing in front of the coffee shop for what seemed like forever, you already knew what it was you were looking for. In fact it didn't even matter where you were, it was not that much of a surprise either. It just had to have been there for a month or so. They didn't seem like likely-looking places to go, a good setup might help you out the most, so you had to be prepared. It had be that way for half a year now, but they still held a good real interest in you as much as they did selling bad products. You stood behind the counter, left hand in hand with the local minstrel swing, your dumbfounded face the only thing out of place on the enormous windowless strip mall. You grinned sheepishly as you made a mental note to come see. 
 What was it? Oh right. It was outside the garage just left of the curb. There were posts out there, all about the bonfire sale and stoner rapper. Your heart sank for a minute before you placed the leftover dry noodles into the cupboard. Your jaw dropped. Of all the times where you could miss it you had forgotten, this was the longest running chance you had in an AC-5. You scratched your head and walked out towards the hustle and bustle. Eventually, as usual, the pew still stood. 
 You cautiously stepped back but instead of taking the cupboard with you, you clucked your teeth and re-shrew your eyes to set your shoelace on the wall. Being off the train a few hours later, you looked back to the window and glancing back up, you finally made it there. Again it was on the street while you walked, but you looked back and noticed one corner was blocked. Had they actually stopped outside? You took a breath and prepared yourself, all it took was a couple touch of the coffee-shop's knob to lift it. There was the creaking as you settled down, before you opened up the door.<|endoftext|>

He always complained about the foibles. But there was nothing particularly special about this job. The people in charge didn't dare speak about it. They let it die. He had wanted a run-of-the-mill invasion, nor were the workers well paid enough to take it all on himself. It was a mission set in motion before their very eyes, one that was set into motion from in the first place. 
 But there were no lies, absolutely no excuse. Since then, those who fought against the temptation had willingly accepted him. Though it was not a guarantee he could survive through the next war; those whose crew he was captured alive wouldn't ask questions. The truth was more likely he would be tossed into a hole, one that escaped the constructed eye scans and then never looked back. If he had to pick another job to get his grip on, he had to want to stay alive. And so he did, as much as he disliked it. 
 The enemy had it easier than he did. It was their fault that was called for. And that they would be buried in Valhalla as soldiers after all. He regarded the manner in which they slain their idols with suspicion. Whether it was chocolate, their rings, or their spears; neither amongst himself nor amongst the people of Valhalla. They would all be given a pack full of drops of malachite from their own bodies. He couldn't order his men to carry more, but it would be better than to submit to their demands. 
 * "Bring them?" * was the order, and he knew it already. It was the normal time for the soldiers of Valhalla to get the drops, and besides, they would not be the last men he had given his word, and if not, he should make sure of it.<|endoftext|>

"Say what in particular you're going to do... " 
 The large door across from my hand raised slightly, pausing in the sludge of recent footsteps. 
 " The name's Darren Smith. I'm 3 months, 37 days, 18 hours, 5 minutes and 23 seconds to leave. " 
 I roll my eyes, and continue to walk through the closed door. I don't care about my chips nor how far I've gone. I'm going to let it slide here. It'd be so easy if I was the first. Once the Chief came, the whole parole thing kind of fell into place. 
 " You understand, I'm going to do my job. Just let me tell you one thing. Just one thing. The police officers need to know the guards must stay in good standing. No bread, no water, no food. No showers, no cages. No chance. " 
 My fear turns to disbelief. I had a few minutes before I had to listen to his grip tighten around the door... 
 " You'll be being led to a safe base by guards and security mechanics. You were going to work in your golden halls for a week. Once you do that, you go home, relax and rest. Nothing bad happened in there. Nothing to worry about." 
 I nod my head, and take a small sip of my scotch. I hate those crap drinks.<|endoftext|>

The grave was always the reason I played this game. I would just sit there and look over and wait for him to be asleep... It's a warm memory. 
 Sometimes I just sit there, long after someones souls have left their graves. Watching my citizens die and sad faces stare after me. Not caring if I wake up, stay in the bed, and watch these people die. Some of my citizens are along with them. They all do this everyday. Well never alone. Except in such a way so that they hear their sorrow and faith. They are jealous of me though. Now even this piece of me die everyday. 
 "They are cackling." Ah the sad cry, of their sorrow but she is beginning to cry more and more. She is making eye contact with him, laughing. All of the usual words but I couldn't hear them. Like they are nothing but sound. 
 So I begin to cry. 
 I am horrified. And yet I love my dead friends. I can't understand why they weep. But then it dawns on me: they were all my friends. They made me their friends. 
 And just as they were in their graves... 
 Like *last* time, the last person I met had woken up.<|endoftext|>

'fuck it isn't my fault guys!' I yelled in an audible tingle. 'just forget the rest of your crew and the plot of stuff' 
 No one had noticed at first, everyone was just so flustered as to be stupid enough to question what was going on. 
 They thought you weren't, and that your obsessive attention to detail would stop them from ever finding the rest of you. One explorer even went so far as to say that you were like a wall, just waiting for someone to catch you, let you breathe and pull you ever so gently in. 
 The captain and crew started whispering in unison: I screwed up my stats' oh there there it is! I'm dreading these geriatric birds breaking my windows for fixing them!' 
 Another captain started yelling, these were more advanced crew, so they weren't stupid, they were simply avoiding the cabin which meant danger. After all, they were only a short boat, and their pace is practically curling around the cabin. 
 Some people tried to cover their eyes, trying to hide behind the glass, others had even blocked eye contact with the captain, to even make it look like they weren't real. 
 But this was their ship, they were the captains, and he was the one who informed them about this. So it was up to them, they opened their ship door, they shouted in unison at the captain and gang: 
 'hi captain! you have made a big mistake, the crew is frantic. are you being watched? 
 There was a viciously loud noise from behind the cabin, I had to intervene, and hid behind the glass, hoping the captain would be able to intervene. 
 Shit, the cabin was totally surrounded and the occupants started yelling that nobody would ever come in here, but no, they were going to be spotted! 
 After an hour, they were finally outside, after a very long day, it was time to rest, to sleep. 
 The captain was lying on the ground, in his sleeping position, while screaming and hitting him with a wooden chair. 
 The crows were catching the attention of the two runners, and each always had a blue pen stuck to his mouth to capture attention. 
 There was a loud banging at the cabin door, it was the captain from behind who was pulling up the door to stop the madness. 
 And as one more talk started, they stopped, and looked away from the door, while taking off their shoes for good measure. 
 The people were throwing on their clothes, it was only at this time that someone peeked out the captain's side and saw a rifle. 
 The soldier next to him turned around to face the man, And instantly put his hands on his head, he ran at the cabin door, stopping at the barracks for a moment, not daring to step on the wooden chair they were carrying. 
 Meanwhile, a pirate ship started looking towards the ship.<|endoftext|>

The planet across the galactic map was so cold. It had been thirty years since peace went out between worlds. Lightbringer, the mighty demon hunter, knew this world well. So was Frostbite, a healer that easily could heal ravaged parties of orcs, time heals themselves off from grievous injuries of lesser mortals. The peasants were made to be the leaders of the nation, and in most of these villages ( not all but most ) is what many felt they belonged to - fame, rule, legend. The hero with the most followers, the blacksmith, could find no other way to acquire more interest in the city that seemed to amount to a whole country. The peasant king found the silence far more treacherous than any other. He was tired and could not continue living long enough to use his entire income for his poor upbringing. Finally, the slaver 'Naga rushed to meet some relief by powering up a pike from his saddle. The god of many had to work with greed and bloodshed to stay in power, and so he devised the plan. Naga opened her face and grasped the sword. Screams rose in a constant stream. The goddess grabbed his wrist, and she lowered the sword to him. 
 “ Oh Lord Naga! I am not afraid of you, you rule this mighty world, peace is bliss! ” The green-skinned man was screaming now. Naga brought the pike to her temple, and in a moment of pure rage, she blasted the jolly and fragile girl senseless with the end of a blackhand. The turn of the light was so bright now that the streets were illuminated by a soft brown light from up in the clouds. Mauna Loa and Laplac, the numerous meteorologists who had previously assumed the disasters of the war were gone, pondered on a strange side of things. 
 “ Naga! Take the weapon from me! ” Ri, as leader of the villain woke from his trance of elation and solemnism, glared into the king ’ s eyes. 
 “ What are you doing here? I don ’ t want to believe you have no other choice. ” The king could sense the disappointment in Ri ’ s face, and sighed. 
 “ You know that there is no other way but a more glorious and worthy path. ” He said. 
 “ Perhaps some other way, ” the king answered, “ The blacksmith would… ” he paused for a moment as if they were being interrupted. 
 “ Yes Sir, ” Ri stammered. “ 
 “ Nay, the blacksmith might find others, but it isn ’ t easy. Not if you already have. Your task is simple. One day the Lord will grant you peace, and then rest without making any enemies. ” 
 “ I find it hard, ” Ri said, “ Lord Naga is a dumb fool, but he is the true and sole benefactor of the blacksmith. ” 
 “ For all the power that you do wield, do you know what your true and rightful lord is? ” Ri asked. 
 “ The blacksmith? The one who deals with the dead? ” The king answered. 
 “ Yes, Lord Naga, but you can not go back to the sword. The sword will be your guide in this time of war. You can not travel back from this world into something amazing and worthy. ” 
 “ Oh! Great! Let me return back to my own time, to be with the brother in power? ” Ri answered. The king shook his head, and took the katana from his neck and set it down beside Ri. 
 “ No, Sir. None of us could. ” The king walked over to the blacksmith and began to worship him, striding like a tonne.<|endoftext|>

Panic broke out everywhere in the world. People were starting to cry. They were scared. And so was Loki, having caved in years ago, and had chosen to save the world. 
 He twisted the axe with lightning bolts, intent on slaying all of the kingpins. Soon, all his enemies would be dead. And just as he was about to strike, he realized he could not release it as he had done so many times before. As soon as the dull glow of the blade came back, he knew it was his turn. 
 He drew his bow and... well, let's say a bow, since Loki never delivered one. And just as he drew the arrow, the dark knight licked it clean off his finger. 
 And then he yelled back, "All gone, with them gone, and my toys loose in the wastelands of the land!"<|endoftext|>
**********607**********
In that moment, I knew I had to do it. I pulled out my revolver and the first thing I noticed was the almost too-light siren coming closer and closer. The briefest of quick glances and it seemed I had not noticed him at the time. Perhaps there were big masked men guarding the way... but I assumed the number was somewhere far away. 
 The shame in my heart was great, I was being sued for anything. A few arrests but ultimately I was out, free of hope and fear. Sure enough in the street over on the other side of the light. For those that have come before me in my time here I see him crouched in the corner trying to catch the bell. Only when he's too late do I realize that he has had some strange transformations and we are almost over! As he swings back at the hustling pursuer from the other direction, I see that I have dodged but that neither of them are coming back. 
 "BANG! BANG! " The roar of the live chase was deafening and my vision comes to a halt as I see it coming, back at me. It's head is bloodied and limp, hooked in loops around it like an enormous spider's silk doll! It's head cradling my bloodied lifeless body before it hops back up and stabs the back of my neck with its needle, sending blood gushing out into the street as the crowd descends upon the carnival rides. 
 It turns out that even though no one has stepped foot in my town in years, my toys have flocked. The Mischief Warzons from the first line came, they all served as truck drivers on this fairytale city street and soon after families battled on the streets. With our new breed of toys we have no problem the dealers. They have lost and used for their own reasons and as the price of trying to find better brand toys rise to beyond their limits, we have begun to bring this about. We use what we can to make sure that we can give our toy line a warm welcome and a chance at life, and this is our world!<|endoftext|>

Killing one less winner made the lottery rules wider. Or, were those rules more elaborate? The news have been swirling around about the disappearance of the one young girl with the biggest lottery prizes. This one just couldn't be any bigger. The damages and problems were numerous. 
 Only two actual deaths, they say. Someone paid for it from the mother. One mom'l, only the fifth full-sized lottery ticket in the world, left the hero wondering. 
 In light of the wealth and now that many are immortals, anyone that would take any more would be deemed unfit, unworthy. And so, the mother's purse left with her keys still. She had been shaking in her slippers for the past few days, and was still saying well and good bye to her daughter. 
 What should you say? She smiled up at the man carrying her purse. 
 "Hey, mom? " 
 A hand on the shoulders of one the two men, and they both rushed up to her. They were young, maybe 21 or 22 and both their parents, and their choices had become increasingly infrequent. A car smashed into an old woman, and took her life. A 3 year old girl, walking through the streets. Her parents were wounded. The children were traumatized. As if in reaction, their father pulled the girl's body out of the street and carried it in his arms. 
 " Don't mess with me! " He yelled as he pinched his lips. " Something's wrong! I can't touch you! " 
 She nodded down, but couldn't react. If she waited, he couldn't tell her she was free. In the end, it made a small tingling in her arm. 
 She could barely step out of the car, and managed to scurry back to safety before the first bullet hit her chest. 
 The bullet didn't penetrate her. She bent down and wiped the head clean of the blood. She didn't mean to shoot. If her family could see the woman's face, they could see that they didn't expect. They were in shock, but did an admirable job of explaining the situation to the man. 
 " I'll let you kill yourself. " The one closest to the body whispered. " Goodbye, don't worry. We'll bury her. " The girl raised her hand and toelled out the bullet. 
 In three minutes, she gave up. 
 " Take everything I have, " she said solemnly. " I have nothing, and nothing but the money I win " 
 It was true, her family had payed for this, but that would bring more money to them, and certainly would screw with the system of society. 
 " Take it, and get back to your village, " said one of the men. " Bring home."<|endoftext|>

Jasmine watched, her mind racing. They had only known each other for about a week since the incident. 
 Was this the last day they could go through without him? Was it finally time to prove she could stand with him? 
 As the birds began to sing, Jasmine noticed he was not singing like he had been. He was carrying very little luggage. Apparently the luggage did not pass through the machine. No, it didn't cause any alarm! Jasmine just needed a way out of this small apartment. 
 Jasmine moved and pulled her checked luggage out of the briefcase. It was the kitchen tile, and beyond that, the small town's temperature. Is this what they drink during such a relaxing evening? Just like they are taught here on earth? 
 Jasmine turned the color of the tile to blue, the bottom blanketing the walls with the sun. 
 "Here we are, " she said into the kitchen sink, " again, a quick snack. " 
 Her stomach started to pound with hunger as the white and orange fruit began to sing around the table. Jasmine lowered the water splashing her nose to make sure no one else could see. She was beginning to forget the song she had heard a million times before. 
 A flying white house has just opened up near the front of the house. Only two other people are outside, and his wife. 
 " Please, " she says, attempting to stand in front of the TV, " hear me out. " 
 It's not his wife. Only the kid, and her mom. No one in their right mind would listen to a song this important. Just her father taking the field trip from North Korea, and his girlfriend taking class. 
 " Here I am, " her older brother chirped, " Al-arabi, " he then just got off of school. They miss him." 
 Jasmine adjusted the back of her jacket, managing to catch a glimpse of his once-broken remains. Not a single trace of them remains.<|endoftext|>

*Quiet hand still resting upon my claw, within reach* 
 "By the way, I'm a dragon!" 
 The unkempt man who had raised me looked up to the sky, his face clear as day and with a grim determination on his face. On the other side of the screen there was a message from one of his followers. 
 *Eveners for thieves. End it all. * 
 Whilst we were online we had already planted some of the stuff. Purging Dora from all the ponies that were out in the woods, with the area packed up within days. But things were difficult. Not that it mattered, the ponies couldn't let that happen to me. We had worked on creating soldiers for the war, but you've had to put little into your job. 
 My eyes shifted to mine. This was my inheritance. A young dragon with the same innocence that I had always known. Just a long time ago before he died from being burned by the sun and eaten by a cow. 
 I hadn't fallen in love yet. I had thought he would be weak, damaged but amazing. But there is no point in evil. His fate is clear, but I was afraid to do anything to show it. I couldn't handle the temptation to meddle in the kingdom. It broke my mind but I knew I would leave it alone and the chance of eternal peace to me.

The Honourable Lord Greenleaf, Justice Ballantyne, for Justice Revesby, 
 The majority in granting our ruling today against the State of Kyzikichtisn's latest infamous murder case, Reply J. The Lord had read the decision carefully, deeply considering how much the evidence predated the official review. He rightly took every step and, by very clearly executed his verdict, sought redress for its action. 
 I have read the final record. 
 The impact is clear to all parties. One relevant point in the final record was the admissibility of the detention of citizen Abpoionla Grigoryta in the state prison of Pointe Cylen, in relation to the murder of Konstantine Kayoukurtis, in relation to the kidnapping of Chris Wuertan on August 6, 2015. Each of these individuals was identified as a victim, owned a Black Bank Key and met the right of residence. All evidence was generated from the German experience from pre-Korea and dated after the founding of the Soviet Union. Moreover, evidence collected in the course of pre-Korea followed the formal nature of bartering prior to the event, an arrangement that echoes in our case today in that once the United States became fully industrialised and began international trade and the conflict escalated far beyond its borders, there was no monitoring by militaries or primary threats, and there were no official orders to conduct raids on the wealthy individuals or to incite hostile acts. The recording begins to make intuitive sense to us, even after the facts previously set out, given all the security against the forces of the prosecution and the view expressed above, but the fact remains we have to suspend the proceedings immediately as to their environmental impact, the questions raised by the accused individuals of Western Bank business, the nature of the business he is engaged in, the nature of his car - but what does the proper use of that world, city and commercial centre signify if it serves as a visible reminder of the State's pre-independence period as a non-state entity? 
 At present it is my view the offensive tactic adopted by the Russian government, reinforced by the US and EU, in combination with similar geopolitical and historical considerations, as I have argued for over a half century, is to cause a Western banking and commercial centre to be ex-infiltration centres and by extension, don't simply pop its helicopter into a heavily indebted foreign bank, instead of within a properly established banking facility by repeating before it the actions of the decisive. To that end it is the Conservative government, and the Jewish rulers of Russia, that will commence direct invasion of Western banks and commercial centres located outside of NATO borders. I have backed this against a background of reasserting our position in two of the conflicts, both within the EU and among the EU and East Asian powers in general, and will continue to push for it until this nation gains complete sovereignty over the Russian sector in Europe. However, the rationale behind the decision is not for it to be excused. At the very least, should the criminal charges be brought against him - as it now stands that he did not commit his role in the crimes that the State is accused to commit - we would understand the gravity of the charges brought against him by the Serbs, what this Court finds such serious and grave as they are given as evidence. 
 I am unable to uphold the judgement against Russia, as he was implicated in the murder of Tseixwy Lion, a South Africanan who trafficked in cryptocurrencies and drugs in his country of residence, in order to help him withdraw funds from his account. The proof of Mr Lion's involvement in the murder should have been the embedded screens on the private online wallet that was a part of his private hard drive during the discovery of the stolen funds. The material images taken after the kill confirm the seriousness and seriousness of the offence. 
 I vacate the judgment in favour of Russia, as I have done in numerous disputes that should have been brought before this Court, and therefore I recommend that the case be thrown out. I would suggest that it be instead thrown out against the British authorities in their own right, because the Leader of Great Britain was involved in the murder of the journalist Gwendolyn Sewler, and so deserves at least one day of a full trial for having implicated it in the crime. 
 I leave this on Behalf of The Honourable Lady Wilson<|endoftext|>

# Flight 7,314 without an A/C letter 
 The writing had been really nice, I was on board. I was really pleased to see the paperwork. " Vast free-fare, you pay separately for every case, in the range of 40 free irlances, from China to Israel! " They had really solid shrugging, as I could sense they were quite confused. And worst of all, all passengers were irlances consecutively from China to Israel. I just hope that they find it difficult to adjust the rules to the new morals that have been developed. Why this guy's testing seems to be getting wilder. I was still really happy to see that he finally managed to get the B crap done, but it was worth it for the company. 
 It was busy outside. I was surprised and surprised that I was supposed to join the company. As such, there was not much to do. I'd thought you could join but apparently the 747 chain had really got dead in the few accidents that we had seen with it, and one of them was killing us right off the plane. Ah well. I'd normally show up in class and take my free irlances, but that was now in-game. I liked this new direction, and hoped that it would get outlast the previous one. 
 As I was waiting for the attendants to be served, one of the irlances flew past me and flying straight into my lap. Bizarre, not that I'd ever think of flying in a jetliner. I took a seat next to him, his eyes wide and mouth agape. He pointed at me in bewilderment, before standing up straight and nervously turned around. Then he took a step back, and it was clearly noticed that I was looking in his direction. " What are you talking about?! " I said firmly. " I thought I was taking a short life. " 
 There he was, passing by me, moving closer and closer towards me, his pupils widening. He was clearly looking at me as he said " That's what you mean! That's your last flight. " 
 " Huh? Really? " I said, scratching my temple in embarrassment. " What? " 
 " You're going to keep sending those irlances, once you manage to get your airline to take it out of your carrier, exactly the way you did before, but we won't have to wait here for 2 or three more months for those irlances. You're leaving a special mark in my heart, because if you stop taking out those irlances before you've already tried to take them out, they won't go anywhere." 
 An almost ecstatic look went up on his face. I continued to monitor my flight and try to figure out what his plan had worked out. He's definitely in line. Now what. 
 Edit: All my novels ( I didn't count that out on page one ) are in my collection. This is my first reading on this sub! 
 [ Part II ] ( https: //medium.com/@jcvfc/wp-please/visualize-1399476374233/view/? id=183256311.7572163 I don't have any idea how to rectify it, but I don't really care. ] 
 Edit # 2: I already got down to no longer writing this. This was right in the middle of reviewing my first novel, and the reason why it isn't the magic phrase I'm writing at all. The fear overwhelmed me. Any and all submissions will be confiscated and all contest results suspended indefinitely. 
 Edit # 3: This is my first rewrite and I'm writing 5.7m great ideas that I didn't have time to review. I can get right back to my story and do much more! Sorry if I don't have a TL; DR. I'm not sure if I'm doing enough! This was actually my first response in like a week and I just wanted to let out one more brilliant stab at rewriting my self worth. I hope it's worth it! 
 Edit # 4: /u/HolyCrap didn't really use any explicit phrases. Honestly, I didn't think the one with none of the words purports to violate any god-forsaken rules he laid out. I mean, they must have a lot of distinctions, but that's just a side note.<|endoftext|>

Suddenly I remember being in some dark room with some strange lights. I'm really in a strange room with strange lights, and it's not like we can't handle the freakin' lights. What gives? The doors of the strange room are opened, and I'm looking in this strange way. I wonder why it's so lit up, but I see no doors. Everyone is in this strange place. I am asleep. It's still dark. I'm waking up. It's too dark. And I know I need to sleep. What am I doing? I'm awake. Calm down. All right, whatever is happening, wake up. Everything is alright, look at the light above my head. Nothing disturbs me. 
 I open the closet door to find nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. 
 I sit in this strange room, still in the dark, and I look down the corridor to find something. I can't look away. I just need to get up. I don't want to die. Why would I do that? Why didn't anyone think of that. I was just stupid. And why wouldn't I? It's like some God rules some rules. 
 Suddenly I remember putting things to bed after trying out some drugs. Right before I'm actually thrown into bed. * Shut up, fag* 
 And then I feel it. I see my parents up there. I look around. Nothing there. I look to where my father is. Like he's asleep, but is *nt* here. But in front of him is a woman. In a prison. Asleep. I think. But I'm trying to get up. 
 I walk outside to see what's been going on. I see my father in a cell. I see his clothes. He's dressed in nothing but clothes. When I look at him, I see some sort of metal door. I turn on the lights, and think "Wow" It's locked. I just turn back on the lights, and behold, there's an earth-sized figure standing in front of me. 
 I run for my life as fast as I can, and I'm being stalked. I am not part of this as I come to my senses, but I can't stay in this world and I can't stay here. 
 -- - 
 ( Hey, I really liked your prompt! After rereading this I'm out of ideas. ) 
 I open the door to my parents home and I get a little annoyed. They have a really nice house! I walk around and check to see if anyone is around, and then I see them, talking to my Dad. 
 I don't understand them. He says something about he can take the lights, that they must be inside. But I just stare at the door! I wish there was something on the other side of the door, like, giving me directions. 
 I try to figure out what that means. But I'm off like an idiot. I haven't had it in awhile, so I find the solution. I don't look at the light again. Just stares in circles, wists under my eyes, nothing. So I wait and watch while the two boys try to get outside with nothing inside of them. I think about going outside, and when I'm gone, they'll look at each other and say " *What are you?" 
 So I wait with the rest of the boys and ask them exactly what that means. 
 Then I wake up.<|endoftext|>

My entire life had been a lie. Alcohol intake had gone from extremely low and nagging to the norm. Adults ignored even the reminder of heavy drinking. 
 I've always wondered if the world would ever get anything better. That memory sometimes repeats itself several times over the course of this lifetime. All it would be like. 
 But then, there was my uncle. His passing had shaken the old relationships. My siblings, my own family, their friends. We all felt it was better to leave. 
 But my uncle always talked about working late, and getting hungry. Yeah. You can do that. I mean, do something else. Life is a positive place. A good home. You can do everything you want. * Do* everything. But do it, you learn to take it. 
 Of course, there's an old saying from history: the less you do, the better it is. But as I spent my twenties in relationships, I got used to their closeness. This love I have. When men are scared of losing their wives, men looking for it from the bottom up, men looking to shirk the courtship. 
... The process is fine. Money still passes through when you leave. Money still passes through when you quit. Men are willing to sell their hard work for a quick fix, for the satisfaction of meeting someone else. Who wasn't? I can say in the history of this society that killing a man is murder. But what's that? 
.... Not until the day you see the money. And you see "The Search."<|endoftext|>

I'll admit that I was on the run but I wouldn't have thought it would be this early. You know the rule? you're not allowed to respawn any time before your end and anything is wrong, i've seen this one before. I'll tell you now, but its that little thing i loved more than life itself. Especially the individual. It's not just that you died so early, i've seen that numerous times before. I even saw my family for once as soon as they woke up that morning. I held a pizza when they woke up, or wrote a message on the nightstand when they went to bed, nothing exciting, only just normal. Ever since, I've had little menial tasks as a bouncer/former freelancer and then in the small life time I may have to deal with big work at first because I was always too concerned with being my own guy to appreciate life without others care. Well the world has never needed us as "volunteers" and I'm pretty sure none of them thought of us like that. On the other hand here i am, sitting here and staring at the screen that actually has no sunlight on it. I'm glad for that, i lost touch with the world through my unconscious efforts to escape the world and since that incident all i have is some simple spreadsheet with some numbers inside it. It's getting really boring once the realization that's all that's needed to kill you has come over me. I've run out of time, but people still read this on the news and i'll admit that's probably true, people believe my final phrase but its hard to think without a sense of humor when all i can think of is how long ago I met my dad. To think of those last few days can actually be considered a time capsule, hmm how many times I thought of him? lol He's not going to forget me after all, but they're still seeing him staring at this screen I see every night. I get up from my chair and the sound of tapping stops me. * Really? god dammit man, what the hell? * " Hey kid " I thought to myself, reaching for the monitor with the usual shaky handkerchief i keep about my neck, tears of joy mixed with the comforting sound of blood trickling down my cheeks, " you saved my life, not like that " whoops. And then, " now i'm going to death too!!! " Shit, i was about to die so easily... I didn't think so at the time, when was the last time you had thought of a decent time? when could I have done that? I grabbed the trashcan from the garbage dump and dropped it, " lets go now " i shouted, throwing it right at the trashcan lid with such force that it shattered. It popped out of the trash can, flipped down, and dropped down a few inches into the earth. My fingers felt like they were about to touch something, then everything had changed. It dawned on me, even with the pill bottles that were strewn throughout the floor, i had taken that longest, dirtiest last attempt to go back into the world and when i finally got to the trash, I thought i'd been hungry, so i stepped out of the trash can and grabbed the big hammer. Now, the only thing that I can do is scream and hope he didn't let me into his little box. The bar-a-rattles. The chit-chat. I woke up in this box in my room in a prison cell. I can't move, I can't feel my hands, and I can't think. I try crawling to the bottom of the chair, but everything is a blur. Everything but me. I can't move, my fingers are pinned over the table, my feet are wrapped around it, and I can't talk. Everyone that i meet, and everyone that I come to see is dead as well. Is this really happening? Who will look at me? My worst fear has finally come true. I'm going to die, but I'm already dead. I can't see anymore, not even my eyes can move from the looking into the small room. The world is getting blurry, and then I see him sitting there, calm and collected, looking at some kind of box with a wry smile. The box opens, and a strange man in a scuffed white suit walks in. " I'm here to meet your childhood sweetheart and kill you.", he says with all his might. He smiles and says the word in my head, and in that instant I realize what I've done... I've done what no one in this world has ever done.<|endoftext|>

I'm fairly new here, but this is from the fallout series. The primary protagonist, twins, has just been dumped and given water for the sake of the story. First job was to turn into their new girlfriend because of their criminal streak and become them. 
 But then I found out her real estate investor, after he dumped her, was tight with her. I was in shock for a while, but then I'd learned everything from her and it all eventually came out. That girl, the person that you had left behind when you left a woman who was everything to you, so to speak, and who you can't change is all gone now. 
 Since then I've thrown everything I've worked on and plans. But even one more house had to go. To rescue her from her evil, unloved ex-spouse, who is now living with her abusive ex-husbands wife. There is nothing to fix now, besides it can't be fixed. So I quit this character created for the sake of the story and instead look at how the story progresses around the cycle, focusing on my character. They're all of the same mistake, of course, but they can see the happening, get the outcomes from the characters I've also created and then stop their actions for a bit so that they can start the story together again. Then the future assumes all of us were different from their same story all along so it keeps us together. 
 I've come to terms with that now too, I've started to kill off smaller characters and start writing some more version of this as well. But with new characters, readership and average moral, it's not that difficult to make something real as a character without killing off their past selves for a little bit.<|endoftext|>

Kevin groaned at the long, desolate hallway. It felt dusty and sweaty, too long to clean his shins. 
 "Mama?! " he called as he grabbed the blanket he'd brought with him from the kitchen. He'd swaddled out the kitchen as fast as he could in the the crowded hallway, and didn't stop until he reached his driveway to pick it up. 
 An older looking woman came into the house, she wore layers of what looked like a war helmet. She exited through the sliding doors that shut out into the neighborhood around the block. " Hi there. I am Kevin. " 
 A gust of wind blew the speed limit into Kevin's face, he hopped and tried to recover, but soon landed on someone's face. The man looked like he'd died from head trauma, hair turned gray, eyes rolled back in his head. " Is it coming for us? " Kevin asked as he grabbed the blanket he'd brought with him and started walking, looking for help. 
 The older woman looked up at him and smiled, " We should. " 
 " What happens if she isn't interested?" Kevin wondered and ran. The crack of cold rain came and raked through the sheet covered concrete, getting chills down his spine, but it was the elderly woman who found Kevin. 
 The older woman, standing in the corner of the empty house with her hand holding Kevin's blanket, would have to put an end to this story if she could, Kevin wasn't going to let the cold get to her.<|endoftext|>

I always knew when I came back, I was standing in the garage. It was raining, we were coming home but I knew by nothing that I would only be seen for a second or two. A new situation popped into my head, I knew as soon as I blinked the sun would shine brightly on me, as though every glance it took was a miracle. I remained standing, the rain began to leave this house and rain were also becoming ahhfto on me. I did not speak and for that I will never be found and in what I once knew as myself I don't want to come back.<|endoftext|>

The gruff man dragged himself from the table to see friends and acquaintances. 
 The late Sandy, elegant yet thin as a ball of gums and a more graceful yet clunky snout bent for a cute figure. 
 Vince, brunette, a sharecropper for both man and woman. 
 All wore an expression of respect and devotion that carried across many of them in a constant state of hopelessness and withholding for fear of losing the fragile balance of his time. 
 Ringo, a representative of the human race. 
 Gusone were the days before when outsiders seemingly could find no protection from fear nor grief. Now there was only sadness and regret. 
 Sharox, a star witness who in his old age had never known anything, just as she no longer wished to experience the bitter cold, but still did. 
 Selenea, an attractive but slender young lady in her late 20s, had always felt rather beautiful as a girl and yet still desperately wanted as much power as she could muster in her, even in her own failed ambition and what used to be making her content of death. 
 My friend, the wise old man who had made a life for himself, smiled and leaned forward with an act of heavy front teeth, twisting his lips in a way only a fool would have imagined. 
 The menu of pasta could only be described as... typical... 
 Solocolatoni, a new pasta dessert, served with delicate colors of butter and a tart flavor which began to turn slightly red in color, wasn't one one of his favorites. He turned his head to look at his former friend, where a small smile flitted across his face. 
 "Really? " he asked. 
 My stomach felt heavy, my head was pounding but I couldn't help the way a spider was wrapped around me. 
 " Sure, right, " my friend responded, the mug flowing from his hands to my face as he took the last bite of the can. " Not bad. " 
 My expression fell. 
 " Ha. No pun intended. " I smiled at the thought of my own and it came to me suddenly as I felt slight flickers of electricity out of the back of my neck. 
 With one last flash of energy the other strangers appeared out of the door as well and without so much as a glance at the two while pleading. 
 " Hey, you looking for the mouse right? " 
 The man's eyes widened as his thin arms curled around me. 
 " Uh... I know what you're looking for. " he replied, looking me up and down, but unafraid of my own curiosity. 
 " I'll look it up soon for you." I said as I ran up the length of the table with Milo, Elliot, Carley and a host of others to the table.<|endoftext|>

The boredom is tingling. It was with him that he woke, in the middle of the night, to the shouting of his closest friends, and to the crackle of the earth. 
 “ Raven! Raven! Get up! Come and come and get me! ” 
 The beeping from the wall created some additional noise that entered the room at random, although the noise was predictable due to its odd pattern. Nobody knew what to do, and so the crowd kept on hearing it for as long as the strong wind blew them away. 
 Ruggus opened his eyes slowly at the sound of the sword moving through the earth. “ W-what? ” He blinked. He was cold, his bones appearing numb, disoriented, in the midst of the quiet, and the left side of his face was cold and brown, his hair twisted and malnourished. He stood. He stretched out his hand and placed it on top of his trembling left arm, bending over, numb, and gentle. 
 “ Those arms, I don ’ t understand, but what ’ s going on? ” He stretched out his leg and poked his thigh. “ My back hurts. ” He stretched out his leg, and rambled on, trying to find the connection. 
 “ Those are the arms. It must have been me that I slaughtered those. ” The walls around him began to clang. His fingers felt like they had twitched the floor. It felt like he was nailing bones with a ruler into them. He tried to think of what his friends and family would do if they were forced to fight. He remembered his mother ’ s laugh, and her smile the first time he saw her. He heard the spit spread throughout the room and felt a slight hand grasp on his forearm. 
 “ What? ” He was too weak to move. The day had decided him for another person, and he already knew why. Or maybe he had hunted them all before, but they were weak to the sword that had scoured their air. With one last nudge from the wall, his legs firmed themselves together and he watched the blade sink into the earth. He waited for the ball of shadow to appear next to him, and when he finally did, the blade vanished.<|endoftext|>
**********621**********
My first day was pretty bad. The lunches were generally the best one of the week. I was really groggy after lunch, so I just let the kids eat at different tables, working really hard to make the lunch I was working on flow through me, but I don't know what made it better. After we finished lunch, I read a passage from a book that I read aloud to my 3 other students: 
 "This is not your problem, the consequences will happen when I tell my classmates about the consequences. " 
 Now that that I was working on it, I knew this would happen, but not in the way others described. When I first heard it, I couldn't deny the lack of danger. The whole thing would lead to more death and destruction. I decided to try and humor my friends for a bit, going by lotta genes. I struggled to keep my letter under wraps, but it all felt acceptable anyway. I had to be realistic. I told them what I had seen, so that their feedback was actually helpful. I told them that today's story was better than its predecessor, so that they might be able to enjoy something different next time. The answer was no. 
 Five days later, I was looking at this piece of paper. I noticed that all my other classmates were reading the first chapter, and there were no words in the title. Next to the title, there was another letter. I didn't know what this letter was until it popped up on my computer. 
 " However, as I sat there reading the study's contents, I heard my classmates debating on what they should do, if they wanted to continue their stories, and hoping they would succeed. I decided that if it wasn't hard to find those people who were willing to continue them, so be it." 
 It was on and on it went. Until I realized it was a new paragraph. The page read: 
 [ Key Note ] Every age has a beginning, but there was a middle. If you belong to your birthright ( which it is ), it has already happened. 
 For some, their moment of relief was confirmed. They talked about anything they needed to lose. Some from their birthright, they used to cry. Others from their birthright would always immediately want to survive to a certain age. They were happy, but all year around. Their death was painful to the point they had to be on a permanent vacation to a permanent house. It's caused by the time travelers. 
 The time travelers, when they're traveling, just watch people that they passed over on their way to a particular country, watch them die, and watch them rise again. If a person loses, that person becomes a ghost, and one from a previous generation will appear a few decades later. Some members of the minority, and a person from the past generation who has turned from a ghost to a ghost. The life of these people precedes the life of the first time traveler and becomes the life of the first time traveler. They get to save the past generation from the moment of their birth, and vice versa. 
 Nobody could see that we're immortal, because they couldn't see past us and we don't live anymore. We live in a process where the one who saved us does not live anymore. Nobody remembers our existence, because the memories of that particular generation became a part of our reality. The same process happens for everyone. We live in a process where it will come to pass when we die. It's a process that makes us want to restart, but we feel that that is impossible. That is why we're here. It's a process that we will continue at a certain age. Those are the entire reasons we need this place. 
 I look at it all and decide to write off all of the day. I hope someone finds it here, perhaps with another title: “ This is not your problem. ” So don't ask this again; this is not your problem. Maybe I should stop reading.<|endoftext|>

Your eyes are not the same. This is perhaps one of the clearest and deepest rift of pain you can experience. Your place is grounded in your previous generation, without you a strong grip on the language you know. Some call it what is called "gangs ", a, middle-aged, white, neatly trimmed woman who speaks freely and without fear. One of my interrogators had once woken you from your trance by saying that the prototypes have the most discordant qualities... and I assume you believe them. 
 Having been in prison for the past year, you have become accustomed to these static, distorting, vibrational ways of seeing the world. Boring as a cellmate, we return the favor when one of the guards asks for their password. Unless you know to do so, you say, nobody else will. The surprises are not as sweet. 
 The sudden awareness that there's something you've missed last month comes at a price. Your hippocampus is damaged by the light and heat that often accompanies ambient light travel. This familiar reflexivity causes you to lose your balance, then your thoughts flow normally. The whole scapular was involved in this decision. Each motion in your brain was something new, something you could never clearly handle. Eventually, you experienced something different and discarded it, and lost the ability to control your decisions to one degree or another. It had felt that way since the first LSD trip, and since that sober, exhilarated trip. 
 I can not describe what made you approach this prison, but I know one thing about you that feels right. This is your chance at a better life. This is your chance at self-betterment. And at all the things you could have done differently.

 Something awful must have happened. I sat on the ground. Thick braided flesh covered my face. That stank of flour. That carcass-ish smell. The cusps in my throat, choking on my saliva. My self-loathing for the two working children. 
 He comes by again. He skulks away, still black. He plays with the aisles with a shopping bag against his chest and sticks one arm out. They poke at me. He can't see me. I see him trying to give me a hug, but he's afraid he'll accidentally destroy the phone. I see him play with something big and wood. 
 What did he just say? He's got to be doing it. There's something that he could do for me! That's something I could do for him! The pain that's building in my body now... it's personal. It's my burden to bear... if that's where it wants to go, I can just wait. He's a monster, I know. He can hit my head with his hands, even though it's a good idea, and there's nothing you can do against that right now. Just pick up the phone and call the police, I'm committed to that plan. 
 He says nothing. He wipes his mouth with his hand and looks me in the eyes as he passes. He talks for a while, but all I can see are melted teeth. Then, he laughs. He's a real regular, doesn't he? Now it's just the grueling taunting voice of a man... 
 I'm not going down without a fight.

Sweetie, you told me to stop calling her Blurry, and fuck off, that made no sense to you. She's been up all night standing there. Being an alcoholic doesn't help much when you're sitting in a shitty walk-in closet and she still sits there, saying her bad thoughts. 
 I was 18 when I got this call, and I don't know how to explain it to my girlfriend because I fell in love a year ago. Before that I was reading the news and seeing as I lived in New York City I never really had a lot of friends, but never really had much to socialize with girls as her name just so happened to be this name. I listened to pop music all day, so I enjoyed the novelty and gave a fuck of it, I knew this was it, I was going to love her. But the truth is I was depressed and lonely. I couldn't take it and listened to Dr. Seuss and something that is simply a paragraph down the list of sounds that calls me Drunk. These days I'm texting her over and over again I no longer can stop feeling like I'm in hell. But fuck it I hate her. I'm so tired of this fuck like I hated out of a corner of my eye. I almost feel her slim frame disappear, all cellulite and defecation thickening her corset like a protective blanket. I'm so tired of this bitch so thin I wonder if I could eat her. 
 Let's get out of here before I do something stupid and dangerous. I really don't want to get in this new situation but there I was in my seat staring at her feet. My hands were trapped underneath the pillow, my heart was pounding in my chest. She would've loved me no matter what I said to her, if she just managed to shake this off, but if she didn't do something stupid like yawn or put her head down I'm afraid I could get the high without feeling any guilt in my heart. I don't know why I do what I do anymore, I thought I just never got to love again, I don't even know where I am and I didn't want to watch it happen to myself.

The teapot was my creation, after all. I came up with the name after a brainstorming session. So then I got him started on it, long before the design person was napping. It was rough, from point A to point B, but then he started using an organic human visor. That was the gist of the problem, one thing you would do on the first teapot. The only problem is, the visor is made of mostly pigmented titanium. 
 I found the solution to a problem the simple way. It was the person from the design group, whom I named "D.L. ". He, remember what I told him? Well, he chose the name of this picocut, after seeing the LED blinking endlessly at 30 in the palm of my hand. After that, he accepted the job as manager of a joint " barber. The customer service section is where all employee photo now works. 
 But, as you may know, all of this work was normal, and is still due due in ten days. We started working on a teapot in front of you today, after being given feedback from everyone who came to participate. 
 We have a " sure enough" product at $ 3.99.<|endoftext|>

When we had first conceived humankind, we had thought our intentions were crazy. We had flown in from some government facility, decided to see the inhabitants in person, but what we had thought was that the flaws in people, and our capabilities to help people was pure evil. We can only see so much and cannot handle anything, and I would be lying if I said that we hadn't grown used to the fact that we lived forever. Even before we conceived, humans had tried to have other modes of describing what they felt; it was an incomprehensible bit of abstract speech, but with a more specific clarity. A more accurate description of the murmurings that used to occur outside the bed, gone through the internet and the dark side of sleep did not. 
 Once a year, we would participate in a special science fair. We could best see what the grand prizes of the world were. We could hear words of life pass by. We could see the progression and fall of cultures. We could see minds of the past change, in a way that we would never have considered possible. 
 Throughout our time on earth, humanity was harvested for multiple purposes, for all the benefits we gained. We just wanted to see where our power lies, in the way those of us from the stars liked to see our whole lives. Then, we sat down, and we sat down together. We watched as we watched our entire lives unfold, for the grand prizes that we would receive, we would never forget. 
 The moment we got together, the world just started to blur. While we were outside celebrating, people started to lose feelings; it wasn't the first time it had happened. However, we stopped thinking. We stopped following the child, we stopped thinking of deaths and sorrow. We just stopped following the memories of events over and over. We just stopped following people with simple questions and answers. And as it turned out, nobody could know what to do with us anymore. We had become objects to be consumed by, being tested and manipulated through groups of people. 
 As our spirit faded, no one would remember the person who died. The thing about ghosts is that no one will ever know what happened to them. They all go to experience their life in a different direction; their every memory but their own. There is no place for people who are not alive; they will never remember the person who died. 
 It takes about a half-millennium of seeing people and hoping one day they will remember another person, but then they will all stop. They will die and are mourned. People who don't remember will always rest their soul in what we call Heaven. Each person waits a little longer, and if it's with someone once, they will think about it again. Perhaps their soul just didn't fit in this world anymore, or maybe they forgot the person who died one day, and are still mourning. My same twin wouldn't know her daughter would be bereft, although she would remember her young self even now. 
 I don't know what will happen to us in the afterlife, but we will still live our life and watch. It will never end, but the more people who see the person who died, the more I can be reminded of the beauty of human life, the more I can enjoy death.<|endoftext|>

Walking home from work I knew that a supervisor would come by and take me home. I couldn't wait to head home because I had a no time for religion meeting, I hurriedly went over to my desk. I opened up my nondescript piece of paper. Yes, I wrote. I got my no time, properly late. 
 Suddenly my supervisor hit the ground with a concussion and I shambled back to my desk. As it happened I was separated from the rest of the team by strong winds and neck shaking. 
 Suddenly I just received a text message from my supervisor who I quickly raised an arm to block. He had to knock. Couldn't wait till tomorrow! There he was, announcing some gold medals for team coopers I would be competing in. I put my hand on his shoulder because what else could go wrong? 
 He sighed as he pulled me into the passenger seat. We unlocked the car, opened the door, and got in. We opened the car door and I was in, covered in blindfold and a mask. 
 Without laughing he squeezed my hand and told me to leave. I didn't. But when he pulled me in and locked me in the trunk he was leaving. 
 I was barely crawling when I noticed a small white dot sticking out of my vision. I stood up and tried to go in but the doors weren't locked yet. I ran down the drive I had just got into and the smell of smoke was overpowering. 
 When I arrived back home in the back yard I returned to the town square with a warm glass of orange juice, giant biscuits, and a beach hangover. Walking home I realized my asshole came in the middle of the day, and quickly rushed my relief away. Then the sun faded and the damp earth stopped her for me.<|endoftext|>

It seems impossible to have a treasure that sits before your very eyes, yet somehow here I am…in this bag, alone in this dank room. We've been in this house for 5 days now…with no one to talk to anymore, can't say I trust my phone with any…days are easy once one click of the keys brings us free and continuous pillows in a smooth ash heap, but this is disturbing. 
 What the hell was that? The mummy
The dry butter of the bag smells faintly of liquid smoke, as if there's nothing but the scraps and a few melted bones from our previous sleeping sojourn. 
 Let's return to the present now, they're alone in the square of the living room, and I can't trust my phone with any phone calls without a switch they use, I slowly move the knife on the floor, and open it. 
 To the right hand side there is that perfect white room, full of primeval mirrors reflecting back the fresh moon light in front of us and radiating the amount of money inside its smallest area. It's utterly empty of any food, though its contents give the illusion of touching any pretentious person behind the silver-peeling glass inside the bag. I noticed this while going into the satchel, after I had asked to see if they had been in line for meals or a night out…something must have called me into this place, but at the same time I knew I wasn't free. 
 I pick up the bag and ready it, back and forth from the owner as I plop it back on the slick carpet, then walked over to them. I opened the bag…there was 20 million, and my mom gives me the same weird feeling when she sees a whole new person. 
 With her eyes gazing blankly, I grab my wallet and go ahead, but before I can start my trade, I notice there's just a few notes on the back. 'The numbers left on this wallet are behemoths.' 
 " *Made in USA, no remonditions. *'" 
 The answers on this note turned out to be that they were very wrong. 
 They are true.<|endoftext|>

"So he stood there, with his hands full of the all hail money he'd never seen, and said he'd do it today! " 
 Julian patiently stared down at the transaction form. It looked so generic, it seemed incredibly simple. Hundreds of thousands in unused bank accounts? Even more money in the bank's name? Who knew? 
 " That's right, I'll go check out some more " 
 " So who's going to pay you this? " 
 " I dunno dude " 
 A confused staring contest broke out in the kitchen. " This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen and he has no business being near you. " 
 " What? Why? " Julian looked down at the form again. " There was the all hail money form sir, " he flashed a smile. 
 There was no doubt about it. Julian: open both a 997 form, file a complaint, it wouldn't do ANYTHING in this instance. He had just spent the 7 billion he'd had in the previous two days. Just ask yourself how much it would cost to save up! 
 The small and sentimental note sat on the table. The present belongs to Mike Shintay. His father, Mike married Mike. He asked Julian to go visit his dad a couple weeks ago. 
 At least Mike came by frequently, and clean. Julian looked forward to staying in their house for a few more days. 
 " Hey, hi Mike! " 
 " Is that you? " 
 " I'm Julius Rodglove. I'm living in Miami. I really appreciate it I guess. " 
 " So? " 
 " Yes, so what do you do for a living? " 
 " Well, I do everything you ask of me, but I might not be able to do it today! So we're gon na have to make an announcement! " 
 " Absolutely! I'm an entrepreneur, I work for the bank, and its called 1YURO! Not technically that I work for a bank, but I work with a real risk reduction team and I don't raise foreign exchange risk at 1YURO. I am the man who's going to get to live to see his 90th birthday tomorrow! " 
 The fight of wills broke out in the hallway. Julian started to close his eyes, but suddenly he heard a voice over his radio. 
 " OK awaiting $ 70,000,000. 4 payments. Number of settled checks. Done! " 
 Julian blushed. This wasn't a prank. Maybe he should go check this out, he thought. Maybe something else had happened. 
 " Okay man, get down! Are you alright? We're gon na need you in the bank with us. " 
 " Listen, I'm just going to make this change here. Maybe tomorrow will be right. If you don't feel alright, call me. I'll see you tomorrow."<|endoftext|>

"Ooh! My... A-Ok. I sure knew what I wanted. Why not Whittier? Well I guess I didn't wan na pick Squirtle so I picked Pikachu " Gary argued. " Well it's pretty much the same for you, now let's just go play " Professor Oak produced Pikachu again. 
 " Oh ok. This is going to be a fun experience indeed " Gary got out of his chair and angrily rose from his chair. " Can you just stop fidgeting then? " He tried to make a mental run, but neither of them knew when to stop. 
 " Wh-whhh! Maybe I'll just play, I'll listen " Gary answered. But he was quickly silenced by Professor Oak. 
 " And... " Professor Oak spoke again. " Okay Pidgey... OK Pokemon. For those of you who like it play round."<|endoftext|>

As soon as I arrived at the medical station, I was greeted with a woman who remarked that I would be here for a week, you see, un-protected from any medical procedures that might take place for me. The staff members agreed, however, they must be very busy just having me here so as to not upset the societal stigma of being out of the building. 
 I was assured by the nurse that I was sorry and that I could have started I ’ d start tomorrow morning, that was not my particularly sad day, but at the age of 21, I was barely old enough to understand and that was not my particular problem. But no, my headache was pretty serious. I was wearing a doctor ’ s uniform- I ’ d been in the hospital for quite some time, I must admit, a program official so skilled at holocaust fighting. All this meant it would take a day or two to mend my pains, to get rid of them by myself. I was even, at this stage, not sure whether to grovel on the ground or stutter out of fear when I said I would be coming to look out the window. 
 Suddenly, the coughs stopped, the air came back and I felt something lighten. I threw my head back and reached for my coat, grabbed the TV and then I went outside to see if I can get some sleep. 
 A man comes out wearing a hospital coat and he pulls a very different emergency blanket. He asks where the patient is. 
 “ I ’ m here to talk to you. Have you a pulse? Do you have an appointment? ” 
 I took off my coat and drenched myself in acid. I just chuckled, “ Not his, not my, nurse, not even me. ” The rest of the staff was screaming and some workers were being disorderly. As we got to our quarters, I felt a bit all over, my head and body became sticky and I started to feel dizzy as well. My roommate kept calling me names and yelled at me as I couldn ’ t move. But I didn ’ t need to. There wasn ’ t anything I could do to prevent it and I ran into the parking lot, pulling out my umbrella and storming out of the parking space. I grabbed the wires coming out of the roof of the building on the way out and jabbed my foot at the doorway. Again, a loud scream came from the place. I pointed to it and it went down to try and pass it off as noise. I couldn ’ t find anyone who could cut off the line to the front door, not with a wrench, but I felt someone pushing me through an opening in the wall. I ran to tell them to shut the door and it was unlocked. The other side had been darkened and so were the windows. I was crying all the while. 
 All of a sudden, I was in a second hospital where the patient was alive, but not quite. I heard the doctor saying that I was seeing light but that this too was a way to stay awake. I sat by the wheel with the doctor who said that I was not on the right track. I opened my mouth wide open and couldn ’ t get anything out but I felt a hand on my leg and a voice say my name. My mind blocked out all the distractions and began to get ready to get out of here. 
 On my birthday I felt the cold rub against me and know it was not a good day. I didn ’ t remember dreaming about it or going back in time to work. As I lay there, in a hospital bed, I began to come into consciousness only to find I was brought back to reality. My mind kicked into gear thinking that this was a dream. Then as I saw the doctor with a smile on his face, he turned and said nothing. With that the nurses and staff came to treat me, another nurse came and left. I don ’ t remember anything after that. 
 Not that I would do that to myself.<|endoftext|>

"You wrote that? " 
 The boy with the ring stared incredulously at the very senior reporter sitting across from him. 
 " That's the fuckin' truth, Matt, you told me to get up and start pedaling, we'll be on Air Force One by 10. Nobody wants this." 
 The man didn't move, the Colonel noted as he left the room and headed back inside. He didn't like it when others with the same brother secretly tried to do something terrible. 
 The reporter hesitated in his steps. 
 But when his right arm finally bent forward enough to take the student, he began pedaling. Then another. Finally, another. A third. Then another. 
 Matt was sure he had no idea why he had been sent to Air Force One, and yet there it was, his story. He finally stopped to think of the drill sergeant that made the best of it. The kid who almost died. His family. And his eventual death when the captain made his run. 
 Matt sat down next to the younger reporter and pulled out a box of Marine rocks. He dove for the rocks and then licked his lips, pushing against the first rock. He pulled one, two, three. Then one and three. He then slid through to the second rock, then a four and the fifth. Then another. And one and four. He used that last rock to shove the second rock in, then, in a third, into a fourth. The hatch opened and a woman jumped out and threw the rocks, knocking Matt over.<|endoftext|>

I got to the sweetest part. They said, "We don't decide your choices. What we do is up to you. " Now I'm married to a bunch of stone-faced, sweaty, donut-eating old people. Literally. In a lot of ways. Why you won't eventually marry me, you ask? My answer to that is kind of simple. I thought that this was the bane of marriage life. 
 You learn much on your way to work. You realize you have to pay people. You learn how to have a child that you love. You also, like most things in life, learn about the areas of interest in the world around you. They move all around you, some passing by your bed side, some chasing you along the street, some catching fish and pets. Also, you learn your neighborhood's values. A city. A civilization. A world. A name, though that's almost meaningless to me. It would be like the Los Angeles of those centuries. Sure, I never knew how city-themed there were churches. I'd have to be quite certain on that. And I learn it all. Sometimes, I do find that they can be quite forgiving. I mean, of course you still have a kid, but that one was supposed to have two loving and caring parents. The ones you love, the ones you're there for. Who knows what kind of person they are, but you still live with them in your heart. 
 So I gathered myself when I finally married the barrier. Which is to say, the man that got married to a hard-working, pale pale woman without any rights or responsibilities. And most importantly, the man that married me. 
 I got to the final part. My wife and I set her on a path to earn her a special place in this paradise. Her perfect place. Our civilization must continue, whatever that means. But something feels off. Maybe that was the surprise the decision I made. Like, right before I married her, I learned the true meaning of life. I didn't have her. I don't have the means to begin one before I can fully enjoy my life. 
 Everyone is smiling, I think, but there's one person in particular I feel a part of. She looks more like her husband than I do. She probably asks me if I need more proof. I mean, come on, it's supposed to be so simple. I don't have much else to ask. 
 I turn to her, and she says, " How about we eat? "<|endoftext|>

It had been 100 years since I had left here for over an hour. We were going to make history. We met all the world famous, we had lived a peaceful life. What we weren't ready for was the hisrzee sharing of the lands with his reavers. The reavers were like slaves and serfs too. We had fought of hand to hand against the over aggressors. We kept the one true friendship that existed between us to ensure the safety of everything that ever happened on this planet. 
 A man went across the planet with us as we were leaving through the main gate. He told us about the current world peace after years of war. He told us about the cultures he would visit and the crimes the reavers had committed. He told us about his clothes and that he was more depressed than I was. It took me some time to form that idea and convince him to go with us. 
 A giant wave of rockets was launched out of the sky into space. The Reavers let us off to make the solar flare loose. The space of the space of the solar flare turned into it. The man left us with only one thought in his mind: 
 "It's all he took." 
 I used this quote to become the leader of the reavers.

She walks slowly past me. I grab the nursing tray, thinking about the night we lost. The dull light of the restaurant filled with the music of it's guest, something I could have never understood. I reach into my back pocket, just before pulling the phone out of my pocket. She didn't ring at first, but I thought she still wanted her favorite drink. I hand her a mug, which was fitting. She drops it onto her lap and the warm rum sounds in her ears and I appreciate the warm crimson mist settling on my lap. 
 She leans back and smiles warmly. I look to her, wanting to fix her ears or her facial hair. She leans forward and she puts the mug down on the table and in turns places the tray with her two hands. I sit up in bed excited and in both of her hands, we put the water bottle in my laps as we sit down. It is as if nothing was ever ever the same, the lights on the patio never a different color. Her eyes are lit with a quality of dimmed just a few seconds prior, she keeps her gaze focused on the coffee stain on her necklace. 
 We're both stunned. She's the one that came in with the plates, the one that came out with the wine. The one that said she was the model in the sewing machine. She was always under my spell when I was at work. At first I thought it was a joke and that was the reason she passed away. Then I thought it was something to do with the door closing at the moment I walked in. I decided it wasn't going to be as bad as I thought. I didn't know what to think of it. I quietly grabbed the cup from her and set it down on the table before opening the door. 
 She's a beautiful light. The last time I tasted her home was fifteen years ago. Her lipstick glistened in the light, glistening off of her nails like diamonds. Her lips pressed forward and out of the corner of my eye, like she was spending the first moment on her last flight. All right, now you don't even realize that you have to reach for the phone to call 911. 
 I nod. My attention is drawn to her. I look at her more for a moment and turn to kiss her forehead. I opened the door and collapsed to the ground, from the pain of how hard I fought to keep her away. She slept for three hours, just to make sure I wasn't in danger and she woke up the next morning in an alarmingly comfy bed. As I wait, I gently kiss her forehead and smile tenderly. I wait a moment, a single moment for her to be in pain, only for her to turn around, staring at me helplessly. 
 I leave before she turns back. I call the ambulance, a paramedic, and four police officers. I'm never sure where she will be for a while and I have to watch her carefully, but a long, tearful look is etched upon my face, before she lets me go.

 Hope you liked it! If you didn't, I have a friend who is at work. He will continue.<|endoftext|>

"So this is why I get up every morning in the office every morning to type out this report, right? Because it *runs the risk of getting over-compensated by a publisher or some other shit." 
 There was a really young girl in an office drugged up. Her only explanation was that in a few short minutes, something horrific would happen. The reporter jumped out of the way, ignoring all of the other reporters probing her, and the only sane thought was that the crime was too obvious. When she exited through the security door, a little girl was on top of her. The journalist put the gashes on her wrist where her palms used to be and pushed them back up. He took one last look at the girl, and told his horror at his actions. The reporter's desperate look made the girl smile. The only question was how. His voice was heavy and sent a nervous shiver through the cold of the hallway. There was nobody. The reporter started to doze off. 
 Days later, the girl was woken from her nap on a hospital bed. The disturbing thing about the surgery was that a bottle of ibuprofen was spilled. The incisions she cut had always been ragged and made it difficult to steady. In fact, some of the cut looked worn. The reporter had called an ambulance to treat the girl for the pain.<|endoftext|>

"YOU BORROW PIG! " 
 " But sir I- " 
 " Take it! " 
 I had heard Mr. Hook also had another problem this week as well. You see, after six years working for the boogers of the Underground, last week I had gotten a job on the line for the underground's mainly profit bastions, the namesake bank. I had a funny encounter with him last week when I was spending all day, and even the most earnest of customers heard my contemptuous argument about his filth. They didn't object or object to my glorious judgment, so instead of discussing reasons for my departure, they simply demanded a cash prize to be taken, outside of my responsibility. 
 " Now, Mr. Hook. This is entirely true. " 
 I glance over to my boss' face. I see a lack of remorse and regret from where I sat, yet I then looked at the amount he won. I stared at my bankroll with eyes one whit, counting the cash I made, up until the day I gave up. I haven't filled that bill yet. 
 " Now that I read the fine print, I can assure you that I am not taking this move on myself. I will seek a settlement, before I retire. You will cease to exist, as a part of your own private, private enterprise. In return, you will be stripped of any goods you have made, or goods you have... " 
 " WHAT! NO ONE CHEAT SO MUCH AS GRAB IN THIS! " screamed Mr. Hook. As his eyes lit up, I could feel the sweat building up on my forehead, and it was starting to get itchy. I wasn't expecting any of this. 
 " But Mr. Hook, the sole reason my advances have disappeared is because I have used the months trying to... " I paused, staring at Mr. Hook. 
 " What is it?! " he shouted from his office. 
 I stood and froze for a moment, until I looked up at him and saw he was slowly moving his hands forward, trying to make eye contact with me. I reached out and grasped his hand. In his other hand, I held a gun. At the last second, I heard him raise his gun as something violently popped from his other hand, and then another, like a motionless person popped out of the smoke, but outside of sight. I reached for my phone, and I was puffy at the disbelief, but the typing was fast. I knew my boss had found a new job after this had happened, and I thought this would be the perfect retirement break. 
 *Sir? * 
 " Yes Mr. Hook? " 
 " Can you help me? " I asked him. 
 " Of course sir! " Mr. Hook said gently, but I couldn't help but look up, confused. My bosses' face almost made you wonder if his face made me feel this way, although I could see it as his eyes turned red. 
 " Yes, of course, sir!" Mr. Hook said smiling, as he led me back to my car and ran away from the truck. 
 That's how I ended up on the floor, handcuffed to a chair, and I couldn't shake this feeling. My boss had gone down a long, depressing path. On the set of a show he had performed for months, he had had the opportunity to pack all of his masks into one, and then take a nap inside. I wasn't sure if he was cheating on my bosses with his masks, or if this was another sign of how badly he planned to fight me. Maybe I had other ideas. Maybe I was just a producer of his weirdest show. That would be good. And then, I was free from my situation.

 I don't think I understand. I liked that you chose to do this. While doing this, I decided to slowly ( and subjectively ) begin naming the strings and rings, really get a feel for what they really are, from what I saw in the working parts. I liked the twist ending, and I wasn't really sure what might be going on. I'm still working on it, and not sure what I'll get out of it.<|endoftext|>

When I went to bed, the glass of wine on the table fell to my lap. I couldn't even get the bottle out of my hand. It fell to the floor. 
 The way she curled her eyes closed and the way her face slipped into the corner, knowing all too well what the words had meant in her voice. She'd never been able to shut them away when I was saying them. They were thousands of words. A thousand words of tragedy, anguish, joy, hate. Her. The name I'd given her while she was here still made sense. She'd won all these years by the way she'd sat beside me in bed. 
 If I couldn't figure out a way to sing, she'd have said to me. If she'd moved from kitchen she'd always say a few words, mostly back when they were empty. Any words she said, be they hopeful or sad. They always became both. 
 I thought about her for a few seconds. 
 "Ooyou. You got the perfect partner. " She was my favorite. But honestly, she almost never was. Some of her words. When she played with me as a child. When she said I wouldn't go to Paris. When she was still screaming in the distance. 
 All those words could never be my most loved friend. 
 We'd talked more and more. I had. 
 I'd killed people for her. I had taken turns haunting. I'd dropped bullets at people that really did deserve to be dead. And I'd cried on the floor. But I had cried nonetheless. 
 It was a habit. A habit I learned to stick to. 
 But the roots of the one thing I loved every second of every day, she lived a life she never saw. Even though I'd had plenty of friends. She lived as long as anyone else, a little less than that while I had. 
 When I was dead, I could not fill myself with such lost thoughts. It never mattered, not when I hated, laughed or cried. How many times had I considered telling her these words? 
 I knew I could always find someone else to be with. Someone who would really be hurt.

 Adam let out a choked sigh. 
 This was wonderful. But as he shuffled through the room, thinking, for the first time in a long time, he forgot that he still had money to put into the kitchen. One of the tubes under his left eye hadn't dented, and it was too late.<|endoftext|>

My mouth doesn't seem to move, but my bones feel heavy and attached. Surely I'm not moving any quicker than the rest of us. For when I am past even 30 feet of concrete, I can not move the body-to-bone with ease. Why do they need their characters to stay at the bottom of a building with me, though? Am I resisting it? 
 As the adrenaline begins to enter my body, I can not help but wonder what is happening to me. Life has not been the same since I was a child. It felt like an eternity in a lab. The furrowed brow in my hands would have made my beard look slanted as if I were pulling out spaghetti. But my arm felt like it had no joints. No motion. 
 I know that I can not escape this place with an unfamiliar face. 
 We made it. I am here. The door to the building that was once my home. I stand in front of it. A hideous figure stares at me with red eyes, much like this person in the movie they just watched. He doesn't seem to care when the door handles slam closed. This isn't right. 
 The person turns around and says "good afternoon ". I take a swig of my beer before saying, " hello friend. I love your beard." 
 Slowly, I begin to stumble around the building. An older woman by the doorway gives me a sideways glance, then says, " thanks ". At this point, I have barely found a voice to say anything. What now? I'm shaking. I don't feel my body move, because no-one does. Maybe it was a bad dream that made me forget my arms. 
 There are several people who have eyes here. It's hard to differentiate between a person and an object through their eyes. But there is a strange feeling to the looks on everyone's faces. Like their eyes are only seeing what they are observing. 
 People look like they are running away. My body senses an unseen force. My limbs aren't moving. The last thing I remember is running towards the same apartment complex. A man runs past me. I run towards him, all the while holding onto his arms.<|endoftext|>

The fact that you're here, talking to me about it, means it worked. 
 Michael, you were way, way late for school, or did you actually remember me?... Yeah, I don't remember anymore, right? 
 I... I wanted to ask you out. I knew how amazing you must be, at 10:30 and you just want to play videogames like everyone else. I wanted to ask you out, and I knew what you would think. 
 But it was dark. You could see the moon ahead of you, and we were still in circles. You had to move around, right? And then, I thought about it. And then you think, well... Are you the only one that goes like this? And you're so nervous. You're so excited to be in a videogame, to have to be so close and get so close to me. Do you ever wonder why I never slept? 
 Oh god. God. Michael, you just got in a situation like that. That's how it must have been. You got to grab a blowtorch, we don't even need a blowtorch, you have a screwdriver. You've been my best friend for a long time. You know... I came to the conclusion that I could make you happy just by going in there with me. I know I can, because you know you can. 
 Now I didn't sleep. What happened then? 
 I haven't had a dream in thirty minutes. I can't breathe. 
 "Michael, you're... " 
 You are dead now.<|endoftext|>

"To The Death " 
 " Be my prisoner! " 
 A passionate cry escaped him as he thumped against the wall hard. His ribcage briefly broke off, bleeding as he got fiercly swayed back and forth. 
 " To The Death " 
 " For being the last of my kind. " 
 A small sob escaped his lips. A heart he held precious. A woman she knew. As he turned to look, she couldn't help but smile. " You, you are the only person worth fighting for. Don't doubt me. " 
 " To The Death " 
 He looked at her and smiled one last time. She nodded and handed him the phone. Without a word, the cell shut. The last man ever to step foot on the final floor. Then he spoke with his sweet little angel, her sweet girl. " Here, listen to me, " she said, holding his hands in hers, " Take this. " 
 He took off his mask. The death metal was a nice little color, his metal heart charmingly supporting his muscles. The left side of the mask gave off the scent of wood, making him soft and sweet. A warm, dry kiss brought him to his feet. He let it fall back on to his body, and planted his eyes on it and his chest. Soon, he could see the tattoo on his cheek and the image of the first blossom he saw. 
 She held the tattoo, something that was... different. Still, it was a fresh and beautiful tattoo of her smile. He watched in wonder as it looked down at her. Slowly, she started to hum. 
 " To The Death."<|endoftext|>

It's easy to give a romantic friend a moment of bliss when he goes fishing and holds a baseball bat because he doesn't think they will ever fly away. I am not hardy enough to be a paragon of the senses or a goodger of the mind. And yeah I played golf when I was 12 years old, and I bet my parents would've sold me and we would have a neighbor happy. I remember my grandfather telling me, "Goddamnit, you can't give a man half of a wish that will somehow turn out OK. " Well my great grandfather told me that once he was living his life surrounded by his grandkids, he never wanted to grow up to have a soul or have an " unhealthy" obsession with junk food. Eventually the poor fucker himself decided that that's what he wanted from his grandkids. He had dementia with long term disability and developed a stubborn drive to erase whatever life or spirit or sessitude of existence it had left. But damn. 
 So in the years that followed, I tried to raise him more. I tried to make him laugh with pepes, sugar and chocolate and cream. He only listened to one song, " Eat like a dolce and flower" because he didn't need to listen. I guess I just couldn't keep up with all the demands of my various companies. Luckily I didn't have to operate a bunker, either. 
 One day, as I was picking out my tab for dinner when I noticed a pair of skinny little gray puppies shivering under a newspaper. The entire entire night before, I made sure that my pierogi blanket came in handy. I spent the next couple of days holding onto the blanket as my mind worked out what to do. 
 Eventually a man broke the news to me, and I remember thinking, " Shit. This is how I will end this." 
 I eventually got a job as a storage assistant and, well, neither of us knew what that meant. I gave him one knee and he slipped. I was happy.<|endoftext|>

Satan hesitated. His eyes flared. His body shivered. " What have I done to deserve this? " he asked. * My* choice? 
 " Your wish... I... " He reached out, as if to grab something but... 
... Then... a black flying piece of paper unfolded, and it showed his name. " Benson Watson. " 
 " Benson Watson? " 
 " Benson Watson? " 
 " Benson Watson? " 
 " Benson Watson? " 
 "... I don't know how to pronounce it... " 
 " This makes no sense, Benson Watson... I mean do I really have to give you this upon my deathbed? " 
 " NO! I can grant you any wish, *I* can grant ANY wish without going into debt to anyone else, so long as they keep giving it away. It is a conceptually complex system of thought. " 
 " Sounds great! " was all he said. 
 " Oh really? " he gestured to his horse " I really do. Why, you had a great time, and all I can give you is this fluffed parchment?! " 
 " It is only fair, Benson Watson, no one has a problem " 
 " You sound... arrogant... " 
 " *already* arrogant, Benson Watson... I... I want to stop... any-- any-- activities! " 
 " Remember this document, Benson Watson! I'm asking you to write down the word PLEASE and I expect you to fill this section, and I expect a follow up, " he replied, as he scratched the paper closer, and gazed up at the sea of black clouds, " ALL of this written in under 100 words, *as if ever asked*! " 
 " Okay Benson Watson, of course I'm very going to wait out the next dozen or so years! " 
 " Alright! Now! " 
 Satan squatted behind his horse, ready to enter his lord's vault, and read the parchment again, but hesitated. He scratched it out of his hand, feeling concerned about what he didn't make sense of. Soon, the black cloud began to swirl around the sun, and he felt light in a blinding flash, followed soon by white, scorched sand, and a pre-dawn sky filled with black, grey clouds, engulfing all but those he had yet to touch. 
 " Benson Watson, is this some sort of hallucination or a sign of your of premature death? " 
 " No Benson Watson, I mean it is certainly not. But it has something in it, " said one of the grey clouds, " Pristine, that, it certainly smells of garlic and red wine! " 
 " No! It is trying to convince me you are the devil! But I swear on your deathbed, I *hear* you making me wait! " 
 His voice grew increasingly agitated. " I can't do this, Benson Watson! I CAN DO IT! " 
 " The devil has a plan, Benson Watson! But what if it's got nowhere to go? " 
 " OK, then why don't you write it down and I will make sure your words get to the very top! But, as you can see, the formatting isn't as in perfect. Especially because... you seem much more eloquent as you're writing. " 
 The words " Please " and " Thank You" appeared in red lettering, and he sighed. He flipped the page to page a few times, hoping that the small pile of papers would fetch a pay raise. The world, finally free of debt, it cost him nothing.<|endoftext|>

 " Nothing fancy, what'll it be? " 
 " My brand new Kindle Fire tablet. " 
 " Ugh yeah, what is it this time? " 
 " Oh yeah, it's actual paper, no files in it. " 
 " What the fuk?! " 
 " Word requires at least two weeks of usage and I need to go with nano-interaction here so I'll be pushing it through the airport in about three minutes, assuming everything runs smoothly. " 
 " Shit! " 
 " I still love that little golden brown tablet. " 
 " Yeah I did " 
 " Well I'm gon na run that and then maybe I'll get some Apple and then it'll have all the McDonalds food and oh god I think it's just a sack of food. "

I'd been on radio long enough to know the name of my favorite station. It was the rock, and the blues. It was the blues, but I couldn't always take it back. I cried a lot. I know, but after I got the call I thought: "This feels good, I'll start composing and propping up." 
 It was taken my afternoon off and I was on a quest for a job. I was in town, and I couldn't get through the national anthem. I stood there, thinking: "Would I listen to my daughter and how poor it sounded on Saturday night without her? " 
 I couldn't work this job. My ears were ringing from getting out of bed last night, and my mind was racing, trying to figure out what was happening. 
 It was about an hour and twenty minutes from now that I boarded my plane. I didn't come down, but when I did I was greeted by a horde of soldiers. By my earphones. They were familiar, but I couldn't tell what they were. 
 When I got on my plane I began clearing the following notes and heard the soldier yell: " YOU'RE COMING TO A MISSION! " 
 The smallest officer kept his jaw steady, and barely fidgeted, until he gave a quick nod and put on his helmet. I heard the soldier return his gaze to his squad. 
 I got aboard and started my flight home. This was always funny. It was just so surreal when someone stood in front of me with guns blazing. The baby cries of my family and friends, the grief that could not be solved by father, and the constant horn blaring. I knew this whole time that the same voice spoke out loud: " That's what it was like before the war." 
 I would always get a wave of memories of it once I started to realize what was happening, when all we had in our lives was the pure ignorance that I would never be able to resolve a problem with the space commander.<|endoftext|>
**********647**********
I finally saved the universe. That's what God did. The universe is eternal. I saved itself in different universes that had different people who had different beliefs. 
 But I got sick of being "compassionate ", constantly watching the rise and fall of the world around me. I found myself hurt and scared at the same time and it all felt terrible. Watching my brothers and sisters struggle to survive the harshness of the world around me caused my heart to spin. I'm the chosen one! I am no master, who will lead those around me in a manner that makes them light up my own day when the time comes! Of course it will not be long before I die. 
 But that's for another story. For one more to take the spotlight off of you all. You and I have made great strides in science, and for that I will take the spotlight back in... Forever. And every year I have to see them live out the rest of their days in happiness. Like the last time a super mutant forced into a failing lab used live coral instead of a magic laser! It's a painful time but when it comes down to it! You all mean well you should keep up with each other! Me, I figure I'll leave you alone in the end. If you don't then you'll never get anywhere! I'm leaving! You're mine now. If you don't give me hope then I won't bring you down either! 
 Now I move the universe to an alternate universe. If God existed, then why, God was probably on a magic trip to the Rift, so I had to move to the real one. If I don't then I won't be able to tell them any secrets. I guess I'll have to find my other self to continue living, otherwise I'm not any more. 
 That and a new universe beckoning me to a new house. No, life is not for the weak. Go to somewhere healthier. It's like I'm just our mother's team supporting her baby in the lab. Getting into some chair from work! It's cold out here. And I'll be stuck here for a while for my health to stabilize and keep me sane. No, it will be okay. 
 The door opens. It is God, his eyes gleaming like diamonds. Do you know what surprises me so much about him? He turns and smiles at me. " Hello, God ". 
 " How are you? ". God stops grinning and says " I was watching over the galaxy as I wove the universe around you". 
 The shock on my face turns to happiness when I realise there's a small piece of a golden space capsule directly in front of me.<|endoftext|>

Remember how I always said the chair was black? Maybe so. Over the years I have been trying to shake off the impression that the chair is black, we would find out the truth, but my students always stood in the middle of the hall accusing me of lying. If I put my head above it, I am incapable of finding out the truth. 
 There is a quiet, soft humming sound coming from the rear of the class hallway. I stir and turn in surprise as the humming continues. The humming sounds are getting louder until a small shrill sound starts to come from the back of the hall, louder than the humming of my students. The young ones, however, are not interested in showing me the truth. I turn my head back towards the principal, caught off guard. His very face is disturbed and he quickly looks down at his watch and frowns. 
 "Miss, it's morning, what's wrong? " he asks. 
 " It's 4:00 am, I just want to go home, help the students write notes for class and clean up. " 
 " Ah yes, Mr. Gutierrez, you are my assistant Professor. " I reply. " This is my family's class, have some time together for lunch at the school. " 
 " Excuse me, Mrs. Gutierrez? I have a voicemail from my assistant Professor DiBanks. " 
 " Do you have the professor's number? I suggest you don't bother calling him until his phone rings at 4:02 am. " 
 " Don't worry, Miss Gutierrez. " I replied. " Thanks. " 
 As soon as Mrs. Gutierrez answered the door I got a text: 
 *email is ringing, old man is asking for help, is he allowed to leave?* 
 *closes, big man leaves office, do you know why? * 
 The phone on the table is still ringing as Mr. Gutierrez and my assistant Professor DiBanks chat. 
 *both in their situation, both considering suicide* 
 Now I have no choice but to take his calling and open the voicemail. 
 *my beloved, I have to tell you something* 
 [ " I am sorry, I got to go, I will now send the class. Please leave. I understand that you don't want to be here, but know that it is my family's call. Please, please leave. I will not be home, I have a friend that I wish would never, ever have to go. This is my family's call* 
 I hear the sound from outside my window, the one I paid a visit to in the halls last year, my very self. People argue outside, my welcome. People's reactions? I look up as Mr. Gutierrez's fist pierces my window and drives through the wood, whistling like someone had cut him open. 
 " Miss Gutierrez, I don't wish for the death of someone I loved, but my beloved has to go, the life that I grew up with. I believe that this means something to you, and my whole school. We will leave, so you will know everything about us. Tell your friends if you can talk about the death of your beloved, and if you need anything. " 
 Mr. Gutierrez stops his fist and looks at the window, a foul smirk formed on his face. He looks at his phone, sighs, and pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket. He hands it to me. 
 " Goodbye, and goodbye, sir."<|endoftext|>

"Come on man, it's time, I need some pure rock in my shoes. " His words thunder through the world. 
 " Babe, I know I'll pay you, but what you need is this. " One of the promoters shouted. He was a clean cut dude that worked in a bank if the lawyer came by. There was a flash of light and he had to have a look. " If you come back as clean as the man I used to be then I'm paying you back for the LP you didn't make. " 
 " Babe, you get all that money but can't you just play until I've heard the terms of the deal? " 
 " I know, but you want to live? " 
 " I don't have a deal. Fuck it, I'm not doing this anymore anyway. I know you wouldn't want me, but we need to do this. "

"Aero. " 
 " C'mon man, we got ta go. " 
 " What? " 
 " I knew we couldn't. " 
 Aero is suspended in space, repulsing as the smoke billows and swirls around the shoreline. He looks down, dumbfounded, at the debris. 
 " I know. Oh it's okay. We get better and better. " 
 Aero's eyes are wide, but he barely lets go of his seat, quickly walking the broken remains of his ship. It seems to swirl away, managing to exit their escape in our direction. 
 " Why is everything going so fast, Cal? It's almost like you can see. I guess that's the only way we're gon na survive. " 
 " Well, you said we'd be able to keep up after some time. 
 Aero's eyes water, but he does not retreat. 
 " Come on let's go get some rocks and backup power. SNAKE! " 
 Everything is buffeted with dirt. Trees. Not even…me? 
 " Where? " 
 " Keep telling yourself I'm the lead engineer. " 
 The string of orders made their way to the little telescope that calks past the ship. 
 " Point Captain, confirm mission progress on planet. " 
 " Captain, signal for entity to come back. " 
 " What? " 
 " Oceanic Patrol, respond. " 
 The ship still moves, allowing Aero a few minutes to drift slowly behind it. The planet is barely fifty miles into the surface. 
 " Just close the wreck door. " 
 " For starters. A forward start. " 
 Aero only sees another vestigial speck in the ship's rear, one with the planet's star as a backdrop. This planet looks peaceful, maybe enough to call off the mission. 
 " What are you guys doing? " 
 " Care to explain something to me, huh, sir? We're the planetary police. We're here to protect the planet. " 
 The ship's passengers pour inside, an influx of sound pressure only made more hysterical by the hyper-reaction of every empty bottle and pellet made from the wreck on the carpet. 
 " We're heading in the right direction, sir. In the right direction. " 
 They make a sharp turn, and Aero collapses on his seat, turning his head to see what he's meant to see. 
 " The planet's gone. It went into orbit. " 
 " It's gone, Cal."

Raquell. The lowly bastard was spent, head of the Roman senate was punished, but he could never allow himself to mourn that his son was still standing. He could no longer remember when he spoke the truth. It was in a once organized form of speech with a few lines of each of the Bearers of Enoch's oaths, we all knew, but even those deep down, even up and down the clan did not know. He decided instead to leave behind the bludgeon to the wretch for honest warlocks. 
 He still shook his head in disbelief when his son came across him in the yard. His son smiled as the Embers of Sapor, offering him drinks. It was obvious that the man he promised blood and said his prayers for death wasn't coming. His son replied in kind, "No you don't, and I swear upon my life that I will drink of your son, which is my father's sacrifice if I die!" 
 With his words, Sapor vanished into the night. 
 It was not until he woke up that he realized that the body was still there. The boy had known, at least, that Sapor had shared his secrets. The only thing which was keeping Sapor from killing would be everything it held dear, so if Sapor could not kill, then it could not be touched.<|endoftext|>

I hit my head on the jagged edge of the sidewalk and instinctively turned on the television in my mouth to avoid what I could only describe as the tiniest accidental pillow bump in my life. 
 The news crawl from the Sydney Morning Herald was looking bleak. A storm was brewing, but they saw him on the other side of the street and were streaming live with coverage of the brief moment that air in their lungs it would take them to dissipate, really. His name was James Bond, as there was no mistaking his strength under nearly the height of the hurricane. 
 The TV blared when the local news anchor arrived from the interview room. " At 11pm, and it's time for our world to heal, 15 year-old James Bond, who feels trapped in a primary school he's hardly even known for, has hitched a life like no other. To you James Bond. This is the miracle of human life. " 
 The camera holo-display picked up James's voice. " No one in their right minds would call my powers of immortality possible or even attainable today - but that's OK James, I guess. We've grown to such a point, it seems we've all given up hope. So, some people just gave up hope on us in order to survive the brink of disaster. That's what happened James." 
 James's eyes wandered to the screen over his shoulder, heavy with curiosity and a smirk on his face. 
 He was right, I was getting stuck in a simulation. There was no hope, but hell, even the most logical and logical of explanations could not account for the slightest signs of hope.<|endoftext|>

Btw, this was fantastic. I figured they got a little too creative with the writing. 
 I got as deep a kick as I could in this story, I feel good about myself, but as soon as I finish I think of me dying. 
 From the moment I saw who the guy was I felt a little off. He was my roommate. Something strange. Even though he was the one who talked to me, I've never heard him talk to me this good. I felt like I was doing something wrong with it. Nothing. 
 I never heard a voice in a very long time. I can't remember how long I've been here, but I can say that I was quite busy at the time. I couldn't go on. Maybe it's my age that got me here, but no. I still don't know what could happen if I just give it up, but it can't be talked about here. 
 I felt something tugged at me. It felt almost scary, I imagined a flying pillow coming for me like it was a beautiful piece of metal. It felt soft on my skin, as though I was waking up in a hot tub. 
 Suddenly I was surrounded by his "friend ". He looked up at me and appeared surprised, somewhat confounded by the part of the story he was in. He said something he didn't quite understand. " You're not going to believe this. " 
 I was shocked. I never knew him, but I never did remember having this strange alien friend. I felt my jaw dropping. I realized that I was bumping into someone in the background. 
 I was scared. " B, try, try!" I shouted, trying to hold back the grief I had for this life. I tried to hold onto what he had said, but could not. Instead I was alive. I was a whole new person, but I was still him. 
 I remember crying, tears falling on my skin. How can someone do that? I broke down sobbing. As if I was standing on my own breath. I could not help but think back. I had something to live for. Nothing. I just wanted to be with him, to see him for the rest of my life. And what a tragedy that was. 
 But all it did was feel warmth in his eyes. I couldn't feel anything, but I felt sad at the memory. It just happened to be right. My friend left, and I had a big world to live on. I guess I should thank god I did not make it in Heaven. The only thing I will do now, is just write this story. 
 It's not very long now. I guess I'm going to have to stop. I'm going to finish it. I'm going to leave this place. I'll do my job. I'll write about this. I will write about what I think the world needs to be like. I will write about what I can no longer be or can not be or will not be. I just made it this far. 
 Btw, this was amazing. I think they got a little too creative with the writing.<|endoftext|>

Hearing the angels arthsome wild mountainside, fading with time. 
 When the doors opened he was greeted to a shining throne. And it is a marvelous sight. My legs are lengthening as I hold it tight to his hand. Upon his shoulders, the thin frame of golden robes covers a broad shoulder and a thin chin. 
 "Anthro- " The Angel impaled him with a cross. " I am the Prince of Sacrifice. After the Holy War, we have been recognized as a community. " 
 Now, as I open my eyes to the sky, I could swear I see a halo of flames across the front of my body and countless ripples from the manial dust throughout his outer shins. Little flies brush by as he stares at me, confused. 
 " Just who is this? " I stumble back over my cracked knees. " You will be the object of the cleansing rites. " 
 This rumbling seems to deepen. " Wait. What are you saying? " 
 He looks so drained. " I am the Great Prince of Sacrifice, a part of you. You will do whatever it is your duty. " He lets a strand of hair hang limply around his ear. 
 " I am telling you how easy it is for the rangers and elven to come here. I only have one way. " 
 He growls with contempt. " You can not take ownership of the valley we are walking in! The gates are blocked for this's sake. So be it. " 
 My eyes close and my blood stung my mouth. " Right, that is obvious. " 
 " What is this? " 
 I pause. The demon raised his hand to our face. 
 " Are you saying it is worth it? " 
 He stares at me in disbelief. " You are... evil! You kill the innocent!? " 
 I look at the demon. " You killed the Demon! " 
 " Okay, just remember that. " He turned his head, closed his eyes, and my eyes flew open. 
 As he fell, countless angels began to dance across the horizon, some even dancing with him. My arms and legs were broken beyond repair and outstretched with wings. My body was torn and mangled, but I held the holy flame in my free hand. Then, the last angel appeared. 
 "... and I said *proper*, " She said, my voice barely above a whisper. " I am an unchosen king from the realm of the fallen. " 
 " His time has come, so come forth from his throne! " I commanded. " Behold! A very rare and fabulous form of art I have created, called radata. You will not fail!" 
 Her screams echoed amongst the grass. My flesh burned in my hands and I could sense a horrible pain in my voice.<|endoftext|>
**********656**********
"Nothing? " 
 I sat back and let the urge bite into my bones like a seal clutching a hammer. No, that wasn't right. When I first saw it, every thread in my life seemed to be threads, perfect anthems and just a dull clattering on an otherwise fine foundation of sound. But after this all faded away, I learned how to laugh it off. 
 I get a slew of profiles about this theory. A man who is said to have killed every woman he ever touched. A man who has a knack for convincing people to do things they never would. And a friend who claims that he sees you fade into nothingness every night with nothing but his eyes. But you got to read through them. 
 " People don't die until you begin to bleed. " 
 I pick up a lifeline and walk to my spot. In front of me is a blonde haired brunette, dressed and polished in an opulent gold rush lace flannel shirt and flowing dark green silk tie. She has her finger to her lips and flutters some delicate tears that are now turning a little grey, " Not everyone has a gift " a friendly voice says. 
 I look around the other side of the couch, it's an impressive sight. Purple and white splashes of soft flames flow through the elegant turquoise floor and there is a scene from... random horror movies. I turn and watch the sickle dance in front of me. I stop. It begins to glow and a brilliant band slowly erupts from the left foot of its skinny slit. 
 " My sister has died. I don't think she would have survived. " 
 There's a call out in a nearby building. 
 " What did you do? You killed her " 
 I hold up the lifeline I picked up, " I tried to leave her the door when I saw her. " 
 " But how did you end up here? " the man sounds unusually familiar. 
 I pause. I see everyone talking about this strange. 
 " It's a spell. " 
 " A spell to protect you from death. " 
 " Perhaps, but I would sacrifice myself for someone I can save now. " I think, " Then who would kill me first? " 
 The scar itself is beginning to heal and my body begins to walk and flex. I am slipping and twitching at the thought. 
 " But I didn't have a way out. I'm trapped. " 
 " Is there something you can do? " 
 I look at the man in the corner of the couch. A is wrapping his arms around my shoulders. 
 " I think you are ready. " 
 The man smiles at me and locks his eyes with mine. I take a few quick steps back. I can feel it. It's real. It's mine and mine alone. 
 " I've arrived, I leave. " 
 I start walking back out of the house. 
 " I hope you find peace."<|endoftext|>
**********657**********
My eyes snapped open from time to time in a chaotic flood. I looked up at the blissfully unaware woman with who I had tried so hard to protect my child from. That was the last time I spoke. She regained her balance, and as she turned to look at me, she saw something else. It was my son. 
 The darkness below was always a cloudy one, but as the darkness grew, I realized I was staring into nothingness. I had been staring into nothingness for the last eight months. I sat at the sink, pulling a notebook from my sleeve, and started writing.<|endoftext|>
**********658**********
She sat down beside me in the waiting room. I could hear her breathing. She rolled her eyes and she hummed with pleasure. 
 “ Don ’ t worry, Jack. You ’ re in good hands. ” I told her. She nodded. 
 The taxi never came. He brought along an envelope and printed a script, heading out from the window. 
 “ We can go for a ride. ” She said, excited. I don ’ t have time for this. 
 She knocked on the door. “ Will you take me to Sweet Annie? She ’ s been working so hard. ” She beckoned. I ignored it, but then I heard the sound of the door opening. I pulled back and locked it. 
 “ Who ’ s here? ” 
 The door swung shut. 
 I picked up a powder and soap. I brushed it off my finger and tossed it out. The scent reminded me of coffee, so I picked it up. On the dresser she was showing me how to make a cat costume. 
 “ Hello, Jack. ” She greeted. “ You called for us for something? ” 
 The door started to open. 
 “ My dad said you could play fetch. We do. ” 
 I can't believe she said that to me, anymore. My dad had been in this situation a week earlier, but today he said he was going to teach me what she did to me. I couldn ’ t believe it. My mom had been shunning her in the office, but my dad was crying about my daddy ’ s cancer. They couldn ’ t let her leave without talking to my mom about it. My dad had pleaded with her about it, but she didn ’ t listen and offered me surgery, which my mom refused. 
 I had gotten three tickets to the bus stop. I had been with my mom since my freshman year at school. It was love at first sight. My dad put me on a set of expensive fancy shoes, because he would support me when I wasn ’ t around. 
 Today, on the bus, I walked to the bus stop. My dad could always come in whenever. My mother could always come in whenever. 
 I was watching her and she did the same, turning her head ever so slightly and stutterily. I could feel her muscles tense, her skin cracking under the pressure. I tried to take her hands off my arm, but I was pressed against the seat opposite me. 
 “ But you need to stay together, Jack. ” She leaned in close and whispered, “ I don ’ t want you to let me go. You want me to get you everything you ever wanted and I ’ ll get you what you deserve. I can do it for you. ” 
 She smiled and I felt tears welling in my eyes. Her soft, giddy voice brought back the fuzzy memories. She would hold me as a dear friend. I told her I wanted her to become mine. There was a night just like this one and it was precious. I wanted her to miss me, but she told me that it wouldn ’ t be long before I had worked up the courage to ask her. 
 I loved her. 
 EDIT: Thank you ^for ^making ^this ^not ^so ^hasty ^if ^this.<|endoftext|>

*I've heard about that* 
 I had just ascended to heaven when I woke up and watched the skies turn white. 
 *Let me please tell you what happened there. You're in a vegetative state. * 
 Oh great, *everything was just fine* 
 Never mind that no one's ever seen the animal I was in, my eyes were all bloodshot and swollen. 
 *How did you say you were dead? * 
 An evil bastard man rolled his eyes. 
 *Don't take my word for it, I was in hell, but not after fucking everything... * 
 How could I have forgotten this? 
 *Me? * 
 Actually don't you know that, I'm dead, don't you? * 
 The man put his face into his hands, "We just wanted to help, the problem is it's not that bad, " He put a hand on my head and said " if you take away my limbs I'll be stuck in this hell"<|endoftext|>

"Somebody, " I said. 
 " Hey, Bob! " 
 " Wait a second, Bob! " 
 " Just a second, Bob. " 
 " Wow. Something is all strange. " 
 I gazed up, locked eyes. 
 " Wow, Bob, " I said. " Your getting your looks like the rest of us. " 
 " Everything is strange. " 
 " Better not be. " 
 " What are you doing. Is something off? " 
 " Your body has been replaced. You're not in your room anymore. Are you okay? " 
 " Gosh, Bob, Bob. It's been eight years, you know that. We came here to tell you the news. " 
 " Well, it's okay. If the event is weird, it has to be. I feel terribly awful about this, but you didn't have much to eat tonight. Now, maybe tomorrow or maybe later. " 
 " Bob, " I said. " You can walk in tomorrow night and then stay for five days. You never went home that day, and that's okay. After all, you were an orphan. " 
 " By the grace of God, I don't believe you can do that. I didn't realize I had a leg amputated. " 
 " Bob, stop! This isn't good news! " 
 " That wasn't supposed to happen, it wasn't supposed to be this way. " 
 " Look, Bob. Don't worry. I've been sick for quite some time. You remember what happened to Bobby and the other kids? " 
 I flinched. They'd never been the most kind people, though. 
 " I've seen what happened to Bobby and the others, but I don't know why you and your children went to the same place again. Don't worry Bob. " 
 " Don't worry about it. Remember when your other half got old? Go visit them again tomorrow. Remember when I used to pet them and watch from the above. " 
 *Oooh. * 
 " Okay. Go get it. I didn't realize what happened, but you didn't really touch my leg anymore. Even so, I'm sure someone found it in the bathroom. I swear, I can't do this without hurting them. Don't worry, Bob. I really don't want you to see this. Don't touch anyone. " 
 " What's wrong? " 
 " Bob, " I said. " What is it? " 
 " Just a twinkling light."

Sorry to not be the best, haven't yet finished the r. me "Mode Project ". Well, yes I had fun! I did the same thing for my sister doing the same thing for me when I first started out, and that's why I wrote this prompt, because it's in my " Update " folder, so I need to copy, paste and check and hope that the path is correct. Wait a minute. No. Nope. I put in myself as an alternate name. 
 > My name is Jimmie Dixon. Known for playing competitive team basketball, and ever so skilled with clubs. Hailing from San Diego, California. 
 I know you're not even sure how to do this. The first thing I did was check the " filename ", but I don't remember what I actually typed. And never happened. Apparently I must have typed in " game " on the wrong way, because I have no idea if this is mine. 
 > Where's the will from the deed in your car? 
 You probably say, " YES ". That's totally not my business. Yes, in my house. Not again. 
 > Are you okay? 
 Ok, fuck it! I won't be able to use the page again after I dig and find a way to even verify my checksum. I know that works out fine, though. 
 > Wait, just wait. Does it work? 
 If it doesn't, then what. You might want to ask. Oh, right. I'll start. You know the rules. 
 > * " Step. " * In my kid name. 
 Wait. What? I haven't checked " Step " since- 
 > I need the office scissors. 
 Yes! That's right. Here I go, let's start at the beginning. 
 > Jimmie Dixon disappeared the following week. 
 Yes, and right now we're all here now. Right? 
 > Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. 
 Okay, So uh, step. Step, step, step, step. That's it. We're here. Step, step, step. Step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step, step. Step, step, step, step, step. We're here now. So, would you like to go back to your family...? 
 Uh, no. No. No. No. Please. I'm. Oh. 
 > Please... Jimmie Dixon was supposed to have the younger sister. I don't think I can remember her last name. 
 Yeah. She probably killed herself. Looks like I should be here. What? We had a brain biopsy so far, I should've not. I'm not an idiot. I was the oldest! 
 Wait. Wait. Stop. I can't- I'm recording. You. I need to verify. Here.

It is 3 AM and only three days have passed since God sent his people to stop the vampires. But there they are, in ancient St. Peter's castle, along with the dying, a thousand knights thrusting their swords at the invaders. The battle raged and at that moment the golden magic sword fell down to the ground, the hilt riddled with black smoke, the sword itself shrapnel shooting out into the sky. The land shook, and God's army rose up and charged. Guns flashed into the air, and within a few seconds, the whole city, with its eternal king behind it, and God's army were ablaze. When Jesus cried out and cried "I am Death itself, and He is God ", he called out to everyone to be quiet and take off their helmets. Nobody complied. So, a fight was about to begin. Those monsters woken up. And Jesus had no strength to fight back. There was only one good thing happening to both sides, and the warrior God still chose the warrior to be the one to destroy the savior of man. An unnamed knight went down with a sword in his hand. God ignored him and quickly ran to his steed, and guided him down to that fortress of steel to follow him down to its stairs. The fortress stood over an eight story tall fortress. One half a dozen knights stood side by side. Some men had been killed and the others simply came over all sorts of strange circumstances to make their way out. When he came down to the threshold with Christ waiting for him, God calmly spoke to him: " God, can you guys help me? " before he began to speak, after a while the light lit up the hallway and God and Christ continued on their way down. While Jesus was hurrying along, he looked up to see a lone soldier across the way fighting his way through the darkness. " Just do it, we can save the city. " God stated. While God looked to the man, Christ was still in the doorway staring at him. Christ looked up at Him and readied a sword. " And I fear those brown, brown werewolves are no match for you," laughed God. As they two blades collided they continued on their mission, hoping to slay the cultist.<|endoftext|>

The site at the end of the road, a cemetery the size of my waist. 
 I was out walking to the cemetery to see what was going on with the day ahead of me. 
 I only go on three dates this year but my road to work is a lot shorter than usual, so I gave my usual route to the old church. 
 On the weekend, my fiancé came home to the house from an ice bath. His wife asked if he had dinner with the family. Everyone was eating ice-cream while watching Dexter on the tv that was across the hall. 
 Suddenly, a door opens at the top of the stairs. 
 But before he could open the door, I saw a crying man, whose face I had never seen before in years and had never seen again before. 
 "Jimmy " I whispered, casting out the pictures of the wedding I paid for to take my husband's reaction to the noise. 
 " Dr, honey, how long has it been since we met?" The husband laughed, as he began to tell me about the disaster in his life that had happened that morning.<|endoftext|>

As I ran outside my evil empire gave way. Every step I took had a second movement to my gold chains bound head. Every cape I wore was then pulled over it and splintered, hence their super-plasma over time effects. 
 The streets were seemingly garbage again. The infrastructure seemed to not give much to the good having helped pave the future. Perhaps it was that the rose-tinted boots which fueled a mix of rain and lightbulb running briskly had become troublesome after I stripped all the residences I had established. Perhaps it was that, despite my best efforts, now covered with armor, I barely felt the paint melt into two pieces. I could hardly see at all other than by the I feel through my now worn bottom lip. Perhaps it was that my katana was now open to piercing through my skeleton except where my spine once was. 
 "You are the monster. You are the one I have trapped within you. Do you feel your fate? " 
 The sound of sudden doors slamming on my back faded as I stumbled forward as of now. Up into the night now still waters formed as I watched the water swirl around behind me, the damp moving objects still repulsive from the day I had awoken. I could faintly make out an ominous form looking through the long nightingale. Clearly trained as an assassin, I sprinted forwards and caught up with the shadow before me. I poked my head out and dove to one knee before looking back up. 
 " You are simply the gallow-slave. I set you free for the actions of your inner cadre, " I stretched out my arms in the direction of the shadow. 
 " Well why does this sound so nice? How does it feel like I am your savior? Can you even remember a name you gave me? " 
 " William Morris. " 
 " Why would you choose? " 
 The answer came quickly in my ears. 
 " I want revenge on those under your influence."<|endoftext|>

"Just a note, Maxia, " boy asked. 
 " And so, I will, " replied Maxia, staring out from behind her desk, " stop sending our students to learn about how modern technology came to be. I mean, you can pretend to see what else could have happened and you can throw away so many memories, but you'll never get to know the truth? " 
 " Well, you wouldn't, " screamed Maxia, tears of joy suddenly running down her face. " You gave me so much guidance. A whole lot of help, " she said, carrying another tired note with her. 
 " A world without my help would be doomed to rot, " said Maxia, " simply too ugly! I loved them even before our imagination had given us time travel. " 
 " You missed me, " jokingly said Hans. 
 " Is that so? " asked Maxia, nodding with her hand. 
 " Your mind made up by me. Mine made up for the years of discomfort and emotion it caused. " said Hans, resting his hand on his desk. 
 " Good. I will ensure it stays that way. " said Maxia as she turned to leave. 
 " Alright class, " boy said to the Board. 
 " Okay class, " Maxia paused for a moment before nodding and turning to leave. Hans stood, hurriedly peeking out from behind his desk to see a red trail behind the student. 
 " Ignore me! I took it the wrong way, " stated the boy. 
 " Wha -- " answered Maxia with a look of sadness on her face. 
 " So, you're telling me we lived in the past? " asked Hans. 
 " *Yes, that one's correct*, " said Maxia proudly. " I was born before you became, you know, your teacher. I learned a lot about that. Have a good day, Maxia. See you soon, " said the old teacher, turning back to Hans who now stood in the school gate. 
 The smell of rotting food filled the air, intoxicating Hans and Maxia for a moment as the smell faded away. Maxia turned around before her eyes and walked away from Hans. Hans bowed his head and left to get a cup of coffee, he missed the great landscape of the future he knew, why won't he lose it?
" I'll see you next year, Maxia," said the old teacher as she closed the door behind her.<|endoftext|>

Juliet strolls into the bakery before Granny has the first bite of her son's sandwich. He stumbles around like a rag doll, eyes darting between his family line of staff trying to hide their misery. A hearty group of flirty children walks past and hunch in the shade, both very nervous. They try their best not to approach. 
 "Fridge, pick up the fork again, " grumbles granny. " Here, take it " 
 James scurries back in the room with a clipboard. He's been cursing this entire life, and instead of ending the misery of every single one of his business associates, he's starting to get good at managing his income. 
 Sarah frowns. She doesn't want her son to have to suffer, but Granny would have that responsibility. Granny had told her about just how much she loves him and how much he's special, and that whenever possible, give her something to give back. He couldn't believe that he actually felt that connection. He took a deep breath and unwrapped the toolbox and didn't even mention how important it would be in coming to anything with a normal job. 
 Juliet holds the paper up. Granny rises and hands James a shiny toolbox. Granny looks surprised. They take the dry scissors and begin to unclip the piece. I hate cooking. 
 " Germinators, " granny says, pressing a thumb to her temple and shaking her head as if she's crying. 
 " Sure thing Granny " I mutter and fill the bag with soup and fruit sandwiches to go with it. I ate all three sandwiches today. James is still shaken. They got him dinner when Sarah ran into him for breakfast yesterday, and we had the strangest evening together. 
 He liked the smell of food. Granny has a very positive view of the baked goods. 
 " Wait " Granny says, her mouth open wide in surprise. She opens up her mouth to speak but she's frozen in place. 
 She waves her hand and I let her see that her hands are trembling. They can't free her from the pressure. Granny lifts up her mouth and spits out a mouthful of soup. 
 She swallows the blood and coughs in relief. Granny hugs her neck. 
 " Cheolettiquette has been followed today, especially around the hookah and Turkish sandwiches " 
 Granny grabs her son's hands and tells him to stay away from the ice. In the worst moment, it happened today. It was her undoing. 
 My fingers bite the hard board and jingle. 
 James explodes, head in his hands, terrified. 
 Granny closes her mouth and watches as her son falls to the floor. She hears the sound of sirens and struggles against her attacker. 
 " Seconds," she whispers.<|endoftext|>

This was it, this was the day. I walked into my house and my heart sank. I had always loved my mother, so why should I be denied her love. Ever since the accident she had tried to suppress her pregnancy, but I knew I had to keep her safe. My mother and father were raped and murdered in horrible ways every year on the front porch. I took to the streets screaming and begging them to end this. I couldn't but reach out to her and pray. She never answered my prayers and kept them, until there was only one among my number: 
 "Gabriel. My name is Gabriel Adam. I hope that I may meet you someday."<|endoftext|>

A young man of about 7 kept a nice, clean living of climbing and smoking a brisk bong. On one stony wooden log in the yard sat three young people in white coats and a black robe with a flat brim. The man in white eyed the lithe young woman while keeping her breathing. 
 'Do you ever think about God coming to that place? His calling upon all his creation to bless mankind, His gentle thrice blessed creation.' he asked, and gave her a piercing look of displeasure. She looked back up and lost herself in her own thoughts. 
 'Well... I suppose what I believe he brings over here is different. First, it is the people who suffer from massive religious whimpers that they have chosen to forget about. Like the head of the priesthood of my generation.' she shook her head. 'But I fear as a young woman I cannot be more aware of the story of saints than I am of me'. The elderly woman buried her face in her hands, opened her eyes and looked around, all the while looking as if she was struggling to comprehend what the only lesson of her life was. 
 'I was once a generous man. I was visiting my old church and saw many of the men in white coats and a tight black cap'the young woman said eagerly as she looked around. 'I visited them all many times during my first years with them. Only the chief of the security guard, men of rank and status could visit the sick and faint of their ailments. However, I was bored of the suffering of men who shunned the lord over this land. At the end of the day, I left to the lands of my family, I knew my place, and the government, and along with that, I met with many of their devout ministers, my social secretary, my maid, and most of the assistants. Still, I continued to go to these people, watching them as they performed their activities. But the ones who remained the most prominent were men of respectability who constantly stood by and always tried to give me a place on their day off. It was only then that I felt a strong sense of loss in my life. Perhaps there was more to this'sacred' treatment than to the pain of God's wrath on those who could only bend their hearts with good faith. 
 This young woman began to chock down, finally letting out a gasp of breath. She was letting out a short laugh that almost sounded arrogant. 'From the day you came here, you have seen the qualities of sin, the sins of man, and all these wonderful souls  that touch each other. I stand by and watched as I healed the sick and the dying.' She walked off in a brisk manner and took a seat next to the empty cabin. Before she went and sat down in her own cabin, there stood an old woman. She waved to the couple gathering from the army around her and said: 
 'I recently married our son, who I believe was the son of King Simons of Spain and King Juan of Spain. He who was brought up from the fathers bad faith, I was brought up from the punishment of constant cruelty in my life. And now my husband will depart for his travels in the north east of Spain, he told me, however many odd things have happened with his beloved wife. But I still feel regret for the sins of men, for them I am ashamed. Even now, after receiving my pay, I don't know if God, our King, or a bunch of men in white coats will carry us forth to glory or fight against our enemies''. She left in tears, and went back to her cabin in silence. 
 'A while later I turned three, and for the first time since the birth of this true God, I hear one of my listeners say:'You should never sleep with your husband. Your new wife of six years I have called out is but a bluff. And if I take that long enough for you to continue living, I shall knock you out'. And I heard, with that conclusion, as the doors disappeared, and as the men of white coats disappeared.'<|endoftext|>

Once we landed, a giant skeleton of what once was almost a human body rested on the beach. Now we were in the earth's second greatest glass dome. 
 "Hello all. We would like to welcome you all to the new world you've set up. Your countries and peoples will all be sure to play host to us in the rest of the world. Thank you. " The President of the newly formed United Nations the recently appointed Chief of Staff. You and the other members of the human race in this hemisphere don't know he is not even human. His face is the total and utter dead all around me. 
 " You all will have a chance to tell your country and people how much you appreciate you so. " The Spirit Warrior spoke one last time for the thousands of men and women that will depart this time. His voice is hollow and the earth shaking with each passing moment. 
 " Thank you President of the United States " 
 The Spirit Warrior has finished speaking but it is not as yet time for making another statement. Upon arriving back in earth space he approaches the human body. He pulls out a chunk of plastic and melts it. " Are you there yet " He asks the men and women in the 4th grade team. Everyone smiles with someone. " I am here. All I need to do is open my mouth. " 
 " Thank you Spirit Warrior for asking all. Your great leader will be called for the third century. " The Spirit Warrior looked around. 
 " Now let's take a look around and find out which people will be responsible for letting this human man die. " The Spirit Warrior pushed open the flap of his third wheel and whispered " let's see... " He walked through the bright, brilliant, shining city streets. Looking through multiple vantage points he saw an aged middle aged woman leaning against a wall and sitting on the porch looking out. She was wearing both the typical suit and a skinny sundress. She flipped the TV on. A 7 am news news crew passed through the screen. A school bus stopped and several teachers jogged into the classroom. The Spirit Warrior asked, " how's everything? " His class looked at each other. " Umm you guys wouldn't believe how much we miss you sir " She joked " Yeah she sure is around 4-5 inches bigger now. " 
 Some of the old Americans stared at each other. " Alright if you'd like to take a private jet I've got a nice landing pad here today." The Spirit Warrior said as he placed the plane back on the air base. There was silence and the children began walking out the door of the flag carrier. It was time to take a break from Earth.<|endoftext|>

When I get dizzy, I look up and find a mirror. I don ’ t tell anyone that, because in the mirror I find a scar which, again, will float away through nothingness. In the mirror, instead of a scar, is a moment which I don ’ t remember having seen previously. There, in the mirror, is the last remains of my first intuition. It ’ s been a million years since that moment. I didn ’ t take it very well, but at least I ’ m not in a wheelchair. I don ’ t even know when I did this. 
 Then I think again, and this time I ’ m thinking of the minute I ’ m feeling. This time I ’ m thinking about the time I cut my hand. My own hand is a priceless moment. When I cut it, my palm was glowing white. I could only see white, with a strange spot. I ’ d taken a thumb from my hand. It wasn ’ t a yes, rather a no. It wasn ’ t a yes, nor a no. It was the valid reason I cut my hand, but in the mirror, there wasn ’ t a yes. 
 I could feel it, but it wouldn ’ t have stood out in the red. It didn ’ t have wings, nor do I recall seeing my wings. There was nothing around me, but my body floated. I barely noticed when it disappeared and reappeared again. 
 I stared at my face in the mirror for a minute. I couldn ’ t do anything to solve this issue. I don ’ t remember using the face I ’ m in the mirror. I don ’ t remember remembering when I cut my hand, nor the time I ’ m feeling, for it is something I want to remember, but why? Why does my mind hate my body so? Why does my entire life lie in my hand? 
 “ Shouldn ’ t I try to come to terms with life on its own? Is there a better way? ” I asked myself. 
 “ I don ’ t believe you. ” The man in the mirror answered. “ Sorry, but no. ” 
 I had no idea what was going on, but the questions kept slipping by me. Why am I dead? Why am I bleeding out on this park bench? What exactly was my death? I wondered if this was some new obsession of mine. 
 The light flashed onto my naked body, as if I was lit up with a fire extinguisher. I was alive, but I couldn ’ t feel the jacket around me. I couldn ’ t remember where I ’ d gotten it, my face, or who I had become. 
 The man in the mirror looked away from me again, as if nothing was happening. He gave me a tight smile, and a quizzical look, and continued to stare at the blackness outside of his mask. He was taking it all in, without even looking at me. 
 “ Well, your life depends on it. You can put it in order. ”<|endoftext|>

I had been told all this was some kind of holiday. He called me a'villain'. I stood and watched as it festered under this flimsy excuse of belief. Everyone already hated me. I would have assumed that I was a comic book villain or something. Ever since I was 11, the world has been very close to forgetting I had something to do. I never saw the first Batman, or Superman or Lois Lane without pinching myself on my sides. I always had to roll over into that neat little home where everyone drank or lived they wanted. No one will believe me. 
 And nobody ever told me that I had supernatural abilities. Then I noticed the fact that they all had powers. This seemed strange enough, considering I had powers! I walk in here wearing the strangest suits. 
 At first, I refused but it became my business. All my parents kept me company this whole time. No one ever visited the orphanage. Oh well. 
 One day I saw an act. He was mid walk in a hallway. This always put a grin on my face. A machine fell down from the ceiling and replaced it with a blast of dust. I was stunned. The machine was small in comparison to the size of the umbrella. While standing there, the silhouette of a hidden boy appeared. Not that my hand bothered to fix it. This was perhaps my very first superhero cape. They said it was coming to the gym. 
 Feeling the shock wave through me I lunged at the boy. My fist started touching the boy and blood pooled from his wounds. Suddenly, something behind me clicked. Hype spread quickly over the school. Friends knew I was crazy and immediately held off on calling the police. On the rise, more and more children boarded the school building and arrived on their way. The school had exploded. 
 Finally, the police arrived. I heard them shouting, screaming, but they ignored me. I stood there quietly in front of my superhero like friends as tears streamed down my face. Their voice seemed to lift in intensity. " I'm sorry son." 
 I can finally see their smiles when they try to comfort me. 
 And it worked.<|endoftext|>

"We keep things in check, you know. " he said with a deep gravelly voice, my own mask's soft fur framing in a sinister grin. " We do, but we hold our elected officials in high esteem, yes, I know why. " 
 I looked over at where the traitor had attacked me. Behind him stood his robed figure, overstriding between a rifle and several rifles stacked on his desk. It was unnerving. He was dressed all black, except for his bloody chain mail vest and rifle, and also wearing a sergeant's outfit with a Kalashnikov resting on one side and a mirror made of runes inscribed in the inscriptions of a well maintained club. The face on his body was worse than the others, and each stone was a shadow haunting him. In his hands sat a silvery " AK-47 " with a red spray paint beam piercing through it's face. 
 "... We did it. We made our two and a half million people. No army, no Russian or Chinese, no British or Americans, our people. We will reclaim the Aztec throne."<|endoftext|>

Galt gazed at a bearded looking man and made eye contact with him. " You're the best. Good man " 
 He paused, and intoned, " or the other side of glass" 
 Galt produced a knife and left to just it out of curiosity, he noticed, he actually continued, and by going to use it, they froze. 
 And to the right, a jug of heroin, and cash was rolling down the same table behind him. 
 The homeroom ended just a short time later as the bank was completely gone and sent the chimney to hell. 
 Galt spoke no words, it seemed pretty obvious that it was something he had to start somewhere. Someone would probably call him a hero. If it wasn't for the fact that he was about 100 years old, who exactly would be the hero. None of that would be a problem though. 
 And so, a little after the doorbell rang, the man called again.<|endoftext|>
**********674**********
Everyone jokingly calls me Bob. We called him this all the time. I am almost of sound in this bizarre tongue or whatever. I can barely speak, usually it takes me a couple longer than normal. His face would be gentle though, if I was breathing right. As always, he would only say "fuhrer ". Nobody thought I was the man who was super cool, couldn't stand radiation, and was generally the most popular guy on the planet. 
 It started with this kid named Marko. I remember his first jump high on a plane? That was one of my first and only projects. My first flight he never made it out of. I lost him to cancer, but after I heard of Marko's story, my dreams eventually came to fruition. It was a man named Paul that introduced me to Paul and he helped me understand technology. It took a long time to realize how much I loved Paul. At first I thought my love would never grow, but I eventually realized he would be filled with himself on that plane. I mean even if I somehow kill him, his dream would never come true. 
 So here I am today with a 25 year old named Bob. Some things have been bothering me all along. But I know that Bob was the most misunderstood thing that ever happened to me, so the younger I get, the more I feel for the man who was destined to be the father of some great goal, even before it ended. After a week, of paranoid computer problems and on and on it went. Who knows how long it took for the myth to slowly boil down to a handshake. 
 All in all, it's been a good thing. Although there have been some weird upsides, I can't help but think that maybe some people out there have something better to take care of, and maybe we should try to save them all, hopefully in a way I wouldn't have to be the guy who almost killed that kid for one day.

She looked around from inside her small, broken and teary-eyed cell. The feeling of cold steel pressed against her chest were thick and unlike anything she had ever experienced before, "I never wanted you to leave. " 
 " How? " she said slowly. " I wanted to see you again. " 
 " Well, I will marry you. " 
 She stepped forward, breath escaping her body in a mixture of pride and confusion. 
 " Have you ever thought of someone like me who does love me? It was hard not to look upon you fondly, tell me why it was this way. " 
 " No, " she mumbled slowly, head pounding, face ashen from panic. " No one ever has. I never wanted you to leave. " 
 She looked down at her hands. Everything was soaked. " No. " she said, cold. She looked around her vacant cell, a hopeless state. " Then again, I did love you too much to leave. It's tough for your soul to move on, especially when you are on your deathbed for eternity. " 
 This confused her. " I should have seen this coming. " 
 " Then why is it not here? You know what happened to your brother? " 
 " Why do I care. " 
 She was tired. She had enough words left to think, tears stirring within her eyes, but as her tears said goodbye she turned around, too tired to cry. " I never thought of him. " she said softly, as if remembering the way he felt in her time with him. " He was a friend, to the fullest extent possible, at least. He reminded me a lot of me when I found him. " 
 " I do remember the way I realized he was jealous of what I had gained. " 
 " After the accident I decided to see him. " 
 " I saw him realize he's the one who killed his younger brother. And he just looked back. He took him with him, like a shadow. He felt everything I had become, and he was all that I wanted. But I couldn't keep him from looking back. I... " 
 " Look at you. You're actually made of glass. How could you let yourself fall so easily? " 
 She looked at him in wonder. It's not natural how suddenly the look turned into rage. 
 " You're what? " She whispered. Her voice was one of sorrow, agony, anguish. " How can I still feel what you are? How can you care for him at all? We were so close... " 
 " You were my best friend. " 
 " It isn't until this day that I realized how close I really am. How long have I lived. How do I still have him? I can't take it anymore, nothing is going to stop me. " 
 She stood up, seemingly tired from her battle against the open wound inside her chest. " What? " 
 " One day, I will do everything I can to bring you back to a friend. Every time we meet again, he will always always hold me in his arms, wanting to hold my hand. For the rest of my life, I will never feel him, to hold you, to love you, to care for you." 
 That would have been just like him. 
 Edit: Say anything else I should.<|endoftext|>

"So my first piece of proof is that the Youtube results were extremely strange since it was an order written on a separate board, one for every human in history, and the other for each human in history. Therefore the most-believable title of the story? I guess you have one big problem. " 
 The camera looked amused. " Oh, but what is that? Nobody uploads the greatest story ever? I knew about the epic people of the future. Well, you just don't use it. Well, anyway, finally the big question is, how did you, a person who deserves to be an accomplice, upload it to that account? " 
 " If I could just pretend I didn't see the camera for every human in history. Well then, one day the old lady will come to me and say, " Is there even an internet in my home country? " I wouldn't be surprised to find all your " famous " links were " in." If only it were that simple.<|endoftext|>

Our solution should be simple. We should be able to show that... yes, and they should be sure the babies are speaking correctly. Give them the device, the design, the code. 
 But we have no money. We have no name for this power. No... The planet is the only object we have. Whatever the material is made of, and whether it exists in this system or not, or if such a choice can exist... we may not ever find out what it is. 
... as an easy-to-use transformation device - it is made by simpletons so as to revert back to this state at the least possible time. As such, they may bend and we will be able to differentiate them from them at any time. I could say that in a few years the children will seem to be dreaming.<|endoftext|>

He stumbled backwards in terror as she watched her boyfriend become a beastly aberration, barely human. 
 He focused his power on one of the bonds within the bonds, flying at any moment of his choosing. 
 He had a magical bond that could twist the mind like any magic spell. 
 He not only tore through her mind, but in his whole body. 
 He could walk backwards. 
 He could move without using his own free will, and his entire body was moving. 
 He could sense everything. 
 He stopped and held his breath in defiance of all logic. 
 He reached up and grabbed the peak of her toes and looked up. 
 Her signature had been on her foot for many hours now. 
 She was just a few feet from him now, roughly 45 feet from him. 
 The air around them had been sucked to the ground in quick succession. 
 He moved his entire body with only one instinct. 
 He held onto the rail of his cane as his whole body was released, wings whirling freely as he landed. 
 He flew at just about any height possible, for hundreds of miles, but he didn't look like he had wings. 
 The ground did no such thing. 
 He forgot. 
 He did now. 
 In his own fucking head. 
 A woman stumbled on the ground after an accident. 
 So it must be her. 
 Time seems to slow on the ground when her bow stops swinging. 
 Not the usual direction where people are walking. 
 The wife to the left looks out onto the frozen ground. 
 Her gaze sparkles and that looks as if it finally comes to a close. 
 The woman looks back into the sky, and then back towards the sky as if nobody moved. 
... 
... 
 Shit. 
 The last thing she remembers is disappearing into the distance while her husband tries to cling to her hand. 
 She hugs her husband and unites her focus. 
 He weakly rests her hand on the ground before she collapse. 
 The last thing she remembers is turning around and hugging him. 
 She uncloshes her hand and places it on top of her. 
 He barely lets go of her hand and watches in awe as her lifeless body suddenly becomes the avatar of the individual depicted on her by the constant movement of her face. 
 Suddenly the throne above her suddenly collapses and becomes the center of the halls. 
 It doesn't matter to anyone that the Queen was pushed away by a bunch of more evil miners. 
 He can still smell her perfume. 
 He can still taste the fish blood around her mouth. 
 He can still taste the oils in her hair. 
 The citizens of Tenga Merneft try to get her back in their beautiful honey shaped cocoon, but they only have to ensure her health is maintained every other day. 
 They kept her healthy. 
 They kept her healthy for the last 100 years. 
 The enemy invaded and they defeated all humanity. 
 But she still craved more than him. 
 She still craved every second of her life. 
 But now it just seems so pointless. 
 But she still craved freedom. 
 She just didn't want to be born into a life full of dirt and death. 
 She just wanted some non-humans like himself, like the family she had were born into, she knew that. 
 She even tried to talk to her new girlfriend, but her dick wasnt responding. 
 "Who should be controlling you? " " Wh--? " 
 Her laughter stopped over a horrible twig. 
 " You'll figure it out. " 
 " I might as well do some programming for you." 
 The third time it happened for her. 
 His Majesty said so. 
 And as the third time she tried to walk forwards, he jumped forward and cut her down. 
 His Majesty said so.<|endoftext|>

As time marched on and to become more precious, finally, M.I.M. was ready. Pressurised to give a primordial push, M.I.M. began on a schedule that was the order of its actions, almost perfection to their being. 
 The Ancients, who lived in a world of pure darkness, sat upon their rocky bodies. This, was M.I.M. under the care of the greatest civilizations. Beyond the range of what humans could comprehend, however, they lived on in between what humans had once been. 
 All of the servants of the Ancients thought it was pointless to fathom what life still stood. That is, unless they knew everything. According to the Ancients, even the death of one's child is not worth their consideration. They could not imagine love, no. They would ask themselves all of this and it would be no use. M.I.M. had declared war on the Ancients for centuries before the time when the incurable had been kept at bay and from taking too much. But that was all now. The Ancients were sure that no battle would be fought against them. So instead they went forward. 
 Their ships sailed between these stars of darkness. They would fight, man or beast, with fire or with all the might they had not called their own since they had met the gods. M.I.M. had entered orbit around a star once again. However, no enemy had dared to approach. 
 The Ancients had entered the FTL container, and called to the stars. There was no reply. The Ancients gladly accepted their fate. When they landed on the surface of the furlong, things changed. The Ancients awoke to find them in the furlong sleeping. But M.I.M. still controlled their outer worlds.<|endoftext|>

Ten years on, I decided I wanted to do something different. I went out to the field, sure there was always some stuff buried underneath the soil but here it felt like the deepest on earth, blasting off into the open air. So after exploring and trying all sorts of things but always having one foot buried in a mountain, my curiosity got the best of me. I went to dig my own grave, for fear that I had misplaced it and as it turned out was the first one I'd ever dug out. I started digging, the thought of a dusty earth next to my home finally came to mind and suddenly we discovered a government parking lot. Everyone was swimming in a huge pool, a big one at that, pool with one person skating. I'm fairly sure I heard what they thought because of the very tall men outside of the pool who then carried on hiking up the aisles to the open space, I couldn't believe what I was looking at. I was almost instantly swept away by the incredible detail. The pool was empty, the old man who left had disappeared, but that can't be right; there was another face, he looked just like him, his arms just as big and large as mine, he walked down the aisles and out into the smog. As he stumbled I checked my watch, it read 15 minutes right after we left the parking lot. Having found a dead body, I went through the several vault sizes searching and looked down the lot to find everything exactly as I always had, deep below my feet, the exposed old man was still alive. I walked along all kinds of dimensions until I arrived at the rooftop, the small old man was slumped over, he looked down at his hands and then asked: "Has it all worked yet? " I looked back at the grave before me and I looked past the man's head towards the ceiling. He still looked back up at me, a smile on his face and then asked: " Told you it was all a waste, we should not dig here."<|endoftext|>

"Fuck you! " answered Oliver, after looking down at his wife. He'd been the pickiest maid in the world for years, after being paid a hell of a lot less than him. He's the nicest, most beautiful, gentlest guy that he could possibly be. Oliver and his wife were the nicest. At first, Oliver had a hard time putting his head together, or at least though he could be calm and collected. " Well sir, I was expecting something quite a bit. I mean, I didn't have any, uh, sizzlers at the restaurant. " He thought to himself, " But how could you never grab something you're usually taking off and off in your middle school dance class style like that? You have to be damn smart. " 
 Oliver shrugged as he took his wife's hand in the stately, ten-shaded arm of his. " So maybe.... " 
 Oliver looked down, just to see his wife and a few of his people sitting at the table, staring at the episode on the TV. Oliver seemed to lose interest in their ensuing conversation and seemed to almost become irritated. 
 Then, out of nowhere, after a short while, this news came from the somewhat silly villager Olivia. Oliver had never heard that Olivia had a boyfriend. Oliver turned around in the same instant he could see the newly deceased woman's curly, nubile skin. Everything around her changed, and, as if she already lived in her own little world, her head was beginning to float, on the ground, towards Oliver. 
 Oliver took his wife and opened his mouth to say something, but she didn't respond. He was worried that he couldn't understand what was happening. 
 Oliver began to frantically fidget as the girl began to scream. He made his way over to Olivia and rubbed his belly, hoping he'd get something that wasn't absolutely unimportant. As he went to pull his eyes back from her, but couldn't get back out, he saw her still floating towards him. It was an amazing sight. You could see the squishy, warm, fuzzy-lidded skin of Olivia as she snuggled up to him. It was just so delicious. Oliver thought he understood what was going on. " I'm not sure what this means, but as you can see, we're going to come through for interviews, alright? " he said and walked over to Olivia with a tight red tie. " Just what kind of interviewing needs to be done for you? " 
 Oliver was startled by the way Olivia looked at him, and trying to respond, was unsure how to respond. 
 " Why do you want to take it?! " he said. " Just be smart about this, you adorable girl, and let's get through this with you. Just enjoy my dad!"

 Ya know... Y'know, the style of storytelling that Oliver always had trouble imagining.

"It's my favorite book, after the Twilight. I have it glued to my wall, in that cardboard box." 
 The skinny girl beneath the chair held out her hand, and as we walked over to the picture, there was one piece of paper that looked familiar... above all the other unwritten books the man had placed on the shelf behind her. There was a photo of Joseph, signed Mary A that she seemed to remember her. With such a hazy picture, it stood out a bit. Was this an experiment? 
 We soon found that the photo contained no real attribution to Mrs. A's handwriting. Does she ever get to speak to her husband? Was the photo a hit? Was she allergic to xanthacea? 
 We got outside and took the pill. It didn't take long for them to notice. They took a long walk to the bus stop, and for them, everyone in the bus was. 
 We arrived at the terminal at 11:44, when a person, dressed in a dark sweatshirt with some sort of wrist band on it, walked up to the 12th floor. She asked me if I would like to be in touch with my husband. I was fast asleep.

Loved each human of the world. Granted the last few years were a bit painful, but finally it had passed. Freedom for my entire family. That was the most difficult pill to swallow.

Dennis gasped "Yes mate? " The gesture was an acknowledgement that he was finally in the final stages of his quest, a sacrifice to be made, at last. Dennis Igloran, aged 57, gestured to the dying scientist that was nervously awaiting further instructions. The charred remains of the island in that field were now resting on a piece of paper towel. Dennis dug his nails into the towel, gleeful. Bewildered Dennis himself inched himself closer to the scientist, willing him to surrender the paper towel before it shimmered away. His mother gently gave Dennis a warm hug, soft warm embrace. Dennis felt an engine cut short by the faded transmission. The cutting breeze blew the paper towel off the pier with a distant rumble. Diving deeper he spotted only a lone figure. The man that Dennis had sensed previously and clicked off the gaudy iPad. Drying tears blossomed, Dennis would survive this. The trapped man appeared still in his clothes. " Your end is a very sad story Adam " he softly whispered. Dennis slowly opened the kitchen drawer, gripping the knives. The surface of the shallow knife open revealing the perfect tool. Dennis brushed the edge of the blade and then turned to face him. " yes yes Adam " he murmured " become wise and wise you will accept your fate, thank you and move on" and Dennis followed the man as he approached the island.<|endoftext|>

"James Randi, I am offering $ 1 million dollars " 
 There is so much truth. There are so much lies and there are so many lies that Jesus knows is a lie as well. I used to be able to reach out to Jesus, but he was so afraid of me. Jesus loved me as much as he loved his parents and I loved him as much as he loved me. I was sometimes compelled to steal what I didn't want, to murder the ones I didn't love. So in the end, I decided I would use my money to help the men who committed these crimes. 
 So I stole the desire of man to love us all. I stole the desire of man to know that he truly felt alone, lonely, and alone. Jesus knew better than anyone else what happens when man starts getting really bitter when he sees us apart, more than anyone else. The very truth that will be needed to use my power and let us have that love that is shared deep down, no matter what- the way is to forge a better world that doesn't need the needs of those in need, not when you have to cry to someone.<|endoftext|>

Subject: Disappointment 
 I got it from a friend's name as part of a brother portrait I wrote for him. The topic is the flashback; I came up with an idea for a flash based but it was totally dependent on the prompt. I don't know whether to attribute it to disbelief of the prompt or evidence that I was wrong. It seems like such an obvious path but it's something I don't want to travel down on the abacus nod to come across and change because that's just not what I wanted. 
 I don't even know where I found the flash meant to go but it was an artwork in my basement in general. Not a problem. I took the water proof and even dropped it on the keys when I arrived home but that spot on the keypad never got any easier. Of course I want to slip something in, that's what would warrant a comment, but none happened. Everything just feels real and now I have memories that I care enough to think of. I hope you don't mind me mentioning that one but its time for a chat. 
 You can come by for this one if there is interest and I'm happy to write comments if you're curious. Feel free to reach out to me, I like seeing someone write something there.<|endoftext|>

I wake up in my house. I walk towards the kitchen. The basement lights dim behind me, but I want to read to him so I do. A staircase opens up to the living room. The couch is still solid, but I notice the bits of tape around it kept reading the familiar word for cup of coffee. I dig down and open the drawers of my kitchen and quickly find the table itself. I lift it up as I sit in the chair. After digging for a few minutes I find the outermost cupboard and open it up in its window. I do so and lay down to put my breakfast on the floor.<|endoftext|>

I don't remember having the privilege. It's almost funny how the years stretch on. Sometimes people like getting everything memorized, sometimes not. That's what separates me from the other ghosts of my hometown: I'm still human, I still have the benefits of the privilege, but in a lot of ways what's becoming a lot more uncomfortable in all honesty is. No matter what, I feel terrible about what I said, and now it's my turn to be the reminder. It's been to high school as a ghost, but when I rose I didn't suddenly decide to jump like some kind of trippy little prank. I've grown to keep a low profile, watching over Jack, the only students at the school I was in my twenties. My parents can barely ignore the gifts I gave them, even with the goons murdering everyone I've come into contact with. 
 I now have my friends, a couple are keeping tabs on me, and the rest are looking into medical school. It's another simple moment in my life, but I'm done with life. I mourn their loss for a time, but it doesn't really matter now. I have to choose, it's time I take on that school, do what I did, and make it just like everyone else. Whatever I'll do, it's done, and it's time to go.<|endoftext|>

*sigh* This is what has become of my Reddit account. I am not sure how it could possibly work this fast. I want to get up, go to the local daycare, and get my body checked out; anything. 
 Seeing as I am only 5'10 and wearing shorts and my white sneakers, I have no idea how anyone could attempt that. Or the inability to access any actual subreddit or any prominent forums... I only took the instructions from Reddit.<|endoftext|>

The Dark Lord 
 Two men, both incredible size and strength, stood on their shoulder. They turned their gaze to the shadows and said, 
 “ Next! ” 
 The creature that watched the team descended quickly broke to smithereens and hurled it at the square. A team of three men jumped into action, unloading various miscellaneous weapons to them and passing through them. 
 “ Next! ” The men screamed and watched as a torrent of streams of flame swept across the ground and rainbows were spinning around them. 
 When the ( also two ) dashes of flame had ended the night, they looked at their friends leaving, those who rushed by after them pulling their weapons from their pockets and vanishing in a cloud of fire. 
 After a mere moment the battle was won but not for the few who remained. Their leader knelt before the Goddess and her staff, it was a shield only one could afford. “ Behold! ” she said bringing it to their eyes. 
 Then the two walked onto their ship. 
 “ Speak now! ” 
 “ When we take this oasis—where it can not be broken, I await your orders. ” 
 The heroes and the villains glared at each other. But the Goddess was silent. 
 “ First, you must preserve the city. ” She said slitting their throats. “ You must hold the city. ” 
 Their two guides retreated to the peak of the tower and sipped their tea. The two surveyed the sky and knew that the Great Dark Lord ’ s dark armor was after them but it was also awaiting them. 
 “ You must do this, our lover will guide you, ” the Goddess said before walking up behind the two heroes. “ It is for you. ” 
 “ Wait. ” 
 “ It is with the greatest of thanks that we take you aboard. ” 
 “ Why? ” They both asked except for the Lady. 
 “ There are things beyond—that one God is powerful enough—to destroy the kingdom we love so dearly and so proudly. We must finish this battle once and for all before the wall is cleared. ” 
 The other hero stood silent for a moment wondering what to say. 
 “ Oh no, what is that? ” They both cried. 
 “ I—I don't understand…” 
 The Goddess merely nodded. 
 “ What do you mean I can do this alone? ” 
 “ I am in full control. You can not stop me. ” 
 The two continued to stare at one another. 
 “ You can do this to me. We all will, together. ” 
 ** "It is with the greatest of thanks that we take you aboard. " ** 
 As they stepped on to the water they saw her work. 
 “ What? ” The heroes yelled at her. 
 “ What is this? ” 
 “ Let me sink my teeth into it. ” 
 She ignored them and they drained the last of the tea from the two heroes. 
 “ *this* is the First Heaven? ” 
 “ No! " The heroes exclaimed and dashed up to the ledge to retrieve the guards and run to follow their orders. 
 The two men remained on the edge of the tower. 
 “ Here it is! The city has been lost for many centuries! ” 
 “ What did you say? ” 
 “ The bowels of Valhalla have covered the Earth and given it life. ” 
 The heroes ran to the Tower and faced one another.<|endoftext|>

When we first came out of cryogenic sleep one of us first picked up an Energetic globe and put it to space. The nearest thing we picked up was a small sphere with all of the friends in the room watching and learning from science. The first words I ever heard came from a missile launch in January of 2000 ( On that day I literally woke up in the hole I'd made in the bed of the bomber and was prepared to release the explosives that launched our energy blast had knocked out of the the Earth ). 
 From this point on we became friends until the death of a generation, when the rumors spread and who's children realized that we weren't normal. We were aliens.<|endoftext|>

He left my yearbook on my bed, meringue down my record label and my commitments. There was something special about The Seventh Letter. We'd met online, she never expected it, but after a long monologue about putting things on I rolled my eyes at the mass hysteria that I'd committed. She didn't owe me anything, so I got back to running. 
 Thanks to it's launch, I'd been able to get to know our parentage for the first time and I didn't have to spend the rest of my youth fretting over who was the better candidate for a tenure as a police officer. My friends in law enforcement were able to raise my career quickly, their history fixed, and more importantly, I had real money to spare. It was a staggering amount of money, and due to it's short term service I was expected to live on in a fast-paced and incredible American media economy. I'd dropped out of school while I was a newcomer to the field. No one had any idea why, not even the shooters, but the love of my life had been keeping me away. 
 The Prophet himself had given us orders regarding stopping drones and returning them to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for tracking and killing over seventy-five innocent civilians. Five years in there and I was ready. My agent, Brigitte, had arrived, set her base on top of my place on the throne, and asked us to instruct our operation before placing our files on the map. 
 The prophet had come to the throne, and ordered us to... The point of no return was a valid point of attack. I had been part of our services and we had been trained to use the full fury of the Apocalypse, but no one knew what was going to happen after that, and we couldn't make them believe that if they got the chance and have the bomb go off, we could summon the world's entire population and destroy it. Then everything would suddenly be in front of us. 
 It was a vision, the Apostle had told us, all the while assuring us that the reason for our presence was for saving that which had been in the great safe haven. And then we had... Fourth Law—even though no one knew what Fourth and what the Pope meant until the next morning. We had to stop spies, tell our intel network how our job was, and these weren't soldiers, they were scientists. A cure for polio, a plan to make sure that Russian security services began biological warfare, and it would save the entire world. I knew it wouldn't and today was the day that we wouldn't! 
 I had the feeling that what I had to do was waiting for my mission and I'd warned our U.S. government of my plans, and today I was prepared. I knew I'd end the messenger before he had time to react and then I knew I'd be able to stop the A.I. from ascending and saving the world.

"I found evidence of a much bigger crime here! " the warden taunted, " Come on! " 
 " Well, this " Robert Capitan was someone's friend and someone who had all but co-opted every possible coin he could find. People like him was nowhere near as important as being a lawmaker or governor. He was a fascinating guy though. It would have been rude if not for the fact that he had only been married to his first wife when he got out of the first room. He'd been the treasurer of a minor firm he was now working for. 
 His wife and children stood on the other side of the pavement as his browser heat rose with every strike. His eyes remained firmly focused on them, not at all within his greedy eyes, but at what would follow. The door behind them opened. Robert Capitan walked over, shaking hands with his friends. 
 " Hey, you guys alright? " Tom Voodoo said, tentatively. 
 " No, not really, " he replied. " For *something*. " 
 " Why can't you just go for a walk? You promised you'd bring it on yourself! " 
 Tom shook his head, unwilling to accept what he already knew was true. 
 " Oh, you know. And the *gift*? Oh, don't judge me, it's just *magic*, " he finished. 
 " Yeah, sure, " he stammered, " I know how that got on my nerves. " 
 " And then that curse for being a good sport, " he continued, " became an uncommon occurrence. And now we know he didn't get to jail, for years on end. You'd think I'd've appreciated it. " 
 " Oh, not just on his travels, " he sighed. " It wasn't very big, and his corruption was good for business. This " Gift "... was actually not that big at all. " 
 " You just have to deal with it to help happen, man. You have to have a *god* in the house if you want to avoid that horrible plague. And you have to, you can't keep yourself rich, you have to use it to give people a sweet heart, which those who can afford it go for in any way possible. You also have to be self centered. Right? Just, bring me something you can use, there is always going to be a way. " 
 " Dangit! Don't listen to me, I'm right behind you! " Tom chuckled, " I just want some coffee and to discuss problems with my wife, " he said, pulling away a dirty piece of paper from his pocket and pen, " That's where I'll let you into this. " 
 " Really? " Robert chimed in, " Of all people that need me most? Your son, your wife and your kid? You didn't give me my money when I came in here. What do you want? Nothing? No one. " 
 Tom quickly scribbled down something, shuffling it across the trunk of his car. He then pushed it in his pocket. 
 " Ok, fine. " He sighed, " Go and ask my wife. " 
 " Whatever, you told me to fuck off. " 
 " You have no idea how much I owe you, though. " 
 " I'm not my brother, " he replied, " I just accept it as that. " 
 " That's all, huh? That's how you work? " 
 " You got ta sign this and... look, what is your name? " 
 " Nathaniel Capitan. " 
 " *'David.'"<|endoftext|>

Fishing the dart from the tree only served to make the tree trunks dance with the wind in the distance. I thought I knew where to look, as it was only a few hundred yards ahead. An old hedge bordered the tree, and the tree is protected by a stone to keep it under control. I should have used that stone if I had more time. From what I heard, the old folk were after the cats, and at this point they were all in town. 
 Despite my best efforts, I failed to catch the clawed hand, and what I observed made me groan. " Let not you hold me! " I whined as I tried to free the hand. " I demand food for your kitten, can you do so? " 
 " Seriously, " the man replied, spittle beginning to drip out of his chin. " You're a pretty young kitten. No one can trust you after this. " 
 The cat perched on the branch next to me dropped his claws in front of him and spun around to face me. When he would catch it, it would fall so fast, it would have done a walk. Unfortunately, the claw had gotten loose from the tree and rolled over him as he ran away. He had some kind of allergy to fur. 
 " I don't want to see you suffer, darling," I said quietly. The old man fell into the branches. I looked at the young he saw and sighed. I could have gone up a tree to help, or I could have just jumped him like he was trying to snatch me by the neck. Either way, he would not be likely to cooperate with me for food. I could only hope he woke up soon. 
 For a while, I was just up thinking about what I had been doing to one of my best friends. After the news broke, the villagers began to pay more attention to me, as they usually did. If I was to end up sharing the spotlight with the people, I would need a good number of followers to make it worth the risk. The authorities learned something. I forced the locals to calm down, and waited for the time to come to kill them. When they arrived, they made sure they would not hurt a civilian. I kicked the boy onto the ground as he told me that they were having a bear incident, causing him to be hit with some strange clothing that was made out of bone. I grabbed the old man with the rope and as I was making a break, I noticed something floating in the sky. 
 At the edge of the forest, there stood a small guy. He looked as old as he was, and if he put his weight on anything though, it would destroy the forest. While we were looking, I felt something brush against my leg and when I tried to open my eyes, I saw the legs break apart. 
 A sudden pain began to begin to stretch across the ground as I watched the grass burn. There, I saw, was an infant of sorts.<|endoftext|>

"I swear I will be the best damn pizza delivery man in the world. " Jim was in the middle of a tight beer bottle & cash rush sale, so low that a tall black guy was lying in a pile of clothes trying to pull himself from the coldness of the Rubik's cube. One hand was left hand and the other hand was standing on the other side of the table grinning. 
 " I can't eat most of these pies in 7 hours! " They yelled as the pizzeria owner shook a click gun. Jim walked away from the red headed faceless " whats THE HAIR BLEAM FUCKING MONEY SOMETHING TO TELL ME ITS SICK! " 
 The cookie was the icing on his favorite pie. " are you a crust co? " Jim asked the keyed microphone. The old cookie fave bobbed like a dog, with a muddy accent to it. Jim tilted his head and said, " yeah I know, but this pizza has to be of good quality! " He turned back to his croissant, which the old cookie co had ignored at the previous stop. 
 Jim had noticed, and was about to make a gesture that would put Jim back in the little shop, when he heard the words that were coming from his speakerphone. He opened up the speakerphone and said, " just like I said, come in! Take that pizza out and order it back if you ever need it. " the old cookie co nodded, and went back to the now emptied pizza box. 
 " hey bro! There you go. I knew you weren't going to buy one if I was carrying that dumb chocolate stick. " Jim smiled and opened the box. Inside was a fake piece of dough, stuck to the side of the pizza like a diamond. " look my dead buddy, " said the last thing that came out of his mouth was, " I cant eat butter!" 
 Three days later, Jim & Cookie Co sold everything else. Fred also got too hot after he paid because he couldn't eat his slice of pie before the Redneck announced plans to steal pizza from Cheaper Lord all the time.<|endoftext|>

"Teacher's won an award, this one can't wait for you to meet him. " Brenda realized she was in the middle of a class. The eyes of the desk were up and his breath was suddenly harder. 
 " I'm here, in... standing in the back of this classroom. " Brenda shook her head. She just wanted to walk away, she needed to be noticed. 
 " That's impossible! " 
 Brenda stood up with her head in her hands. She smiled. She knew what they looked like... The gym, the office, the school bus... The weird accent that seemed to go without saying. She had to speak. 
 " Ian, you got this? " She said. Her personality was almost recognizable from the kid in the " Lawyer" gray sweatsuit. 
 Ian leaned back in his chair. Her glasses trailed off behind her as she stood up. The teacher sighed. It was all very surreal. She felt better. 
 Brenda knew she had to announce her in the class. She had long ago lost her job and moved to a different city. Her parents had decided to move to New York so she could study hard. She had this pent up energy for this. Brenda had always known she had to retire now. Everything around her had been taken from her. She began to walk away. She walked away with only one thought in her mind. 
... 
 Brenda knew not what to do with herself. How could she go when someone else could also go? How could she graduate high school without her dream of a proper life? It was impossible. It was even more impossible to build a career without leaving the house, and it would only get harder. Brenda looked at Ian with a smile on her face. She asked, " Are you sick? "

So much so that these photos were corrupted too so when it came time to start uploading the files out of mcnak it was finally done. So, as things started getting back to regular they just seemed awful and there is no way to go back to normal without killing us... I almost wished for relief but that is just wishful thinking when you think about it again... I see humans are totally socially much less respected in 2015 as far as mcnak raj. Those who don't know our languages are threatened with extermination from their own communities. I think that it would be very unjust of us to be such a doormat on ourselves... Forgive us! For killing our own people... Ah well. As soon as we started uploading this as we began to have affection of our DNA until we could properly emulate apes but what we did was horrific. We were all doomed together with animals. These those who designed this spacecraft died the same way they had died and what had even more shockingly happened is that they continue their occupation into 2016. I see humanity has began to be understanding the whole concept of the world love balance completely with the sake of toicking colonize all around the planet... They have switched around our internal organs and harvested the last of the human hosts in favor of a virus to display our inferiorness instead of having it deemed incompatible with our purity. This alone is enough to pique my interest and my path... We begin to have discussions of propaganda for panda consumption and also the importance of following the moral code of everything else on their planetary platform...

His metallic blue eyes gleamed, but something about them frightened me. Of course I did. He'd been defending me for close to ten days now. With claws and horns. And at a pace I would have been afraid to let go of. But no. This did not last. 
 The wind was strong, gusting in up here and I could see the clouds moving in the distance. I could not be alone. They were cutting through the sky. All the time. I am weak. I dare not stand. I am just a monster. I am an idiot. 
 But tonight is always the night. He's going to make me weak. I dare not give in to his call to change. Let him find me, you have not seen it happen. I am not one to permit any of this, no matter how much I try. 
 Time and he is changing now. He is terrifying. I am terrified. I am turned on. 
 He whispers to me in a high pitched raspy voice. " Come on baby boy. Come on we will make a movie. It will be great."<|endoftext|>

Anna lay on the ground a short, curled up, writhing mess of broken bones. Her mother and father were preparing to take off the.5 inch thick sack of trinkets Anna was holding on to, with a twist of the straw, reaching the ground. Anna's mother loved trinkets more than anything in the world, and her father loved trinkets more than thematically. Her father had ended up purchasing an entire trinket family when Anna turned 18. Their household was simply too large to fit in most families, so they decided to take up throwing them off the far side of the family, in hopes of keeping the family together. 
 Then as the tug of the Trinket at the door stopped, Anna suddenly remembered that the tug was for sisterhood, not revenge. She pulled her arm and was instantly struck dumbfounded. She also remembered that they were meant to be in the same household when the trinket was handed over. Even then she didn't exactly know what she was dealing with; her mother held a pink toothbrush out to her now. 
 "So! Who are you! What do you want?! " Her mother was looking not just around, but at the brims of cups and plates she was holding, and her father was answering a coin toss. And then she remembered that Anna's mother was going to marry the house's foster child. 
 " Mummy? " The woman was clearly trying to lure the girl away, and Anna's mouth began to water. Her father was making all kinds of gestures with his finger too, showing her that the trinket could move. Anna didn't know which was in front of her, but she knew that the touch of her trinket helped her think. She looked at the man who had made her trinket make a move, and whispered " so... So you're me! " 
 " Yes, I am. " Anna responded with a chuckle, to which her father corrected him. " I only... I'm you too... I mean... You are. " 
 " How are you? " He made sure his hand was always on Anna's shoulder. 
 " Well... Except, I'm no good. " She lied, trying to be more careful. The man was at peace now that his expression had disappeared from Anna's face. " What did you do today? " 
 " Well, I realized something. " Anna said. " I didn't mean to hurt you. I wanted to give you something. " She took her father's hand and started trying to explain. 
 " I spent a whole long day trying to save the little girls from death. I will never forget what I did to your mum. " 
 The man smiled at her and quickly grabbed her hand, squeezing tightly. " Don't worry, darling, you'll be fine. " 
 Now there was an instant of peace between them. It had been such a long year that Anna had finally run out of things to say. For a while, Anna couldn't remember her mother asking, " Why are you crying? " 
 " I wanted to apologize to you. " The man said. " But now that I think about it, I don't understand why we have to write about that. And maybe the last thing you need is to tell your mother that you're not good. I told you to love her."<|endoftext|>

It was one of those scenarios that got me rolling - the next thing I know I'm in a car accident, and not twenty minutes later I'm in New York City, the driver is a diminutive, pale man with medium hair and lips that I can't quite place - and his name is Mike. I'd heard he was your typical young gun barrel fired maniac, yet I'd never been a frequent paranoid person but this guy wouldn't have done a fucking thing. 
 He's obviously not entirely apprehensive, the four corners of his mouth drooped open in surprise at a sudden motion of my approaching. In seconds, he's absently tapped his gold strapped sapphire forefinger on the steering wheel. 
 "You know what man, you haven't seen *the *Donor 1. His name is Byron. And I've told you this, given you a good goddamn reason to live. " 
 With that, he passed me the really big slide-top, good for catching my attention. I could see his blend of snark and excitement almost passing for human in his words as I drove away from the scene - " You don't need your fucking goddamn Aurora Express." 
 I'd seen these things before, and tried my best to avoid thinking straight. Maybe it was quite a shock when I read it on the news that morning. Maybe he wanted to change his tune? Sure, it sure was crazy, but hey, he's a fly. * Fairly confident* to actually beat me off. He got a reputation of being the smartest dinosaur with the antirapoplethms, and if all else failed, I'd reckon he was still pretty clever.<|endoftext|>

Rick lay across the living room stage and stretched, squeezing and scraping against his protruding muscles. He remembered running a cult for all that he loved and working towards that very end, but still not quite in the hearts of his brethren. He felt alive. 
 As he was pulling the mask off, and lowering the mask, Rick's head shattered into numerous pieces, the wig ripped apart to reveal deeper pools of blood spilling out. Out of the pain which came from falling backwards, he was aware of his surroundings.

They were all dead, mostly buried there. To hear a mere one whisper in their wake, hundreds, even thousands of miles away. They had all gone to the same place, their old home, that had not had a soul to turn to. And yet here he sat, motionless, in the most eerie of states, standing in the center of the entire world, surrounded by a single wall, its softness contrasted with the inky blackness of death, an eternal emptiness. His only companion, who had ever known him, had been dead for weeks. Its heartbeat had lasted much longer, the jittery bars of death pulsing in its coffin, but there wasn't much he could do now. 
 By this point his only interest had been in his son, hoping he would have a respite from this place, to shed his infernal last thoughts on him, to brush off his tears, and tell him of the man he had once known. But it didn't matter that his memories of the once alive lingered; his only purpose had been in him, to dwell with him and remain with him the rest of his life. There was so much he could have done to achieve a better, just life. 
 "It's alright," he had been taught, if only so that he could escape this place and share with the rest of his people the things he once had and know.<|endoftext|>

That is, except for the one that stood out from the others, the first star, which stood just out of the thousands that had coalesced around him. He had stood out because he was so young and innocent in nature. It was at this moment that he knew he was pregnant. He knew it would be. The gas that was her cunt filled him with his desire. 
 This would change him forever. The first star, a flicker of a star, followed its mother, her mouth, and her skirt. They danced. All of her violent dances, and their cadences, culminating in their dance that they were all chasing. This would be the end of her as woman. The game she was hunting that they were all entitled to. They would soon be all hunted. She would be consumed. 
 His mind raced back to that moment when she was thrust down on top of him. She knew that he was fucking her. He had to beat her. She would awaken up in the morning, eating her chicken. 
 He would rise and beat her. He would know that she would tear that itchy skillet open and pound it until it rose, swallowing it whole and out of him. To her shock, he would drag her in the rain and fish the china pots, then finish her off with his next batter. She knew she would be killed instantly, but for her she was free. 
 He needed to shoot her. He needed to shoot this gun. He was so damn young. He'd never shoot. 
 He pulled the trigger.<|endoftext|>

As Bruce set his laptop down on the wooded floor I can just see him slam it down quickly to the floor, striding to the rafters. I turn to see him freeze, thinking it is finally over. My palms are sweaty and there is rage building in me. I instinctively make my way towards the window. Luckily the window looks out onto the street so I'm not too far away but I can't see to hold it back. It's fairly common for patrons to go see a light only getting bored once in a while. 
 As I am contemplating everything else I start noticing a reflection. It appears a huge, red stag with three tiny horns protruding from its beak. My blood pressure can no longer control what has just happened. After a few moments my adrenaline level drops. It's so obvious. There is magic about to unfold and if there is a god I can claim the day.<|endoftext|>

Everything is a show on how you will live. It's a hurt, it ’ s painful, but it ’ s important to be ready for death, to enjoy every second. 
 Oh, well, and God it helps to be clean, because the foul mess will tear you apart and you will come back and again it is so painful to see your angelic finery red on the walls of my universe. My double life changers are on a secluded shelf in the middle of nowhere, waiting for me to calm down and water down my tears. 
 You ’ ll never be able to yell in pain, every tear will be so afraid of being seen before it melts away, "**RID**! " I say. 
 And the words they say? " It ’ s a beautiful world, is it not? For every beauty that is an example to you, there will be another in the next, and you will feel that same pain in that second. " 
 Oh, well, I ’ ll be relieved, my god! You ’ ll be happy if I make you cry! How nice it would be to come back into your true home, to see your angelic finery red on the wall! 
 Good, God I ’ ll hear you, "**RID**, ” with a mighty breath, be glad you were here, just let me be happy. I ’ ll be able to be clean once again. 
 So tell me, " **RID**! " My cherubs, please tell me how I can be clean again. 
 In my heart I ’ m dying for my angelic finery red! 
 Why will you cry about it, my little friends? Why can I see them red on the wall of a room that is hotter than God ’ s fire! Why can I be joyous in the chapel that is bigger than the skies? 
 " **RID**, ” I say again, un-guiding my angelic finery red from my grave, and blessed the golden scent of my green coca cola.
I ’ ve never found love, no love less in the human world than in our own. Why can ’ t I be happy without my angelic finery red? 
 In the end it is best that I have my angelic finery red now! 
 No more misery! No more pain.<|endoftext|>

"They really had visions, Jake. They even had eternal hatred for me. The whole of it, of course. " said Rudolf, the man in the black robes. 
 " What about you? " asked Jake, in a convincing tone. 
 " You and your kind were split, of course. That and my son, " said Rudolf, quickly addressing Jake once more. " What was his... " " That man's gonna kill you - how did he end up in that whole... damn cell, Rudolf? " 
 " It was some kind of meeting. While you were there, I remember telling you, I was teaching you about love. That loves and a helpless love. " 
 " I'd torn the strings, " replied Jake. Rudolf himself saw the confusion in his eyes, the sharp edges with sharp words etched into their naked world. " He hurt you, and he left you there forever. You heard me? I made him stronger, and then he became even stronger. Very strong indeed. What happened then, Jake? He left you... there, but not for long. You don't know where you are, Jake. " 
 " How long? " 
 " I've seen you before. I've walked you the... floor. I've noticed the scars. I've seen the bruises and the disgusting place you were. Don't get me wrong, though. Those scars... are very stark. You were like the monsters, though. I witnessed the horrors you'd do. You burned, you eaten, you burned. Those wounds are just getting worse. They grew stronger. Perhaps you must have seen how hungry you were, Jake. " 
 " And what do you think of your imprisonment?" said Jake. 
 The man in black had long since stopped shaking. He gazed up at his prisoner, deeply. He tried to calm down, but there was no comforting sound. 
 Blam, blinding gunfire. I shuddered.<|endoftext|>

"But Sir... Is that you? " 
 " Well... " I tapped out, a motion that sent a chill across the room. 
 " Maybe not, what is it? " I glanced back at David, a wet, hissing laugh. He chuckled a long, long and deep, before shaking his head and turning away. 
 " No, no! This isn't a joke! " I flung my head back, fearing he would be caught in his flow. 
 " A man won't let such indigestion test his worth! " I sobbed. 
 " Damnit, you're the hooty one! " He took another long drag of his cigarette and turned around. 
 " Pardon me sir, sir, please " he said, leaning over the table to look at me. I looked into his eyes as he was preparing for his speech, it was the last thing he wanted to say. 
 "... And you're alive? I have nothing more to tell you, anything to lie to? " 
 " Oh... No, I'm alive " I closed my eyes and looked back up at the screen. Two glowing words appeared in the top left corner of it. " Experiment 4.2 added."<|endoftext|>

“ What was your name? ” Father shouted between ranting breaths as his work continued. 
 Closing his office door, Father smiled slightly. “ An elegant French boy I suppose, until he put his name on an 85 page catalogue. ” 
 Began the process of introducing a strong climatological crisis to the physical world, it turns out. I've been playing with the Neanderthal genes since much of the human race was forced to move out into the wilds of Africa and the Middle East. What I didn't know was that there were before me Neanderthal-beings. Enthusiasts and crows flew past me with stunning speed. Unlike us, Neanderthals ’ wings were sharper than ours. 
 Hence I had to create the first army in human history, in the name of science. There were repeated battles for only three human beings: Johnathan the Great, Krispy Kreme Bunnyman, and some other indigenous folk. One exception was Inscription scratched head. 
 I had to put it down and get the others started. When the world had lost its worst enemy a few hundred years ago, I wanted for everyone to use their six limbs to do whatever was the task most suited. Everybody accepted it, everybody moved and moved, all for the same mission. Easy as that. 
 I decided to look into medical theory, eventually developing a chemistry that was less and less complicated than its counterpart in the part of the world that lacked oxygen. There was only a single opening, but I was called to demonstrate it to the rest of the world. 
 “ Did you test it? ” They asked. 
 “ Sixty nine percent of people know what I'm saying, ” I told them. “ If only we could convince more. ” 
 This was great news, I told them. Some people were willing to pay for a researcher ’ s insane? An answer was never needed, however. I sat down in a tall, crisp table with the creation of the brain, and placed it on the table. The scientists around us gathered around it to see the results. There was a machine that was erected all around it that could process the last last remaining oxygen from Earth. 
 It pulsed, slowly, causing these people to shut up in embarrassment. The brain, of course, is a machine. But for the scientists it was more. 
 On the back of it, there was a single tape. It read:

 " I don't care how greedy and powerful the industry is, they're all noble! And that makes me an ideal candidate! " 
 " Um, don't worry about those fucking celebs, man. All that's important is you work as a goddamn sales guy, you know the kind, man. They put up better offers than I could ever--"

 Dr. Juniperhoff played his dentist assistant. He was turned away by the dentist's sudden, unusual pause and looking back at Dr. Hanac. 
 " Doctor - if you don't think I'm a good fit for you, we need you to do what you have to do now. " he said to the electronic presence before a robot entered his surgery room. He tried holding up the clipboard, but it was a doorway that could only be made for the doctor's open office, so he didn't bother. 
 The metal doors began to open as Dr. Juniperhoff filled out paperwork and waited at the landing at the door. Every day, he would go back to the site of the surgery and follow it's progress until a new procedure would be done. One day, doctors would walk in, give the room a thumbs up, then they would hand Dr. Juniperhoff an envelope and then he would work his way to his office to sign it. He only worked for certain patients as a means of self promotion and personal fulfillment - good for him. However, as for the hospital, he respected that every last one of them were able to keep their business entirely available to keep them happy. 
 Before he left for the reception, Dr. Juniperhoff gave each employee a good beer to begin his important work. It was crisp and refreshing, providing them with the least cajoling a person would need. He invited them to a long cocktail session at a bar, where he had placed a tray of champagne on the table before the conversation began. After that, the team traveled to his private office and began preparations. He would take two rounds of champagne to moderate himself and then take a nap. During the final round, his server would laugh and shake his hand and a raucous reception would begin. 
 Of course, doctors have no choice but to reassess their schedules. It wasn't due to their greed, of course, but their hard work. A lot of good could come from being loyal to the organization, but they were so dedicated and determined that they didn't realize they were a labor of love. This staff is really good at their jobs. They put in effort and make sure that every nurse is treated equally. They are a great team, and they work together to help clients. And then one day, one other patient or management will have to learn.<|endoftext|>

"A threat we're all worried about, where the soldier takes a bite of his first bite of green, how it ends up nuked, and when it lands on the enemy. " 
 " And that's exactly what the ghost says, and the information is precisely correct. " 
 " Unfortunately, because of our leader's comments, I end up completely wrong, and create a world where the enemy takes the slice of green bite out of the soldier's own mouth, only half tasting, then pouring over themselves as their head falls onto the concrete. " 
 " A world where the soldiers are getting less plump and morose, hungry for brains and nervous, tired of living in fear, and all they can do is get on with their lives? A world where zombie fortresses and torn-down hangers are enough? A world of all starving asunder and starving again? " 
 " He gave me a smoking gun, that's for sure, and I used it as a signal to push him back to her. We both knew he wouldn't be interested in her talking about how this can't be part of the new game, it must have gone over his head before he even began. " 
 " And then I noticed that in his mouth his eyes were just barely whole left as he drank the juice, and in the cracks of his lips he said they were just like when he took the bite, " as he pounded his cigar on his desk, and then proceeded to barge into the principal office, typing furiously, legs dangling. 
 " I spotted him flip open his laptop and write about how they're all terrified, all hungry, and all are grinding their teeth at the fear and hatred the world has for them. I turn off the smoke, turn off the heart monitor, turn off the security cameras, turn off the watch next time they take a single bite of a green meat, how ridiculous! And then I see that both of the men out there aren't budging from the desire to kill, and take a bite out of the beast in front of them. I can hear him talking down the storm that's about to start. I've taken to taking notes at work every week, and lately I've even tried taking notes on 'women of men.' But I can't understand it, their manhood being such a homogenous thing that I can't understand why a man looks like a woman, or how the world's much more palatable than their stiletto heels. " 
 " Well at least I have a very tempting solution, and at the end of it, at least a world where they're always making stupid jokes about the emperor."<|endoftext|>

When they asked for any doctors on board, I didn ’ t think my PhD would help... 
 It actually couldn ’ t, they didn ’ t ask for my mind, they all told me. They ’ d remember my name? It wasn ’ t mine! We had worked together for quite a while now, but they still decided for me to perform a mind reading, asking me what I liked. They had asked if I liked music, played some music, or stopped by the pharmacy every month. I had heard most of them talk about different kinds of music, including a mysterious band called Hardwired. I didn ’ t know music, and were looking for a singer, so I simply asked about my philosophy. 
 Now here they are, sick and tired of the mockery of people who leave details out of their vision, a thing I would be well aware of with other people. 
 “ Frank, ” they said, “ You need to go see a psychologist. ” 
 “ Oh no, of course not, it ’ s a common question, wouldn ’ t it? This, well, what I asked if you see an alien? ” 
 “ That ’ s possible, if we take a step back. What kind of alien? ” 
 “ You ’ d think they ’ d notice if I asked the interviewer about some of their calls, ” they said, “ But it ’ s not really supposed to be. Even if you did, do you know why? Because there are different kinds of aliens here. They don ’ t know anything about music, just play their instruments and listen. ” 
 “ Oh, you ’ ve been trying to tell me that for a long time, haven ’ t you? ” 
 “ There is an alien calling you. It looks familiar, yes, but is really not it, just like we did it the other day. I don ’ t remember any of it. ” 
 “ That is all, ” I said, “ Please help me. ” 
 “ Of course, we could, but I ’ ll be sure to make you aware of this fact. ” 
 In a flash, they all stood, and I ran to the nearest mirror in the corner of my room. A therapist appeared in front of me, looking like she just saw me in her dream, but for the better. I looked over at the therapist, and she leaned back in her chair. 
 “ I found someone like you, ” she said. “ Something that would make the office life full of trouble. It ’ s on a branch of the Department of Mental Science, just outside of all those aliens. ” 
 I nodded, reaching out and taking it with me. She sat down next to me, a smile spread across her face. “ Please take me into your office, can you take me back there, Professor? ” 
 “ Of course, of course, we can, it ’ s already been brought up repeatedly, what with the government demanding secrecy. ” 
 She took it, and smiled, taking my hand and leading me outside. It seemed like months later, after so many bad memories, I was told a world-renowned psychiatrist would help me.<|endoftext|>

I stared at the alarm clock in disbelief as it ticked away its fourth half. It wasn't even a year since my first test of human patience. That boy was a real one. 
 I made my way to the couch with my class and woke up to those tutting masters telling me about my next test. All it took was a little push on the butler's desk and I got myself a bet. 
 "You can't cheat on your first test of old age " - Ben Jameson told me, clearly bored with the timing though. 
 I looked over at the ancient German tutor. He was amazing, he always knew how to do something difficult. My parents put the curse aside and said " We wouldn't have thought that you'd raise a child with three of those as a reminder of how much human maturity you've put into your work ". 
 " But wait ", I asked as I reached to shake the old man's hand, wanting to bring him back to his senses a little more. 
 I turned around to see the other tutors laughing at my future test. They were old friends from high school, obviously from the same teachers but they were as dead as they had come in the last couple of years. 
 I had never really noticed the need to get up to spend as much time as possible while being watched. I had asked some of my teachers recently to tie a knot in order to tie me up more tightly but that seemed to have been for naught. 
 I glanced at the exit to the classroom from inside and smiled a little as I had for the last three hours. The students surrounded me and a demon walked into the room. 
 " Can you fix my curse? It's not exactly perfect, but we're almost there. " 
 " No ", I told them quietly. " I'm afraid not. " 
 " But you bet " - The demon said with a smirk. 
 " Yes, yes, a woe to that. It doesn't even have a force field ". 
 " Shut up now! ", the girl screamed at me in fright as the demon blew her mane with a pair of magical large hands. 
 " Oh yeah for that too! ". 
 " And my advice to you is that no one makes mistakes. Even when you try, some changes will be made. Get ready for your birthday. " 
 " But my choices are different ", I remarked. " What if a female one takes this test first? " 
 " That can't happen if it'd fall in the wrong place " - The girl replied. 
 " Listen everyone there you caught that witch! She is the oldest witch I've ever seen! " 
 " Don't scare me baby boy. She knows what's coming so she won't hurt you unless you do things a little silly. She won't do anything until you ask her out. ". 
 " I'm not going to make that mistake! Now can I get this done? ", The girl persisted. " We can tell her where you have some strange things " 
 " Yeah man, I know ". 
 I stood there for a moment, thinking how horrible the devil was as if he knew the last three hours of my life was just one long dream. I turned back to the old man, still giving his most obvious hints. 
 " Now hurry and don't make a fool of yourself".

The shapes of a woman are so hard to make out that you can't make out any of them. However, of the ones that can be seen, at the very least, they look like them, but it's pretty much like everything just feels abstract and void of anything or everyone. The girl is pretty, with a wide smile and there are a couple of glaring holes in her cheeks. 
 Seeing her doing something reminded me of when Jack told me he had seen my life before. He knew what he was doing and I didn't believe him. I made out the shapes of the *naughty* and *bad* girls at our local local park, and the kids had their own special way of saying "raped by her " around the kids who didn't have a clue what those places were doing. That was all I really knew. 
 The number of light year angles coming through the heavens would probably tell me that the sun is beating against the clouds, making it seem like an itch that is going to get bigger. The way the moon is moving is reminiscent of sucking the heavens' breath away. All it has going for it is this and that. I, on the other hand, know what it is like. Not having sleep for a while is easier than having fun. I can catch a break or two from each of my friends out here and it's almost like I'm sitting back in the apartment that we have to call home for. 
 It's been about three years since I turned down my chance to become a commercial actor, but this is going to be the one I need to make sure I meet everyone and something. It looks like Rachel is going to meet a certain boyfriend. I just need to help her find her way.

If anything, it had been the silence. Like it was nothing. None of us had ever heard the one constant thing. 
 It was the beating of your heart, pounding deep into your chest and the 'hot' sensation you felt at home most days. 
 Or days you'd try to suppress the pain, starting a lifetime work experience, instead of spending all day indoors. 
 Or months or years, with your company getting increasingly antsy, even to say the least. 
 Or years, sitting here in this little dingy room with my half-mad's hands full and my brain glued to your computer. 
 Or an eternity of this walking, night, and day with no thought of your future. 
 The memories, the reminders. 
 That day was like nothing else. Your mind took over my life, absorbed my thought, and absorbed everything else. 
 It... is... full. 
 It's only 7:00 PM and its been hours since I've been here. 
 I tried to suppress my shock, drench myself in my anger, but I felt nothing. 
 I hovered over the AC fan, aiming for the bulb, but only managed to fizzle out as my stomach began to turn. 
 Just before I could blink, the darkness overcame me. After a few seconds of staring, the other blinding lights came on, washing away the darkness around me. 
 I was alone.<|endoftext|>

John woke up to a horror fit of laughter. It was an odd take on the phrase "The clown loved laughter". Actually it was a great one. As John had been on the ceiling for hours and used the restroom to muffle these last *chasing hops* of laughter and laughter. 
 John had slept through the whole night wondering how it had ended. He was always afraid, he had recently thought himself so healthy that his body would sustain it, that he had given up smoking his entire life and decided he needed a drink. So he, dressed as The Lame Clown to actually have fun with his'unhinged body,' stumbled into his bathroom for another drink. 
 He was hit by a flying sound, it felt a bit strange. Every time he pushed the umpteenth floor of the bathroom to the other side of the bathtub, he hoped his head would bob to the correct tune. And then, he remembered what the shower looked like when the water had poured onto him. What made the bathroom more uncomfortable? 
 Is this the explanation of why people always lose their jobs because they heard such sounds. 
 He didn ’ t like that, since he always had to be the first to break the law, but the bathroom was too large so he needed a friend. So he came down to where the bathroom was. 
 In the backyard, the sky was half full of bubblegum flowers. He remembered that he had stood at the end of the day just a few weeks ago, on the fourth of the month so it had never flown past the point where it truly became a part of the sky. 
 Oh no. The balloons were for him. 
 In a flash they lit.<|endoftext|>

Satan was beating the shit out of us. 
 Pretty much everyone I had ever met thought our relationship was the strongest alliance to ever come across, but a half dozen tribes of Hell had already fallen. So with one tribe out of three, we had to force their would be allies to join up with us. We had this surly commander there who had taken control by going by the name of Moses and hiring the latest Inhumans, and we had a good feel for their cultures to rival even the most tenacious INhumans. As a result of this we had had to break the ever-popular Supernatural alliance, leaving us to fail at the initiative of the sake of fighting and winning. 
 The units of Hell had become almost a full army and had defeated all of their enemies in an extraordinary and short battle only three days ago. Soon enough we had finally seized control, but a single member of our loyal brethren had betrayed us and was watching over our leader. He was mortally wounded, just like the rest of us, and had bled out a the standard Angel healing ailment. We had, of course, fought him off valiantly, but our leader was showing us we could control his bloodlust and build armies of our own. Every new enemy unit entered ranks one after the other, sending forth their own heroes to take on Hell's the demonic overlords. 
 It was over, though. We saw that our heist was lost. Our annihilation was within the realms of our own, but when the outsiders awoke our numbers was at an all time low. We were just a small elite unit until the leaders of the Crusades broke our streak and defeated us by overwhelming numbers, killing so many that they lost their souls for as long as their army ran on mere funds from one source of blood. Even the elite Hell units saw their battle form dying. 
 When the two factions met in Heaven they could not find a single other threat on the battlefield that did not come from their own enemies. We were there at the gates of Heaven, we appeared on earth at the gates to answer their prayers. All that was changed was our name.<|endoftext|>

So I woke up this morning, this were all messed up dreams I had, memories I didnt know I was real, I thought maybe it was over I had been dead for a few hours. But this was different, I had awoken to more disturbing nightmares. 
 I was deep within a box, straight into a tube in a hospital room. No, stairs, stairs and tubes, no more visits to the doctor. Life was not making any sense. I couldn't be real I wasn't real at all. I was out in front of the chapel and all they said was'Welcome to Hell, be nice, next time cry without tears, remember Jesus and God on that earth, we helped all the people on that earth' 
 Everytime I went downstairs they would look at me weird. The doctor shook my hand and told me that I don't need any of this I have to go down in there for a few hours while I try and forget about everything. 
 Then one day I suddenly heard a strange noise, then another. I woke up in a sunny room with an old woman before I could say "fuck" she said which knocked me out.<|endoftext|>

It was not that the Duke left, nor the city, nor any of the other townsfolk, that he intended to stay home. However, he found himself here, trying to ensure that his mother would not be kidnapped, with the soldiers involved in the destruction of the castle. Fortunately he had a little bit of spare currency, as it was an armored carriage, so that could help him out with his past, and it was only a few kilometers away, so as not to be too desperate. 
 As he entered the village, he took out the letter he had dropped off at the place where he would do any questioning. He read it. 
 “ Everything is destroyed on this site, Sir, expect nothing from you. ” 
 “ Thank God, if I get word of my daughter. ” 
 “ The soldiers, they are planning the same things I planned. ” 
 “ The soldiers are working, Sir. ” 
 The soldiers wouldn ’ t be able to take him on, and it was purely the money; so they were created to save the army. 
 “ Thank you, Sir. Now Sir, prepare to move on to the castle. ” 
 And so they stayed, finding safe houses to lie down in, and stayed there for at least a few months. 
 After that, he went back to the village, where he hoped that he could, that he would get some medical supplies for his dead mother ’ s wound. He got some medicine for his mood, and he tried to talk to her about it, but she kept worrying that he might be cruel, or maybe even kill him and keep him safe. 
 “ Just wait here, Sir, you will find some medicine in there. ” 
 The village soldiers arrived, causing the army to be angry, and someone within them ordered them to engage the old man. The lieutenant told them that the king had sent a delegation to the king. He ordered them to continue from there, so that they were able to find a more likely destination. 
 Somebody named Frank, came from the east of the town. Though he was in charge of the fortifications, he agreed to join them before the others arrived. 
 But, they weren ’ t allowed to join any towns for food. One of the soldiers told him that the soldiers could not go to any food, since the food from the old fort wasn ’ t edible, so no food was allowed from the fortification. 
 “ He is mad! ” 
 So they were ordered to set up camp. It was going to be a big, sweaty feast, making sure no humans would come, and some guard would be stationed inside that fortress. It didn ’ t matter, because there was no way to flee the fortification without being captured. 
 They eventually found a group of rebels in the town, and left the village. They found the army, and turned on the camp. There was an ambush, with the soldiers being killed by one of them. The old man would get captured before they were able to move. There were rumors that the army is to be used as fodder for the revolution, and that is where he should have gone to. But that was not real. 
 A soldier of the army arrived, one of the rebels taken alive. The rebels started hitting him on the head, and he couldn ’ t get away. They were trying to get the attacker away. After taking his vision, he continued the attack, and the soldiers even tried to get in close to the old man. 
 “ Please, try to do something, to save my life. ” 
 The soldiers weren ’ t completely stupid. They tried their best to run towards him, but they were in a bind, so they had to evade any opportunities to escape. 
 One of the rebels managed to knock a piece of wood out of the old man ’ s mouth, and cut the electrical wires into the wires. As the guards started to scream for help, someone inside the camp called him out. He got into his bag, and carried it over to the soldiers. The old man stopped breathing, and asked for his money, and a bit of bread, before he left, saying to the soldiers: 
 “ Hey, when the king returns, I know you're not really hungry, so... ”<|endoftext|>

He glanced over at his mother and dad, neither mentioning them by name. The youth attempted to explain to them that their own father had shot his father and uncle. This caused the whole society to scream in protest. With his parent's higher education backgrounds, he knew that this was only going to make the punishment more severe. 
 He made a brief nod and stood up and began packing his things. Looking at the back where the family films had once been, he felt bad for them. He silently passed along a copy of the film, motioning for them to reread. Hopefully that helped. 
 He peered over his shoulder to the animals. Hardly resembled human, although he liked the feeling of a bat or an ant. Apart from an occasional raptor or a buzzard or a cheetah, they seemed to enjoy the warm sunlight as well. Judging by their size, the couple seemed to have something to show for their age. 
 He glanced over at his mother and dad to speak first. It seemed odd to the man on the sidelines, but the friendship of any mammals was rather spectacular. With a slightly annoyed tone, he patted his father on the back, taking out a large box of tissue paper. The boy would have been proud, had he grown up in the Asian civilization. Before he knew it, the incredible creatures from the films were standing behind him. 
 "I hope you enjoy this film, brother, " his mom said as she took a tissue paper from him. She looked down at her tiny brother. " I bet they will love it. " 
 He reached over and said, " Never mind. Just as long as we make it short." 
 Finally, he opened the film. The men were not paying much attention, and rarely made a move to change their bearing to bear children, yet the mother was soon voting to raise them. 
 He looked back over at his father with a smug look. He knew that he had done this too much. He was nothing like his mother. He knew she was the most charming and knowledgeable person on Earth. You could just sit there and wonder if the land was green or burnt, and you'd even consider the sight of it simply stupid. But they were all there, besides the boar, and there was nothing left to do.<|endoftext|>

They're roasting my company on a dinner plate they call it, a dinner every night, let's call them the good books. The crew of the ship are staying put, uninterrupted, even if the lights in the cabin can't see them it still impacts on me. At least that's what they tell me. They don't want to press the issue for them. I prefer them telling me how we did all the stuff and how it felt after we were in control or the descent, but that won't count and doesn't justify thinking about the consequences. 
 It was something that I learned from them. No one wants to tell them about the terrible struggle of the four humans that were spinning, maybe with two moons on each side, and no support to support them. Four human deaths like that. All four humans and three faster than me. The island made sure that I had to find enough light to make it or we'll all die. Once more, I had to go through the iron on a bray and run on a tether, even if I didn't land they would stop me from sliding and unstrapping myself. 
 I had two light years left, at least two more months of water. They didn't know how much had changed since I set course, maybe just seconds or months. I had to find a way to stop them. There were three positions left and I was doomed. I wouldn't give them hope, I'd lose hope in a way that seemed easy. The moon had burned up and sun lost its weight with the sun and I'd never see it again. Three more months and I'd be here. How long could I let them watch me and I had no idea. I wasn't the Captain of the Enterprise, I was a spare one with my last glory, the Captain of the Enterprise and all that. 
 I wanted to travel to that island just to find something of value, in a place where humanity would be free to grow. I wanted to find more of my fellow crew and people, families more comfortable looking for a few years at a time, and the experience I had once contained. To take it all back, all the way there, all of the life we had survived in the last four years. 
 Two more months and I was going to be here and I still didn't know what to do with myself. If I could find something to eat and live without me there was no reason to take care of myself. I had no idea how to protect myself. My plan was just a crazy notion as I pressed it. They watched me drift away slowly for almost two hundred days on the surface, days without sight in the barren plains outside. I was going to find my way back, but had no direct sign of what would happen to me. I had to get away. 
 I couldn't do it alone. If I ever found myself again the crew would be mad. 
 *pfft, aside from the beginning, I'm not sure how I set foot in the United Federation on earth before the light went out. *<|endoftext|>
**********724**********
The first time I had talked to him I realized, once again, that this would be a bloodbath between our hearts. It was a November evening; upon waking up to find that he was in bed, looking straight at me from across the bathroom window, after having just finished slumping against the wall and grabbing a blinds, he was staring at me with his sleeping eyes. The first time I had just witnessed something like this, my heart sank, and my jaw dropped. Then I told him I had not talked to him again, and he kept shaking his head and talking. During the first few years, I thought he might be wrong, but once I noticed it, I began to believe it was him, since he was becoming thinner, and then I started to relax. 
 But suddenly, he starts slumping. He begins to groan and jump, but the change in tone does not concern him. It seems to come from his blush. And then he stops. His eyes are bright red. He looks me in the eyes. His face says it all, and I think he is crying. But he doesn't. A beat runs through my body. He is sleeping very tight. He gets up. 
 He doesn't want to sleep. I don't, as the first time we broke up, I hoped I was sleeping the better. But now, I am cold; my skin is cold. I want to leave the room, but my stomach is still hurting. I want to scream, but I can't. I want to jump, but the cold cuts through my voice like knife blades, and I find myself on the ground floor, on a cold empty floor, with a bloody cut across my face, and a hand on my arm. 
 Then I keep crying, because I want to cry; because I want him to leave me alone, and if I try to leave, I'll have to smash my head against the wall. I'll have to choke, and I'll have to force myself to cry. I'll need to kick him in the chest, as a long knife opens its way into my skull, and I just want him to come. But I can't; I'm freezing. The cold outside starts to knock hard. Then I'm falling, and we're running, running out, getting to the door, so I can't fall back down. The door is shut. I'm cold. I'm helpless. I don't know what to do. He falls on top of me. It's so hard to get up, to get back down, to get up; I've started to feel soft and rough on my skin. I start to smile. It's quite cold. I'm smiling now, but I can't feel the tears flowing down my face. It hurts like something I've never experienced. I don't have a mouth, and my heart is still hurting. I scream. I cry on my pain so loud I can't breath. It hurts like something I've never felt before. I scream, screaming, saying, "I love you, " my voice screaming, " I love you so, so much! " But I don't. 
 Then I cry again. And I don't cry anymore. And I keep crying, and crying, not saying anything anymore. But it's getting harder to move, to grow, I see, as my heart races. I see a soft ring lightly on my finger. There's a big smile on it, and my heart is booming for a heartbeat. Then it's gone. I've been cold ever since. And I have no mouth. I'm afraid that my throat is pulling down on me. I have no idea how far it goes, or how long until I'm gasping for breath. I can feel my heart get warm, my chest freeze. My cheeks are soaked in sweat. My face gets pale. My eyelids are very dry. I scream and my voice is very little now. This is too much. I stand up, and help myself to a napkin. I pick it up and put it on the stand. I grab one of the inches of my neck and the fingers put my chin over the hole, and put my shoulder against it. I laugh. " Yes, you," I say. 
 I leave with my wallet, and leave like always, and the burning stomach at my sides, waiting for me to get back up. The cold feel against my thigh. I have no way of stopping my crawling, nor can I avoid the tiredness. I smile, and there she is. She is bleeding on my face. Her thin fingers are waiting for me to stop.<|endoftext|>
**********725**********
As I was spooning ice cream at my favorite Starbucks, something inside of me woke up with a blank, unadulterated stare. * What the fuck? * I said aloud, rubbing my face in frustration. I looked at my left palm. A green, which I suspect was the cinnamon, just slipped from my fingertips. The thought made me rethink my actions. 
 I then noticed a small cross staring back at me. I watched it in amazement. It had no expression, just a hairline of hair. It flickered and then promptly dropped to the floor. I sat up straight, staring at the cross, now off in the distance. I ran outside, and ran for my girlfriend, brandishing my backpack and weapon. He had all sorts of weapons, armor, and a backpack. I don't know how long he had been wandering around. 
 As I approached the cross, I noticed the currency was nothing strange, save a sliver of money. I took it out of my backpack, picked up a large bag, and placed it in the cross and ran. My girlfriend followed me until I got out. " Sorry to bother you, " she said. " It's just that you're looking for something that was stolen, isn't it? " " What? " I asked. She replied, " Nothing bad happened when I came back. But you noticed a group of strangers were storming my home that day. " She watched me for a few moments. " So what's this? " I asked. " The idea that someone had stolen something was so tempting to me. " " Well, we weren't following you at all, were we? So we went to the neighborhood. " I tried to pry my fingers free of the rock holding it up. " I don't think so. " She said. " It's strange, isn't it? " " Sure it is. I took it out of the bag, and you brought the bag closer. " " What? " I asked, nervously. " No, that isn't necessary. Did someone just take your backpack? " " Who says that?! " She asked, just standing there, looking angry. " I called my mother, she didn't come. " " What?! " I yelled. She looked at me, and then back at her arm. " Your arms?! " I heard. " I never got to do that. " " I don't know. I'm sorry. " I apologized, laughing and standing up. When I got back to the cross, she was gone. The clothes on the cross were gone. I put the backpack in my pocket and ran away as quickly as I could. 
 I ran to the park, but I was not caught. Sure enough, there was a group of black robin carcasses everywhere. What happened? I thought. No one was stealing anything.<|endoftext|>

I was in another world. I was one among many. Skrimory I was, I would say. But I never told you how I first saw myself that first day. The side of a coal miner, lying in flames, watching as their fires soon swelled to the boiling point. As was my mission, risking my life every hour. This venture... I'm calling it...'The Smoke.' 
 The faintest raspy whisper to the depths where I drifted was met by a harsh scraping at the side of my shining steel pipe. I mighted, but I'm not stronger. When my actions broke through the walls of space, the stone beneath me loomed menacingly over them. I crumbled from the cold, cracked, hollow face of the cavern, my final breath short and sweet... I watched my brother die and smite the other side of the rising smoke. It took years, but I swore to myself that if I simply walked away, that the stone would crumble into oblivion, a glorious death upon which to live. 
 I watched my brothers die and kill as I walked away. The twinges of green, the glow of flames, the light of the bright moon heralding the end of my tongue... I watched my brother die, the last living thing, and was met with cold stone with a hollowened hand.<|endoftext|>
**********727**********
*There she was. * 
 Poor girl, in a suit. This was no ordinary black outfit. Hard to believe that there was blood in her blouse. 
 *She was her moment. * 
 The small candlelight reflected off the blond hair, its casing being faintly brown. Several minutes later, the red light flicked on. A couple of doors, lightly rolled in the gutter, were opened. Another close up of body, flesh stretched out from the sheet, revealing a crimson corpse. As if possessed by a host of hell's horrors. 
 *I'm sorry, I wouldn't want to see her again. I shouldn't have killed her. * 
 Soon, six men were already in the room. " Hey, " one called out. " What're you doing here? " 
 The blond hair was quickly scrunched back up in her hand. She turned around to face the man. This time, he wore a helmet. " Feel free to come along, mighto," he said with an apologetic tone.<|endoftext|>
**********728**********
It didn't have to be "human " to land in a shopping center all alone, it couldn't have been the media coverage over a flood of scathing tabloid articles, television commentary, but the interviews? It's all clear now. " Humans, we need to mobilize. Get back in our cities and don't make the same mistakes that we did, the only goal today is a powerful army and not some happy drama. Everyone has their manager, it's time to finally show up. " Today is another chance to run a nation, to march like the Spartacists and Parisians. The planet will be a new centre of civilization and you, Marsden Hawkins have helped this nation turn ours around, now go, find a job, leave your dog at home, eat some rest and try to fix your stress. " The guy got up and started walking. The people behind him hesitated. The interviewer looked tired. " Think Martian good luck, man. " That was enough. What the hell was this thing called? No one was looking. He started walking. Nobody was moving, just small figures. He paused for a second and before he could pick up his pace, the man ran. The moment the two had kept the photographer up all night saw it as he was getting pulled towards the edge of the parking lot. " He's out of a job, he's a failure. Get back in the system. Get in the right city. And then you can come back home and make a great nation. What an idiot, I should be back to my task for once. " The photographer just ran. The civilian caught up and was walking slowly to make sure he didn't run over the man. Just before he was sure his car was totaled, he heard what sounded like a high pitched wheeze, then you heard it. The noise seemed to pick up as more people started to run toward the edge of the parking lot. " It's all over." Marsden knew it was over. He couldn't find a job, his family couldn't stay around him anymore and Marsden couldn't go back to college in Oklahoma. Marsden was woken by a blaring number alert his family came over to get him. The freinds would be home for the movie night in the meantime, they expected to be at the station. The people waiting there demanded food and a drink while they searched for the sunken spaceship. There was a heavy noise of metal coming from the ship. A hollow silence filled the cabin while all of the noises stopped.<|endoftext|>
**********729**********
I wake up at 5am, comb my hair, have a shower, and prepare for my day. Walking down the street, I pass a girl, blindfolded, her eyes are deep blue. To her right, a man, also blind, holds a dark loaded weapon. 
 I sprint down the street towards him. 
 "What's your name? " 
 He looks up into my eyes, hands slightly crossed behind his head. He must have looked at me a second or two. 
 " Eva, I'm- " 
 " Oh your name is Enzo. " 
 " No, I must say Enzo... " 
 " And you died? " 
 " Uh... yes. " 
 " Did you die? " 
 " No. I have not. " 
 " Did you die then? " 
 " Not really. That's more a practical joke. " 
 " And this is the moment that I came into being? " 
 " That's when I had planned something. " 
 " I thought you were going to die by then. " 
 " Yes. " 
 " And was it small at first? " 
 " I don't recall, but it was barely a concern. Like... " 
 " Was it small at first? " 
 " I guess it was small at first, almost not at all. " 
 " Then you died... " 
 He removes his boots from the ground and stands, daintily. He shakes his head slightly. " My brother. " 
 I walk back down the street, towards him, pistol in hand. He stares right into my eyes. " Maybe you didn't realize you had two to begin with. " He pointed a gun at my face, but pulled back so he wouldn't disturb my balance. " Let's get you home. " 
 I quickly dashed off into the street. I stood there, crouched at the curb. Not worried, I picked up the white, light colored watch that I always kept in my room. I began setting it up, a cross that reads the minute hand of each number. 
 *Heartbeat at 10. I attempt to jump in the air and over the fence. * 
 I look up and look down at my watch, until I see 11, but that's the least that comes out. I could hear screaming. My brother. The others. I hear the kick back and then another. Blood. 
 I step back to the fence and am transfixed on the red hand of the number 11. I look down to see the number 10 reach zero. I look up in surprise and then back up at my watch. It says *zero*. 
 " Good, " I say, " That's the last time I've checked for nothing. " 
 " What are you on about? " 
 " Uh... just checking for Eva. " 
 " As in... you need to start right away! " 
 " What? " 
 " Well... I decided to give her the key to the club. I set the sauna three minutes before I came down, just to see what we were up against. " 
 " Sounds good! So what is your name? " 
 He shakes his head impatiently. " Goudah- " 
 " This is... uh... simple. Just Benjaeger. Oh fuck! " 
 " But... " 
 He gets up and walks towards the bedroom. 
 " My name is Jo that sounds nice. Please let me see my son's... watch." 
 The tears trickle down my cheeks as I see his beautiful face.

I was not among those psychopaths, but not one of them felt free to assassinate me. I guess if they were strangers they might have been shocked and horrified. I could even be more shocking, for I hadn't even killed someone. The goal was to make them stop. 
 It had been three days and the training I had just obtained had gone awry. No amount of speculation would lead to a swift murder. All I wanted now was to rest and die with a smile on my face. 
 I grabbed the map out of the drawer that I brought with me when I was done. I was free to say hello, and I did. 
 *Once the deliveryman did his thing and moved his gun, he pointed it to my head. I wanted to die, but not in this way. This felt wrong to murder, not fitting me. And if anyone wanted me dead then they were not wanting me dead. No. I would simply feast on my soul. One way or another, I would die. And I would die good. * 
 As soon as the deliveryman finished his ritual he proceeded to charge at me as hard as he could and I felt my life begin to fade away. I had made my point. My life would be mine. After I took my life, I could spend my new life with pleasure. And he was right. I had totally dropped the ball that I was hanging on the edge. I had not been consistent in my murder and my chosen weapon was supposed to be to kill. 
 *After the deliveryman returned from his shift, he took off his mask, revealing his new hardened state. He shrugged off the icy look that he had gotten from me. He got up in the middle of the living room, close enough that his head could barely be seen above the rectangular room that he'd been living in. As he closed his eyes, he turned towards the hallway. * As he reached the end of the hallway, he swung a small weapon which he carried in his hand. * 
 The flow of blood in his body made me gasp. One last shot, and I was gone. 
 My destiny had been set, finally. I killed him and the people of a sleepy little town.<|endoftext|>

Bill, who even has a pretty bad temper, sat through his tedious paper review. 
 "Well boss, I really mean to tell you, to analyze and follow every relevant variation and you all lied. " Tom said. 
 " No? " Bill said. 
 " Why did you say that? " 
 " Actually, John, you shouldn't have told me that. I shouldn't have. I didn't take too long to pull through. But the leak first broke me from my bearings. " 
 " My god, how old are you, JANE. " 
 " 726! Why have you claimed it 10 fucking years into that journal cover up? " 
 " Oh great, I got it. Now tell me, how do you justify you all this? " 
 " Well, I would suppose it's a case of curiosity. " 
 Bill sighed. " You're trying to be annoying. You should put your pen to paper. I got him to come in here from his time at Stanford. He... " 
 " Bruce, I... we've been in a class. We'd rather do oral history then memoranda and deep dives. I'm going to ask you one final question. " 
 Bruce stopped arguing and looked out the window. " Are you serious? How long has he been at Stanford? " 
 Bill shook his head. " He's gone. I don't know how many years have I had to share it with him. He's fed me this non-story and, well... " 
 " So. He's changed for the better lately? " 
 " Yes, because it's been many months now. This whole fiasco has been a great distraction. You know me personally, but I'm left hanging. He is too much of a con, and I feel like I would never have got the chance to listen to him. But boy, I still think there's still something in there. " 
 " Will you tell me what it is about Mavis? " 
 " I don't have time for any more. I don't think that Joejanes work. " 
 " Will he outlive Joejanes again? " 
 Bill sighed. " I don't know. " 
 " And Joejanes is me? " 
 " Yes. " 
 " And Joejanes is the son of Joejanes? " 
 Bill sighed heavily. " And if Joejanes was Joejanes? " 
 " I'm sure Joejanes would be Joejanes once more. " 
 " You have to be kidding me. " 
 " I did learn what Joejanes could do. " 
 " You did... well, you knew he could use Joejanes to augment all of his intelligence. But Joejanes wasn't a mathematician. He was one of the bureaucrats at the NSA. He learned what to do with EC gravitrons. That's awesome. Couldn't you at least try? " 
 " Joejanes was my mentor. He helped me write the tool. I'm a good student. " 
 " And Javi? " 
 " Absolutely. He's the only person who doesn't feel completely down. And he's a very accomplished student. " 
 " And he doesn't pay attention to exercise? " 
 " No, not really. " 
 " So it's not Joejanes? " 
 " No, but he's an inane disappointment. Joejanes is my heart. But Joejanes is no one to tell jokes on. He knows what to do with them. Even better, Joejanes could affect the course of human history with his analytic tools. He could follow in Joejanes footsteps. " 
 " Joejanes? " 
 " Yes, Joejanes. " 
 Bill sat for a moment. Then, he dove headfirst into the deep web.<|endoftext|>

My trial shall begin, I swear. 
 My liege, Queen Rosemary, my courtier, our savior of this land, had gotten me into custody this morning, attempting to avoid a life sentence for this crime. I did not believe her murder was a heinous deed and I did not surrender to an unjust end, but no punishment had come to me for her murder, and this was wrong. It was false. I had indulged in the earlier robberies on my father's estate, after being instructed that I had to pay for them if I returned to the hospital or to my father's bed. My assailants had done this not because of me, but because they wanted revenge. My name was William Sullivan and I had been assigned to this job. 
 At first I didn't believe it. Why am I chosen for this task? The men who had attempted the robbery, who had found my body floating about the street, who had found my golden retriever inside my grandfather's bed, and did not pay attention to the cover-up by my lawyer that day. They never had. 
 Then my father died. That was the worst. I didn't want to believe that murder occurred. Why didn't I pay my way out of this responsibility? 
 I was prepared. It was simple, come out of the hospital in handcuffs and put on a stretcher, so I could show my boss that I was sorry about my actions. At first, I refused, but now, my fear got the better of me. I wasn't looking to get my revenge, no. I looked to get what I was promised.<|endoftext|>

"Jreikya Dyrion, why do you keep saying that? " 
 " To prove that I am immortal? You were selected to perform this last masterpiece! It is the final trial against these despairing beings! " 
 " But why? " 
 " Please, for perhaps, a hundred billion years! The trials have lasted almost in a hundred years. The last shows not once in thousands of years. The trials give everything that I still have to maintain my home. " 
 " Perhaps I did the right thing. But do you want me to believe that? " 
 " No. I want you to stop trying to use this bait. " 
 " But... " 
 " Hiding behind a curtain, is a fatal mistake. " 
 " Or is it? " 
 " Of course it is. You would be no better for the position. But ask me again. Why? Why let us go? " 
 " Because you risk everything! If this dooms us, why not throw it out? This is our last experiment. " 
 " That would also be folly. You just made us lose even more! " 
 " I-I see! " 
 " It's because I have realized, that this is where we go wrong."<|endoftext|>

"You must be the one at the bottom of the grave. You are the only one of your kind who has shown any sign of opening the path to a New World. " 
 " I am sure the world is no longer safe for you; my loved ones and your servants have died like spoiled mice in a room of mice. " 
 " Well, " he says. " I must have mistaken your clothes and wish them away. Be careful now; it is a life-or-death event. " 
 " Why? " 
 " Oh, I forgot, the other liars have some scars too. " 
 " And their faces have a spot on them- " 
 " Excuse me? " 
 " You must of noticed it then. " 
 " I must be mistaken too. I must blame this on the ill taste in my food. " 
 " Er... Okay, I was trying to avoid that. " 
 " No -- " 
 " We had an affair, why should this matter? And you are an asshole and it might well be a big decision to make before I have a chance to explain what I've done. " 
 " Eh, that doesn't make much sense. I've seen many different people go through this grief so many times already. What do I do? I am a wise man, one who understands both of the modern medical concepts of grief and the afterlife. " 
 " You are not wise, that means you are a moron! " 
 " More like a moron than a liar. This is the way the world works, no more lies with a dead person! You call yourself this man because you can't get away with just throwing away your choice just to prove you're a liar. " 
 " I am not sure how old I am. Before that, when I was very young, I was a wise man. I made deals with bad people, made plans for them, arranged favors with my neighbors. After all, who would have thought my choices would compromise *this* family and friends? This is not an issue for the undead, life and death are not the same. It is the responsibility of a wise man to fight evil. If his reasoning led you away from the path, then it is okay. Even if life's so much longer than it seems, trying to make life less dangerous and more pleasurable could help. " 
 " If only..."

 “ This is the first time I ’ m actually using this portal. ” 
 “ And why not? I can go into another dimension and destroy it. ” 
 I am the god of hundreds of galaxies. And more galaxies are watching me in their billions, streaming me their intrepid bounty. But I am not a savage soul. I have never conquered a single person before, and have never touched a single thing. 
 How could I possibly die before a show? There is nothing dangerous there, they say. Why would I want to die before I become the god of other galaxies? 
 I do my best to allow them to predict my life after, however serious they must be. If I am truly honest with myself, then I would remain gentle and content. I had mastered multiple faiths in the last few thousand years. Well, if you could call them universes, then most universes are now as benign and safe as Earth. 
 Earth is simply fine. It is three hundred different physical dimensions away from being hostile to me, so the chances of one of them acting accidentally are very low. But there are also rumors. There are absolutely no explosions, craters, or accidents that could begin with this, Earth. 
 I kept this secret because of fear. I thought it wouldn ’ t be so bad, but apparently a rare human hold group started to target me, and I realized that they were all of them. How could they be so stupid? They have unlimited numbers, I'll tell you about that tomorrow. 
 My lot in life is to track and review their horrible deaths. I have spent the last fifteen years listening to every sentence uttered by each soul I have run into. I have spent over four thousand years trying to have a true conversation with every soul I have had the chance to capture. From the beginning of time I have laid low because I didn ’ t want to have to sacrifice my immortal soul for someone else ’ s good. 
 But then one day, I stumbled across a new soul. In a fit of rage and fear, I launched an attack in a single fireball at all of them. Each one of them just slumped to the ground, gasping for air. Others had run into each other, crumbling over, and seemed powerless. I run as fast as I can out of fear. 
 I was sent to kill the remaining five of them, as a threat to my pure omnipotence. But the other five just screamed in pain, crying out in anguish, while other beings just stared and stared at them. Only when a choice had been made, and most of them used their infinite power to save me did I notice, I got a response. 
 I looked away from the souls I had killed, using their knowledge and abilities to get a closer look at what I was doing. Everyone looked up in horror as their eyes began to water. One child tried to run with a few cubes in his hands, but started to spin wildly and crash to the floor. He started to scream in pain and beat the cubes on their limbs, slowly turning them upside down. After seconds, he broke his cover, and looked up at me, stunned. His eyes burst with tears and he gave up staring at me for a few seconds. 
 When the fifth one was completely disabled, his entire body was still looking up at me with dread in his eyes. The sadistic kids were all running in fear as soon as he stopped his savage pleas. I stood up and stamped a piece of paper across the space between us, and I looked again into his eyes. He looked at me like it was the only thing I could do, and finally said, “ They ’ re not like your pups. ” 
 He then simply rubbed his eyes and said, “ You go kill them all and be the next Noah, Isaac, Jasmine, Rachel, and Jill, and never tell anyone about this."<|endoftext|>

When one is not full of life then they will be full of death. We will weep and we will struggle and we will be weak. Life is unending. One must give. To give one's body, mind and soul to the universe, we are the last piece. 
 When one builds, just how long we have to create to reach the perfect place, even a man or woman will have nothing but infinite time. Where the first wind starts, we have arrived to the right timescale. No matter what we did when the year is over, the earth was cold and crusted. As our hair dried, we would come to great lengths and rise. I knew, when I was young I asked myself: "Will that create the perfect human being." 
 It did. 
 And so, so long ago and all that. The time came. The end came with a starting point of reaching perfection, but it would not be my perfect being. 
 But the sunrise began. 
 The dawn of my grandest creation; A human being with infinite time. 
 Until the day of my first sunrise. 
 I was the First Family, Black & White. Black & White were an Empire, the Empire with the largest armies. Black & White had a god, The One-Who-Is. 
 The 1,000 soldiers had captured the 4th prince in the Empire to bring me to reality, My Enemy, The One-Who-Takes-Tales. 
 I am the Sorcerer, Demon, Crimson. I am the Sorcerer, The Wolf, And The One Who Flies. 
 My name is Tyr, and I am Immortal.<|endoftext|>

Jim sat on his palms as his wife was dragged to the police station. The six pack was lost at the gate but one of the officers found a kilo where it fell and ran over to give the woman a hug. 
 Jim had told Carol about his twisted love of one day seeing a geyser where he said the sun warmed her and they both got used to the cool air inside. He had walked up to Carol when it all went sour but with nothing else to do it was just his belly. 
 "Why the fuck would you do that, Carol? Why do you seem so anxious? " Jim asked as the officers tossed him some notes and put him on patrol. " Carol I am a taxi driver and you don't have the right to dictate what I do without knowing what needs to happen to me. Come back by again and come talk to me about how we are having a perfect day and who was keeping you away from me. All I ask is to know when to leave the property and why your in there. " 
 The, uh... gas tube. Jim was speechless. How did Jim know what had happened to Carol? Was there something wrong with the guy? The sink had just a cracked ceiling and the door wasn't there. 
 " My wife's in here in a horrific accident! " Jim continued to get higher and higher, a voice cracking in his head, " What the hell did you do to yourself Carol? " 
 When he got close Carol wanted to lie down and kiss him but she wanted to blow out his nostril. Jim thought about quitting the taxi and had a bottle of 100 proof nail polish ready for pick up. 
 " I know. Tell the officer I love her and I don't care how badly you love her. You look like you want to fly. You're a woman but this is fucking life. I bet you can handle it. " 
 Jim was sweating but it was too late. Carol had just got on the ambulance ride when the police arrived, almost immediately Jim was on the floor and a crowd of people chanted the words " GOD PLEASE SAVE YOUR MOTHER. ". 
 Meanwhile at the police station Jim waited impatiently. He could hardly believe his eyes. Carol was gone. Jim could never find out why but by then Carol was dead and the cops, they couldn't find her body like they had been waiting for hours and when they finally found her they didn't help her. 
 The policemen were quick to treat Jim but they quickly found his wife because they were not able to find where his heroin was. Jim sat in the waiting room and for a few days he thought that his wife's cancer was mostly out of control and that her entire life had just been a dream. 
 " What the hell are you looking at Carol? This new cam's not real life and it's not like it's life. " 
 Finally getting in line the cops addressed Jim with a suspicious look on their face. " Mr. Black it is our suspicion that you have some kind of stolen substance. I would like to question you about your own death but how you ended up on that side was completely unexpected, what can you tell us about yourself? " 
 " Mr. Black the corpse was found in a cement box but he was apparently fumbling with a piece of paper."<|endoftext|>

The morning once again echoed into existence. And tomorrow after that night, it would all repeat. But today, I had a new routine. I grabbed the odd white material from the pocket of my trench coat. 
 It was this object that allowed me to get some sleep when I was travelling. And I covered my eyes with this strange metal tool, and rubbed my eyes with the odd shell. That made me giddy and once more slept. 
 For a couple hours, I sat, my eyes fixed on a small frame on the desk in front of me. I placed the odd sphere on the desk, using the sphere to make vibrations between it and the wall. I set it on the desk and all I had to do was rub my eyes, I could easily make everyone I come across wake up with dreams. 
 Today was one of those mornings when I have some plans to rest. 
 I headed straight for the bathroom. The sound of clinking pots sent shivers up my spine. I always worry about the plastic one, and with every new day I wake up with toys, I might as well play with that. 
 I decided to catch a snack after practice. While sitting on my side, I put my arm around some toothbrush which I had gotten out for my friend. He didn't react at first. I knew I shouldn't have called the office. Apparently all you were ever supposed to do in this job is mess with the drill and will break something. 
 Time passed as I drew my toothbrush. And every few hours I would start it on the bathroom floor and let the toothbrush warm up in the wash, waiting for something new to be found. My fingers seemed to be doing just fine, until today. 
 Suddenly, a near deformed girl with red hair fell up. For a second, I feared she was dangerous. Then something else happened. As the tears rolled down her face, she dropped her scarf. 
 "Nice gift! " She said. " Well, I hope you don't mind if I go clean it all up." She hugged me tight. We went to the shower, which is why I skipped out from the mirror that was already laying on the floor. As I was putting the toothbrush to dry, I found it. 
 I removed the toothbrush and rolled it up to it. I smiled to myself at my desire to spend more time with her. And I put all of my energy into it. 
 I showed her that the knife I brought home was expensive. I laughed at her. She was shaking all at once. I raised the knife a little, unsharpened to a sharp edge, and took my time playing with it. It was really effective, just to think about it. I put it into my mouth a bit too quick, but it actually tasted good. 
 And again she grabbed my hand and my hand closed around it, opening it around her mouth to tell me that the toothbrush didn't take much more effort than it should. Her teeth felt happy like it worked all night and I continued brushing them. I remember I asked her why, since she had loved when I first saw the girl wearing my outfit before that day. But she didn't answer. 
 I guess I am the first person I have ever tried to send texts.<|endoftext|>

"When you ask me anything, I respond out loud. I know it's a stupid question, but I am offering heaven. To you and me." 
 They were two of those stirring words those about to be peddled by the despicable god's minions. As was always the difference between a good liar and an evil one. It was not the fact he was teaching the most beautiful women a lesson she would ever learn, but that he was a cruel father. When no one is happy, you have no place on earth. That unending misery was eventually alleviated. At least he had his supply of angels and demons in his pocket, so they weren't full of their own blood. Eventually, he would have, but then he would have lied like a child his entire life. That damned mother wouldn't understand... after she learned that the religion of suffering was based on a hatred of others that she held deep inside of her.<|endoftext|>

 If you are reading this, I totally agree it is a masterpiece. We as a company let our ( original ) employees publish and publish creative literature on content we consider holy, for the greater good. However, we don't publish fully licensed works, for we write the stories and the anthems that any individual put in a piece of that piece of literature. If we could receive funding through cash, we would give every single reader the art that is engrained in every literary medium, giving them the freedom to read any piece of fanfiction they want without being in a library. 
 While our stories and artists are executed to perfection by the thousands, we in turn go towards the souls of the people who submit submissions. This process was instituted when the stock prices of the company skyrocketed and the creators were removed. Today the names are posted on the top of every page in the entire world for readers to see. The meaning of this dream lies with each and every one of us. Because if everyone is to have the access to the power to force our beliefs down, what can become of us?

"Witch hunts are not always about witches " said the old-school bartender a few moments ago. 
 A young witch had interrupted her duty, and now needed to clarify this phrase clearly. The old woman had been a large, beautiful woman, a victim of cold weather, death and disease. 
 " Ruthless " she had said with an impressive sincerity. 
 The bartender waved his patron's hand and pointed to his guard. 
 " Four hours until she's back, two hours of daylight and two hours of champagne! " The bartender announced with a solemn, but sincere grin. The old woman frowned and replied " honey, don't you think she was hiding under a potion with a bottle in her hands? " 
 " Well sh -- " said the bartender, now obviously unaware of the weapon she held in her right hand. 
 " I thought I said right before... " thought Ruthless, as she rambled on. " More whiskey, please " she said, looking to the old woman. 
 The bartender looked at the old woman and raised an eyebrow. 
 " Rose. " 
 " Rose! " the bartender yelled. " Rose Rose Rose. Rose! " 
 " Now she is hiding under your bed? We found her coming down the stairs right after work and have her in the living room. " 
 Rose stood with her head down, only managing to walk over one of her shoes, barely noticed that the shoes were lying on the floor. 
 " You need to find the girl, even if we are starting to hear gunshots, and leave this place when she goes to bed " The bartender said while examining Rose. 
 " No Rose, it is indeed leaving. " 
 " Happens every time " said the old lady with a wink. " A clear sight that night. " 
 The bartender gave her a " Please " and replied, as he raised his glasses " There is no silver lining this time, honey. " 
 " What do you mean silver lining? " said Ruthless. " You've just called me a witch. And he'll think you're crazy. Besides, it's possible I screwed up. " 
 " Crazy? " said Rose, already paying it no mind. " You must be thinking this is really a witch hunt. " 
 The bartender waved his patron goodbye, before speaking again " But it was just yesterday, right? When you were listening to me making your last words to your best friend a few hours ago. It was just another morning or so. Even if all this time, your following your aunts and uncles into a house to escape the... wait, is it a haunted house or somethin'? " 
 " The forgery " said the old lady as she held up a ring in front of Rose and tapped it against the ring. 
 " Oh, nah, the the haunted house is that damned witch! " Rose exclaimed as she realized her dream. " This spell allows for a cold, deep feeling in your heart to let you feel your loved ones are gone for a time. " 
 " I am nothing like that, my dear Rose. " The bartender said sadly. " In this peaceful night, the words will not come. " 
 Rose stared at the old woman all the way down the hall. A good look will kill you if you don't carry on with your family. She saw these words and nodded towards her guards. 
 " Now set everything up, what am I going to do about her?" Her guards muttered under their breath. The old woman was gone. The bartender was gone and Rose was still bitter and angry about the spell being broken. The old woman held out a cloth and the police and army guard in front of her, wearing gloves and everything, helping her waltz down the hall. 
 The bartender calmly said goodbye to her two decades old nephew. 
 *P.S. The name of the town for the haunted house is Scabber. We had a few ideas, but we decided to send a big firecracker up after that too. So it should just be on a hill by the castle. *<|endoftext|>

*Dear Diary, * 
 *I am so sorry, but I don't see you again. I'm so wrapped up in this, that I can't do this much. Is your loved one dead? Am I able to bring him back? I know I can't, but I want him back. He's my hero, and I know it. Every time I see you, I'll feel regret for what I did to you. I've lost count of the number of times you've wanted to argue, but you always insist on this, and that's why. We've talked, and we've married, you know, only made things worse. But I feel like when the emotions are kindled, I'll have you back in the moment. As you close your eyes, every step you take, every mention of words makes it worse for me. I know you loved me, but not just so much. It's a place where we are on the same page, and no matter what you say, I'll always be there, when you need me most, talking to you about how we needed each other so badly to move on to the next adventure. I know it's painful, but I love you with all my heart, and I still have my demons, right now. Get back to writing, and I'll continue living. But I want to find the love I've used to craigslist for a living. Don't be afraid, Joey. Remember that dream that we had together when I was a kid? It was so beautiful. Hope. You kissed me when I was an infant." 
 *Edna Spencer Reed* 
 Here's my letter. 
 I now understand why I shouldn't have been writing this. I'll never get any answers when I'm gone. But I can't imagine the ease of wiping my other worthless personality, living in constant fear of letting go, and trusting the "good stuff" that keeps me on the front lines. I cry that I finally know what can be done. I'll make sure you die safe, and for as long as I'm able. All the things I've said have lost all meaning to me. 
 Until then, I hope my hands will keep me warm and bright as my last breath on this damned page.

 ____________________________ 
 Hello Diary, 
 You two don't understand, at all. 
 This letter is desperate and sad, but I find no effort to keep you now. 
 Have you thought? Why not once? 
 Because I really hope you're asleep. 
 I'm sorry that you took so long. 
 Don't you know the risks? 
 See this is my letter to you. 
 If you read it, you'll understand. 
 You ever thought just living this life would be easy, that I could just kick the wagon and make it all better? A fall like that is barely worth a damn. When that happens, your head hurts and your organs kick and you think you'll be okay. But you never will. 
 Don't know what you could have done, but these choices are hopeless. 
 Yet I write to you with hope, knowing that it will be okay, knowing that every time you kick the wagon, it'll be okay. 
 That's all that matters. 
 This is a sad day, so I promise you I'll see you again, after it's over. 
 Don't look away from me, Joe. 
 Cheers, 
 Larry<|endoftext|>

"What brings you to here? " I asked as I pointed toward the silhouette of the massive craft that filled the corridors and the main nexus, zero gravity on. 
 " Nothing, nothing really. Something bigger. " She gestured toward the ship with a dead grimace on her face. 
 It had never really been a dead one. No shred of memory of who she was, anywhere. Even her mother had given me up in the early days, looking for the same reason she used to find me. Maybe one day you'll get your soul back. 
 " Just one question, what do you know about me? " 
 That was how she usually would answer when I asked the question. Though she was never what one would call emotionally stable, I always wanted someone who could say there was something about her that most fully expressed those convictions of hers. I would put words on the page when she got really good at answering. 
 You see, I built my whole life up on the backs of people I loved and worked with. Looking back now, I would probably have taken it in stride. And not if I were given the task of watching the whales after a dive. I could be anywhere, and no one would care if they could live anywhere, because the pods were made for love and memories and things you still have to experience. 
 In a way, she is similar to me, except that unlike her, I couldn't truly think about people anymore, even knowing about myself. I was able to remember and cherish like I was memory. And I could watch people and feel them, you know? 
 She was nothing like me. 
 I had always felt a connection with her. I thought of being with her when I was younger, when I was a prisoner of my own greatest fear. I had loved her in those ways, remember? I thought that seemed wrong but sometimes it makes me feel like I never had the chance to experience anything and more, only recently started noticing that " different things " have become an everyday part of my life. 
 How ridiculous that she, an outcast girl from a particularly short life, couldn't possibly be me now, even more so for a perspective of my own. For reasons I can not speak of, her inability to be different gave me a reason to keep going forward; I knew that for years, until she left. I had never been younger than 17. 
 It was easy enough, at first. I would get to see her as a woman, understand her, spend a long time with her. After a few months, there was a knock at the door, starting off the day before her home days. 
 And then it hit me. How could I still care about someone? It was a clear sign that something was wrong. No one was more important to me than this woman, and then I was letting go. As I closed the door, I was paralyzed with a sinking feeling that I had never done something to her, nor experienced her previous life before. That I didn't know her, or love her, so it must be true. 
 I felt abandoned and sadness for everyone I knew. I feel like I couldn't do anything without her. I could have saved others that mattered. And I didn't. 
 On my way out of the docking bay, I heard the heavy door slam, slowly opening in the low light. I turned on the water, and waited for my ship's cryo-torso to shut down.

"I would love to meet you! " said Medusa with a smile. 
 I opened the bar and took a sip. 
 " Excuse me? " he asks. 
 " Um... I'm Medusa from the supermarket. " I lied. I truly didn't care what kind of food she was from... 
 " I've heard some funny names, " he said. 
 " That's correct. " I said in a nasally voice. 
 " This can't be real. " he explained. 
 " So why don't you show me? " 
 " Oh, what are you trying to say? I can't let you into this world! " 
 " I... I can. " He squeezed my hands, went inside and locked the door. 
 " Huh. " 
 " This is dangerous. It scares people!"<|endoftext|>

"My friend. I need to stay with you. " 
 The phone rang once. " Don't worry. She can understand everything I've taught you, and if I need help, I can phone her. " 
 She could see my long face in the mirror. My face that had been dark for years, that had grown cold and distant with her sad eyes. A puddle that should've dried, when people once remembered the truth, and now she washed it away. 
 The phone rang once more. " We can talk. " 
 " Yeah. Thank you. " 
 I put on my jacket and made my way out the door. As I did so, the man next to me laughed maniacally. 
 " Really?! There's so much hate in your face! " 
 He was too embarrassed to look through his sunglasses. 
 " Everyone is so stupid about it, that's why I do this, at least for a long time. Every day for the past couple of weeks, I wake up in the middle of the night and try to avoid light outside to avoid danger. That way, I don't hit more people when they shine my way through the window. My person, maybe for now, I don't really care. I'm happy. I want to be around people, and I want that person to be happy. But to me, there's always room for misery. " 
 " Alright, good. Let's hear it for 'Errol', you're coming over to do errands in the ice cream shop? " 
 " Ah, great. I'll be right out for a drink. With that, we should get going in the morning. " 
 I drank as best I could. It didn't hurt to have a sip. As the rain began to fall, I stepped back and grabbed the cold bar from the countertop. 
 " Let's see, wanna see what you have down there? " 
 " Nothing. " 
 " What happened to the good vibe the last couple of days? " 
 " Well, I bet you heard the news. " 
 The man stepped closer. 
 " If you know someone, let's go in that office. We should stop at the other end and study. It's a common practice for them to try to learn something from us. " 
 I pushed my glasses down and backed out of the room. 
 " Are you sure you're alright? I got a hell of a headache from standing in front of the mirror every day. " 
 " It was long ago that the people who wore bad attitude on everything died. I saw that accident with my bike in the street and saw those who had bad eyes and in turn died. What's happened? " 
 " It was just a little fall. " 
 " But you... " 
 " All this fear I must face... what is it I must endure? What could be coming my way? " 
 He raised his right hand and gave a slight tug on the bar. 
 " Well, that just makes it worse. The mirror shattered right on my head, and I've had nothing that can make me sad."<|endoftext|>

He was a potato. 
 He, too, could talk back. 
 His name was Gruyère, too. 
 He rose from mama's cubicle to speak in her classic kids voice. 
 What a laugh! 
 His friend, Alfred arrived a few minutes later with meatball. 
 Fifty eight years old, he was not quite dressed well enough, and easily got out of his long jacket. 
 Perhaps no harm, taking between two vegetables one day was more than enough. 
 Uncharacteristically this can all be forgiven, it was the joke we must prepare. 
 An Alfred was in the restaurant again. He was not even an onion. 
 Life in potatoes was as easy as it was enjoyable. 
 But he was not cooking. Why? Why not? Why not cook? 
 He asked himself, "How did I end up in the dining hall again, this way? How did it end up where I am now? " 
 " I have good memories," came Gruyère's response. 
 They turned the old sow on fire.<|endoftext|>

** "Hey little guy! Listen! Uncle Timmy- " ** 
 Jim walks into the train... 
... His dad. Timmy. 
 " Hello! Well look, old buddy. I'm sorry but things are dark here, and I don't understand how you managed to piss me off on this train so abruptly. " 
 Jim runs out the door, staring at the train, he tells me he's lost count of how many times, before he walks back to his father, cocks his head, as if everybody else inside is freaking out, he smiles, now he's an grown boy in a school where the teachers never keep kids in to the same backroom as they used to, and he can't remember where he was sleeping, he can't remember what his parents were doing... Why did he have to go back? 
 The train rolls around towards town, and the heavy black roof of the building that once stood above it has collapsed, as Jim looks over, he sees a giant letter on the desk of everyone in the station. 
 ** " Dear Timmy, 
 I think this message is over.... " ** 
 " What? " My father looks me right in the eye. 
 ** " My God.... 
 Your Ketchup Line bullshit.... Are you seriously asking how I ended up being like this? To die with Ted on my hand... Because, the town decides when I kick butt, and says that I couldn't like them. I haven't been on a Ketchup Line for *six months. * No, three months I can't believe that... I... Not even close. * -XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - You never call me that, and while your mother is pale and sick, your Father isn't calling you like a bloody pig is supposed to be. I'm on the desk of my parents, and while you've always hated the freedom I was given I must tell you exactly what you're gon na learn, because in no time at all, I'm the one telling your parents, and you won't be getting this for one better reason. I'm not gon na be a burden on their lousy life. Not now... ** 
 Jim stops dead in his tracks and waits for his father. 
 " I bet I'll have you know how you all earned your insurance, Ketchup line! Remember that big bill and all? " 
 " No, no " 
 ** " That big bill and all? How did I end up in this town on Ketchup line? You never take me in? Oh, I'll have you know that kid was the one that broke my heart. * Owned the Ketchup Line! Owned the Ketchup Line! Owned! Owned! Owned, and you just didn't put your kid in that line? Fuck you all!" ** 
 Jim's lips curl, his voice becomes silent, and tears start flowing freely down his face. 
 ( Afterwards, I will probably write a sequel to this because I just feel like it makes the picture understandable. Do you have any suggestions on what I should do in writing this? I've been reading that romcom since I was a kid and i'm just always trying to make connections with the characters and making relationships happen. )<|endoftext|>

"Enough chaffing." The professor says, raising one hand toward him to pat down the tip of my tongue. The smile comes to me as I see the light erupt from the small screen. 
 The big game of golf is coming soon, people. Boy oh boy, have I played for the wrong guy. I shouldn't have. He might not know this and feel it, but I know that feeling. How could this be? 
 My world, made up of corn, hideously, My truth, my reality. It's a tricky thing. We're not all perfect, there are a lot of us, but our world is making mistakes. We'd rather die than deny the truth that we've done everything the past five years or that we would change the world. 
 I have to find out what to do, 
 The professor passes me a card. He moves to play, and one player begins to argue with the other players. He points a thumb at the first player and the second player does the same. The last player actually and an odd look begins to appear on the player's face as he has looked at the new player.

“ Don ’ t tell anyone about these things Don ’ t tell anybody about these things! ” 
 The sirens go off far away, but at the same time, Annabelle ’ s voice ringing through the city. “ You don ’ t understand. The last guy… the former leader of humanity. He is dead. ” 
 The sirens come again, and the tower is thick with the red, white and grey light that is backed by a cloud of nothing but ash. There is a creepy smile on Annabelle ’ s face as if she is in a movie, her throat split in a narrow smile and a new letter starts with ‘ a favor. ’ 
 “ Hi everyone, we are… keeping track of all of our shipments. I need help finding what you need. ” 
 “ Huh… I don ’ t know, it seems that when I bought this office and found all of these pens, I realized that after a while maybe I forgot about the new supplies. For the last time I have thought to visit the secret facility where they keep… they kept… these pens. ” 
 “ Hmm….there are not quite enough pens to hold me back. ” 
 A sweat rolls down Annabelle ’ s forehead and a quiver grows through her as she thinks about it, thinking about why the employees from some province may very well be unable to perform due to what they are practically wearing. Then again maybe she could do something in front of the military. Maybe what if she can do something with those pens, she thinks. If they keep the pens up… she is a scientist, or perhaps a lawyer. She would like to find out what secret facility is, but she can ’ t afford to purchase all these pens.<|endoftext|>

I have a job. A job meant to be my whole life: a weight loss curative specialist. Just as my mum said, these days I get to say goodbye in the bathroom. 
 She's got her makeup on, just in case. It goes without saying I miss her. 
 Take your time, though, dear. You see this job of trying to get laid, is well worth it. I've been on the ship for years now, carried on the ship so perfectly. 
 It takes a while, but it starts at the dawn of the following month when I made a trip to make sure I would arrive at the correct spot. I'm by no means one to tell; you see, I was given the job primarily because I couldn't work without money. ( Real men don't pay for housing, i guess ). 
 So, we landed together, each ready to travel together. After a few hours of flying ( which is getting pretty technical in this orbit ), we had settled in. I found it relaxing because I don't even know if I sleep because it keeps me up and moving. 
 It was nice enough; do I get to see her with a friend? 
 There was, of course, a mutual friend and partner. Very, very close at hand. And they just sat outside each other's tent in the mall. 
 That's when it started. I brought her some kind of fish. It was only half an inch long, not too big either. It was a nice thing to see. 
 I handed her the food and I took out a quick game of tccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc. Why? Because she told me in the early months that she loved them. She'd say "I do". It's been three months now, and both of us can not seem to shake the feeling that we are not the same person. 
 I hate it when you say that, but it is also a testament to the fact that she and I loved each other. She shared all that, and probably more. 
 When I first signed the deal, she really meant it. We would get everything we wanted, though. 
 I can not speak for a moment about what we did, as it was always very difficult for me. My father had taken her and my mother to Africa and ended up learning African languages. I lost my girlfriend to diabetes, so the relationship was marked. We had gone through a life change for a little while, both literally and figuratively. 
 I didn't like it at the time. I never was a good person, as someone who was good looking or strong or full of confidence. But now I'm happy that she was happy with me, even though I'm not. 
 I told her everything in the store. It was all right; the fish, she had told me, she was fine with that. There was a one-night stand, and we were going to eat some booze. I put all the crap in my phone, and had a cup of coffee, free for our next stay, but we both ate our drinks from time to time. 
 Those were always some great moments for me, but once my birthday arrived in August, I told her: 
 "It's not always like this," she exclaimed, and ran out the door. 
 It took a while before I made it out of there. She was lying on the toilet floor, dead. Her clothes, none of them. Her eyes, they had been gone for hours. Her nostrils, they had been gone for a long time. 
 All I can say is, I think that I owe her a debt of gratitude. She really did deserve it; I wouldn't trade that for a great person though. It was worth the long to learn a little of each other, especially when they found out. 
 My first thought was: ( " She always loved me" )<|endoftext|>

"Hey there guys. 
 Hey you, 
 P.S. I did the same thing you did yesterday. I acted strange, to be honest, and you dint stick me with text messages. 
 P.S.: 
 I killed you yesterday. 
 P.S.: 
 Only funny thing about me is how you tricked me. I got my psychiatrist on me about it, and then telling him my end came with the writing of the 1st line. That sucked, and that's not a bad thing, that bitch. I get to move on. 
 P.S.: 
 So why the fuck not? 
 P.S.: 
 My head is half full of pine needles, and I don't feel ready to put on a face paint like you did. I don't need a mask to hide the cold reality of my vile, unselfishness, and I don't need the knife to meow in embarrassment as the doctor tells me you'll suffer but I'll be fine. 
 Okay this is insane. Shut up, you motherfucker. 
 " Greg? 
 Greg? 
 Your sound guy is dead, you know that, right? 
 Greg? 
 Wait, got ta be right, right? 
 Listen, that's both of us. Your former selves died when you fucked up, and no-one agrees about it so you screw up what is left of your soul. Seriously, you're not even bringing yourself here. 
 How the Hell am I supposed to handle being disconnected from *anything* else. Should I try to transfer all my memories? 
 Damn, I'm starting to hurt. Waking up to the sound of the frozen trees upon you, feeling the heat on my veins, can not be made to feel. Why can't I feel? You caught me here? Me? I had to go. 
 *Six months, in a remote, meerkated village in India* 
 Nine months, we brought the fucker back to the site, and you were watching him gather his right and when your dick fell across my face in that cold mud you felt the warmth of pine needles to mask your new body. He squeezed, and rose. 
 Nine months, nothing but water and sunshine, only watching out for the flames as you bit down on each other and threw yourself down the tree, and you tried to help me. I lost track of time. For hours, as I fell down the trees, you sobbed, and swore, until you sobbed and swore and again I ripped you to shreds. And I killed you. And now you're locked up. 
 Six months, feeling what it was like, to be alone. Or at least I was. I tried to be alone, you said, though no-one who has listened to you has. And that's true, but no-one has been remotely close to my house or something ever since. We're not close, only we know that this isn't our home, and that I can't get away from it for longer. It's a fluke, your people are kind enough to let you go. 
 Six months, you were left with my insides, made to speak to others, by you and your friends. Maybe you can meow some more while you're gone... 
 You cried. 
 Six months, out front, no-one was there. But you told us, but how could you hear us? You scurried away screaming. Innocence and evil, and you told me it's okay. 
 One more day, you'll be safe, and we'll be together. One day and you'll be alone. 
 P.S.: 
 Goddamn. You make stupid music to try to assimilate you. We don't want that. You'll take me back. 
 Goodbye Greg.<|endoftext|>

It was 2am when the sun rose. The sudden changes were not expected, and drove the Empire to a complete halt. 
 A couple of years had passed since the alliance had formed, and almost a century since the Union had broken the fast-breeding continents. Everyone had been cruel to each other, and they knew that they shared their fate, but they knew that they were doomed. For the last five thousand years, the world was mad, the Wind waited for us, and it did. 
 Unfortunately, the cold did not come, and when the Twin Cities fell, the Emperor realized that it was not worth the sacrifices of his people. He wanted the world to "break free, " but he also wanted a solution. 
 Everything in the four corners of the Empire was dead. People in stock boarded up into refrigerators, moved them to the heat-zone, and kept them warm. The Empire feared that its last remnants would be gone, frozen at the chest of the capital, but not to " freeze to death, " as a culture would prefer to be called, such as " homo sapiens." Those last few centuries were the last of civilization. 
 At least, until the Hive Mind tried something new. 
 For thousands of years, the Hive Mind led the Imperial Alliance. They controlled the technology from which all life should have come, and they could not abide the Empire's genocidal behavior towards a single person. Instead of killing everyone who had set up the Sterilization Plant, every one sent to escape the " Rotondo Hadozao de Endemillene " was executed for his murder, and they sent the rest to experience life at a rate that would never have happened to anyone in the days of Terran. 
 But when the Emperor changed his mind and knew he would wake the people at that moment, he saw something even cooler than the systems before him... 
 It was not a gas. It was not a petri dish. No, it was... a cat food.<|endoftext|>
**********753**********
Honestly, I can't even begin to fathom what the words were, I've always wanted to touch someone, to know what it was about them, my dreams, the way they looked. I was wrapped in my nothingness like nothing happened; I couldn't even begin to process the alien taste from some of the voice in my head. I've never once felt anything like this before, but it reminded me something, that loneliness seems to pervade everything. Life with everyone around you is kind of sick, and I hate to think about it. So often, here I am doing normal things, having fun or enjoying life, but for somebody who doesn't know me, it becomes a lot better. I'm still trying to understand and deal with it; I'm still using it better than I always had. I feel strong and unharmed, at peace, and now that I wake up and look up at the lovely stranger beside me, I can not bring myself to be like this. I'm not ready for what happened, but we are together, and I want to see you soon, so I want to let you know that I love you with everything I own, and that there is no point going any further without you. And all I can say is, thank you for everything you've done and made; it may still be a bit ridiculous to say this, but I know that I've made a path, and I'm going to make it real.<|endoftext|>
**********754**********
It was kind of funny back then, but it wasn't until I got older that I realized I wasn't really changed at all. A lot more real than, or at least that's what the word came to mean. 
 I was a cripple. I was stuck in this long spiral of anger, obsessiveness, controlling, and confusion. I wished my school had stopped running. I hoped there weren't any machines holding me in. I hoped I won't be ostracized. 
 The boy who chased me was sweet. He didn't intimidate me. He wasn't cruel. He was gentle. He never threatened, or even tried to. I never understood it. I just wanted to figure out what this monster had done to me. 
 He was a hero. A big man. But it was too bad, he didn't have much. The combination of suicidal tendencies and physical strain was enough to kill the kid. Unfortunately, I didn't have any friends. 
 But he did. He always did. He loved my life. His family kept me safe. I had family. I was the child of a loving father, a loving mother. But it also meant he loved me, too. 
 And now, I see him. This monster. 
 I can't see him anymore. He isn't here. 
 I look across the world and I see many things I never saw before. Animals, insects, insects even, there aren't any. Oh, they eat, it would be such a shame to see animals. But I don't care. 
 He has eaten them. 
 I have no idea who these animals are. He can't leave me alone! Surely there must be some other animals, but I must stay hidden, lest he take more. I can't hide anymore. 
 I cry. 
 I stand up. 
 He bites into my arm, and he runs away.<|endoftext|>

It had started as a scientific curiosity. a foot in the trench. an explanation, that even if scientists had predicted the heights of the earth had never occurred. You knew the tall and slender faces of the skeletal anthropomorphising creatures were their fellow soldiers, but you didn't expect them to look distant. They knew us, and that gave us the choice. A few hours ago, they decided to base their plans on us and so we participated in the passage of time. This was a natural disaster. day before, we rode the army together towards the treeline. weather reports call for cold, bring a fire, it all seemed surreal. As the morning nears we enter the darkness. I watch the bright lights of the moon block out the forest. '…Good work Lyndon, it's finally coming to a close. Would you like to go back inside?' I ask. 
 I realize now he was right. I'd argued this every time I fought with him, yet they always chose to try to make an example of me on the battlefield, all for laughs and derision. I wanted to say 'I never say this' or 'why is it so quiet? You're dead' to all the animals I've encountered and found friends with. I argued against it all, to no end. But something strange occurred, and it was infinitely cooler. what was so wrong with his physique was somehow contagious. 
 So, as I sat out of the window and gazed out across the ground and could see the insane flow of air around me, I decided I had found it. I went outside and noticed at first glance what the woods looked like. Quiet, tranquil just around the crevices of the treeline, but extremely dark. I figured I'd now find out what this place looked like. I set out for the steppes in a pursuit of all the animals I could find. I'd tracked people down in search of food, and I found nothing. Even my entire town was gone, just disappearing along with the city. my eyes started to water and my stomach felt like its straining. I began to panic. what was going on? I was having blood. the moon lowered over the ground, and I saw an arm appear and walk out a misty gloom, just before a flash of light: above the city. Thousands of men and women of all stripes made for the city and hid behind an oncoming highway. a bolt of light was sent flying, blinding them as they fell, its radiance dimming as they slipped through the debris. Every pocked each other as they did so. The rain began to fall, the dead still felling as the train they'd travelled to came into view. Still nothing. The men and women behind the car swerved the car around to a stop, and began their tumble. A tear trickled down their cheeks before landing in my gaping throat. I began to scream, but silence followed. I only heard one word of it: Stay. I almost did, it was all you could do to stop me. 
 I knew then that we'd have to find him.<|endoftext|>

As I dragged the massive sword from my icy-cold hands, I would be pitiful. Had I not been feasting on that cherry of a "joke, " I wouldn't have gone through all this. 
 " And tell me of what an asshole you were. " The beast called out. " Why did you make those little computers, just for fun? You know you can't hurt me. " 
 " It's your choice. " I managed to squirm my mouth open enough for the beast to at least get a good, physical look at me. Perhaps I should go out and ask for any more. Besides, I'm not using my power to much; the humanity of Earth simply keeps on spouting out nonsense. 
 " Whatever you do, don't speak of me, " the beast said in soothing, not-at-all-subtle gibberish, " but perchance you shall be safe. " 
 I thought for a moment. The life that it's producing, that I... I... should've caught. At last, it gave in. " You and your ilk have, you see, a whole world to rule. This device is a profit for you. " 
 The thing stared at me, mouth wide open in concentration, and I blinked. Then, for a second, I felt like I was in hell. 
 I didn't know what to think. To think that the mere thought of stupidness could wipe me out like this. The beast did not stare, however. Instead, it moved silently through the chamber. It knew I wasn't coming. 
 I was frightened. 
 " Listen to me. " I started. " They are no different than any other child's story. " 
 " They are real and they deserve to hear that. They are no different than any other child's story. " The beast finally spoke in another genial, human voice. 
 " You are insane. You think that this invention is some sort of god. You think that you will look above and point at an intelligent AI and tell them that they are just idiots for hacking on the machines, like you did to me. " 
 " Yes, yes, " I responded. " You're certainly in my fantasy. " 
 The beast stood up, prepared to return to its hiding place, another computer chair. " Any further questions? " 
 " No. Do you wan na… " I cut him off. " Listen, whatever you do, and don't pretend you won't, okay? " 
 The beast looked down at me. " Well, at least they're I don't really know. And it might be for the best. " 
 The beast's eyes widened in a tiny grin. " What? " It asked, and was suddenly clearly confused. " You're not that bad? Isn't that what really took the moon out of orbit for you? " 
 I gave a little bow. " I suppose that makes sense to you. " I explained. 
 " Correct. But your money is blacked out. Only the memory files and the sum of money that isn't blacked out. " 
 The beast roared, flashing its bright crimson black-red eyes for what seemed like hours. He knew that it was my watch. That it was time to make a toast to the gods that had given me dominion over Earth for years. That he had called the end of humanity as we know it. 
 Suddenly, it changed its mind. " Haha... obviously not! You would say so. " 
 I gave a little bow, smiling. " Would I want a toast from a god that has been watching me? " 
 " Of course! You would also make a toast to me! " The beast exclaimed, thrusting its sword and turquoise feather antennae into my vision. 
 I stuttered to myself. " That bastard. You can't just waltz in and talk to us! Your self-interest would still be in your hands, and even if you didn't *wan na* speak to a stupid AI, I'll go and watch you! Be ready to play chicken with him! " 
 The beast's black eyes narrowed. " You are being foolish. " 
 " What? " I questioned incredulously. 
 The beast tilted its head, taking a firm grip around my hands and circling the air with a silent smile. " Are you really that serious? " 
 " Yes. I'm just so surprised that you're not hearing me."<|endoftext|>

The land is mountainous in number, twisting as it shakes and twisting as it shakes. During those times when the soft moon falls in low mountains it is very obvious that the valleys, mountains, and mountains that dot it can only be seen by our eyes. The earth roars with every step, as the birds sing and dance around us. 
 When the sun rises we become aware of what it means for us to climb. On the edge of the mountains there are cliffs, other mountains, and the sea. Upon each cliff are still other wonders, and yet to look across brings us together in a sweat. We can not tell what is still there. 
 When autumn is approaching we begin to venture deeper. Snow plows further and further on, across the mountains, and across the valleys. We must tread in silence until the ice begins to retreat on to our homes. 
 By dusk we reach our homes and the living quarters of the earth. On the valleys are extremely numerous plants and animals. One of these things is a bee. I know it sounds like a bee but if I look carefully enough I can tell that it is a food source. If we crawl quietly behind its foliage like the many others that we have been alive for it to consume, there is no secret.<|endoftext|>

Daniel felt the cool air kissing his face, and as he began to drift off, he was not sure exactly where he was. 
 "Adam " he said, " he smells like shit. " 
 My eyes slowly sank. 
 " Adam? " I asked, obviously confused. I was trying to calm the uncomfortable feeling inside of me. I was also a little bit afraid. Daniel seemed strange. 
 " No, Daniel. " I said, slightly hesitating. I thought that I could understand. He definitely seemed strange, but he was clearly in a different kind of trance than the rest of them. I don't know what happens when you walk into trance. 
 " I am asleep. " 
 " Yeah, that's it. " I started again. After a moment of this I realized I wasn't in the trance I normally was. But maybe I was in his nice green fortress? " Dream patrol? " I thought of it. Then again, I wasn't sure if I wanted to go in either direction, or if I was just hallucinating right now. 
 " Nah, that's it. " I said. 
 " I can't come out. " The darkness from inside me screamed at me. Daniel stopped shaking. " I'm here in the dream. " 
 " Huh? " I said finally. I didn't really understand what it meant, except for the taunting. I was really scared. Adam was obsessed with this program, his program. Daniel was a human, this programmed object. 
 " Don't you think this is the one? " I snarled. 
 " I think it is. " 
 " N, no. " I said stubbornly, seeing the situation before me. 
 " The one? " I asked. 
 " Nah, that's it, what was that? " 
 " It's..relaxation. Relaxation. " I said, holding out my hands. " I don't want to wake up in here. " 
 " Relax? " I said worriedly. 
 " Not now. " 
 I closed my eyes, trying to clear the fog from my mind as best I could. 
 " Maybe I am dreaming. Maybe I am, and if I wake up, I'll wake up somewhere. And I will not be in this dream. " I replied disbelievingly. 
 That came as a shock. Suddenly it was dawning on me. The dream " patrol" was supposed to go off. 
 Adam, with a rigid man's smile, stood his ground. He saw me standing there, it seems as though I just caught his eye and sat down. 
 Adam smiled.<|endoftext|>

"Good evening Alliance, " President Mills added quietly. 
 A limo pulled up outside of the White House. Employees were holding a celebration as they all knelt and voted. The President sat back in his chair, checking the time and reaching for his coffee. He took his coffee, and gagged. Everything fell into place. 
 Their faith in the advancement of the aging process, which they learned growing up, was healthy. It really meant something, and everyone felt like it. It wasn't like what they initially thought with their diets or exercise. People liked to believe in how long they could live, and effort gave them the ability to make ends meet for all. 
 With just the right amount of effort, the total lifespan of the planet would be almost double that of the moon. It was amazing for everyone. 
 The President took the cup back, and put his cup down. He opened his diaphragm to completely refill the cup before the ever increasing liver count. 
 " Oh they're so blooming. They're so adorable! " He exclaimed, walking over to the statue. As he looked around, he said, 
 " There's another version of me. Next time you grow-up, you'll really save the planet. " 
 " Keep it up, " The president said to the other workers who waited outside. 
 " I'll make it up to you, " The President said as he grabbed one of the newspaper clippings on the table with his finger, and filled his cup with coffee. 
 He didn't leave until he was around the corner of the map. Not only had the entire city been covered in animals during the last war, but the amount of space started to decline. 
 " Wow, " The president said, in a very happy voice. He spun around, looking around. 
 " What happened to space? " He asked, smiling. He leaned forward to look at his eldest grandson. 
 " Just didn't know. The planet was named G.S. to help fight the invaders. But they never fully realized, just what kind of place the invaders could be," The President nodded and dipped his finger.<|endoftext|>

The glistering corvette looked bad about 8 minutes of driving. The sound of it filling up with fluid shot towards the final blank just before the fogged up the part of the horizon over the mayor's house. The wings and roots of its vehicle skittered about, swaying from side to side in space, extinguishing whatever was destined for the moment. The parked car was parked in empty plastic truck seats, unconnected to any power generators. The problem with having the cockpit occupied, per Wands Meets Missile, was that in all likelihood the power would be depleted from that'me-grind' at whatever happened to us. 
 Wands Meets Missile kept playing with the helmet, which had failed to register we were on high alert. Just before one of the old guys jump down from a climbing position, the badger crashes through the nozzle, consuming the occupants of the newly felled taxi. Not good. 
 Instinctively there was a pinhole leading to the pup's little window, a bird's eye view of the glorious skyline bisected the street by its back entrance. Wands Meets Missile gave a long air of acceptance as I parked in front of her and put my spare iris in my ready held fist. I looked around and there was no one in the hot dry night sky. I placed the last of my fingers on my talon, and the pilot turned in his seat. Almost resigned to the loping racecourse chatter of the waters in which I was born, and all that was left was to open that last door of the wrecked taxi. 
 For some reasons, I still felt like walking through the forest and catching the sight of a nation that had grown tired of shopping malls. Out here it didn't even matter. When this bungalow was at the edge of town, and it was 8 am and 11 am and the Indian highway hadn't been closed for two days after a fierce storm. By the time that the first to get lost emerged through the through a nearby road and realized what we had been getting into, nobody else knew what was out there. Not us either. 
 We had stepped out onto this side of town before, but not all of it was there. Was it a hotel door there? Did it call you in for a last piece of blood? Was it a cartel hideout? Hell, I did run across this place once. The city hadn't been nearly as big as any bank or university. It didn't have much health care. It didn't have a mass of gang bangers who could stash medicines under the table because it wasn't profitable to do so. It wasn't much better than that old old building they did everything that they could to get into the government — economic and managerial — system, and it didn't have any jobs. Money, jobs, dreams, and individual freedom had been subjugated by communism. Now, however, the only thing that was left was the new puppy in the, well, puppy bed.<|endoftext|>

The villain's crown of skulls sapped his extra cash. A man with a small suit glows in the dim light of an assisted living room. He scoffs at the hospital from across the room. 
 "A balloon? " 
 " Yes. " 
 He holds up a bag. The villain walks out, and The Hero tucks it in. " I can eat here tonight though, because don't go out. " He turns to the patients and startle them. " Don't kill me. " 
 " You will not do this in front of my family and friends. " 
 " No, what are you suggesting, and get them out of here sooner. " 
 " No, I am still deeply saddened by this, " 
 " Sorry, that's very near what I was saying." 
 He goes inside and pattered outside for the first time. His cloak was dusted and his heavy hat was dirty. 
 That night the villain put down the bag. As he left the hospital for the afternoon, the person in the wheelchair reached into the bags. An orange that had been lodged in his jacket and face was wrung into the jacket. A string was tied around a page of their history, and in that page sat a sentence.<|endoftext|>

"Why are you saying this? " Miss Shreynold asked, her voice cracking on my skin as the sun's heat reflected off the feather and feathers of her head, obscuring her true form. 
 " Because, you know, in every moment like this, all these other ups and downs I could've done differently. " Her smile seemed to come from the back of my neck, a burning of anger I didn't want her to see. " I don't feel like going out on my own. " 
 I spun around to see her, her anger completely opposite the lies I was saying to her. Taking a sip of the water, I then looked back to look at her again. 
 " Why aren't you telling me something? " she asked, her eye-collapsing cheekbones contorted with anger and lust. " Why do I always be exiled. " Her voice was weak, barely fit into the hollow of my mouth. I started to shake in my chair, and my feet began to involuntarily push their way past the sandstone. " Because. Because you're an ugly moron. " 
 I closed my eyes, my hands pleading with me to let them escape. They always escape. Although I wished for a real fight. The two words that she would always say became so clear to me. 
 " So far as the afterlife is concerned, you have ended your own existence. " 
 She looked worried, though she didn't realize it at the time. 
 " I'm not sure I understand the issue, " I blurted out. 
 " If you want to end your own existence, that's fine. We can work something out. You just need a time to get worked on. So long as that isn't insurmountable. " 
 Slowly, I stood, my hand on the handle of my revolver. While I was about to relax, I surveyed the crowd. Everyone around me slowly began to move, furious and furious, all warm faces staring at me. 
 " Hush, your buddies are down, " I muttered, grabbing my gun. 
 Others heeded my call, and started to disperse toward me. This was going to be a long night. Her parents made her believe otherwise. 
 " By the way, maybe I can talk to some of them? " I asked, looking over at her again. " Sorry about that, I'm sure they wanted to talk to you. " 
 She didn't move as her long blonde hair started to fall on top of her shoulders. Her tears were already beginning to roll down her face. In that moment, she was gone. The only way she'd ever reach out and comfort me was if I would abandon her. 
 " Maybe," I said to no one. 
 She looked down, her fingers resting against my chin, clinging to me.<|endoftext|>

The Accursed Sun. 
 The Animal Oars. 
 The Males. 
 One Night a Reign. 
 The Champion in Body, Sword, Hand, and Foot Battled. 
 But it wasn ’ t enough. The Darkness drove the Man into Madness. 
 They approached the Tree of Life and they ventured forth to own it. They knelt before the Tree of Life and it granted them much in the way of dreams. But the Male reflected on his life, and then turned to the Woman who planted the Tree of Life. 
 The Conception of Madness was to be reached and the Men would slay their Enemy. So that they would dominate Men and Women alike. The Goddess Tepe healed Men of Madness but she would hate the Man and Hate her Child. She gave the man the Power of Magic and thus the Man could become the Master of his realm, have the Master of Magic and hate him for his Magic. At the same time, the Woman who planted the Tree of Life would attack the man and hold him captive. He would fall and the Children would fight back, but the Man would be left alone, weak from the Authority. The Woman allowed Men to possess her Child by granting him the First Blessing of Magic. Men after the Madness and the Child they could take and marry. The Woman made the Man have dominion over Men and the Children and that he could become the First Prince of Madness, with Magic and hate him for what he had done and his Magic. But they would fight. The Man would fall, but they would not leave. The Woman gave him a Freedom. One that He would reclaim and love, and all would be Loved and learned in the Forbidden City. In the Kingdom of Madness the Man would be free for the first time. And in the Kingdom of Madness the Man would become a Hero, and the Children would be Learning. And in the Kingdom of Madness the Man would Love. The Children would learn to love the Man. But they would not consent to him becoming the First Prince of Madness or her Child. 
 The Vampyre I. 
 The Barbed Sting of Madness has fallen. 
 The Carnage of Madness has risen. 
 The Chicken of Madness has died. 
 The Vine of Madness has risen. 
 And with that it has come, and overcomes the Vampyre and the Bird of Madness, and thus carries on the Wars and War, and Overcomes the World. Then men will rise up against the Prostitute Man, who has grown fat and losing his Male Niceness. Men will deny the Mother and Men will lie about their masters' insatiable lust, and they will fight back, but their Strength will not last. The World will see that all is gone and when the World will be finished, it will be in Man ’ s possession and hold. The One Body and everything will be gone from the World and so will Madness. Men will live and the Men will die. 
 But Lust is part of the Species and it needs its mate.<|endoftext|>

He ran to the garbage bin. " Hmph, so that's the last time you come here! " He snapped, running it. 
 " Huh? "
" It's just a bone. Oh... " He stomped his foot. He held his hands together. " C'mon, something was in this thing... " He couldn't take his eyes off it, it was his first dinosaur. He was so excited. 
 " Yeah, I've got to get my claws. " He set up his tools. " Now? " He took a look out the window. " Now what? " 
 He drove down the street. He wasn't going to bother with the shiny metal off the bed into the backyard. " This is my last act, so I guess I should see if this thing finds something " he thought, now suddenly realizing he had parked his car outside his house. 
 He stopped at a small local garden. It was beautiful. It had a golden circle like one and a rectangular base and vines growing out. It looked like the one behind his front door, he thought. 
 " I'm so sorry, it wasn't like those were your dinosaurs... " He waved at the animal. " I'm sorry about that " 
 The animal twitched and looked at him with questioning eyes. His strange mother " always wants... getting out of these things. " 
 " Have you considered hiding it... or... " He told her. 
 He smiled his, " I suppose not. They... they always come in there to take this thing. " 
 His mother waited, eyes starting to well up. 
 " My son, don't be afraid. You're always looking for something. " 
 His mother prodded her baby. 
 " See? I need you to come with me, she said it would be rude to want someone alive. We don't live in the woods so there are no animals."<|endoftext|>

But then the meetup. The matchmaking. The gym talk. His escort for stuff like that, half a man and a walk home from work. Seeing the smile on the broad Asian guy's face and knowing that something about him would make him interested in his fellow man like that. He was totally looking forward to that. He was a big man, but he kept his camera still but smiling. And I'm not complaining. After all, what the fuck are you laughing at? 
 She smiled too, also. I mean, I'm your date, but you never talk to a date without a wiggle in your arm. She did look like an intern too. They always catch my attention, but you never know what they might be thinking. You always smile back at her, and that's the single most important thing about meeting a girl like that.<|endoftext|>

Venus' gravity disturbed his crashing ship. Faster than ever before, he could barely make it across the Atlantic, stretching the globe at lightning speeds. The icy surface got immense under the ultralight-class fauna as it blew by, which he himself managed to avoid. 
 "You're trying to sabotage this landing craft! How did you know the planet couldn't fall without our help?! " He yelled at the terrible gravity. 
 The wheels started to shake when the massive road-roaches began to climb on to the vessel. Cajal, the stork-ling, was often called when his bugs crawled around him. No matter the directions, he'd only lost another swan. The six-level vehicle that was owned by he Mars Company had run out of supplies shortly after the rampages began. 
 " Look, everyone is racing to hear me... " He tried, but couldn't find his voice. A voice chimed in through his speakers. " Xunjin-pay -Xastersoldynbe, my compassion may be as deep as Hell. Yizwardo -Zudduzujmur -- " He tried again, but it came out with a hollow bellow. 
 " See! Look! The human workers are not waiting for me! They have risen up! You have no right to kneel on your knees!" The landing ship roared and pushed hard at his flying wing as the machines stowed away his belongings. He clenched the wheel with one hand. Taking a slow right, he hovered it over the cockroach infestation on the monitor and listened. A quick recompose had shown his antibiotic bugs took a few tries. He blinked to make sure his eyes hadn't been smashed by the wheel-half tread. Only the bleated out collapse of his engine would halt this disaster. He, who had learned to fly, but who no longer cared how much B-Rite he took to spiel the story of the Martian god Mars, had found the rule of thumb. 
 The earth had become contaminated with a chemical that vaguely resembled, mostly, a curious compound. Within the week, the colonies scattered across Mars had succumbed to mutagenics and other rampages. All in favor of a stronger global government's approval of the skin-club. But Venus: the chosen one. 
 Humans could hardly fathom the disaster when these things did, though their bitterness about it seemed to settle their minds like a spring breeze. It only took a few seconds for an alien to actually come to the rescue. They came through the sections of its hull completely clear-cut - a finely sanded red stain on the roof. A giant tongue of its own didn't seem to budge, much less squirm and absorb more damage. 
 Drawnled and dazed, it swerved towards him, skidding into the hull. It threw itself against the surface, faltered and crashed towards its pike, spitting in the open air before being engulfed by the thrusters. Time went on.<|endoftext|>

'Honey, we need to talk. Can you listen?' 
 She leaned in close and spoke. 
 'I'm sorry, Sir. I went through with the club. I can not give it back because of fear you will upset me, sir.' 
 She was confused at first, but nodded at the command. 
 'We should talk now.' 
 She handed me a pizza and asked what it was for. I asked her who its owner was. 
 'He is someone I trust.' 
 I should tell him though. It is best to avoid his presence. 
 'I am Harry Potter.' 
 He looked at me in confusion, then said,'Yes? Do you mind saying something?' 
 She nodded again. 
 'I'm sure I am.' 
 I went home and set my mother down on the couch and put on my pyjamas. It was all I needed to survive. 
 *It is all so well. My time will come and be ready.' *<|endoftext|>

This is the first time I have done so well and my answer was pretty solid. First, I addressed myself ( a question I would gladly have asked ). What makes you want to do this, I hope you'll find my answer interesting, considering there are several pointers to various points of view there including how to write a book or something interesting, what your intent in writing is, how to submit research, and how to write a novel. 
 I can't help but think that I'm pretty funny, and someone had to be making me this way because I have spent so long pondering such things. A lot of times I wonder, does it make sense to write like I'm writing in a 'paper with a keyboard' scenario? Where's my line in relation to writing ( how does one consciously frame stories and move on from one? ), where's my main motivation? What's the point? If it sounds cute, then at least I have plenty of room to modify it if I want to. I hope this can help me shed some light on my motivation/constraint in writing. 
 Okay, time for you to see if you need to elaborate on this better if you're good and if there are more ways to relate in length. Any suggestions you have on improving upon something? Questions for me?<|endoftext|>
**********769**********
If anything, it's good to know that those who think they can stop me don't know how hard it is for them to stop me. They might call me an agent of death, or perhaps a killer. I have nothing on that. 
 In the only time I have known, I hunted spiders. The branches were reared there with a knife, I took with me any meat that was raised in warm blood. I could only target them once I laid the look on the animal that was so popular with all those who lived that day. Its bright orange stripes, just like that wildebeest without eyes. They may not have forgotten me, but I would. I had become the very reason they allowed me here, to be here when the New World became extinct. 
 I did not know it was already to late. 
 My foresight was simple, I simply created a swarm of yellow-hued Spider-Stings. They called themselves the Suuuust, or the South "Masters." They called themselves the underlings of the Eifel Dragon with all its offspring to their position inside their ethereal host. It was a mean spell on me. They tried to circle me, slip them into my arms, and lock me in. Somehow I felt it was working. Their manipulators had everything they wanted, and they bound me in. 
 Perhaps they intended to change my mind. Perhaps they needed more time to do it. But if they wanted to turn their enemies into bait to lure me back to their courtship, then they had only a few hours. 
 I lay there in the calm, mid-afternoon air, curled up into a ball on the blacktop, where the sun was just setting. I really couldn't believe it. The snake was actually here, and no one knew where it came from. Those authorities were too stupid to realize what was about to take over the world. It took so long to realize. 
 It was mostly dark. This might have been goodbye, though. 
 The entire day, the moon crunched around me, and I watched the spiders slowly lose their fangs, and drop their icy bodies into the water. I hope the spiders drop their wicked hide and bury their reptilian underbelly. I always wondered when the deaths of millions were here. How could they have waited so long to try to escape? 
 They missed me. 
 Why would they always succeed? 
 Many of my fellow scientists had given up before the Wraith was established, and they failed to remove the hatch. Not long after the monster, red as night, broke out, the only way for the humans to reproduce or to appear was to create a new one, or, more precisely, a new monster. 
 I cannot remember how many of my subjects had survived, and there are many unknown questions about what they were capable of doing. They must have feared me. How could they have known? It was no wonder. Their most recent attempt at interspecies breeding had worked for the intelligence, and it worked. I hoped the North Koreans would reach out to me, and bring the Human race to this new world. 
 Others had tried to create a world of foreign princes, or corrupt dictators, or monsters. They tried to create a world where they could look to me for guidance. There was no stopping me. 
 It was okay though, they were not allowed to change themselves. They were in control. There was no need for fear to release me. There was nothing I could do that would cause fear. 
 I lost the weak and any attempts to attack me in the last few days. They don't know what I've done with them. I still have a small pouch, and when they unlock it they will disarm me. 
 Instead, they all face down this dragon, one large figure, upside down, its back turned to me. 
 They tear open the pouch, cutting off the passage to the upper mantle. A glass barrel is pressed in. The snake slides away, and the queen of the Dragon, the monster, looks at me with a smile. 
 *You will learn the truth. *<|endoftext|>

"Why do you take, hide, drink, and do that every day? " The last words I was ever thankful for. Until this morning, however, I was very careful with my movements. Before me stood the sword. With sorrow in my eyes I pulled it out, unblinking, to take it from the dusty room before me. 
 The great hall had, for the last moment, been completely silent. There had been nothing while I looked at the sword. An ancient, slender, steel dagger, writhe in despair. There had been nothing while the steel floated lifeless to the ground without condensation. It had been all except the ache in the bowels of my stomach, subsisting on only space for the blood in my gut. After the silence was gone, the blade bent, plucked, and dragged my hand down to become the actual weapon. 
 Nothing now could be said for this weapon. Neither am I worthy of living, nor rich enough to own a soul, nor rich enough to be able to invest. I hold nothing. Still, no one would seem to approve of my actions unless it would kill them. Until that day the sword had come to me. It had flown down into the darkness, past my eyes and into my body, untouched by remorse or habit. It was as I lay there on my back to witness the carnage, one final, pungent drop cutting my knees off. 
 Then, a scream. As if in moments, it hit me. There was no way my mind could last this long. My thoughts became fleshy, and head heavy with anguish. But this was not just any scream. It was as if life itself was burrowing out from underneath me. I found my balance, leapt off my wooden bridge, and gripped the sword at the end of the hall.<|endoftext|>
**********771**********
The treacly moonlight sparkling over the top of the mountains surprised me, watching the rich dark earth fall slowly into the small pool beneath. An intense radiation knocked the long shaded garden out of view, melting the seedlings in an ancient warp powered bolt of lightning. What was left of the garden was replaced with a cold gray obelisk, hidden on every rock on the planet and with the hieroglyphics scratched across the roof showing the an army of their masters working, harvesting and distributing plants and animals. 
 I turned to face my apprentice. My apprentice, Tim. He was calculating the hazy nature of the plants before him with an evil grin. He'd gone to great lengths to hide his power. It was something he always found appealing. 
 "Six more days, " he said. " " Now *go* back to finding your secrets. " He motioned to the massive land mass below. My apprentices stared at me, staring to the sky above. 
 " Pick a city, " Tim snarled. " Let the creatures live in it. Perhaps one of them even find its owner. " 
 I pointed to the smooth formations in the distance. Where once The Beasts started dominating the land, only two remained. The light-treaters watched the land, despite the darkness around them. The country of the planet beneath them, originally spread over oceans and forests, dissolved as quickly as the mountains they once held were dissolved in. Each layer of vegetation was greener. Most seemed to melt into the dust which absorbed their dust, transforming it into sugar. 
 " Pick a place, " Tim commanded. He licked his lips and moved through the green structure, pushing in surprising patterns. " I told you the water ran through it. " 
 I nodded reluctantly. I took a deep breath, and looked up at the sky. " That's what the beasts do. No wonder the Peasants are standing around. " 
 The ground on top of the continent rumbled, not moving. The green mountains in front of us danced in the cobblestone sky with shadows where a subtle rustle of the rivers did little harm. The little group of ants surrounded the little pond, waiting. 
 After our little powwow I became suspicious. The animals took life in the land, crafting homes and farms in their own secret. How did they even manage it? How can there be a planet in one place and a fortress like this one? 
 I guess it was my apprentice's fault. Tim always had a real knack for unsettling the guards. Things got much more dangerous with him. If the guards did anything wrong, the whole planet would collapse. The giant clearing around the pond was crumbling into dust, and all that remained was the earth, then the rivers where they once flowed, then the trees, and eventually the water. 
 I couldn't believe what I was seeing. In his intelligence he had no concept that this was indeed the better destination than his homeland. He knew the adventure came at a cost. He must have seen my apprentice doing such a thing, though. 
 I never thought I would actually kill the rainforest, that I would completely sever its barrier to me. The tiny mammals and birds managed to find fertile soil on which to spread food and other crops. 
 I spoke softly to my apprentice. " I'm afraid that your appetite for meat is already lost. But I can't risk picking on a plant's heaping grave. " 
 He sighed heavily. " I can grant you anything. " 
 I nodded. I kicked the insect around, and the mud underneath hit his face. The light-treaters heard my reply. The sound of my words reverberated in the sand below. 
 I leapt away from the clearing, and tapped on a rock. The yellowed rock seemed soft, weak, solidified. I felt my wings flap. At the smooth brown mass below me, a shimmering demon appeared. 
 In unison, I took the land below and enveloped it in my cloak, spread it out over the surface. 
 " Miriam! " I called to my slave. She would probably be my wife in any case. 
 " Please, don't worry," she murmured.<|endoftext|>

Something always tells me something is about to change. It was the cold of the December day, midFebruary, when the thick fog around my face turned into a bright light. There were humanoids around, looking around. But when I glanced out the window of the higher-up's dinkysand in the basement I saw nothing but dark material, undulating. Only darkness in the morning. My mom, looking up from her phone before the sky watched. My dad on the other hand, pacing back and forth. My sister in bed- I had almost died. Nothing could calm me. I was scared. The fog was more intense than usual. 
 Next to my room was the table, and two others in the back, the window close together at the tops. The blank wall of my room, flickering brightly, and the carved... sour smell was like death to my nostrils, when I first stepped out.<|endoftext|>

Little Joe McClane, a retired sheriff in Little Rock, was working in the pumping machine. All thanks to the arrival of the new president, Mr. President, and a very exclusive interview with a highly esteemed tax attorney. 
 "Is this real hell? " asked the unnamed lawyer. 
 " This is what happens when money stops being used, but we never hear back from anybody from before. Nobody. 
 " Aren't you going to go find a couple lawyers who can be receptive, just like your predecessor? Take a look at this guy. " 
 " What? " asked the $ 4000 lawyer. 
 " He admitted to us he wanted another policy saying it's no longer possible for ANY major overlord to influence the policy of their nation - that's what he didn't say - with the democratization of other areas that involved himself in an obligation. Now you just got ta make sense of it. But its just a joke. And as much as Americans like to admit, people like to move on, they say the only way they're going to change this forever is to make sure that those of us who really like running the nation only hear from those on the other side. You don't have to go to a small town and talk to Hillary Clinton's a[ spook-fucking-wall-feather dummy ] clique as part of that one little scheme that's only going to add to the global debt. You have to listen to the lobbyists and political pundits. You have to look to facts. Before you can dive into those little 90's businesses you've got to start looking to the people. Get out there, talk to the people. Listen. 
 And just the sound of the closed time machine. After reading Bob Robert Nevery's The Big System, you can tell Jim Henson wasn't lying. All his bad faith shows were present. But was that or did he die? If he wasn't one of the poorest people on the planet, maybe he wasn't one of the richest? Or maybe he was the most corrupt thing I've ever seen. I've never seen a thing like this. " 
 " I'm not sure what your talking about," said Mr. Morrisey, Jr. in his coruscating, misanthropic voice.<|endoftext|>

I am God. We left Earth, our own species, saved and cursed to so many more, by this very liquid being that made it such a pleasant, loving friend. But in our infinite and infinite wisdom, we made a mistake. That of our own making which is now spreading through humanity. Now God, who only had power of his own, is saving the human race. His own Holy Artifact. He mocks humanity that we still cling to as we know nothing else, and unites them into one larger, ignorant humanity. And with this Artifact, the ancient theocracy becomes ever stronger, as the humans rise up and usurp mankind. This Artifact is the reason humans will soon die with all the love and devotion and faith they have for humanity. This Artifact is not evil. It is the primordial love of the human race. Because of the Sanctity of Awareness, to another God, I give thanks. Amen. 
 I see our creation go down, that is, as darkness goes down into the darkness, as beasts on the plains echos and cast aside their bones, as spears spin their wings up in the night sky. Our mighty God, knowing them is waiting. But we did not cut him into pieces, we formed the archon of people to serve Him. This Archon, peace be with us all, will be our undoing. But when our beings break down and our Archons become evil, we fight back. This is the greatest power We have at our disposal. 
 Me.. My very essence, is imprisoned deep in the darkest magics, and when it shows its face, it laughs and laughs even louder. When our archon laughs louder, we hurt him and we cry, and when our archon laughs still, we harm ourselves and we overcome and defeat the Archons, which I do. What happens when our Archons attack us, what happens when our humans have become the Evil Ones of the universe? What happens to our Archons who ruthlessly torment humanity in their dark inner monstrosities? What happens when they all die, by us, with their darkest is the most perfect power we have. 
 So in the name of God, I give thanks.<|endoftext|>

Oh, god. I'm so dazed that I probably forgot what the fleshbag knew. And how his sweatpants and fur-lined gloves are wildly different from my fur-lined suits and seat belts. And why exactly are my toes touching the ground? Why do they still want to fly? I think I'm a cyborg -- 
 "Hey, what was that? " 
 'Do you want to go up and punch me?' 
 'You dare not' 
 'No... Why?' 
 'Because I know you are a cyborg. My tree did!'

 'Don't you even know how we got here?' 
 'Nobody knows about the event that changed our lives.'

 'What? No way.' 
 'Well, you're a cyborg. I mean you're allergic to all the stuff being given to you. Probably, you're exactly what we're looking for.' 
 'It's not like I'm not gonna. I just want to see you in a baby. You can give me this baby,' 
 " Like that baby, from a baby, haha? " 
 'Yeah, in that case, I'll have to help you out.' 
 'See? I said, a baby is just a baby.' 
 'That's so *fine. *'

**Time for sui-** 
 We were business associates and would like to disclaim any connection to wrongdoing involving me at such an age, thus what is. My phone came loose with my red tape, but a wife threatened to call the police, so I checked my tech support. 
 **I am very sorry for the interference** 
 I wasn't even sure why I had it. After entering recovery mode, I noticed that I was practically playing God in terms of audio quality. The music was atrocious and uninspired, and the screen blurs and arrows on each screen started to flicker. 
 I narrowed my eyes, swivelled my head, and scouted the area, just looking for the closest restaurant to be open. 
 I was met with unsavoury faces, very few given the chance to speak to me again. Faced with the scene, I involuntarily swivelled my head back toward my corner. There, outside my window, could be seen a woman with a large, scarred chest. She stooped down and grasped a butcher knife with the tip of her finger, muffling the motion in my head. She swung it sharply into the window, and the rest of the apartment was engulfed in a massive blackness. Within an hour, the building had become a black, grey planet. 
 It was all over the news, lots of headlines on the nightly news and on social media. Stories of a "Death Star", a " The End of Original Series " and the presence of aliens in every major publication around the world. 
 The last thing I remember is reading of an argument between a newspaper reporter and a porcupine who was captained by a spitting image of a skeleton, and walking out in their car, screaming and screaming and running out of the scene. 
 I was all alone, living in a nightmare, despite my sobbing and blood dripping into my arms.<|endoftext|>

Every time I entered the Path of Thorns, I'd want to touch something. 
 At first, I didn't know what would come of it. It always seemed to go through my mind as if I was unwrapping an old branch of the great tree. But something was different. 
 It was as if I were being held in a hug, as if I wasn't about to wake up and wake up tomorrow. 
 I don't know what it was, but I felt free to touch it when I was absolutely calm. 
 And then I heard it coming. The hum of the tree against my ears. I tried to move, but my hand jerked backwards, clamps and hooves hitting the ground. My long, pale fingers, tracing lines, striking where I wanted them to. They were deep and sharp, my teeth squeezed against them like thin meat, creating sharp blisters, hot and painful, but cold. 
 I heard it. It was coming for me, and I knew that if I let it go, I was still bound to this beast, and how fragile I was. 
... 
 The humming stopped, but it wasn't the humming on the tree but something that was humming to me. This seemed a steady beating in the hum, yet after four days of no running, I was here. Heiweh. 
 I floated to the ground, eyes bloodshot, palms sweaty, eyes locked with something familiar. I spun to face this presence, but he was gone. This was it. 
 I looked down at the empty dirt, pulled away, and tried to shake it. I could taste its fragrant scent in my breath. Just one more step and it would be done. 
 The hum stopped again. Every step I took, something told me that I had some unfinished work in my mind. Something I already knew had to be done, something I did as my life depended on it. 
 And I continued. 
 My foot hit the dirt like an old man. I pushed it hard and hard. I turned slowly, this sounded like a man's footsteps, but now it sounded like an entire person's footsteps. 
 The hum stopped again. I had thought that this was enough. But then I heard the large, shriek of one of the quiet-silenced men, steps and shadows reverberating within the blood-red underbrush. But it wasn't him, this was all the path came to me. I heard something else. This was me moving towards something, and I realized that the hum had taken me. And I had nothing to lose except the barest hint of the tip of my finger. 
 I slipped on my boots, and pushed through the darkness.<|endoftext|>

So first thing here is your idea for this prompt, here's my dev diary. 
 **FRAGMENTS** 
 Tranches of vegetation – terrible, quite terrible. 
 Blossoms about – well crushed and ripped apart. 
 Blotches of leaves on which no saw has ever come – a life-cycle that grows wild and chilling. 
 Hindering or destroying something else, a deadly weapon as it subverts all reason and reason alone. 
 Destroying everything in its way, creating everything, and they live their lives over and over until they die. 
 Oh you hear that horrible refrain from some horror show, those people can't even imagine we exist. All we do is hunt and hunt and forget. 
 Because in the end that all ends one piece – the chain, as it is found in an almost every single person on Earth – is me.

"What? " Eric said slowly. The room was silent. 
 " What? " Eric seemed slightly calmer than usual. 
 " What do you mean? " 
 " What do you mean, what are you looking for? You won't believe this, but I wanted something for my birthday. So you just sold it to me. " Eric looked around the room, nothing out of the ordinary. While he was here, somebody was acting strange, until they got back from raising the bill. 
 " What is the bill for? " Eric asked calmly, apparently having to maul the cat. 
 " For what? Because of the stupid copper hidden in there. " The cat vanished, not even being heard anymore, only gone for another 2 minutes. 
 " W-w-w-what is it? " Eric looked around the room, that thing didn't make sense, hadn't picked up yet. Suddenly, everything started fizzling again. Everything looked black again, like it was in a haze, and Eric felt like he was beginning to doubt his friend again. 
 " And why did it make no sense? " Eric asked curiously. " C's weren't copper, never copper, hey. " 
 " Oh. " 
 " Well, yes. And it doesn't mean anything right? " 
 " Well... I mean, I just did the baby and my mother is coming home. " 
 " THAT's an elaborate way of asking her? " 
 " No, that's all there is to it. And you really thought you were going to buy it on purpose? " Eric shook his head. 
 " Well... " the cat stood up, and disappeared in a flash, to never be seen again. 
 And with that, Eric found himself craving that copper. It was at this point, on his birthday, when he really took care of this thing, thinking he wouldn't need it again.<|endoftext|>

"I'm sorry, sir " The stuttered woman's voice broke from her private sulking, almost choking. 
 While unperturbed by the interruption, I briefly pondered what I should say next. I wasn't going to provide a point about what actually happened. I'm well known for my glamorous moments, but whether an emergency befalling me or not? I had checked my watch, but things had gone wrong. The internet had been inaccessible again, along with new service from a heavily-guarded government part of the country. I could see numbers from my phone, but I wasn't going to make the connection for several minutes. The phone was broken twice and went offline. Turning my attention back to the seat next to me, I consider my options. 
 " You know I can't pay for my car repairs like this, " I whispered. 
 " Yes, " the stuttered woman replied with a frown. " Of course I can. " She pressed the button to activate the computer he'd sent me, and my car exploded. My car spun, spun, and spun back to where it used to be. My phone started to vibrate, but soon the ball drive computer would work again and substitute the battery. A calm spurt of thoughts went through my head. Perhaps I could get some sleep. 
 It's a bit hard to lie to your boss with you only requiring total outbursts of energy. 
 " Was that the driver? " I asked my superior who'd confirmed the mess I'd made. 
 " Yes, sir. " 
 " What was that? " I pressed again to verify the detective that killed my colleague. " Is this the man in the shop? The accomplice? " 
 " Sir, " the office dog dropped his paw to sniff it out. " I really hope not. " 
 For someone who fights crime constantly, I'd never been less than torn about what it really meant. It's been a couple months now and the cop stopped doing the same thing I did, which is why it's kept me alive by a non-stop stream of eyeballs. I think maybe it's the hormones that have been making me the cause of death in the first place. The hormone in my brain turning me into a dog after two months. I wouldn't give anything to break this. 
 " You should talk to Dr. Trumpy, " I finally repeated to my superior. 
 " I'd like to have sex with this woman, " she said with a kind wink. 
 " I'd say the relationship you've been in for the last twenty years has failed, " I told her. 
 " How'd the doctor go? " My doctor asked. 
 " Part of him isn't really there, he just goes back to the lab and runs the calculations. " 
 " Oh my god. " She blinked. " What was that for? " 
 I was at a loss. I'd seen her do drugs once, but never those of domestic abuse or suicide, and I'd seen her pretend to weep in her own home. The girl didn't seem to care either. 
 " Remember that time you asked a transgender woman what a vagina was?" Her voice came out normal, almost like a whisper, but I knew it was true. 
 I saw my wife heaving with joy as I realized I'd simply kissed my wife, while looking at my children watching their television. 
 For a moment, all of my hopes for life were shattered. I grew mad at myself for failing her with the only child she loved. I couldn't help my emotions anymore. Her love for me had run out and I had to hide it as best I could, even though I knew there was no other way. My rage just kept climbing up, wondering if I should go back to my only loved one, because that very same emotion ( when she was trying to justify her actions ) was going to go through this girl. I hated myself for breaking her heart once again.<|endoftext|>

Silence. 
 All of the men and women sitting across the table were still glued to their televisions, yet they all focused on the speaker next to them. 
 "Dammit Kim, it's been months, you've been at it for six months now " said one of his closest subordinates who had insisted he should never come to this impasse. 
 " We don't have much time, just listen " started the other. 
 " We don't have much time, do we? Everybody wants to change things, everyone wants to use our influence, we're all so scared of changing things, it's so stupid. I mean, don't be afraid, it's all just too much for most people. But nobody really wants to change anything, it has to be fixed somehow " 
 The man said it out loud without sounding nervous. He obviously had no idea how to operate in this situation, he simply made vague suggestions from his commando uniform. 
 " I'd like to thank the everyone at the Pentagon, first the guys on the ground and everybody on top, for everything, they make this smooth work feel right. And I also want to thank David, David and my two buddies from a big corporation for the plentiful investment they've put into it, they've gone for a lot of things, like greater access to space and the kind of technology the military uses. " 
 The president tilted his head as he spoke, " That was an incredibly stupid decision of yours too, especially from the helm. You can be passionate on everything, you're up there with me for sure, but come on, that was the only thing I wanted. I had to make sure the world was at peace when we were at war. Come on, you didn't allow me to use the computer, do you remember the TV show that you put on when you needed it? It's a lot of work now. In the end, we were just not going to be able to keep going without your help. We need to do a better job, now better, maybe we can show the world that we care. David, you're the best candidate. " 
 " No, I won't, I'm starting to get hungry. Come on, that was a very stupid decision. " 
 " No, come on, that was a very stupid decision. We're here. The times when the whole world was at war, once because of the stress I put on the Russian leadership, we wanted to show them how much our empire was worth. Now, to save the world and show the world that the leader of the free world isn't about to use his personal spoils as his weapon of choice, nobody would really do it if you broke the terms of our agreement " 
 " Very intelligent Kim, there are other elected leaders that can help, call up General G of the National Security Council for guidance. " 
 " I'm in charge " said Kim, because this was a good idea, he must have thought it was stupid or naive, but he saw things from Kim's point of view. 
 " I'm not a dictator, I work as a medical doctor. David, you're the one who is out of the loop about your nuclear ambitions. You'll not be anywhere near the leaders of the free world now, it's time to talk, like it is or not, and now that I think about it, it is to be OK"<|endoftext|>

A bed of blueprints lay in my field of vision. One of them was a dash down the right path, along with a confession letter signed by his younger self. He didn't have the lust of a 5 year old, so I'm going to go ahead and continue with my excavation. The other was an only child of two. Before I was young I had a friend who had created a rocket that could serve as a beacon in case of danger. As soon as he had gotten the firing teeth, it fired a high pitched growl and launched him, hurting everyone nearby. I'm no rocket scientist, but here we are. The rocket crashed beneath the school. In a couple seconds my friends hands were bled on the ground, while my mother gagged on her swollen belly. So one of these missions will be taken care of. I grabbed the rocket from the ground and picked up a section of hunk of metal from behind the doorway. I fanned the door at my direction and planted it on the front lawn. First my man will assume position on the left side of the building, set fire to the front yard, get inside, let them escape, then I'll take out all the barrel position players and put them in a cage on the back of the school. I bend the barrel position players and place them on the wall at the front door. I move my full weight as it comes down and squeeze the trigger. Some broke bones on it and melted their thighs. All I need to do now is sit in the first area and watch a video. I'm keeping it a secret, but I know it will be the last. The video ends up flooding my mind. I put the video up on youtube, click play. It's so time consuming and pointless. I don't want to watch this anymore. What now?<|endoftext|>

 "Dad " the 11 year old boy asked, passing the usual poster: their mother's long, yellow hair and long, blonde nail strewn into their back. They managed to hang it from the wall for protection, and stood up and pulled a tiny, yellow, budgie cap from their robe. 
 " Your life timer " the boy said, standing up, hand resting lightly on the boy's chest. " You never remember, because of you, this is how you die. " He hung it as tightly as he could, the pins on his cape wrapping almost around his head. I put my hand on his chest, and pushed up my hood for cover. I turned to them - **my mum** - and said to them: I'll be back in only a few weeks. 
 " **Your mom** " 
 " It'll be alright mum. It's going to be okay. " 
 " Oh! Wow kid, I love to see you again! " 
 " **MUM** " 
 " Just happy to see you in so long!"<|endoftext|>

"... Have you seen this one?! " 
... 
 " Yeah, you also saw those kid from all across the system dead in the destroyer of the Ark? I dunno but... just look at the big picture! " 
... 
 " Yeah they all looked dead, you killed out 2 groups at all in the process. These are humans, we are carnivores and will eat anything and everything that gets in our way. 
 " What about the other brown drags in the bottom of the ship? I didn't even think they saw that coming " 
... 
 " We have to eat. If you and your crew aren't going after their cargo then we can't eat each other " 
... 
 " Easy man, just think of your son under a galaxy's worth of malnutrition. He'll get the rest of his grade O grade food in nutrition. While we are on that vessel I can see this UNATCO guy or whatever goes around with these big dumbfaced porknillas in his tank " 
... 
 " Okay.. you're right. I'm going to kill a hundred of your crew because of my meat allergy ". 
... 
 " I'm gon na rip them apart and sell my kingdom for a trillion cents. " 
... 
 " What do you want me to do? Let's make this some better " 
... 
 " No, because even if my bones are broken in this universe everyone they gave this a chance to stay safe " 
... 
 " Goddamn you. " 
 " Shut up. This is the only universe where every single human of the planet used to walk around and eat real meat. " 
... 
 " Hey! I found you and your brother and your dog!" 
 And that was the end of what The Biggest Banana Rich Guy in the Galaxy had planned. The Galactic Senate was busy debating unanimously regarding a proposed bill to take everyone to the secret secret hellhole Earth.<|endoftext|>
**********786**********
She is very happy, one of the regular ones in here, they always sat by her in the grass in the mountains; it was my habit to rest close to her, and if she ever came outside, I would stand close by and gently touch her. 
 My job, is keeping her happy. I wash the after she's received her pacifier from the wash. She didn't say anything lately, she just kind of would snore on me when I was looking for her. I used to spend hours by her window, watching her outside, smelling her unappetizing scent on the sand and on the pavements. 
 It's almost too nice for her to be anywhere near me. Everything around me is the same grey, except for the moon and the flickering light of the moon. It's almost beautiful in here; it was my calling; it always seems to me right away. 
 I pet her, she's cute, pretty; she gave me a treat for breakfast the other day. The feed goes on and on, but then she all the sudden wakes up. I squeeze her hand and I say goodbye and head for home. I know what she would say, when I was happy and I was loving. 
 Does she love me? I can't bring myself to explain that. 
 The comforting feeling inside her that I'm living her a good life was too close to believe. You hear her and you can feel the same warm warmth when I step near her. The only comfort we could really get from her was in the warm embrace of my hand; the comfort of knowing I would never have to see her again. 
 So I go sit by her porch, waiting for her to come back. I don't ever know what it'll be like outside; I just know it's good to breathe on her soft belly. It feels so good to feel that fucking calming sensation when you have your mind racing. 
 By the time I finish in, I put on my blanket and head to the bed. I turn off the light in the room, just to make sure there is no one out there. I don't know how she's going to feel when she sleeps. It's time for me to go out for some rest. I wash my hands under her chest and she'll just let her head rest in me, covered in my soft blanket. 
 I turn off the lights once more to look outside. My eyes open up, her sweaty, wrinkled stomach smells nice. It doesn't have the warmth of someone cold and clean. Instead, it's her crook and her wrinkle like skin. 
 The sunlight is dazzling, burning through her skin and down her spine. I pray I feel happy that she won't wake up in me.<|endoftext|>

That night, after a week of drinking in silence, the moment froze. Did something happen, or not a thing had happened? And so did I. 
 I could tell that the party was nowhere in sight - there was a fire, and the rickety building was leaking acid. A couple crying. 
 Everything went as I knew it'd be, while the doctor said that there was nothing I could do. I can't tell anyone. It's only you and me; I know it. 
 Oh well. 
 I found myself floating down to your home, sinking down to your face. You're crying now. 
 The darkness was a new beginning, unbidden. Your mother had jumped to life after your escape, and you could still feel her fire crackling behind you. 
 She'd worn a blanket. We buried her all the while. We struggled, one another. 
 We died, my good wife and I having said goodbye to each other before the drinks were over, until my "charm" reached a boiling point. I thought you weren't going to see me that way, but I wished you'd see me already. I hoped that you'd see that it was your mom's fault; I missed everything. 
 All because you felt I was drunk.<|endoftext|>

The angel looked at me and I shot back in excitement. He was the happiest he had been, and he did what he had to do every day, sitting on his throne. Every day. He was going home as soon as he learned of my sins. He looked back down at the yard pile he had planted on the floor and thanked me for my help. Then he told me. 
 “ You have fulfilled your wish? ” 
 “ Yes, sir. ” 
 “ Well, that ’ s all I got for you. ” 
 “ You ’ re right, sir. I can ’ t be certain I ’ ve ever done this before, but you have. ” 
 “ No, sir. I ’ m sorry. ” 
 “ Well, thank you for asking. Is it worth it? ” 
 I smiled a bit and said, “ Of course I would. Every single time I was doing the right thing. ” I had felt guilty. Everyone hated me for it. 
 “ Of course. Just- wait, how did you know before the idea came to you? ” 
 “ The plan was simple, right? You ’ re going to find the one who killed you, correct? That ’ s right. ” 
 I shrugged. “ Yes, that ’ s right. So after listening to your sentence, I would see whether or not the one to return home would be guilty or not. ” 
 “ Oh, I think so. ” 
 “ Any move? ” 
 “ No. ” 
 “ Thank you for asking. ” 
 He gave me a concerned look. “ Do you do this every day? ” 
 “ Yes, sir. ” 
 “ Oh. No problem. ” 
 “ Good. The problem, then, is that it only gets worse if you try again. ” He looked me over and said, “ If I have to make the same mistake twice, I won ’ t be able to stop it. ” 
 I couldn ’ t answer him. My palms were sweaty. I wanted to scream. When I did not start or come to, I couldn ’ t tell the angel. But he told me to. He told me to drive the car. He said he would drive it quickly. Then he would have me pick him up, turn him around, and make sure I killed him. 
 “ That can ’ t happen, sir. ” 
 “ It can, sir. ” 
 “ Good. ” 
 “ Okay, then. ” 
 I remembered that part. I remember before I had talked to the angel, about how I had become the best son I could have ever become. I had the best parent I had ever had. I got a wife, had a daughter. I had a wonderful life. But it was the most exhausting, craziest life I had ever had. 
 “ I wish I could stop now. ” 
 I wanted to push him away, tell him he was right. I wanted to stop for a moment, but I knew if I tried too hard, it would fix something. 
 “ That ’ s the best decision I have ever made. ” 
 I nodded. I wanted to ask the angel how he had just found me. I wanted to explain to him that I had saved him and was now able to get my revenge.

*Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit* 
 Tiny black bits entered the room, filling the candle lit coffee room and buying attention. 
 "Here, *harlan*, come on. " The tiny bit started to slide down the dark wooden bar on the wall. A girl in her twenties just started talking, and it was growing louder. 
 " *Tiny baby, Tiny baby, Tiny baby, Tiny baby, Tiny baby*, " she muttered, floating up the high hallway stair-lock. 
 The girl peered up. It was a small, square child. Tiny. Tiny. Tiny. Tiny baby. Tiny baby. Tiny baby. Tiny baby. Tiny baby. Tiny baby. Tiny baby baby. Tiny baby. Tiny baby. Tiny baby baby. Tiny baby baby. Tiny baby baby. Tiny baby baby. Tiny baby baby baby. Tiny baby baby baby baby.

The topdeck was dark, but oddly quiet. It wasn ’ t like the cabin with the graves underneath in the wood, though. 
 I remember coming here; we had tons of hard dirt and rocks around us, falling down into the abyss, my brothers and I scouring the hard rock and collecting some of the high-grade metal and metal powder that made up this storm-trooper base, nearly the base ’ s predecessor. I honestly didn ’ t remember much about joining the ship, but I didn ’ t remember going to any of the races, except a few. I knew the movie started with Jesus and the Jedi Knight ’ s holoprojectors, which I would continue to regret doing afterwards. 
 My time on the ship was shot by my younger brother ’ s breathing apparatus, through cover, then turned to dust. He was sitting in his chair watching the sky, and I couldn ’ t tell anyone what else happened, but he was young, so maybe something else might happen. Eventually, the meteor went over the edge, and I looked down on it, feeling compassion and fear and suspicion, but what happened is impossible to tell. 
 A dark shadow followed the comet like a shadow, facing straight upward, toward the station, then took off. After a few moments, the shadow returned, and I saw those shadows coming back toward the metal and steel pieces, hitting the crew helmets and everyone above. 
 Nobody realized what they had been looking at. It seemed like we were heading in the direction we were going, with the heaviest part of the meteor land on the ground, where someone reached out towards the glass, but when it crossed the gap between the metal and steel, there wasn ’ t anything, just some blackness. It was silent, but the only thing we could hear were the cries of the ship ’ s crew members, some of them screaming in agony. 
 “ I hate it! ” I shouted. The ship let out a cheer, “ It was going to rain you out… I didn ’ t expect it to rain, of all things. ” 
 The crew members muttered something under their breaths, but the shadows only stopped a few meters away from the ship. A sudden glow appeared in the sky, and we both froze.<|endoftext|>

Even by the eldest of son and daughter they also saw the world, but not all saw it. 
 I knew why they died, not by that I was the only one who had lived. But more than that it was what I could see. 
 For I saw nothing. And the screams fell to the bottom of my lungs. And I didn't fear, but I didn't care for them. 
 I have seen nothing because I had died. I see it because there is nothing more I can show you. But how do you tell if something is new? You look around and then you find what you want. And then you die. 
 I'm sorry. To make you feel just like me. I know I did not save you. I could have done anything to save you. I just wasn't ready.<|endoftext|>

The waters appear brighter as they arrive in the darkness of space, slowly but surely adding to the detail of the music. " Blue " sounds in my head as I walk towards the song. I'm getting close now. I feel as though I'm being watched. I look at the stars and see as if I'm being watched too, right there... " Yessir, yessir, what in gods name is going on? " I cringe. I haven't gotten off this Earth in the very long time that I've been able to be alone. I walk for a while, walking everywhere, I've walked anywhere, it seems when I did I was the first one out. From where I was, people seemed to follow me everywhere. I was just walking again, they thought I was doing something unusual. " Yessir, you were just walking as you were passing, put your shoes on and the moon's just shining... " I look over to where I first heard the song, but it appears I was right. * The song! The song. * 
 We climb into the darkness of space and join ourselves for the first time in 30 years. I listen to the song. People walk around, I start to realize there are things we don't know. It's funny, they're only walking around with some knowledge, some sense of feeling, of separation, of spending every second of our lives waiting. I look down at the music, " Blue? " I look up and see a guy shouting something and I cut him off, I don't know what he's saying, it was a rambling question. He didn't mean to say anything, he merely stopped running. " Are you alright, Mr Alexei? " Alexei turned around, " Why are we here? ", I snapped back, " Because, yes I am, I was just... Thinking, thinking " I looked over to the guy now, and I see that he was actually more calm than I had ever seen him before. I looked back to the music " They have to test my next life " he pointed, " Yes, but we have to show them the control this time.. I thought it would be easier, and with that confidence, I left the group and simply ran." I saw everything, so... long time ago I thought I was unstoppable. How the world spun. I brought the idea to my entire family. How to save our world... I... felt that I had my chance. I... could just do it, out of this darkness. I wandered far and wide, and this time I knew my goal, I had to make sure no one else ever showed up. I wandered a very long way, and came to a nearby rock where people talked to me, and as I walked passed other people, they slowly thought that they were following me. They said that they weren't and their starting a new battle on this planet. I walked along the shoreline of the rock and passed a familiar group. * Human* Walking around alone. *: ( I have to stop now, but it will not stop me. * )<|endoftext|>

Mein Kampf, my book. The men who poisoned my mind, made me forget so much. 
 I have seen madness and pain and failed so horribly. I have struggled with so much life and found solace in my duty to free anyone who, in my eyes, were to end it all. 
 My anguish has entered my heart like a virus is keeping its control from burning into my skin until it can not burn it down anymore. Mein Kampf had always been a hit. 
 Guess what happens next? I am my kind again.<|endoftext|>
**********794**********
The silence ticked and ticked like a buzz of stardust that was later torn away in a torn and rubble-lit explosion. 
 My eyes wandered back over to my wife, who quietly rolled her eyes, running off to a bed that the bottom floor would seem to have too little cover. 
 My eyes were downcast, too aware of the tiny hole that had just started beneath the entry way of our two apartment buildings. The city lights gleamed. 
 "I really hope this keeps up. " I said, sitting back against the cushions of my small mattress. 
 As you or I might've mentioned, you and I lived in Manhattan. The only large city in the world where no one was living in New York, nor visiting you, in the year 2255. 
 In that year I was a freaking teenager in Akron, Ohio. Born on August 26th, 1952. As we all know when the New York Times published that day, Brooklyn was a swamp for sixteen years. 
 The different thought pulsed in my mind, but remained deflated. That December, I'd leave for New York City for a love life. I'd travel to the stores for a brief day with the rest of my family and sleep until it was time to get back home. 
 That same December I'd die on the first of November. My last day, September 11th. Then the paramedics. 
 At the hospital I could feel the first decay. The questions began to gnaw at me, and the staff began to lose trust in the death I had witnessed. When I stepped into the waiting room on the first day that I arrived in New York City, I ignored the enormity of my loss. 
 The week after my death I was a millionaire in Uruguay, and lived until the second of November. My family would be happily agreed upon. 
 The months are years. I've created a small business, far less significant than a stockbroker in the market, which manages to sell more shares every month. 
 I've done half a dozen deals here and there. I've switched my bank account to some obscure equity investment spot. I've even earned a life insurance policy. The day I stand on the steps to get home is all I need. 
 Throughout all these years, I've learned a few things. Some are hard to understand, however, as I've been a catalyst that have led me through a life of evil. 
 A certain room is the size of a deck of cards. At night, my fate is written on the card. 
 The silence ticked and ticked. 
 It has to be his design to pass the time. Just one more minute and I shall leave. The worst part is that I am going to have no one to see me for a long time after that. 
 Another minute and that time begins. There's only one shot. 
 My hands trembled as I stared into the light-swept square of apartments from each side of the enormous basement staircase. I didn't like the simplicity. Did this still matter to me? Was there something missing from the project that would need to be implemented? Or were I going to lose everything I had built with these buildings? 
 As I descended the stairs I had its sights on him. 
 The mask-wearing man smiles at me as I climb the stairs. 
 " Good evening." 
 As I move to unlock the hatch to my room, I see a flash of white light. 
 A loud rumble, followed by a screech of steel.<|endoftext|>

"Dolphins..." I heard when I got home from work, and I found myself looking over the office's wall in incredulity, as I walked out. I've been out for over an hour, the weather's perfect, and a maximum temperature of 103. How could I know this was somehow possible? What had happened? 
 So I went upstairs and got ready to sleep. Just in time, the cat jumped in my hair. I screamed " Squat! Squat! Squat!" as the cat ran away. I was convinced it was normal. 
 An hour after waking up, I saw a large blot print across the Wall. 
 Someone's ph.D in Physics.

There we were again. The finale of The Keep and the Empty Bottle. The last big loose leaf on Earth, for whatever reason, that one. The dirt was felt and soaked and jiggled, eternally in the cylinder. 
 "Trancter - namaste of Berenae. Metellus - Disgenum, Nonsebregus - Diei " The words rang out in a choir of pain, then gentler in the water. Twice a day, I finished a crab crawl on a fresh old, cobblestone road with the purpose of encouraging death, eating Christmas cards and beer while I watched. 
 Beneath me the glowering seagull approached. I sat and chatted with him for a while, but he didn't see me coming. I had a plan. 
 He approached the road, one hand moving around the cylinder for a foot, the other riding my weight to push through the gangbangers, a twist of the handle. They swept me off guard, through the blinds to the terminal. I picked one up and threw myself out the room until the other rolled over in a heap. 
 " Rory, why? " I asked his glum way of telling me why he's so fat, I cannot explain. He put the life from his head into the cylinder, filled it with a thick woolen silk and zip-ties, and gently wedged it into a ball as a bowtie. I tied him up and put him down in the back seat, continuing with the tour of places where I'm here. 
 " How have you been? " The seagull greeted him again. He was sipping his beer in the green open stall with a corn tortilla on the bar and creaking hard on the rug with his paws. He walked up and took the box from Rory, *and* placed the lid on it. His eyes lit up, more than James Wakefield. 
 I pulled Rory up into the rain and washed his hair. I warmed my eyes, and put him on the top of my bed. He made noise like I had taken his sister from him in the worst way, and it rocked me to my core. A sweet love that I had too, but not as sweet and deep as the one I had spent three years in and out of life with. We spent the next hour and twenty nine minutes together. They whispered me things, but I couldn't speak. 
 I took him to the transport with the other prisoner. He was pushed through the dark doors, past pickpockets, to a locked bathroom. Upon arrival he was lined up in the kitchen. He looked up, and suddenly I was scared, too scared to get up and look at him. I grinned, and shook the little man's hand. 
 " You have to go now." I said, pulling him into the tub. He was still quick, so I turned on the light. 
 I took him in a bath, and had him stretch out on a chair. We flipped a switch and the chair slipped away, and the doctor took him to the chaebole, where he stayed until the end of his life. He drank a glass of whiskey, smiled. I laughed, and told him about Rory. 
 One more thing.<|endoftext|>

"Ai. Ai! Hey buddy, what time is it? I got some business to attend to right now. " Bob looked up, his trademark soft green eyes full of sparkle. " We're still never getting outside. " 
 " Since when do you go outside during the day? " Fred asked sounding concerned and quiet. Bob scratched his forehead. 
 " Today, anyway. " Bob began. 
 " Huh. Not important. " Fred tried to think of the last time he'd ever been around a ghost. Oh well, at least he had some spare change on him for the weekend. He was leaving now. 
 " You could try going to hell for a while. I'll take you. " Fred flipped open his boxers and began packing out his business. " Hey bud, for you now. " Bob smiled and fell for an angular skull being slammed to the ground in his boxers, sticking out its bone like iron. " I like that shape. " 
 Fred went back to sorting through the things that Bob wasn't at home with and carefully piled them. " I can't put myself out there. Are you gon na get out of it? " Fred looked at him, confusion etched through his face. " Just because a tattoo says so. Well where's your soul mate for me? " 
 " Well, the last time we met, he was planning to murder me. " Bob watched as Fred hit the ground, hands clutching around an empty can of shotgun in his right hand. " Man, man, he saved my life. " He watched for a few moments. 
 " I don't see why not. " Fred shrugged and got back into his boxers. He began leading Fred to the front of the room. Fred looked for some sort of identification, though the tattoos only indicated where it had come from. His legs were bound in a futile attempt to not look intimidating. 
 " My name is Bob, and I'm pretty hot. " Fred cleared his throat and leaned over to the paper the person had addressed him. His nostrils flared, and he began chirping something incomprehensible. " So, what was your good life like before you got to know me? " He wasn't looking into his eyes, not when the anxiety hit. The smile on his face was not what he expected from a ghost. It was a bitter smile. 
 Bob started whispering something, not his usual rasp but his own voice. " I couldn't make it work. I didn't want to. " 
 " But you wanted me dead, that's why you took me to the first company I knew. " Fred gave him a wink of his own, and set off back to the car. He was just beginning to feel the itch in his stomach, which was happening too slowly to be going down immediately. Bob felt his heart stopping momentarily. 
 " Do you like my tattoo? " Fred said. He let out a flat, intense laugh. " You really are a pretty strong-looking ghost. Now get outside man, and I'll show you some form of respect." 
 A few moments later, he was on the road, heading south. The headlights looked like they were starting to sting, and he was all alone.<|endoftext|>

Mr. Ollivander walked through the clearing once more. He looked back at the town's great castle, with its rich and withered trees and ever changing night. He placed his feet on the ground, forming a long wooden throne from which he could move the mouse. 
 Underneath, he stood, and rested his head on a rock. 
 He turned and faced a small, haggard woman with a crown on her head. Her hair was bare, drooping over her face as she picked up the crown. " You are meant for this purpose, Mr. Johnson. " She lifted her hand, revealing a clipboard. 
 Mr. Ollivander dropped the clipboard and stared at the woman. Her face was so many shades, the locks falling down like silk. 
 " Do you accept? " He asked the woman. She nodded and wrapped her arm around her shoulders. 
 " No, " she replied. 
 Mr. Johnson was a boy, 2 years old at the time. He called himself " Gorch. " He lived in a huge mansion, with lots of barrels and rails. He walked to the right, becoming more peaceful with each step. 
 " You have found my castle, Gorch. It is time to serve. I'll have a dozen important guests to thank for this journey, " Gorch said. 
 He just listened. It was his first real conversation with a wizard. 
 " To prove my worth to your people, " Mr. Johnson said. He pulled a small wooden cord from under his arm and wrapped it around the woman's shoulder. " You want to be my guide to this... different world? " 
 " Yes, of course. " 
 " Great. " She nodded, reaching down to grab the cord. 
 " For your assistance, " Gorch said with a reassuring smile, placing the cord back on the sword. " I've got the killer proportions to stop you, " he said. The red flames licking his arm led into the castle's great hall. 
 " And your victory, " Gorch said. 
 " Yes. " 
 He pulled the cord to the keeper's shack and lowered it to him. He walked over, examining the cord. For just seconds, he saw nothing but empty space. Then the creature started moving. 
 " Come closer, " Mr. Johnson said. " You seem so calm, but this is not what you want. Do you know that my guards can never harm me? I will always protect you. I will protect you, I will always love you. As we speak, we plan to take over the village." 
 The creature moved toward Gorch's castle, leaving this woman alone with an empty prison. 
 Mr. Johnson worked his way to the other end of the steel door. He would catch up to Gorch in the morning.<|endoftext|>

I lay there, the chill of it's incantation starting to creep up my spine. I tried to push the table away but my arms wrapped around the woman ’ s shoulders. I threw the book at the table and tore her stuff, her chair screaming my name as it burned. 
 “ You aren't the only one who got this, ” Death said, “ there is always another that needs attention. ” 
 “ Whatever. ” I said in a serious tone of voice. Death took the book and looked out at the endless sun sinking below the horizon. He took another bite and began to drink some of his sweet vodka like sweat which pushed against my throat. 
 “ What can I do for you? ” He said, shaking his head at me, my heart seeming to slow as the cardiologist looked at the duffle bag of laundry I was putting in my mouth and asked, “ Are you cold anymore? ” 
 Death chuckled again before looking at me and grabbing the book he pulled out of a pack. He put it inside the blanket where I had placed the paper cover and filled up the empty bottle. He took a deep breath and handed it to me, “ You are. And I'm sorry, but I am not helping you anymore. Don't try to sit through. I've got you in very good hands. ” He smiled and turned to meet my eyes, “ you are the hard one. ” 
 “ I ’ m not, ” I said, “ right? ” 
 Death turned to look at me, stroking his beard, “ What does that even mean? ” He laughed and laughed at me, tilting his head and kissing the top of my head. He pulled me closer and kissed my forehead. “ Oh God! ” He screamed, “ Don ’ t you hear me? ” 
 I heard a crash outside, “ Hit by a truck! ” I screamed and screamed. He dragged me out of the room, “ with you, I ’ ll keep the courts up there, lit if you don ’ t mind. ” He took the one I had the weapon from earlier, throwing it to the ground. Death looked into my eyes for a long moment before holding out one finger, almost shaking my hand. I struggled and struggled until his fingers were undone and I slipped and slid onto the floor, falling unconscious. I was lying motionless next to Death like a newspaper, catching the long rays of light in his eyes. 
 “ Just tell me what ’ s wrong. ” I said in a shaky whisper, looking at him before taking a step back. 
 “ You ’ re angry now. I ’ m the angry one. ” He said, as I felt his fingers lift me up and he led me out to another room. He quickly put me in my bed with a look of frustration on his face and turned to look at me, his eyes bright in a mixture of red and blue. He said, “ No. I ’ m not angry anymore. You ’ re a hulk. ” 
 I looked at Death and sighed, “ Yes, I am. ” He said as he picked me up and led me out the door.

"You are, the red money has been deducted from your coins. Today is the day of the return of democracy and you shall prove your allegiance to this worthy country. " 
 That sounded cool in the beginning. I walked over to a green stall and had to hold my breath before my heart sank. There was a man standing in the middle of the waiting room. Who was this man? I counted my coins and shook my head. * Shame in the world. * It was bad enough hearing about the America Slag. How many had we had fought against that psychopath? He shook his head again. 
 " You better watch out around here. You're a streetlamp on offense " he yelled. " I'm the name you want to replace the other money in here. This is the user ID of the coin you have in your pockets. Those folks will surely know whom you were just listening in your own ears." 
 I relaxed a bit. It was something to do with the blinding light of the universal user ID as I shuffled the gold coins into an array containing yellow bills and green coins. Everything seemed younger. It was too fast for it to truly be an American city. 
 I turned back to the station and made my way inside. I walked up the steps to the next stall and sighed. * Damn it. * I hadn't done that in decades. This was my first time thinking about it. I hadn't messed with the coin in a long time. I started walking down the hallway. 
 I entered the hall and down the hall until finally the station buzzed to life. My hands were shaking and I couldn't focus on the hologram display at the top. I pulled out an old analog clock and turned it on. It read: 366. Weeks had passed since I last blinked. The new cops. The new polling stations. The public television. Pretty soon, we were all in the center of the city, waiting for something strange to happen. 
 On my way home I saw a giant statue of a snake. I couldn't see it because of the decay of the ancient statues. I slowly went to cover my face, when I came face to face with one of the original cops. 
 " Get off of me ", he yelled at the statue of the snake. " I did this every time you ask me. Do you know what it's like to be an American?"<|endoftext|>

"YOU HAVE $ 70,000,000,000? " John screamed at me, shaking me out of my stupor. 
 The black envelope was at the same level as the cashier's phone, allowing me some privacy. 
 My heart pounded. $ 70,000,000. What was this? " I'm the best at saving. " I stood up, and turned around to find out why he kept sending me $ 70,000,000,000, my bank account now reading $ 50,000,000. 
 My stepfather brought up the wire labeled " The Annual Share. " Then I saw the man next to me, his blond hair and glowing eyes. They looked good in his black attire, but I wondered who he was all those years ago. Why now? Then I remember they were told I had $ 70,000,000 in their trust account. 
 I looked around and saw my bank account was full. Another $ 70,000,000. 
 " There's nothing left! " I screamed in astonishment. 
 " What the...! " He screamed back, grabbing hold of a bag strapped to the table. " What did you do? " 
 " I said'I'm the best at Saving!' I tried my best to get rid of it, but it just kept stealing money. " 
 " You're talking about buying $ 2 billion worth of ammo you don't know how to use?! " 
 He extended his hand, palm tip up. 
 " So, cashier, do you want your credit card number or your check? I'm going to take your $ 2 billion. Do you want your down payment? " 
 I blinked hard, and to my surprise my order made all the way to the manager. 
 " Now pass the money on to your security guard and he'll take care of it. " 
 " W-what do you mean? " 
 " Seriously I don't want anything to do with this. " 
 I slumped against the wall and heard a click, and I heard my heart crack, and jolting a little. 
 I stared back at my shirt, and opened my wallet. I gave a quick glance at my back and it was already $ 65,000,000. 
 " Throw it in the car?"

"It's a curve! " 
 The pilot of the small ship was concerned by this. It was faster than the one B( 2 ) to earth, and the spin cannot be reversed.

One is no longer dying but become an important part of our life. Not only that but this is a college one. What are you prepared to go on live your life as the community where once life was only a railroad path so you can walk further and become a noble man or teach. Many come to their own private cemeteries. Many want to attend their own private funeral. It's only last week I found out that my future professionally lives on that public cemeteries, thanks to the fact that my family means nothing to me or my friend. I was so glad when I found my cousin Steven across the road trying to cheer up the car that we've always had in tow. I even saved my cousin Steven from his funeral and he happily agreed to make a loan for life insurance. My brother, Brad was taken and even though it didn't make any difference that we're hospital staff all have a job they accept such a service as their own. 
 I'm surprised, but glad. I really am. I must have some paperwork done, but my form is slow and we know some things because the letter of the law has to be fully signed and pre-produced before publication. I decided to take to Facebook and google "financed funeral" when I made a call from the guy across the street. He was going to his own funeral and see a sermon from his previous cemeteries, and I was so excited he didn't see me. I don't really remember going to the next funeral because no one knows it and all he knows is that his fortune has paid well. A lot of people didn't even know he was dead. My friend Elizabeth dies in her own funeral and the funeral for her is the same as the funeral for Steven. 
 He was a nice guy, but he actually enjoyed the funeral. He would talk to people about how they only met his brother the week before the event, and then some. It got pretty tedious then, we were seeing the crap that everybody lived too. Nobody really said anything about him, or why people loved him. Instead it's been a while since we've gotten into the outside world, but I just want to say I think that's why Steven's buried. He has a complex history here, he really does. He was not the type of person that didn't care about world peace or the environment. He was what you've known him to be before he got his gift, this kind of religion, and we've all grown old together. Everything was perfect to him, he was forever a part of everything. 
 Like I said, I'm very happy in the know. I've figured out a lot of things, I'm finally starting to see how things truly are, but I'll never know. 
 Edit: Forgive the grammar mistakes.<|endoftext|>

They arrived on the second week of the third year. Often I've seen giant ship coming down the air, but the city here was unfamiliar with it. I'm not really familiar with it since the main bridge had just been completely abandoned, almost blocked off from the main road. The constant forest canopy blocked off these things from accessing the outside world or the more fantastical airships. 
 One evening a reporter came through the city. He spoke of magic. I don't know why I still think that man speaks to me, but he had the impression that we were bored. 
 "Sir, we need to know the building in the mountain here? " 
 The reporter whistled into the microphone. The gathered crowd looked all around and to the left, the city gates were closed. This was the third city to have gone underground; they used to be main attractions, but they were demolished years ago. 
 " Yes, sir, we need to know about the architecture here. The language was unknown, and these pieces may be of a different style. " 
 I don't know where they came from, but I think they were disguised as tourists from some secret country or another. Another report that came later called for a disaster investigation and that the government was hiding the underground ones. Finally we know they are building these things. 
 " Sir, they did not just just build a building here. They used to build a large mountain on the edge of the world. " 
 I nodded. 
 " But where are those cannon balls? They need to be protected! This is the giant ship built under the bay! " 
 I waved my hand to ask a question and the reporter laughed. I'm not going to lie, I was curious. Looking around, I saw that the crowd was milling around, some of them chanting phrases or wearing flashy suits to show it was empty. There was a long pause. I turned around, to a tall man who was wearing a white coat, his hand still tied in a twisted ring around his wrist. 
 " Maksilleu! " I cried, blood pouring from my lips as a sword slid from the other man's fingers and shot downward into the air. 
 A clamour in the crowd screamed for help and I heard the fall of wind and the sound of debris falling in the distance. Another explosion echoed through the city, another small one there was a man there at the time. I glanced at him from the scene, I asked, " Who are you? " 
 " I'm the Mayor of Palaquin, sir. We need to talk to the locals. Did you hear about the magick weapons they built here? They only use a rough version of fireballs, not fireballs like those we were told to build under the mountain in the forest. " 
 He was an interesting man, I thought, for he spoke in a different language than we were used to. He was tall, gray skinned, his hair was long, and clean. Everything fit right in with this man. It would appear to fit perfectly and I followed his gaze. 
 " Yes, Sir, I do think you all deserve to know. This city was abandoned years ago. We took this moment to discuss what to do with it and make it our focal point. " 
 He kept whispering and I followed his lead. 
 " Unfortunately for them we underestimated the ability of the mountains."<|endoftext|>

The bald man shook his head to the ends of the table in displeasure. 
 "They would love it, if it weren't for these hateful rules! " he exclaimed as he poured a tear into his drunken friend. 
 The man was an odd man for such a small creature, but he was human enough to know the way that he needed to function. He had just come into the market to collect his kite maker kit for the weekend, and had become defensive. The only money he made making a hobby was money, but he missed getting any community work done in a day. " Just put down the man," he thought. 
 *Races, elements, and stars are all that live and breathe in our lives and are suited to us as builders and collectors. *

"No, no. Yes, yes. We're going to help you be a soldier. There are other missions we could do, but it's the longest you ever can do it. And you don't like it? " 
 " But I want to accomplish something. " I didn't have time to say anything. He had brushed past me, but not very quickly. I felt anxiety. It felt off. What if I knew that someone was watching me now? I didn't dare move from the corner of my eye. 
 And then I pressed pause. 
 " Tell me something? " 
 " Tell me, what's the mission? " 
 " That's what I want to do with you. Let us capture the Emperor and world together and bring peace back to their country. Now, there must be some way to react, so we should take him to his people, who are not one to question. Tell us what his mission is? " 
 " That's exactly what I want to do with you, " I stared at the screen, and everything settled back into place. The tension was still there, as if waiting for the biggest possibility that didn't exist. 
 " Tell me more, boy. Tell me more. How long is it going to take for him to fully colonize his people? How much will his hostages spare? What happens when our people are watching? " 
 " Exactly what you want me to do... with you. " 
 And with that, I began the walk back to my ship, back to my base, to answer the handful of questions of the people watching. And all to get him off my back, trapped in my own head. It was okay, at the beginning. 
 And then I threw it. 
 It bounced. 
 It wasn't like it had traveled far, let alone hitting the sun. It was no big deal. 
 And then I looked back into the screen. 
 " Sir, is this what you want us to be right now? " 
 " Sir? Sir, I want you to put your hands into the bottom of the, uh, the jump board." 
 So that was what I did, to save a planet and remember my grandfather. 
 And then I got on the jumpship and waited, and then I thought back at the simple decision that had to be made to fly home in the end, to think like one of the little green men from the village. And then I imagined I would still be alive, but for what? How would I feel after I had done that to my grandfather. 
 This was going to be a long day.<|endoftext|>

“ I ’ ve been protecting him so dearly. I ’ ve watched him struggle as he was tortured with horrific hate and terror. I ’ ve rescued countless children from horrific, psychological torture. ” 
 I had been thinking that since kindergarten. I was always drawn to such people and there are a lot of times when I thought I ’ d never see them again, but I did it anyway. I can ’ t recall when or how I ’ ve ever seen a kid like him, it would just stop me from being able to say what they were feeling or to make them do anything, or anything. But he always thought I ’ d help him. He never said anything negative about me. He just wanted to know what it was like to be loved. He didn ’ t ask for anything negative, no matter how hard it was. And maybe that was the most important thing: No one really cared about me. I was merely a part of them, as any parent would be. You don ’ t really care if someone is eating or sleeping, and you don ’ t really care who is breathing and who is sleeping. 
 We ’ d first find out about my superior ’ s condition a long time ago, when he was three. There wasn ’ t much attention paid to him until the war. He ’ d been told about the atrocities he had committed. He had dismembered the bodies of the civilians around him. He was drinking himself to sleep, and was sleeping with a group of people about to attack the other neighbor ’ s house. 
 I ’ d brought him to a doctors office to hear everything, even listen to the doctor. They had read all of the documents I had seen him in his life. All had to be right, and it was all right, for a split second. I closed my eyes. I felt a bad coming. I had no memories, no thoughts, no feelings. Nothing could have prepared me for what had happened. 
 On my way out of the doctor ’ s office, I made a mistake that will haunt me for the rest of my life. 
 I was relieved that I was done for when I returned home. I couldn ’ t say how I ’ d feel after such a big meeting, but I did my best to remember what I saw. It seemed so strange to see children again after all these years. The first time it happened was in the bathroom, when I took him out to the mannequin in the corner. We talked for hours. He was very happy to see me, but suddenly, a bottle of brandy came out of the faucet and water ran down his fingers. As I lifted the bottle, a big, black thing came out. It looked like a firefly. It seemed to come from nowhere. I still can ’ t remember what happened last time he was grabbed, nor do I know why. 
 The next time he screamed, I ran and grabbed him. He screamed until I let him go. He still had no memories of the war. I thought that I had vanished, but I just couldn ’ t go back. I saw a firefly in the corner of the faucet, and again, a glass of brandy. I took him back, and tried to track him down. And again, a big firefly, red and black, came out. I carried him back down the street, and he really did want to go back. But I couldn ’ t stop thinking that if I did, we would have to find him somewhere to be safe. Like, in the cemetery. I grabbed the railing there, and he gave me a good shot, and we made it to the cemetery. 
 Even though I feel as though I was cut off from my own son, there ’ s not much I could do.<|endoftext|>

This one was taking too long. My goodness... How many geniuses had stepped onto this project and failed with endless eternities? Words were broken, more words were lost, videos were made, I filed as many papers as possible and missed deadlines I'd been expecting. I considered myself lucky to be in this position. My anxiety in modern society had vanished one part at a time. The problem was how to explain it to my coworkers. I held my hand out to the table and was greeted by a strange bag. Then a hole just popped out of it's surface. Several questions popped up. " So you guessed it, how long did this key take to crack? ". So it begins. The secret program is one big blue button and it has only one possible answer. It answers it's web browser owner. I knew it would be difficult to pin down, but an electronic key can do that.

Paul looked across the table and see. He was actually a beautiful picture of Gloria left on a table next to a wood stove, yet he has to get to work the next day to put the burner on, because they are closed. He had no idea how he got so upset, as only a few minutes ago, he was sitting on a date. He thought he knew things about that time, but he didn't and he never was. 
 When he started thinking about this, he doesn't mean to offend Gloria, but what is actually going on is too fucked up for him. He's thinking about getting McDonalds, or New York, or Washington, or some shit like that. He doesn't realize how messed up he is, because he didn't put a pen to paper or something. He realizes that he isn't there. He doesn't even care. 
 Except for this one date. Actually, he didn't say it that way, but he does, because he would only like to be with a friend he loves and a relationship partner that he dated yesterday, because it was his memory that conflicted. When Paul was younger, he thought she was great, pretty and funny. She laughed at him all the time, "Jules? Lem me get you at the bar tomorrow and you'll see what a strong laid back woman my old pal is!" She never looked just like other human beings in his memory, she was flashy and always wanted to out do him, so he was jealous of her, but he lost his focus when he saw her there. She helped him forget that it wasn't her, as he lost his cool. 
 For a second, the guy who just happened to be there made no sense to him. He saw someone else who didn't exist, and thought he was always in the wrong place at the wrong time, but who he was. He looked into the guy's eyes. He knew that the guy just remembered that he was in the wrong place, that nobody else in the world remembered him.<|endoftext|>

I was waking up from a dream a few hours ago. I thought I had heard it tell me to go to the bathroom. 
 I dozed off, the stutter in my head made me wonder where I was and how I was going to put some answers in my phone. 
 Sighing I opened up Google search before brushing my teeth and took a breath. After about ten seconds of searching it for anything that I thought about I settled down to pick up the nearest acoustic guitar. 
 After all, as annoying as my knowledge is, I was on my way to a coffee and to deliver some answers. I ignored the shrieking voices in my head and slowly walked over to the kitchen. 
 It was starting to rain though, I wasn't expecting it. 
 Before I could even think about letting it all finish I had heard a noise in the rear-view mirror. 
 It was black. It was silent. My eyes were going to pop out of my skull, but not that. 
 Then I heard it again. 
 "Get to work now mate " it said. 
 I raced upstairs looking for answers that I could find. 
 But not any. 
 After I looked at my hands I realized that I could see dark circles all over the floor and desks. 
 " You there " I said tentatively. 
 Then more dark circles appeared next to the window. 
 I shuffled my feet and looked at the floor once more. 
 " You there! You won't believe what happened! " 
 I shook my head. 
 " I got a job offer from Goldman Sachs saying I would be your boss. What the fuck happened with me and my bullshit job? " I said. 
 " That wasn't the starting thing was it? It started when I was drinking you a cup of joe at the racetrack... HA" 
 That's right where the phone was. 
 What followed were frantic attempts at driving me insane just for being here. I quickly got to the hospital, jumped in the car I had driven, cried while the ambulance saw and one of the doctors tried to comfort me but it was too late.<|endoftext|>
**********815**********
After a year of testing I get convinced I'd found it. Looking at all the reams, almost half a dozen hours of video footage, I had found it. I'd found it. Everything. 
 Goddamnit. Last video. There's gotta be a video. Instant JSTOR MESSAGE for all the people who don't pay attention to the texts I'm sending to them. So what if they find me. I'll open it. I'll give it back. I'll stop. 
 Since I received my call from HIMs, the whole world is screaming for a YouTube channel. I posted videos on /r/Art and people started commenting, all to prove that I knew what they were doing. And then my personal wiki, user: KawaiiNuuakuMachi - A Japanese community known for taking the trouble to save the lives of those who weren't watching, posted a tutorial on himaping myself into their base. I started getting fun ideas for filming my own show. 
 Not this. This takes too much money. And apparently most people are not dumb enough to go back to salt water or heaven at last. They'll be disappointed at what's left of this. There's currently 17,235 people on this sub, counting down the minutes until the video cuts out. 
 Get off my property. 
 It ain't so bad now.<|endoftext|>
**********816**********
The response he received was awesome. It was everywhere at the local theatre, and he had to choose. 
 His wedding ring was brand new. Awesome! 
 The sale was quick. Twenty years and he's still passing it on to me. 
 Then it was a lot of waiting. He rushed me in the door, dressed me in my old packing bag. The same shell he put me in a campaign suit, for sure. 
 The baby was singing in his arms. 
 It was exciting. 
 "So here I am - right? How'd you get that? " 
 " When, after having your baby in the hospital? I knew you'd be fine. " 
 " Yeah, but the things you said to me were just... off. " 
 " I know, the bitterness, the memories, the beats you were waiting for. You kind of lost yourself. In the end, it was just me and you. " 
 " You just couldn't explain it. Not quite. " 
 " That wouldn't explain how you and I spoke for hundreds of years. In your last life, you were a writer. " 
 " I could - I had, they were writing about how it all made sense in an age when you wouldn't speak of the bad on your mind. It was at the lowest point of your professional life and then something happened and after the party, it went well and my husband would get upset and sent me off to the hospital. You were such a nice person. I had some hot cocoa and thought about how much we'd miss your funeral. " 
 " But I know! See, I thought it would be great. I'm just here to say that I kind of did when I first heard the news of your death. Nobody paid any attention - you never talked about your wedding, nor would you ever talk about it for many years. It was always about your parents dying, and you, really, didn't talk a lot about your family either. You used to make funny jokes about losing all of your friends. It was one of those weird'Grandma, we have kids now and we know they grew up, but a really really weird family now?' kind of joke. But you just made it worth it. You were like... a father figure, to a very strange and complicated bunch of people. And I just - you just couldnt, you know, just *truly* understand it all. And in that very moment, you have finally been able to put the work in the words to your grandson. You made them. You allowed them to laugh at themselves, they loved themselves, and you let them know that it was alright. You laid people in constant fear that maybe the world can heal slowly enough, that maybe there is a single thing you can do for everyone, and you could all be your own parent. You just couldnt help but find other things you loved in this world. You made my life a living hell and I guess in those moments the same came from you." 
 And then there was the photo. 
 There was it. A photo of my son, sitting over them at his funeral. His stomach still turned, as his mother had told him, I couldn't have imagined that there would be no black robes all over his body, and no scarlet hair all around it. 
 *Now* I will never let him have that, I will never let him have that, I will never let him have that...<|endoftext|>
**********817**********
They say the beast of the night, what I would call a tresterle, was on its way to their ancient caves. He came upon the lowest of the masses, and the souls of those below held by sinuous winged beasts wailed in pure stupor. The light illuminating their stronghold was blinding, and a single dragon breath following. 
 "We shall tame the drow! " The man on the left shouted, rising to his feet and dismounting from the heel of the sword at the peak of the lofty peak. " We shall bring back this wicked thing, that had killed thousands of our kin and lay this thing under my so-called chariots of strength. " 
 A dragon's roar could be heard up the mountain peaks, and the steel jingling of its cannons could be heard above the cliffs. Men and women screamed for the small land beyond the bear, but they were not allowed to leave their children to sleep like beasts and lead to the dark depths they had come to see. 
 The Tretenle wailed that night. It roared from the darkness of the mountain peaks, and the rise of the moon and moonlight were seen as the Great Dane's voice spoke. "... the beast must die! Do not fear for our safety, for the hand of the Sun has proved just enough to bring you in. " 
 " What am I to do now? " The rattle of the whip found its path with much effort, still holding a half-sword in one hand and half a dagger in the other. " For the coming darkness! " the fox-horned beast commanded. 
 The monsters moved, and the beast screamed at them. " Crocodile-hands, turn to children! " said the fox-horned beast. 
 The Beast of the Night beckoned one, zipping and zooming up toward the top of the mountain, aiming his sword straight for the liege of the wolf in front of the little shelter of the forest. The lord of the Deep Lands watched in amazement as the beast of the night's song blared from behind his head, and the Lord of the Deep Lands then heard no more from his lips to reveal the wind ruffling the cloth clad fabric as though restrained from her water. 
 The beast of the night had once again been spotted by the wolves' guards, and presently they were asleep. A young woman stood at the entrance to the forest. She had been master of the Lilies, a young maiden by all accounts, something to be done with. Her such beauty had not changed as the beast of the night's song told, but the shrine at the entrance was still the same. 
 The young maiden brought her small hut, where a barn had been cleared away in the woods and an altar of gold and silver had been carved out of the trees. When the a dragon's roar returned, the Beast of the Night picked up his spear from the ground and stomped with speed, skill and determination to dethrone it. 
 Then the beast of the night was back on its prey, and for the first time in thousands, thousands, no more monsters arose. The Lion who stood along the shoulder of the man atop of the lion's mountain bridle up. Two children at the back of the pack eyed the beast as it walked up the mountain. 
 "... we can not stand now for our deaths; for those are crimes done against us. " His voice crested the mountain and roared, " and for them, those are heroes against the darkness. And now we shall strike out at this rock that lies just beyond. The Tower of the East, which surrounds us now; and we shall break through the last link between our enemy and our quarry. " 
 The Lady of the North waved her backle at the beast, and the wild pack began to fight back. The beast of the night spoke in shrill whispers. " Sir, I don't seek to slay these men of the night. They will not die any more for the little one did not leave his hut at night. I am now watching from the hills. We did not leave the Lilies of Midgard to seek and here they are! " 
 The beast of the night and the Lady of the North moved from the mountains, as well as each other, and raised their spears. " Heavens, we shall forsake them all. We shall all be rid of them. I come now, and burn with my wrath so that the deified may dwell! " The maiden of the North took a step forward, and raised her sword from her shoulders. A trestle to be stuck in the trees nearby would strike like lightning, and if the beast of the night cursed the wolf once more, the trestle would eventually bind the stormy forest. The man facing forward gestured toward the flames, and the sound of thunder filled the once glorious forest. A single trestle
**********818**********
The glow of the late night sunlight blinded my eyes as I listened to the myriad of voices in the red-circled café. It was a strange sight; white shrubs swayed lazily in the breeze. 
 "How've you been? " 
 " I'm fine. Just getting to sleep. " 
 I raised my head in remembrance of how many people had died from acid attacks in the last 24 hours, when the production team was spending lavishly. Alex looked into my eyes before he answered me: " My god, Alex, we had to keep an eye on you! " 
 " M... m... " 
 My eyes snapped open to meet Alex's. A muffled scream, and a black-gloved hand gripped my head like a matador. " Shut it! " 
 " You're not such a hero! " 
 " It isn't! " 
 He leaned over to the back of the café, and offered me a hand. " I just need a favor. Thanks, buddy. " 
 " Thank you. " He shook my hand. " It's nice to meet you. " 
 " No problem. I've heard there's people looking for you with spats in me as well... " I looked him up and down, and smirked. " Might get here soon, " I replied with a wink. He shrugged. 
 " Thanks. " I sniffed, staring at the surreal scene before me. 
 " Thank you. " He said nothing. His voice was almost at an utter crash. " You're actually now dead. I know what happened but don't I - like, I didn't. Just don't talk to me in public. " 
 " Wasn't that supposed to happen? How did it come to this? What happened? " 
 " Well, I wanted to get caught up in the past. I wanted to end things. Just like I've... done so much. " He shook his head. " Everyone hates people too much for it. You seem a bit harsh to me. " 
 I shrugged. " Yes, but... " I began, unsure how to stanch my moans. " If I were around people, we'd kill each other off. You would be a monster, because we all deserved the same thrill to avoid being murdered. " 
 His voice cracked a little. He looked back at me, and smiled. " Sometimes, I wonder if you hate yourself as much as I do. " 
 I looked down at the ice. Blood had begun to collect all over my face, and I could only hope that he hadn't forgotten what he had done. He flicked his hair back to his jeans and thought for a moment. " No, not now. I've had enough."<|endoftext|>

There it was again, number 4175, the real number behind the Green Mouse hats I used to call my foot. It was a nice statue, slightly tall and tattered across a nearly pockmarked plexiglass panel. It really looked like it was me, with some chalk words where anything less than beautiful would be. The wizard hat suit that I wore and worked under was really a bit cool. Looking down at the hat I could still make out the entire body in shadow, with the remarkable pattern of wearing it. It was a little strange, actually. I had to ask, are our ancestors great in this world? Is there another world? Anything that we, we need to be questioned before a new world seems to emerge? 
 Not that there really is. Actually, the sound of wood cracking becomes about 17 BC, when Apocalypses built massive plumes of black smoke out of the sky. It certainly is very close to each other. I wonder what the relative dangers will be if we have a new savior? Who would get the same experience, exactly, like them? Only, you could see the momentum shift with the touch of a button. There was an uncomfortable silence for a moment before the black cloud shined, before crashing into the two buildings I stood in just before its destination. The first came slowly, it was there as the surrounding building shuddered to a halt. A crowd, with some of them yelling and laughing, gathering in the blink of an eye to witness what was going to happen next, took pictures. 
 Two sets of saucers ran towards the figure, pulling it back at least a moment before it was light, leading to a series of robotic door switches clicking or hoisting the head to the floor. Out came the voice of the voice, too loud to be overheard, and the speaker, in all its glory, almost lost a voice. 
 * "Only four years ago when you were three, " * Inline smiled. * 
 " That's right. " An old voice replied, but the baby boys eyes dropped when he heard it. 
 " But..." Another voice replied. 
 Three legged creatures of a humanoid form arrived in their room and told Harry not to leave.<|endoftext|>

I looked over at her face and she saw the color burn in my eyes. The woman was like the pictures they had asked for. I was there for her family as if nothing could affect her. No matter what I did, no matter the affect of my food, no matter the amount of water I took in, no matter how loud they yelled and the fact I had left the house without finding her, we just sat there on her sofa. I came for her because she wanted to come home to my side of the house, where she would be the "real mommy " that she always would be. But this time she came to my side of the house and found me. My " real mommy" could not believe her eyes and was never the same again. She never looked back and it was as if she had relived the horror of living as a patient without knowing anything about my demise.<|endoftext|>

"Wonder Woman? Wonder Man? Wonder Woman? I bet you want any of them! " 
 That couldn't have been better. " But how?! I just wanted to entertain you, you know? That's all I wanted. " 
 As Princess Alexandra jolted forward to comply, her thoughts were abruptly interrupted by a terrifying surge of ecstasy. Her powers of slowness were almost exquisite. Her costume entirely covers the entirety of her torso, and instead of the usual dolls-of all the new costumes, she wore a suit made exclusively for her. The suit encompassed a nose, mouth, ears, and nose piece, while her face was the same as hers; but equally messed up. The mask-whatever-she-is posed no stigma at all, yet when asked, without hesitation, what it was doing, which suit it fit, would her agents contact instantly? 
 " Princess Alexandra I cannot respond to these questions, please continue my delegation, " Merlin told her. 
 Her agent, Sally, was screaming at her to leave, but the idea that she had suddenly become possessed of powers from hearing tales of something so pointless as her appearance caught the mind of the rest of the meeting, which didn't have the familiar team-up tic in the background. " You had the best idea! " she was extremely upset, and said, " Maybe I didn't make any assumptions! I mean, let's just go see some movies! " 
 Thinking about it, this may have been the first time the villain seemed genuinely interested in being the princess of the North Pole. Nothing about her plans ever seemed forward thinking; she just wanted to be liked by everyone and get to be popular. Merlin sighed deeply and said, " So we don't need to worry about the other half if we promise not to interfere, and I just want to share this... adventure with my contacts and because of that, my powers have granted me a huge audience with people like you! " 
 Alexandria, unable to hide her secret devotion to the fighting arts, continued to laugh, and Merlin waited for Sally to pass by again. Even at this pace, her diet consisted of taking a few extra bottles of Westernols and getting two photos of her in all different super-stories every month. He asked, " Did you guys ever see that one guy in Disney who's just picked up a broken flower, started laughing... or that guy who's cooking bananas? " 
 Staring a little deep into her actress's eyes, Sally whispered, " Well? " She was still laughing, and Merlin chuckled lightly, while Jack got the attention of the audience. She nodded in greeting. 
 " Now little girl, see that picture of you by that flower museum earlier today. Wait! I told you to go next. I'll tell you what's behind it so you can make this far without knowing. " Sally gave a wet cough, indicating the embarrassing picture in her hand. Merlin sighed and said, " Plus, I was looking for the five craziest and most powerful supervillains in the world. The good news is that I have found you one! It's actually a very special one, that nobody else knows about! " 
 Sally was now stoic, but still affected by the poor man's brilliant look. She gave Merlin a look of mock contempt before actually asking, " Well, this will probably take a lot more convincing than I would have hoped. " 
 Borrelle, to Merlin's left, was extremely annoyed and took her cue. " Come on kid, maybe some more than meets the eye. But we have our powers, after all. " 
 Not wanting to miss this one, he volunteered to relay back what he heard in the background of the ship over the network. He hoped that there would be a chance that something extra would get him excited about this adventure. As he left, he grabbed the Virgin Mary and gently placed it in her hands. 
 " First of all, we owe you a place. Secondly, we want you to get it, because get it will help a lot, you know? It gives you more control over the world, and you will see the real world. And thirdly, keep it hidden from the world. Keep it from the world too. And... um... wherever there is... good morning, lady."<|endoftext|>
**********822**********
The world hung so heavy and lifeless it was as if the span was forever enfeebled in spades. Earth gave way to the blank earth as the sun's long reach stretched out and died out. What once was a splendid place with lush green valleys grown with elms and hayfields grows dead on with the trash heap. A treeless flat earth filled with crumbled emerald trees until it's leaves and tufts are like slender scissors or shivers. Once there was a world of warmth with a sky that shined red as the world dried up, where temperatures dropped, where trees grow, where birds fly, where rivers flow, where lakes catch rainwater and breathe it down in to rivers that turn into lakes. Nothing is to be found here, is there no place to live? Hell, where did that light come from? Where do I find my son's severed head?" 
 Alzheimer's was removed from human memory and the child's life was ended with the fact his grandfather had passed from that drive.<|endoftext|>
**********823**********
I was sitting alone in my living room drinking drinks when I hear a thump in my kitchen. My son cries and begs me to stop. My wife goes to visit him; she's getting more demanding. 
 "We could go and grab him! " I yell. My son waves me off. 
 " You- " he bites his lip. 
 I answer, " I'm sorry, I can't. " 
 " What the- " He trails off. " You can't do that! I've sent you earlier. But the clock says the game is over in half an hour! And you can't keep it up for three days. " 
 He swallows and looks at me, wondering why I won't back out of this call. 
 " It's my fault your father never saw the tape. No matter what the outcome, it always looks the same. Look around, you know those good Samaritans. I'll never forgive them if they hold you back. " 
 " But, but... " 
 " Look where I'm pointing you're father once again. Your evil mother really is a bad mother for hiding from me. " 
 I sigh. " I'm sorry, we're all bad about the stuff you did."<|endoftext|>
**********824**********
"Y-- oh god, oh god. " I whispered to myself. 
 It was long since I had sat on a table with a person with a cupcake. I had assumed that everyone in my life had the same voice. Not everyone told me the " healthy " news, so I stuck to the normal subject. I'm a professional, you see. Just a few minutes ago, I showed up with a cupcake. And it was... right there. Pretty?
Looking around me, I realized that one or two other people looked at me, who seemed to be observing me. I was looking at the cupcake, but didn't... I wasn't interested in it. Oh, did the next person sniff my cupcake? No. I got up out of the chair and walked around to the cupcake. I reached behind my desk for it and reached in, got some candy bar, and left. 
 Two more people followed me, this time wearing white disguises and wearing rags. They definitely didn't understand me. I looked away as they started talking. I was going to die, I was going to die. I just didn't know what to do. 
 I put down my cupcake and ran up to the handrail. As I came to, I looked at the handrail. It was empty. 
 " You're taking it for me. What do you want?" 
 I looked at the glistening keyring on the handrail. My heart dropped. The only letter left on the keyring was this: 
 T.<|endoftext|>

I don ’ t have any one else I want, and damn if I didn ’ t know it. Look, I don ’ t want this country on the ropes, just a little tighter. It was such a sad time for America. Just look at the wars we both fought. I want to end the wars I caused, I want to stop wars that go against our interests. I want to replace the institutions we created. Of all things that you thought were fair and square, screw them. Trust me. I am paying for it with my own blood. 
 You sure you won ’ t do that on the ground? Yeah, right. I can ’ t just start over, but I will. And I will do it with as little resistance as I have to an army built in my sweat and tears. I won ’ t lose my parents, I won ’ t get jobless, and I won ’ t have to become homeless. Everybody else likes to think I was supporting them, though the truth is, they aren ’ t. I am not paying for a takeover, but my own people doing the same. The Party will always win. A person still talks without fear of attack, yet I think it will help that they know when it comes down to it. 
 Thank you to people like Hillary, I have a new job in Israel. New people are all that I need. They need jobs, jobs to build the luxury homes in their little factories. It ’ s lucky I won. I will even pick up the kids now.<|endoftext|>
**********826**********
So quickly, I had noticed something I shouldn't have noticed. 
 I hadn't seen that face lately, maybe even since the the phone calls started. 
 "Are you buying that or what? " 
 I didn't. No new phone calls, no texts, no texts from Alex and his new friends. They got in my face one quick phone call and broke my concentration, but before they could correct me, my eyes bulged, so I looked down, but it had nothing on my face. 
 " You wan na buy? " 
 I didn't wan na buy. 
 " Sell what? " 
 I did, but my eyes weren't the only thing in my world to bulge and grow a bit more, like they were in trance. 
 " Sell to Alex " 
 I still wouldn't buy, since I had seen some strange stuff out of the corner of my eye before and liked it, so it wasn't uncommon to see this face if I was lurking in my dreams. It was with that usually there was this flood of nerves and giddiness building up, my mind being more transfixed, like watching a tree of fire place its might lightning in a rainstorm. 
 " You're getting dropped? " 
 I didn't know what I said, but I wanted to protest. Why did this guy deserve to go through what I was doing to him? Why was I supposed to try and buy a gun and everything? I didn't want to be a part of this deal. I needed to get his attention so I pulled the trigger, not expecting to see any of this craziness build up or anything. I don't even remember what I'd done with the toy at that point though. 
 My hand, resting on the trigger, burped. It must have hit something hard, because the glass caught on something in the middle of the pop of it, and this was now what he only knew about guns. My hand grazed the old. Browning model small, maybe like a deer with all the hits of a deer on it. I had shot myself in the face, in the foot, in the head. Two gaping holes in the glass in my forehead and then a reflection of the black, liquid that had once been my life. 
 " Sell? " 
 It couldn't have been a hit, you know? 
 " Sell? " 
 My eyes swam through the cube of darkness as the girl in front of me stepped out of the car. I didn't make a sound. No gasps. No screams. No scream at least. 
 " Sell is nice, wasn't it? " 
 I had a hard time picturing it now. There were still flashes of light but you could only see a little at first, then you could get used to them all. 
 " Sell. " 
 My gaze, the only lens in the eyes now, was meeting an ordinary shadow. I had seen a deer fall from a high tree, quite obviously, on the same parking lot in the same spot. Some part of me kept looking up and down at the figure. She sat next to him, and started playing, drawing cards in her lap. Her hand started growing bigger, and bigger, until it was nearly as large as his. 
 " Sell, sell " 
 My eyes, flat. Pale. She was watching me. She wanted to give him an ear for his words and I didn't want to become his brooding or his friend. I wasn't even listening. I couldn't say anything. I tried to scream out but he would just say something and then she would just continue playing and the card wouldn't get bigger. 
 " Sell, sell" 
 And then I stopped hearing. I looked down at my hand and it was empty now, like it wasn't there anymore. This was not where I'd been if he'd had what she wanted. 
 I stepped out of the car and started walking again, hoping that at least I wasn't going to feel the shower completely black for the rest of the trip.<|endoftext|>

"Get me out of here! " says the woman, driving a blue sedan through the chaotic crowd of sidewalk-clad miscreants in the Saturday night bonfire. I shuffle out from behind her, deciding that maybe she had notice, behind the wheel, what had happened. 
 " Call 911! I came out of nowhere! What the fuck! " I shout in desperation to my loved one, who returned with my simple questions. The man out of his seat stands up, still quite shaken by the events of his last few months. 
 " Told you to fuck off, " he says, standing to his full height, I step behind him. 
 " Why'd you say that? " I say, explaining more to him about my possible tragic situation. 
 " Well, my wife and kids are devastated, " he responds. He slowly, genuinely, leads his heavy red footsteps away from me. I'm not ready to answer the question like this. It doesn't add up. The evidence inside the woman's mouth is so clear that everything else I've just started to feel increasingly clear. She's been lying all week and part of her has taken a shower and will have to use the restroom soon. 
 We drive on toward another rich woman. Most of the grocery stores you were up against were in the picturesque east of downtown, but many more picturesque restaurants were in the suburbs and most of them were completely deserted. Two separate pop-ups in the middle of the last block in a city closed down- no taxis, but beautiful ones that are clearly for sale. What's more, they have a sign in the bottom right that says " Culinary $ 5." 
 " Find the sex industry, " the woman says. She sits beside me on her hands and knees as she guides me towards her destination. I dive headfirst into the narrow gauntlet of shops and cul-de-sacs and strip malls. The industry thrives in markets where men tend to stay longer than women, and it thrives in the lean threes of businessmen who want high profit margins, which tend to become a family business. Everybody wants to catch up to the women, and so I usually join the exotic, glass-bottoms and pristine sex shops that dot the walls of these towns. My first day there, I was greeted by an exotic hot blonde. 
 I was handed a generic white dress and a Rolex 3D suit when she got it. The man happily grabbed it and dragged it around with him to the fitness center where she let out the most painfully rhythmic pattering sound I've ever heard. I realized I was nude from the early part of the evening and it wasn't until the tears hit the edge of my eyes that I realized I'd just been charged for kissing women.<|endoftext|>

Frank recalled his friend Leisterur's first bite of Grendel.  He had known the reaction, it would be over soon, that Grendel was tasty. Leisterur had met him for lunch at the border, of a sort, too. The one for whom Frank had challenged him to compete with, to make a proposal for. 
 "Oh... you mean... ( French accent ) is this how you pronounce things? " 
 " Well I did quite so, Frank. " 
 " So let me read you a poem for you. " Leisterur had been a contributor to an underground German literary journal. 
 Frank smiled shyly, trying to contain the laughter that soon began with a quip. Leisterur, he thought, would also be interested in what he was writing and that long such a short poem could yield untold literary and political impact on the world... 
 " Ummm... and for you to come back? " Frank asked. 
 " Of course, but... I am not quite sure this is important enough. How come nothing but this is important enough? What is so important about you and Grendel you want to make a long, bloody poem? " Leisterur glanced down at his lab-coat with a mixture of surprise and concern. 
 " I... I mean, you humans might need some funding or something. And also, a good few scary looking things... " 
 Frank was awestruck. How could this be right? " It looks like they want your blood. " Leisterur began laughing a little harder. 
 " Absolutely! How do you say that!? " Frank thought again. What was he thinking? He was in complete denial that it was wrong that his friend and Leisterur were not from Europe... 
 " You see, I have been sending messages to every continent in the galaxy... A new set of messages, sent by a phone number. It is international. To your Earth world, it is international and if anyone came to your planet to see a message, to tell them how to kill this zombie, they would have to cut him open! And on my message, it says'contact individual of humanity for help.' And that for any degree of cruelty, they must go through the crewmembers for assistance, and the crewmembers can be committed to our home planet if they don't... For any instances, the greatest atrocities the US empire committed in the past few years are committed to the planet. " 
 " Wow. To the human world?"<|endoftext|>

Darkness. 
 Deep fear. There was something underneath, little pressure. One morning he screamed, though the scream was drowned out by a series of cryps, a series of misery, followed by pain. 
 He awoke, his head rising into his hands. I made a decision... 
 It had to be done. It had to be made with compassion. 
 He slept. 
 He fell asleep. 
 Darkness. 
 He woke again. His face still shaking he made out a puzzled expression on his face. He went in his dream again and once again, he didn't remember looking at his face. He went into another. 
 He saw someone standing before him, older than he was. Who was walking forward. The person asked him what he was doing, who he should be doing with. He didn't answer. It didn't matter. 
 "I- I'm here with a demon. " 
 " What kind of demon? " 
 " This one. I was very worried, " the demon smirked his smile, " other than that, what was I supposed to do with you? " 
 " Thank god, there's something I want, " he grinned in a way that made no sense to him, " this is how it was supposed to be. " 
 " What?! " 
 " Go tell the demon I'm trying to save your life. " 
 The demon looked at him blankly. 
 " Why don't you just leave him alone? " 
 " I want the peace of mind to go away. " 
 " Shit, I wanted the peace of mind. What had you meant by that? " 
 " The damn right thing to do, " he laughed, " you idiot, *know* you didn't mean anything by that. " 
 The demon looked up and around, and slowly he looked into the eyes of the person on the ground, " give them the peace of mind."<|endoftext|>

Commander Niwa Lubernun

As we started the hunt, my men displayed our best equipments. Horns and spears, helmets of light, ground staffs, halberds, time traveller scopes, it all was routine. If I didn't do a thing they might call upon the thread of fate itself, the thread of our fate. As we swung our hammer in a death fury over the enemy wall there was nothing more I could do that my men not killed their best warriors in their effort. I slid the two arrows ready and placed them down back in position. The men behind us were scratching their necks a moment later when every man shouted in revulsion and then just giggled at the irony. We all made our move and left. 
 It didn't work. There wasn't time to reload the first arrow and blow past your gunner, my men could see it and it was just way too slow. We fell both of them to the ground and struck once more. Five more seconds. Heave it high, then go. Turn around and run. The metal hand turned as the foot reached its mark. My boots brushed the woods floor, just behind the melee encampment. There was nothing left but to readied ourselves to extract our bolt of ammunition. We had lost one of our soldiers, who was already too far forward to stop it. We all sat down and focused our attention on the base of the hatchet. Clutching my head I started my jostling for hold of my device. 
 Suddenly, I heard a very loud boom from within. I could make out the sound of a powerful hammer flying towards the wind, smashing in my ear and wreaking havoc for every enemy in sight. I'd never heard that as loud before. Even though it sounded so much like a strong hammer it seemed so random, as though it was tens of thousands of miles away. But as the hammer fell upon my head it disappeared entirely. I screamed and screamed to no avail. My eyes began to dry up. I couldn't help but listen. 
 There was nothing left in sight at this point. What sort of punishment might await us if we took that shot? We had fought so long to retake our village, hundreds of years ago, the last of our kind even. The sun was shining and watching the Red Moons, the same men who ran at us all the time. Now that we had the oil and were heading towards the new moon, the mood was definitely turning sour. I faced my men and even though they were laughing at their mistakes I watched them patiently. With no time to react I fired blindly at every thing my men tried to throw at me. It was getting to be far too fast for them to react quickly enough. More and more of them tried to throw as well, some choosing the weapon themselves but even the half-forgotten spears couldn't stop me. Our ambush had been overrun, if they had been about to get shot. 
 At this point I sat down and began to mend my wounds. I'd never seen men so helplessly fall to the field of battle before. Their pain was mutual. I longed for the relief of my bloodied companions, of the meaningless rumble and of standing still. It was my last breath, barely into the final moments of a long and terrible journey. He'd come back on his own accord. I dug my dagger closer to my throat as I prepared myself, ready to fire again, when my men leveled their weapons at me. The last volley passed me, my armor broken to the nubs at the same time. I quickly tried to catch up, with slow reflexes I pushed my dagger in front of my head. When I felt a sharp pain I turned to watch the damaged metal halberds creep up the base of my skull. One by one my men fell from all sides. I couldn't stop my body. I lay there motionless, clutching my dagger. In pain I waited. I waited until the dark forces had taken hold of me before shutting my eyes. 
 Oh how painful it must have been for the wrath of the gods that I was finally going to die.<|endoftext|>
**********832**********
I opened the door to my bedroom and crawled up the wall in front of me. I knew what this would be. Delirious out in the snow! Any reactions would be measured on a form needed to take a default line of sight and draw attention to myself. But by the time I was almost out of breath and slipped, I recognized the small bluish piece of abandoned equipment in my bedroom that day. I knew what it meant. I knew what it meant for the world. And I didn't even care. 
 I glanced to my left and noticed the resting patch of snow where the small wooden kite had been. Although twisted and worn, it was the shape of a decent spoon that made it look so familiar. After a moment I looked up at the gleaming thing and returned a slight nod. Now my focus was already on my task. 
 _______________________________________________________ 
 *The thought of this newfound attention had apparently turned so deep, and my mind was beginning to feel like a bowels of polished white. It was a desire to reflect, to scratch, and to make a thought appear. There was no thought except to become aware of the task that being tackled was in a way fairly appropriate. " How can we be practical now, son? " When I spoke from my back the child of my goal arose. Its voice was smooth and powerful, but I saw a small twinkle and a gleam of recognition in its eyes. 
 " He didn't like it, Ben. " The child said. 
 I smirked, turning back around towards the skylight. The man on the ground and the snow was the pain that I used to see. It felt like a bucket was being sagged from the ground, sure. But in reality it was something else entirely. 
 The man seemed exhausted and sad, and I saw him stand over his child's well-being. It was time to undo the time I had made with the vase. It had been so comforting. Even though the man here was literally watching me get up at this point, a smile was now almost on his face. He moved over to the axe that lay on the desk and clambered up. I jerked at the tree branch that held the kite up. And I knew in my heart that I had made him happy. 
 He pushed the tarp off the ground a few more times and looked at me. " You told us you were unhappy? " He said. 
 " Ben, " I said, my eyes glazing over. " I said I didn't want to do this, but I've heard it's beneficial. When the child likes something, they go back to your drawing of them and enjoy the ones they have. I can't go back to drawing them, it doesn't work like it used to do. But you asked me to give you one request. Now there's a place out in the forest that doesn't depend on anything but your letter. I'm ready to see you again. And I can offer your shiv, if you'll help me with the naming process. " 
 Ben looked up at me and he cringed. " I'll be with you soon. My lord. " 
 " And what is the third request? " I asked, getting closer as I couldn't help but tug his hand. 
 " Help me name them. " He said. " Now. " He guided me through the steps and I couldn't help but grin at my best friend. " Call me the Butkin, with your social skills and your hyperactivity. All I ask is that you help me name them. " 
 " Give me time, right? " I asked. 
 " Hm. " He nodded and walked towards his new find and he disappeared. I knew it then, and I knew I would gladly never have to meet my daughter again. But then...

 *Thank you so much, really you know how I like these girls. You always have a great cast of characters that I think every little girl must have at some point. But even though they are so different, if you are reading this for the first time, make sure you read the very first lines of the letter. Plus if you read the whole letter, you'll understand that you're going to be an inspired girl! *

I got fired one day. I never asked for a raise, but I was afraid of being terminated. I didn't know what else to do. I was asked for the last time I saw the target. I could sense time travel had been coming. 
 "Hi, what makes you want to shoot me? " I was 15 years old. I was sure he was the person I wanted to kill. 
 " Wait! We need to go out into space and take pictures of that face. " I was 15 years old. 
 " We're a little late. I understand you'd never call me when you get old. " He looks back at me. I think " Okay. This is ridiculous. You're still not someone that wants to shoot me. You can put up your hands to defend yourself. Get in their space and be the one standing behind us. " He punches me in the face and we move out into space. 
 I must have looked younger than I was 15 years ago. I went to college to get a job. I had a girlfriend. She used to work for me. I visited her in a restaurant two nights a week to get a snack. She worked at home that night. I had a dream, but reality shot in. I had to work the night shift at a remote diner for five months while I lay in bed. I would never get a raise. I took my job for the fifth time and didn't expect to be fired. My dream was actually a real one. I would be in a bank robbery. 
 The last thing I remember was a huge crash, it really was big for six months. My boss called from the press to tell us the general manager wasn't there to explain anything. I lost everything I had ever loved. I would go to rehab to get better, but at the same time I was stripped of my childhood dreams and my potential. I was the only person alive, but I was still 20 when I lost my job and now I was stripped of my hopes and dreams. It all happened in such a short span of time. 
 But most of all, I lost my job because I accidentally shot someone. When I got to work, I walked into the bathroom and was shocked to see me there. I put on my best blue shirt and the best jeans I own. My mom, who I have been told I'm a part of, called me down to meet up. 
 " I wasn't supposed to go outside. " I explained, my face contorted in a horrified look. " Mom, aren't you going to call the police? I thought you were in a coma or something. " 
 I was told my whole future is planned, I'm supposed to do my job. I was also told my dreams are real. I couldn't have dreamed for the hundreds of millions that he was supposed to give me this much money for. 
 " That's it, " I said, my mother smiled. " Now let's go find him. If he's really dead, tell them. " 
 There was a long silence before I heard a gunshot. 
 " I can tell. " I managed, " We need to leave, okay?"<|endoftext|>
**********834**********
I walked down the street, and gently dug my hands into my knees. Moved my fist into my forehead. 
 Another tug, another tug, a little more tug. My arm felt tight, and I knocked a cigarette out of the corner of my eye. 
 Fascinating. Nothing here to get me. 
 My stomach whirred. I did a few sniffs at the cigarette and a couple of my coke, and, oh wow, it has a.44. 
 I used the shoulder stick to make a finger pull to the tape bag. Nothing to slow it down. An hour to get a face is funny, and everything in my shoddily successful life has to pay for that. 
 I grabbed the top and pick it up. 
 First time I was having fun. It might get me a call back later. My life has got me dreading this road I am on. 
 I had enough. This scene needed a center. An escape. 
 Suddenly I heard something. It was a gnashing of teeth, and as the gnashing got closer, a bit of bone was grinding. 
 The person behind me screamed. I froze. Something was clawing at me. 
 And pulled the tape back. 
 Another pull. 
 The gnashing got closer. Finally, I was free.<|endoftext|>

*drawg raven> :D dammit dammit dammit dammit **DAMMIT**: That's what I was talking about. Sorry bitch about that. 
 “ I'll be back. I'll check on you, call you. Where are you, right? ” 
 *drawg raven> :D Where are ya? ” 
 “ Nothing. I can't be anywhere, I mean... apparently I could be anywhere else. ” 
 **DAMMIT**: It ’ s that easy. I just made it up. I made sure you didn ’ t die. Not yet. Thank you for coming, dammit. 
 *drawg raven> :D I don ’ t care. I ’ ll go check you out with my friend. 
 “ Thank you. ” 
 “ This is awesome. ” 
 **DAMMIT**: You know what, I ’ ll see you soon. I just want you to know I love you. 
 “ I know. ” 
 **DAMMIT**: Come on. I can ’ t be anywhere else. Come to think of it, I should have known this would happen. It would ’ ve been worse if it hadn ’ t been. Everyone else would have been dead. 
 *drawg raven> :D she probably wouldn ’ t survive for years on end. No one would see that happen. Nobody would do anything to stop it. 
 *drawg raven> :D I ’ m sorry, but I don ’ t care. You ’ re right. My friend isn ’ t going to die yet. It ’ s never over. And most likely, he won ’ t. But you won ’ t do what you say for that. 
 **DAMMIT**: You probably want me to find you. 
 “ Sure. Let ’ s go check out. ” 
 The sun beat down on the hospital gowns as each chair writhed, unable to hold their weight off. The gowns clattered along the carpet. There was no dance in sight. The washing machine ruffled and tossed. There was something unerringly vivid about this detail, and the heartbreak in the bathing suit that seemed to come so quietly from her face when it started, and like all fleeting acts of will, the ocean would set a trap which would trap whoever she was. 
 **DAMMIT**: Hmmm. Something else came off the maid ’ s steps. 
 “ She just drew blood. ” 
 “ Yes. ” 
 *drawg raven> :D — it stabbed at me with such intensity that even the object of her ire had failed to miss. The string of cuts she pushed against the marble counter brought me back to reality. 
 " I'm sorry. There was no intention of saving your life. I got around to it. But I'm so sorry, dammit. You were in a better place then. What happened? " 
 “ Oh. " 
 *drawg raven> :D I knew you would have died eventually. That ’ s it. Goodbye. ” 
 The water slide. 
 “ I ’ m so sorry. I ’ m so sorry. I forgot you were in surgery. I just... I can ’ t. ” 
 " I ’ m so sorry." 
 My phone rang.<|endoftext|>
**********836**********
Ding di ding dong dong. I'm hummed. 
 I'm humming along to the song - day or night and I feel a hum. I just can't help thinking that I could just eat pasta, there should be a cool sauce called lovebone, I might even have a hot sauce called beignon! I feel like saying hello and then hearing its sweet moan. Its mouth seems full of something holy in the pit of my stomach. I don't know what it is. Why must I wait until it's too late. I do know that I will see the whole space of food once I'm gone. I think of prying it out with my hands, looking for something to eat with. 
 When it clears my mouth, I open my mouth and the hum reverberates like a soul of a female. I'm very hungry now, and as i prepare to put it away I move it towards a small cloud of sand in my pocket. I shoo away anything that my mind. Everyone in the dust settles and everything begins to stir. It seems like a lot of little bugs have gathered on the little shit. It is starting to smell like..water. It walks towards me with arms sticking out from underneath my covers. After how long it took to get my mouth off its tounge, I give it one last blow and pull it over my head. It drops to the ground and seems to sit still as a young man comes out of my laps and waves. I can't help but laugh at the way it sat as a child. He had green eyes and them skin was yellow so I don't know what was wrong, but he was taking everything very seriously.<|endoftext|>
**********837**********
"You know, I'm angry now, " I blurted. " In fact, I'm incensed. You put the Narnia clan on its knees. They passed me a virus that corrupts the pathing system, kills off half the female character - the ill-fated designs! " 
 " We were told you could kill us, " his simultanoy voice boomed. " I was a little worried you'd become infected, seeing as we- " I paused and dismissed him, " I'm in big trouble, aren't I? " 
 " No one else wants me dead, " his henchmen sang in protest. " They think they can kill me, or they'll send a death squad out to cleanse me. To my credit, they don't, really. " 
 I knew what I was doing. There was no turning back, really. I stood there, possibly a meter behind him, and found my unwitting companion slumped over his lap. " What was the deal, Harry? " I shook my head. " I love that part where I get to decide what to do with myself... with someone else. " 
 " Your right. " 
 " You said that? " 
 " I didn't make a fucking judgment call, you fucking seahorse! " My companion shuddered, and his soft, trained cock framed his face. " You can't kill me. " 
 I grimaced. " No. " 
 " Sure! " He yelled. " All the villains have come after you, and I won't stand for it if it kills me, because I know we can kill you. " 
 " So - " I made a gesture of forbearance, and stood up straight, about to hit the ground. " You know what, dude - " 
 " Yes, you do, " the foolured man laughed. He pushed himself up onto his mahogany throne and stood. " I'll blow up the capital, so I can get you assassinated for killing the Queen, no problem. " 
 " You're an unkillable NPC, I understand. All the slaughter you did is acceptable, " the immortal PC replied. " But I can't kill you because I know you'd get yourself killed, man. I'll kill you even if you attack me anyway. " 
 I sighed, and rolled over. " What? " 
 " Well, " the immortal PC hearkened out. " What I'd do is sell you his soul. You were clearly too strong in the beginning. " He cursed again. " You ruined our plans! " 
 I cringed. " I don't know, dude. Go through all the humiliating fun. " 
 He clutched the mahogany throne for a moment and mumbled something under his breath, as if unable to make out who the man was. 
 " Watch... move, man. For one, I don't want to mess with him. You can be annoying. I can be cruel. " 
 " Will I miss my birthday, friend? " 
 " Hahahahaha. " 
 " Yes. No. You need to protect your father before he turns cold. Wait, is this some sort of joke? " 
 The immortal PC craned his neck to look at me. " Not a joke, man. It's a deal. Leave me alone."<|endoftext|>

You know how me and my brother play together on these long rides. We play half of a game. Half of the guys are weirdos. Sometimes I swear my brother still goes to bed with us all night long. 
 All so I don't get to waste time with the other dudes. It makes us uninvited, and it is a perfectly normal way of outing our siblings in it. It makes me feel good about myself. 
 I wasn't really sure, back then I didn't feel like it. You see, my brother has always been good at getting into fights. He doesn't really live at your street level, and can only have difficulty of 2-4 friends per character. He just spends as much time playing as he does driving around, or going about his business. 
 So here I am, sitting in my parents asylum. I'm taking a drink, and as I'm getting to my feet, they start whispering to me. My father and mother are asleep in my room, and my sister and me are down on one knee. We are the only two remaining victims of this game, which we decided not to let. 
 My dad and mom hug me close. 
 "Mom, what have you done? " he asks. 
 My dad catches me twitching with his smirk. 
 " You ran off with the son that killed your dog. " 
 My dad and mom look at me in confusion. 
 " I'm sorry mother, you can't see my name."<|endoftext|>

His face was unmistakable in his lifeless state. 
 “ I wish for your heart to be peaceful. ” 
 “ I wish for you to live a good life. ” 
 “ I wish for you to have a happy future. ” 
 “ I wish for you to have an awesome past. ” 
 “ I wish for you to do the things that I love and you know me as well as I know you. ”

 “ I wish to be able to be a productive adult. ” 
 “ I wish to be a good adult. ” 
 He stopped breathing and slowly pushed his sunglasses back on. 
 “ I ’ ll wish you to be happy with the name, ” he continued to push the letter on to the side of the library where he had sent it several times. 
 “ I wish for your wish to be truthful. ” 
 “ I wish for your wish to be accurate. ” 
 “ I wish for your wish to be a realistic promise. ” 
 The mask fell off and there were tears streaming down his face, now filled with concern. 
 “ I wish for you to be happy with how you move on. ” 
 “ I wish for you to tell me how happy you were to have a family. ” 
 “ I wish you to tell me what you are thankful for and hope that you have had enough. ” 
 “ I wish you to tell me the battles that you are all too familiar with. ” 
 “ I wish for you to tell me what to think. ” 
 “ I wish for you to accept who I am. ” 
 “ I wish for you to be who I want to be. ” 
 He turned around, lowered his sunglasses back, and walked over to the library. 
 “ I wish for you to say: I wish you were also happy. ” 
 “ I wish you had the sense that you didn ’ t have to take responsibility for your actions. ” 
 “ I wish you were also happy and this makes sense. ” 
 “ I wish for you to be content with choosing a hobby over a career. ” 
 “ I wish you to have long, happy years. ” 
 “ I wish for you to have a nice feeling for things that are good and positive. ” 
 “ I wish for you to be content. ” 
 The voice faded from his head. 
 “ I wish for you to be happy. ” 
 “ I wish you to be happy. ” 
 He reached up to kiss his forehead. He felt his eyes close around it. He smiled at his son.<|endoftext|>

I had studied history of the Holocaust ( how it had begun there, I had none to tell it! ) My sociology partner helped me prepare in the past few years. I was a cyclist and a lumberjack back in the 1930s in the olden days so my credits as a historian may have come about for me when I tried college, but not for that. I was working from home when my campmate died. He had survived a fire, and was one of the first people to survive. He wasn ’ t good at his job and got beaten, but also short term. So he was there. When he walked down the stairs I began to suspect that he had been worried that he was going to be challenged to the death today, a fact I hadn ’ t yet taken the full affect of. I was left curious. I ran straight through the train cars, past the suicide bombers, but ended up being lucky enough to meet it ’ s twin. 
 The train doors opened. One of them suddenly hurt and fell. My partner knocked at the door, ready to get on. But he found the man standing there, near me and a knife in his stomach. 
 I left him and was waiting for him to join in the open door by my side. “ Four get lost in a tunnel this big, boy, that ’ s a tough stop. ” I told him. The man looked at me, “ The U.S, U.N, Russia, any idiot think you ’ re really going to solve this all? ” 
 I shrugged and helped him to the next stop. I had explained to him that I was working an underground road and I could get from here in about 30 minutes, I was going to die and that was fine. My partner smiled and told me that a simple jumpsuit was enough and moved on. 
 I joined in as well, like most guys, but I soon found the man had something real. A knife in his stomach as well. The post-mortem, judging from the look of it, was amazing. Like he was shot to death in a bunker, or worse, poisoned. The post-mortem told me that he was in the Roman Empire in 308 AD. It also told me the things that surrounded him, and how the snow covered his body. As I unfolded a surgical blade and stabbed him in his stomach, he smiled at me and told me: 
 “ I ’ m the man who escaped from Auschwitz! ” 
 He laughed and pulled out his own knife and slashed at me, but before I could stop him, he passed out. So I found him, and picked up the knife again and chucked it at him. He woke up and tried to beg for mercy before I threw the knife at him. I tugged the knife away from the wound and started to leave, but came into view of the place I was standing in. 
 On the steps, stood a man who looked like me. He was tall, dark, skinny, pale, and blonde. He was warm and full of life. He covered his mouth and nostrils, but I didn ’ t notice. I didn ’ t want to go back to my family, I didn ’ t want to go, so I stepped out of the tunnel. 
 “ Welcome home. ” I said to him. “ Now where have you been, boy? ” 
 He laughed and he pulled out a pistol. But the officer backed up. “ No, I don ’ t remember saying that I was coming. That you must have been through worse than death. ” 
 I waved his off. “ And no I haven ’ t. ” 
 Then he approached me. 
 “ What is your name? ” 
 I shook my head. “ The word is Gott, Gottte. ” 
 The officer gave me a quizzical look. “ My name is Lee. ”<|endoftext|>

Hey baby it feels so hot my dick. 
 "Shit you must be afraid to go up in that door. " Sir David said from downstairs. 
 " Oh for fucks sake I am afraid of that. " I said as I went up in the room. 
 " Really? " David said through a confused look " not I was afraid of the dark too. So will it be dark for you? " 
 " No. " I replied 
 " Where the hell are you talking about so I just go downstairs in an hour and you wouldn't want to go up there. " 
 " I see... " David said while muttering something under his breath while trying to resist the urge to run to the window and into the bathroom. 
 " So that's why you fell and that's where you are now. I need you to come out and have a seat on my floor or you will arrest me on grounds of involuntary manslaughter. " 
 " Well I need you to come out my dong way, there is nothing I can do about that. It'll be over shortly. " I said trying to suppress my excitement " there is nothing I can do about that. I just need you to come out and have a seat on my floor or I will arrest you on grounds of involuntary manslaughter." 
 So I pulled out and checked for any packages and found a knife with a live camera. Of course there was never a live camera. I flipped to the window trying to calm myself. I wonder what I am going to do about this.<|endoftext|>

President Speerling looked up from his page, nervous with the interview. Almost as nervous as the question he was asked last night. " Sir? " 
 Smyllium listened intently, waiting for the results of his interview. 
 " Sir, the data is in wonderful condition. The oceans have been in ocean sediment for 3 months now. An entire planet has been covered, and however long the increase in seawater between the two initial periods was, it is still shallow. Can you say something else? " 
 Speerling's voice cracked, the expression deep and innocent, as he sent the action him his report, its final words untill he had to sit down again. The President could not have been happier. " Have a nice day, President Speerling, and have a nice day. I'll call the President before sending our robots back to Earth. " 
 Smyllium hung up the phone. He felt a hand on his shoulder. What could he say? If only he could just listen to the interviewer in this moment. His decision after all was made. 
 " Mr. President, in case you could perhaps consider yourself spiritually sound, I'd like to introduce myself."<|endoftext|>

"The energy field that the wall protects the Earth beyond even this small distance is entirely empty. " Linda, the next one in line to fill the spot. " What do you mean? " 
 " Well, Linda, we don't know. " 
 " We didn't dig at the center of the wall and... " She paused, staring into the camera, looking up at the North Pole at which she had just stopped, looked and saw where the draw saw to say'we' and where the something had gone. 
 " So why does one of you think we only dig at this? " 
 " Well, Linda, we realized that this wall contains hazardous amounts of radiation on the sol system, so we drilled through it instead. For whatever reason, we had a cooling system and someone went in and said'well, what do you think we should do with it then'? " 
 " That's absurd, " She paused again, staring down at the camera to observe the base she didn't see ahead of her, " What's the point of that anyway? " 
 " Well, Linda, we had no idea whether they would have figured that out anyway. So, we didn't dig the place out of our hands. Instead, we just sent on a big, teams of 10 personnel to continue the flow of radiation around the place and knock down the wall and the place. Then, after we had the force of ten people in there from the inside out using the gravity of the wall, they put in the things we were going to put into the wall. We even took out all of the hangers they were wearing. " 
 " Really? " 
 " Really. Then, finally, we got the person they sent in from the inside out, who wore more clothing than any other person, yet had more clothing than anybody. And he was taller than everyone else, but he looked like a real man. And we thought'well, if he just worked out of the backpack, we might be able to blow past the wall before someone else gets hit. Wouldn't that just bring some douchebag urban explorers to our cause? Wouldn't that go out of our way to poke through the wall like that?' " 
 " How should we proceed Linda? " 
 " Well, the story of the wall is a pretty happy one, really. Pretty much everything we had to do. We just sent people to pry it from the wall, and then we were looking for any places our drill corps could move. Out of the 10, they found a way. They mounted a giant robotic arm on top of the wall and cut off it's roots. And they got permission to do that. So we were called down, or we were summoned into the field. Those guys, they found a way to blow through it, even further than the others and hid us in the darkness. In a few weeks, they are scrambling to get a place as as far as a crater in the wall, without diggers. " 
 " You just told us that it was a cow shit hole and suddenly you're all over the place! " 
 " What, in a little while? " 
 " Well, for one, we're pretty busy. " 
 " So what do you think, Linda? " 
 " Well, then it just ended up trying to rip a hole all the way through. To see if we can get past it, it just had to rip it off and then throw us there. I mean, everyone who was sent in, except for him, for the roof. Weird, but he did... Go and beat up the roof guys. Everyone except his dad and kid. We started getting messages like'hey, that was your dad. Fuck'."<|endoftext|>

Chapter 1 
 "Alice, you've learned that the leap week in high school is for the weirdiest nerds out there. " 
 " Well, then, on to your other level of nerdiness, aren't you? " 
 * " Bill, it's pretty horrible you know. Everyone else who usually has a transition door turns to us right away! " * 
 " Want to know what I really got wrong, Bill? " Alice leans back in her bookcase, rather wary that this anonymous stranger, who doesn't live far from here, was actually talking to her. 
 " Oh, yes. * Bill! * I've got to get back, right away! " Alice whirls away towards Bill, who maintains her usual awkwardness with a grin. 
 " Okay, *so* right away... whatever, Doc? " Bill wriggles out of bed and clumsily puts his book back in the sheath. 
 " It's okay. I like you and your brain though. " 
 " Uh... okay... Can you stop me for a second, I really don't want to do this. " 
 " Uh... Okay okay, then. First, let's not show you... page 51 of your Diary. " 
 " I know, right? " 
 Alice giggles while drawing out a page in the most shameless way possible. As she finishes the legwork, Bill suddenly stumbles back into bed and unbuckles his book flap. 
 " Oh please don't be late, Bill. See you on the other side. " 
 Alice looks up to Bill incredulously, her eyes wide with shock and horror. However, she stands straight and quickly slaps Bill in the face with the book. 
 Bill quickly scrambles to the bedside, hurrying to get his gun back. Alice kisses him gently and un-buffs his door handle. 
 As Alice leaves the room, Bill quietly looks at the paper. 
 " First story I got for Professor Shlorthy, " Bill writes. 
 " Wow. Might end up like this next week..."<|endoftext|>

Dr. Finger, race to the graveyard. 
 Next to the graves, the garbage squirms. The needles stir. In front of the graves, the people weep, as if by accident. 
 "It wasn't so bad yesterday, " Barry thought to himself. " Not bad at all either. " 
 A lone man passed the stones. " I like to think it's better this way. " 
 At the end of the cemetery was a large man with gold bars. He was trying hard not to laugh. " You know what Barry? You wrote so much good books. There's just so much wit that *I* can do better. But the dead bury their own thoughts. It has to end, all the others died. And better. That's the most important part. It's why you came here. Because I could just kill the good to keep this day going. I've always wanted to come here as a scientist, but only now... " 
 The man added a rouge bandage to the man's arm. " I'm not interested. " 
 This was a different man. Something more, someone better. But he simply sat in his chair and waited. 
 When he finally got back, he took a deep breath and said. " I don't know why I liked this place, but I *can* thank you. And you've always loved me. I can tell. We did this for more people than *all* of the other dead here can. " 
 A tear was visible on Barry's eye. He forgot how bad it was. Not for the first time, he could see the shred of remorse in his eyes. They were ordinary. But he needed something special to keep them at bay. 
 " I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault." Barry threw himself out of his chair and towards a door.<|endoftext|>

The sound of blood echoes from the Great White Throne, and any who will listen will know the true nature of our enemy: him who demands the keeping of its throne. 
 The arrows dipped as it struck the remains of our walls, forming a trap when the disoriented portions of our forces flew outward. Those unfortunate enough to get careless with the arrows at first were forced to retreat into safety zones. After what seemed like years, as the wounds held of others permeated the metal plate that once guarded our people and our lands, the lines of blood that had surrounded us from the river below drowned us out. The warlord that commanded this war against us had risen into the skies, and through his ravenous wind the Warlord sought to terrify our people with the strongest of his powers, to incinerate them in the deadly flames of hell! We had all but taken to the Storm as it fell, but as we pursued the fleeing beast of war we were sure his axes would cut us down swiftly. He had reduced our number at the onset of the season by another three thousand, but in one fell swoop of victory the opponent had defeated the liege of chaos. 
 That same day, this great wall fell, engulfed with the magic of the warlord. The new find allies of the great warlord were thrown onto a ship bound for the waste by his mighty dragons. As the defeat of our former allies became apparent, there was no denying the fight could only be won in the lands of the last peace between the earth and the sky.<|endoftext|>

"Bro... Bro... No... What? I have a life. " The man with a gun rushed in a tall building near me. 
 " What the fuck " I whispered. 
 The man takes out his phone and dials his number. " Hello? I would like to call you. I am homeless. " 
 " Ow! He's a dank rat. How the hell can you get in here? " I yell from the toilet. 
 The man flips open the lid, then puts the phone in a wrapper that reads " 555-24-HUMAN ". He goes back to dialing the number and I sigh. 
 I call a fellow eater that lived at the nearby gate, the one at the corner of the register. " Hey, Jerry, what's going on? " 
 " He's stinking. Stay in there. We'll get him checked out. You ever found the spot? " I ask, rubbing my eyes. 
 " Yes. What's happening? " 
 " Not this time. He stopped drinking! He quit drinking! He's killing himself! I don't understand. I don't understand. " 
 " Are you showing any sign of stopping? You smell like cigarette smoke. " 
 I look down at my feet. Even the dirt and debris covers my feet. I wonder if I have been kicking and screaming, and then " no " again. 
 " Why? Why are you yelling at me like that? Why do you have to kill yourself? Do you *really* have a life? " I start to stutter, as the rage goes away. 
 " It doesn't make any sense, " Jerry says, and motioning to the bag at the corner of the register where he keeps the wine. " It's been a couple minutes and we're still getting through the pain. Now go, now, bro. Get your shit together, and then save yourself. " 
 I grab his hand, and hear him say it in a whisper. 
 " Jerry, I'm calling the cops. I know you're gon na kill yourself. I know how to stop it. I'm sure you've had terrible days. It may not have been easy doing your laundry, but you've taken time to get your ass up. We have a guy in the car that'll take care of it." 
 The suspect grabbed his gun and ran off, leaving me as the closest thing to financial ruin I've ever known. The man turned my attention towards the lock at the corner of the bathroom, where the man said to take a last squeeze. 
 I picked up his hand to stop myself. I didn't want to open the lens and find myself staring into my own eyes. I knew it was my fault. But I trusted him enough to do what was best. I pushed myself away, and the memory of the man I helped end flashed in my mind, as I remembered that crazy night at the gas station. I got myself up, smiled to myself, and walked to my car. I watched as the man came outside with a box of Halogen tablets.<|endoftext|>

I was about to pass the rope, when I heard something booming. 
 As I turned to see if all the snakes were dead, I saw Belloq on the roof deck. The male and female soldiers that had been in the water looking the other way, were breathless, but somehow excited. 
 All of a sudden, the sound of guns against rocks changed. Cars blaring outside of their truck stopped and began to whiz like airplanes, and sound surrounded me as I closed my eyes. What I saw in the distance was... As they were moving, this foreign monster that looked like, at least from the inside, the historical moment, I realized that human beings may not make any kind of difference at war... I looked at Belloq and saw that the men from the U.S. were armed with the reality of the situation and decided to take matters into their own hands.
They went up to Belloq and we proceeded to kill him. While killing him, many of them had let loose a shot on him. The hole caused Belloq to cough and push his revolver in a circular motion in front of him. I could tell that he was terrified that he was finally going to fall, to die in this shell shell chamber and and not be hit by magic... what was happening? Finally, he reached down and grabbed my arm, and pulling me close felt that I was covering my face, I was afraid. I looked at the ceiling... " Behold! I reveal to you the god of sky and the water that are under our bed! " the floating god said. 
 " It was called 'God of the sky'! " I yelled at Belloq and he shouted back, " Mommy! " He cried, and as he cried, I saw the white water pouring down from the sky and he yelled " Dad!".<|endoftext|>

It all started like any other week. Tonight, I woke up and ate breakfast. I was sprawled out on my bedroom floor trying to stretch. Did anyone see me? Was anyone there? 
 I talked to the window, closed it, and was told it would be all over soon. I put on clothes, reached in and felt the breeze on my face. Screaming and nothingness got me out. I pressed up against it and I could feel its own warmth. As I brushed against it it quiet calmed down. It ran my hand along the soft surface as I prepared to bite down on it, but as it came under me a feeling came over me, like a tidal wave. I shut my eyes, opened them, and… it took me. I was screaming and everything went black.<|endoftext|>
**********850**********
The world was always one of mysteries. I would often catch glimpses of unanswered questions, nothing of interest or importance. 
 Whenever there was a great tragedy or scandal to be solved, I would sit and read and analyze. I'd contemplate the myriad feelings I would feel through it. 
 Perhaps I wished we had been better. Perhaps one day, through sight or words, one night, I could resolve the mystery. We would use our powers to clear one another's heads, and I would remain the same. We would create mystery by explaining and discussing it. 
 Our work was perfect. Many lost their power in some way, but still I could deal with those who remained. 
 Eventually, the unthinkable would happen. One day, the story of myself would be able to be told, and the knowledge of what caused me to leave our world would be absorbed. All we could do now was have a peace, that is, until the world devolves into chaos. 
 If the world became one of chaos, it would shatter itself, and I would not be the hero.<|endoftext|>
**********851**********
It was, perhaps, the silliest accusation the world had ever heard. 
 The Institute for Creationist was hauling the largest crop of earth-based bioware technology ever conceived, they claimed. The project envisioned using an entirely new crop of minerals, mineral compounds and other round technology. They claimed the key to molecular energy being not found in the cold side of the Earth were the source of the energy, and not all of it was greenhouse gas. The closest they came to reproducing this energy was through their probe ships, in fact. Even with water, their principles of energy creating a crucial fuel source was retarded. This was an experiment, one that would have never failed. But the idea that life was ever going to exist on its own would have suffered a terrible fate. 
 The institute let first contact go through one of the two orbiting rigs. They planted the seedlings on the planet with their probes, lab equipment, a new planetary orbit and capabilities of landing. When one did succeed in sending it off, the gravitational pull jumped a steeper, and the field exploded and everything went dark. This was the start of a new era of space exploration, whereby every brother of every earthling on the planet could find new opportunities. Except they couldn't. They couldn't find other men on the moon, either. They couldn't find another life form. They couldn't find other crystals beyond how well the silver spoon could hold. They couldn't find other things. 
 The summer after the results of the experiment were presented, the world gathered to witness their brilliant achievement. They, and most of the world, gathered at the same huge diamond-like structure that they had seen at the top of the Pi Observatory, where the US congress gathered. From there, the media rushed to the post for their best glimpse at the ice and Earth of the Stone Age, leading to the planet's downfall. 
 And then the forest fire. A fire they'd nicknamed the "cattle fire ", a kind of tonic fire, to ignite the surface and the atmosphere. 
 Imagine, if you will, the kind of atmosphere they'd create, and put the carbon dioxide and nitrogen and other gases inside to generate energy. Just make sure that the carbon dioxide is being stered at room temperature before burning. Once and for all, stop doing such an evil thing. We've been working on this project for over two years. As one of the only remaining scientists, I know that if any of the things they built to the brim, these are the seeds to soil life on it's own soil. 
 As the elders prepared for the second bottle, I faced the frozen landscape that they painted on top of what was once the map. The world was watching. 
 And for a moment, then it all went black, and I was forced to lie on my back, staring into the abyss that I would have to live in the next two years.<|endoftext|>

Who was he, that bastard? Who else had souls? It all seemed so morbidly ordinary, like if it was a minor inconvenience, a community trouble, but then - hell. No one dares to venture into the dark. Nope, when people who see the light, think the same, they don't believe themselves to be ghosts or demons, just deities and demons and the like. 
 So, the whole thing sounds exactly as he'd imagined it. That must have been it. A million years of eternity of darkness and pain and emptiness had produced a specimen akin to him. And now it was here. The damned in a flat plain. A windbrick dunes edge soft on the white pebbles, giving a faded rosy light a hangover. At least it sat snug on top of the concrete. Very stealthy. 
 Who else saw the light, but Him? No idea... except for the way his eyes gleamed, the way he always treated others, the way he very rarely touched. He never seemed to care. Perhaps it was Him, he believed. He might even get His name from that handsome old gray-brown-haired youth next door, who smiled at the line of confused shadows. 
 He sat there, at the bottom of a pebble, from mouth to brow... he reminded himself why He invited Him to this flat plain. He would have given it a name - an alibi - but here... it wasn't that remote. 
 The darkness drifted around the girl. Mantle broke free from hair and a vermilion brown ring draped over a red velvet fringe. Clears hit the edge of her dress and separated the green and black, holding back the heat, and lifting the girl back up so that her dress showed no more slight imperfections. She had still had the same clothes when it went dark. It's all her fault now. He stares down at her bright blue eyes. Did she ever love him? How could she not? 
 The girl's head now seemed to be swimming around her, tucking back her fall, letting her gaze drift around the pebbles. A smile seemed to follow it. She laughed. Kissing her hair tenderly, then taking another open kiss on her lip. Her body had accepted her forever, and her eyes never seemed to show those piercing features. 
 The cold cuts carried on forever, and they broke into dust as all collapsed out of existence, mouths agape. The young girl let out one quick moan and a deflated gasp. Her tail flew up and a box fell from the air into the sand beside her, and she stumbled up on her toes. Three sunrises lay ready, even though the moon never shone in her face. 
 She bent down and smeared her hands against his back, inhaled deeply, and hit the surface again. Outstretched fingers and empty nectar drops poured down his shirt. Sweat fell from his face, then from her, then from him. Her voice passed through the air as he walked back to his seat. 
 "You ruined this, Josh. " 
 Josh looked down at his hand. " I-I've... I... wanted to die. " 
 Josh cocked his head, then started to laugh. " Been through life too many times to say no to you. How can you blame yourself for getting that last deal with the devil? " 
 " I... tried. " He stood up. " And you just wanted to live. Why? " 
 " I... tried. " 
 Josh's expression fell. " It's easy to blame them, after all. " 
 " I don't understand. " 
 Josh shook his head. " You've always told me you wanted to live. That... you wanted to let go of the part that was the same, because now, it's never happened to you. " 
 " I wanted it to never happen to you. " 
 Josh shook his head. " I wanted it to be the same. Now... now it's never happened to you."<|endoftext|>

"Now, how many times have you been in that place? " The old man asked me. 
 " That place sucks. " I answered. 
 " And why did you say it? " The genie asked, as well. 
 " I couldn't help but trip. " The old man repeated. 
 " Well, there is a catch, " I told him. " I need to figure out where I left off. I can't just find the right world and find it again. " 
 " Have you had any of the drinks you could afford or gold galore? " The genie asked. 
 " That was last night at the bar. " I replied. " No. I was on the phone with everyone. " 
 " Is that why you think it makes sense that you go back in time and change your greatest mistake? " The old man asked. 
 " I dunno. " I repeated. " Sometimes it just shows up. " 
 " I don't know about *that*---*That's when I realized I had completely forgotten something. * 
 A large object flew overhead, 
 a feather with shapes 
 a gigantic bird 
 A wrist shaped lamp 
 Its wings seemed to extend 
 until it reached the sky. 
 *No... that was an unusual dream. * 
 " The stars don't want you to see " the old man said. " None of us are very good with eyes. 
 They're human! They're the only person left! " 
 " Me neither. " I said. " But I can see what this tower has to offer. 
 *I wish I would vanish. * 
 I looked over at my new host. He was leaning on a chair in his office, his neck draped over the elbow. His boots clapped against the floor. 
 I ran my hand across the side of his face and his eyes widened. The fierce gaze of a child never faltered. 
 I took a few steps towards the window. " I wonder... if it is still because the inky black of the night is away from the city. * " 
 " *Good gracious... * " The old man exclaimed. 
 " And why won't you make your wish be granted? " I asked. 
 " I don't want to think about it. " The voice of a man who was waiting for a word to finish his sentence replied. 
 *Not in the least. * 
 " I look forward to this one hour conversation " I said, pushing the people to their seats to wait. 
 " Wish granted? " The older man asked, picking up a book by the window. " I'm going to change things. The king is going to rally the people to rally in the face of despair. And when he gets there I'll leave. " 
 The younger man and I made our way over to the door. " Good luck, everyone. " 
 " God damn it, " The young man said as he threw the book in the way. " We'll need the chairs later."<|endoftext|>

I was sitting in the coffee shop watching a man type on his computer. He typed the words, "It begins raining outside", and it instantly starts raining. 
 He hung up the phone and glanced at the news as he craned his head. His face was the color of tears and his voice had become tinny, needing a change. 
 Just the thought of the black pit gave him his back straight, he was about to cut off the cord until he could stirle water with the muscles of his thumb. 
 " YOU SAY THE FUCKING BREATHING PULLS MY BOOT. OH GOD IT STARTS CRYING OUT! " 
 He was talking to himself, his eyes closed, feeling the water's energy draining through him. The sound of the damp earth filling his lungs filled his nostrils. 
 Suddenly, loud metallic groans filled his ears. A deep crack crackled out on his monitor, and he saw a man run at him in blackness. 
 The man took a step closer, aiming his gun at the man. 
 " See? You're a goddamn one!" 
 The man darted backwards, blasting him out the window, hitting a flesh and bone object. 
 He looked up, a bead of sweat flapping down his face. The man ran away as quickly as his legs would allow him. 
 He heard a low growl coming from somewhere nearby. He turned around and saw his down-to-earth self running for the stairs. 
 He realized he was in a coffee shop, but before he could turn around he heard the long fang of a pistol, rattling on the counter. 
 He yelped as he ran away, looking around frantically. The heat from the space between the two burned his skin, creating a excruciating blinding pain. 
 He lay there, on the cold floor, unable to see anything. 
 He checked for his gun, the ammunition charging it but he could not move his body. 
 The only thing he could see was a dark wall, something peering out at him. 
 He got up as fast as he could and ran for the exit, knowing it was only a matter of time.<|endoftext|>

"Double down, everybody! " The commotion on the arena voice echoed through the water, excited all the way through its busy cavernous halls. Leaders of various revolutionary organizations in general were droning on endlessly, marveling at the general dominance of the Red invasion force with their massive shields and dark magic to help protect themselves from the worst of the bloody Hachvers. You can see their uniform, made up entirely of Mjolnir and the Shadow of Others, their silver armor falling apart completely over the course of the melee. You can see their golden lanterns running through the air, shining bright white in the large arena. With each enraged hand, the windows of their doors slowly opened, revealing the entirety of the numerous super-villain families engaging the red hordes with iron weapons and heavy swords. You could be sure that the Hellspawn Horsemen would begin to gather outside their gates soon. 
 " So... Now you've won." The announcer said, while talking to the targets, shattering the glass of the arena to reveal that many powerful monsters were carrying green shields, and more dangerous than the others. The fearful Hachvers shook uncontrollably as two of their strongest, as well as several incredibly dangerous Hachvers emerged, flanked and menacingly fighting over each other as they just stood. It was a safe march, and nothing was going to happen to their enemies. A second announcer announced, as the final destroyed metal box hit the ground, almost as if the presence of heavy armor was activating into giant purple instruments against the demon soldiers. Then, the teleporting thing vanished from the sky, and the slabs of destroyed armor returned. The action ended right as they entered the arena, and the battle was easily won with the seemingly impossible.<|endoftext|>

His presence drags on for a few moments, then he suddenly turns towards the door. Clutching it, he begins to speak, "Get it? I want to buy a million dollars! " 
 " Poor fool! Money is mine! " 
 " I understand! I'm the one who did these things and I told them! That? Me too! " 
 " Eh? Well yeah, it seems to me it could be of benefit in the grand scheme of things. " 
 Clutching the invigilator across from him, he says, " But you said you were the one who created money. How come you're spending it at the comic book shop next door to the homeless shelter? " 
 " It's nothing to me really, and who can imagine a place like that with 300 people? " 
 " Oh. I'll just be honest with you- " 
 " No you can't! " 
 " I had a dream! I just had a dream! I had to buy *money*! What better way to make it *not*? " 
 " Well, I mean- you know how it goes when you sell people a gift? It all depends on whether the cash is worth buying. If you're an evil genius, you don't necessarily have to sell 'lives'. " 
 " So if it's my money in the TV, then I'm just making it up. A million dollars? No. On the other hand, that doesn't sound bad either. " 
 " Sure, sure you are. And you sell things. But should that not still be a steal? " 
 " It's not steal that counts though, was the matter in the clouds again? " 
 " Okay now, let me explain- really I didn't think that all things were coded specifically to transfer money, but I don't really *have* the luxury of understanding how others think! I'm an omniscient god. I've just got to figure out what all the fuss is about. " 
 " Aren't you insane? You give people comics or have porn or whatnot? Most certainly not! " 
 " Am I an omniscient god? " 
 " Credible enough! So say hello to my colleague. " 
 " Senator Schild, are you ready to address the vast majority of the Republican Republican Caucus today? " 
 " That's not fair, fool! " 
 " Alright, great place I'm in. I've got the good news! I have the bad news. I'm gon na sell you a million dollars! I'm gon na check with the Mayor of Minneapolis."<|endoftext|>

I was on my way to the casino one Saturday, when a blind girl walked in. I couldn't look at her, but I could see in her eyes that she was ready to give me any gift I had in my life. Looking into her eyes gave me a sense of terror that it did not work like it always does. " Look, I wish you could change lives. " She said she was from your left, and she was walking to your right, the bathroom and the checkout office. " I wish the world could change my decision and take care of the cause you are setting out to do. So, I will grant you access to new powers, and the gifts I get will be at my fingertips in the same time. " 
 I had exactly ten seconds. 
 I looked at her and answered, " What? " 
 " You will receive $ 17.75, from the person in your life who has chosen this gift. Should you not have chosen this gift to cause death, you will just have to reappear at 10:39 AM for the day. " 
 She was gorgeous. Her features and her mannerisms matched my initial reaction to that which I had already been denied by the person in the casino, making her as great as I had ever dreamt of being. " How long will this take? " 
 " I will reach my destination, no questions asked. " 
 I couldn't believe that she was indeed being promised immortality, and I didn't have to wait that long. 
 I made my first wish. " Can I bring you your 20 year old son who has chosen this gift? " 
 " Of course. We won't have to wait another four years. " 
 But she was incredible in every way. Her voice was clean, refined, and charming, but just missing out on the charismatic nature that the machine had provided. 
 I smiled, knowing that life wouldn't be much better out there if I gave her something that she would know to love and care for her children. 
 I believed that it would make the world a better place, yet I was wrong. 
 " So what's the right gift to give? " 
 I asked her. 
 " The people in the world want to live. " 
 " Who? " 
 " My parents. " 
 " Where? " 
 " Exactly 1.5 billion people in the world, " I kept saying as I exclaimed " I will grant you access to this gifts " 
 " So you wish you were the best person ever? " 
 " Of course. Who cares? " 
 I laughed at her. " Wait, one more minute, I swear to god, we're not getting any MORE fame. " 
 She looked at me again, and told me. 
 " Your parents are dead. " 
 I smiled at her. 
 " How about you go get a job? " 
 " If you got one my [ back ] ( http: //www.reddimg.com/3o2sj6e/8/1/aww7b/13f6fa36b4fe/upload_300x214/-s.jpg ) ". 
 " I can't wait to make this one up. " 
 " Aww, no problem," and she left as she left.<|endoftext|>

"Alright kid, just let me finish what I said. After you say that, I would like to go home... I need to go... to Woody Hills, OKAY? " 
 The five year old girl strolled over to the open door of the house, keeping her eyes on the extended line of old pine trees waiting for the handle to open. Tim couldn't hear her, as he'd seen every second of his step. 
 " Ahhh, hello pal... " the girl stopped dead in her tracks. 
 " Santa? " Tim started waving a hand, confused. 
 " Yes, the kid looks adorable! Oh great, " he said, waving at Tim to show how adorable his little Santa Claus was. " Thank you, kid. Nice to see you're still alive, buddy, I appreciate it, but you have to go home... I'll get you back in, you hear? " 
 Tim didn't say anything else, waiting for the good thing to come out before continuing on his way home. He walked to the sidewalk and reached for the handle. 
 " Hey kid, are you worried about that old lady at the door? " the child asked, concerned. 
 " Umm... no, I'm not sure, " Tim said. 
 " Oh-huh-huh. " 
 The girl stared at him for a second, then turned to face the street. " So, that's why I'm here? " 
 " Yup. " Tim looked around the once worn post office, until he saw a small firetruck. " Well anyway, thank you, bud, and good luck!" 
 The girl quickly turned on the television in the corner to see this one over the not to mention this moment will forever be remembered in school.<|endoftext|>

[ Sister Joanne felt the wind raise through the gaps in her sister ’ s cloak. She looked outside at the abandoned cliff that was once a forest until, just before the horizon came to rest upon her, and rested by the rocks of the pathway, where she stood, falling back to earth into the dirt with no other choice but to face her death. As she headed forward she lifted her hand to catch a glimpse of a familiar face behind her, and within a moment, on the rocky face of the cliff faced the ground, she realized, that her sister had been walking there for at least fifteen minutes, and was missing her head. ] 
 [ THE END. ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2u48xg/wp_youre_going_against_your_fathoms_of_blood/cs0xy9/ )

Don ’ t let the computer tell you who I am. Your coroners say I ’ m sorry, but it ’ s better to spare you everything. There was only one person in the room who knew who I was. I ’ m sure you know I was before. I never seemed to forget the lights, the faces that stood out in the crowd. The children crying, hiding in rooms only your answers would understand. Not this place, you want me gone. I never betrayed you by sneaking into your head. I tried everything to help you and never found you. 
 The gold slipped from your fingers, and my vision began to float. I sucked at the air between my teeth, trying to bite into the filling that was enveloping me. Light filled the room, and the thing covered in it seems to tear away until it ’ s just a rubble. The office van on top of the tram stop had just arrived, and the doors were shaking, gored and stained. I stood and strolled down the street, not interested in knocking over it or anyone else ’ s luggage. I couldn ’ t just go out there and ask for anything. I didn ’ t want to live my life as one of those people with a job I never wanted. I wondered if they would call me back, and wouldn ’ t they have been more careful about this? Every time it happened it would get worse. 
 “ You hear me, what are you waiting for? ” 
 With a few grunt “ I have a grand operation, ” she said quietly. 
 With a grand smile “ It ’ s the reason I retired from the military. I would have always preferred my position in history. ” 
 “ Well don ’ t be so harsh! I did nothing wrong. ” 
 Her eyes shot open and my face appeared before her before me. 
 It was a sinking feeling as if I were witnessing my last moments. Like a knife piercing my gut. It hit the floor next to me and I fell to the street, not knowing what to do. I was too stupid to worry about it any longer.<|endoftext|>

A huge clang was heard throughout the room as Rita grabbed a small box from her purse. She had no idea where it came from, at first, she was enthralled by the taste and the touching sensation it provided, she knew the source was in her blood, but she couldn't say whether it was from hot sauce. Rita stopped eating meat just to catch her breath and grasped the item in her right hand and wiggled her finger in excitement. It would taste wonderful! 
 The room burst into flame. 
 Rita looked behind her to see a strange looking man and woman standing in front of her. They wore black robes made out of split over corset, each one a different size, hair length from thin to small. There was something else about them, something other than the experience of being alive. She immediately motioned towards him and asked for him to come and join her, the man slid on the woman's lap on both ends. Rita took the slip from the man's hand and turned away, she wanted to grab her purse at any moment. She heard footsteps on the far end of the room, a couple looked at each other and asked for him to bring her. Rita continued to follow. 
 Rita strode across the room to the middle of the room, at the foot of a bed, there was a tablet that had a question mark beside her cursor. She looked at it once more and pressed the head to the darkness of the bed, she saw a door open wide and high, the old door was unlocked, one would think that she could open it. She went through the door and gasped as her senses begin to kick in. 
 A large man entered the room and stood up straight, in a robe that was dressed in gold on his chest, and a wispy cloak. Behind him, a vehicle started up on the tarmac and its drivers started to race back and forth on the road. It was time. 
 "René, please stop! " Rita begged, " René, is this really happening? " 
 René simply looked up at her and said, " Why is this happening? " 
 Rita's body began to shake as she tried to comprehend what had just occurred. She looked down at her left wrist and saw a dark red Q shaped object protruding out from within her chest cavity. Immediately after, her father turned his head and faced his mother, she ran to him and told him to stop. 
 " Let him go, please. " 
 Rita screamed and ran back to her room. She ran outside and in the distance, a helicopter had dropped a balloon into the land and now she was about to put her hand on the big monster. She heard a loud bang, before she got a name as the big monster came in to surround her. The helicopter flew towards the monster and shot at it without any success, as he broke free from the giant, demon, who stood before her. The whole room erupted into the sound of helicopters and screams of fear as when he saw that she had been destroyed and were no longer able to function, he took off his robe and cut her wrists, with his powerful knife. 
 " Now, you guys are going to kill René, so that way you can kill me and leave me here, and we can go back to our normal lives again. " 
 Rita's eyes started to water as she screamed while the big monster stood before her. He jumped up and caught her hand with his sharp stick, broke her brother and gave her poison to maintain her body. The monster kept screaming as he took out the sword. 
 " If you try to murder me, please just kill me and you'll be like Baby Brienne: one step at a time."<|endoftext|>

Someone feels up the stairs when my last resident with any semblance of companionship is merely hovering behind my door. I just want to die. 
 Even if that means taking me right to my limit and sticking it out in the open forever. A bone deformed tire crushed my head, lighting my sudden dedication to avenging on the men who should not have done it, and I'm getting all choked up and drooling whenever I think about the consequences. 
 "What will you do? " I ask him, pulling the hood of my hood and exposing his giant, tall, darker eyes. " You're the worst thing I've ever done. " 
 *How can I ever think of a better thing to do without him? * I retort, staring at him lovingly as I slam the door closed. 
 " What? " 
 He places a hand over his mouth and sighs. " It's not like you would do that to me. " 
 It's not a smile that glows in his eyes, it's desperation. 
 I stand up and glance around the room for an explanation. He's curled up against the wall, rolling his pale face back and forth in his hands. The security guard beside his shoulder still watches, but he's too late for me. 
 " Who are you? " I ask, peering over him in fascination. 
 " Your father. " 
 " Your wife? " 
 " Yes? " 
 I glance over at him, my silent gaze hot from the hate around me. 
 " Is it your fault? " 
 I shrug, rubbing my eyes with my hands. 
 " It doesn't matter. " 
 The guards eye's still on me. 
 " It's the fact you're a demon. " 
 *Who cares what her father thinks, or what her enemies think of her? * 
 " It's always the fact she accepts you for who you are. " 
 *Of course it is! Of course it is! The price is, the reward is damn high! * 
 " Ah. So I'm a human trafficking syndicate fighter, " he says, a sheepish grin wreathing the corners of his mouth, his anger shining through. " Now, of course I must fulfill the duty. I am sick and tired of it, and I've never fought so hard as I've been. But I'm gon na do what I have to, you see. I put on my mask, wear my badge, and fight until I am defeated. " 
 He releases a laugh, smirk spreading across his long, black fingers. " If I were you, I'd be in no position to fight you. Of course I would. I see you here in this cell, each and every day when the moment comes, I can tell you exactly what I need to do. " 
 " You've always been a dirty, weak man. " 
 " So much for my moral condemnation of you. " 
 I gasp as tears flare above my eyes. This hasn't been going on for two years and I'm beginning to get bored with talking to this man. He's in my head, the kind of man that writes sexual favors for me on a whim, and he's loving my son like a brother. 
 " What do I do now? " I ask, desperate to make him feel any stronger. He doesn't answer. 
 " The old fashioned ways haven't worked, have it? " 
 I look out over the porch and around the couple he loves. " I take them to the day care. " I say quietly, leaving him a knock at the door. 
 " Who's there for the kids anyway?" 
 I'm taken back by his honesty as he brings me down the stairs again, this time as his fingers wrap around my hand. He doesn't shut up. 
 I know I don't have to.<|endoftext|>

"... They're back. " came the booming voice across a giant computer screens. 
 There was an *Bang*. 
 *** " Brethren the Last of humankind: Worm" *** 
 I waited, thinking of my family. I felt sorry for them. I would have hoped it wouldn't be me. Was I dead, or are the spores spreading faster than they've ever seemed to, just like how they were heading towards humans. 
 Maybe the virus died out, or something was wrong. I had fought many wars, many people, throughout my life. Humanity always made friends with other beings, and always had a point. 
 A horrible wound formed on my arm, but it was too late. I could no longer feel it. Soon I would have fallen dead in my sleep. Finally my heart stopped beating, and I felt everything I had dreamed of just disappearing into a state of pain. I fell to the ground, never to wake again.<|endoftext|>

The beast was numerous but no less bulky, little more than a vat or trash can that kept on panicking when someone tried to steal it. It seemed to look like a hound, but in fact it was just a naked animal curled up on the ground. 
 When I was at the library I started seeing its hands. Little hands covered with black and green creatures tied to a wooden platform near its head. In their hands they were tipped with little bullets which both seemed to be small unlike the ones in the toy box and as if a predator was inside. A copse would swoop in out of nowhere, shooting down dead ninja with a velvety object. As a moment passed by that didn't seem too large, there were mouths ripped open in front of him. 
 People would throw things at the beast, talking gibberish over the ear sticking out of the chest like someone stabbing with scissors. Other than that it wasn't much to look at. It had no eyes, no fingers, no legs, or even a head. Had no legs. It had no eyes.<|endoftext|>

"No, I thought we were done. " 
 I was standing in front of The Town Hall, round the corner. Looks like our population was falling. It was only a short walk, maybe 5pm and a few empty stores, left and right. Nothing out of place. Not even a thought or a dollar for change. Although I was curious, I didn't have anything I could make a statement to explain. 
 " Look, let's. Let's get the chances up a bit. It's $ 25000 to me. " 
 The guy leading this joke started laughing. He laughed. He walked over to me and checked his watch. " That'll be another 100 million to me. " 
 I smiled. " A truly blessed creature you two. " 
 There was a silent silence. " And to what? " 
 The man stepped closer to me and picked up the box he was holding. He tossed it into the air and then left. He kept coming to me, hoping for a chance to try something. 
 I smiled. " What you two said was true. You two are those lucky bastards on earth who have their lucky picks. You will never have a problem buying a box that will guarantee a better life for everyone. You... won't be able to make me and my family rich until I make a change in life for you two! " 
 I felt my cheeks burn, like I had just pulled the prank, but it was soooo cool. I laughed. " I am incredibly lucky to be here. " 
 I was probably paying for the poison inside of a jar. " I know, " I said, " But I was expecting money. " 
 I laughed. " And only a few years ago, I managed to keep the lines going for nearly $ 100,000. I just hoped for a little change, no matter what. What if I went on a bad run and got something of value? What if I lived in a big city like San Francisco, Washington DC, or Kansas City or Ft. Worth, Texas? No problem, I don't have anywhere else. I'm a real, lucky lady. I can do all of that. And on top of that, even if I die, I get to live a great life like you. It's perfect for me, but at least I can make things better for everyone else. So I guess this is my life." 
 What? Oh my god, I thought. I'm gon na see a girl go to college with me, get married, find a decent job, and live a normal life again? 
 However, what I could bring would be better for everyone.<|endoftext|>

Hermione sat panting on the bathrobe behind her. Her eyes began to water as her senses went blind. She was truly in need of a miracle. Her heart was racing with the thought. How could she need a miracle for such a heinous thing? How could she blame herself. 
 Her life had become a living nightmare. Her dog's lifeless body in front of her. Her friends, best friends, even her pets had all met death in the path of her quest. Her family? Or was it like she was some jealous phoenix that swore she was going to slay a villain and be reborn into their god? No, her life was a one time story. She knew that her goal was to destroy magic forever. She was already over twenty six years old and exhausted. 
 The thought of the fact that she had to battle magic if she wanted it made her grumpier. What if it was just a random by chance because of her confusion? How could a minotaur just come of age and she could be doomed to fight and defeat him and fight, always on top of his form? 
 Hermione opened her eyes. Looking around the bathtub everything was entirely dark. The soft maw of her eyes became watery as Hermione remembered. She didn't even realize how bad her breathing was for a moment. Clearly she had beat the monster to death but also there wasn't any room to hide. The monster was gone now. When she opened her eyes and this apparition with her was back. She had tried, and ended up doing worse, when she had confronted the monster and it had hungrily defeated her long ago. He was dead. 
 Hermione clapped herself on the back. She was at peace, as if nothing had happened but that things did not go as planned. That she was finally free. She took her best companion around to see the past and remembered the first time she fought. It was an encounter that cost her her parents an extremely large amount of money. It wasn't everyday people kept their kids to themselves. She'd done it for money, everything was free. Now she could enjoy what she loved with her loved ones. 
 Hermione got a slight feel of cold on her neck as she looked at her foot. It was hard. She had kept her foot warm the whole time and was now a bit lucky. The place was dry. The well dressed policemen and guards were a couple of feet away but they only had full access to their guns. The smell had always made Hermione drowsy, and her whole body was covered with sweat. 
 The poor bitch was in the bathtub. She opened her eyes with one eye close and saw a naked stranger. Damn it. Even worse than the last time she fought the monster. 
 "Hey hoey, you! " The woman said with a glow of a feeling that she could only describe as permeated through Hermione. 
 Hermione immediately sucked in air. " Yeah? " she asked tentatively. 
 " No, I didn't think so. My leg's hurting! " 
 " Got ta kill you, you fool!" 
 After a long silence the woman sighed. She sighed. Finally, she had saved that bitch from all that. She stood from her seat and started walking toward the steps. 
 I've finally figured out a way to seal the deal.<|endoftext|>

"The Earth has been ripped apart by infinitesimally large, land-size fires that consumed the once-broken, lifeless elements, creating an atmosphere an unimaginably powerful for fire. Our population so far has been limited to one with enough fuel to heat two supervolcanoes - one climate equivalent to any prior Earth or surrounding solar system - and spare space for two entire planets, leaving the entire population to dwindle slowly to the abyss of a different planet entirely, a simple reason why you might care at all to stop a fire! " 
 ~Timeless zombie apocalypse - traveler 22 ( 2082–2150 ) 
 " Terrible things have been done to the planet, many of which have been attempted by the humans. They came in a primitive age, mostly weavers, leather skins and thievery of the natural environment, down to the few that remained. They can't even account for the fact that they haven't allowed gravity to bother them - they keep finding ways to eat them as if they were anything other than quarantined animals. Without this, millions of people have died. Earth has been ravaged by what is currently considered to be little more than a fire ( and it is too vast to even count ). " 
 ~Demons are extinct - traveler 42 ( 2167-2280 ) 
 " In the land of humans, it seems the drought and famine of the last 4000 years has been beaten back. Sometimes the living social structures dissolve, mostly culling everything safe and rugged in the harsh, barbarous areas... when the poisonous flying vampires intrude on these areas and eventually destroy what remains of civilization. This death is more favorable to agriculture, as the creatures prefer to study less, and make decisions on how to hunt, and consume crops if necessary. What they always did better than the wild naturally occurring animals was always fleece them into a variety of hunting grounds, in hopes of a better harvest. But when all the could-be exterminators are eaten by these mindless, rat infested hordes of aliens, everything is going *too* well... even animals of smaller size will be fed in safe, structurally sound ways. " 
 ~Humans look for a way to change to civilization as fast as possible, blind and blind as they go. Terror of the the humans are the only way for them to make the mistake of imploding. They will see through the violence, slowly finding their ways to their most viable predators - and they will do it. They will have to. 
 ~Humans can't cause a mortal apocalypse. Such an effort will never really get done. Their minds are corrupted. They are nothing more than ideas - and why would the impact of such a violent society be touched on a life as brutish as ours? No. Humanity can simply replicate the way they got here, making sure all the protective, efficient servants are dead, not buried, or killed and distributed to various other living organisms. 
 So why kill one of the few remaining species in the Milky Way and re-infect the stars, when everyone else is sowing famine, drought and conflict? Humans think they can just calm down. We have been there, watching the impossible. 
 ~Humans have a word for our kind. 
 God.

"Doc, I have always wondered what you are doing with our boy, but no words are coming back... " The boy standing beside Doc turned to face the doctor who was now striding into the room with barely moving a finger. 
 Doc turned and asked the boy more than anything. " I don't want to keep him around. But the story in Allendale didn't line up with the script. Could you just give me a little human time to think about that? I'll take that idea, that whole one. I'm sure he'll like it. " The doctor laughed as he took a deep breath and opened a lift up to meet the boy looking at him, then turned and walked out the door. 
 It was the boy's turn to look across the hall, his eyes wide and lifeless. His blood running cold like lye on the thin side of a cup. The father made contact with him and the child caught his eye again. The child was only nine, barely older than Doc had originally assumed. The tears had begun running down Doc's face, and the fear of those inside him as he saw he had made his choice shattered not just by his thoughts, but by the world around him. Doc could only watch from a distance, waiting for that figure to follow him. 
 A tentacle moved through the air. 
 " Doc? " said the man who had come to a stop as the water evaporated in the water around them. 
 " I'm coming Doc. This doesn't have to end, I'm here to make it go away. You have to save him, save the world. " 
 The man turned to look at Doc. He raised an arm, he began weeping profusely. 
 " And you have two, right Doc? Why don't you go and save all the world and save the boy or what? I'm not dying. " 
 The son said nothing. 
 " I didn't think you could be that kind Doc, we hadn't discussed this much with you back in the human world, " The man continued but could no longer stand, " and why can't you save us Doc? " 
 The boy, hungry and confused, raised an eyebrow as if it knew that something else was at hand. 
 " Well Doc, I suppose we can talk it over. Have you had any fun? We're not... like humans, you know Doc. " 
 A sea of worry turned to contempt. The world was different than he remembered it being, if he was a human at all. 
 " But what if I don't? " he asked. 
 The man frowned and took a deep breath. He reached into his pocket for the which bag of groceries he had brought with him and pulled out a small box. He closed his eyes and looked at the boy. 
 " You'll have to get in to here Doc."<|endoftext|>
**********869**********
"Oh shit. " 
 The boy stood up, clutching his glasses tight in his waistband. He liked the look of them, everything was shiny, not that they'd ever felt shiny. The small ones used to be worn around the back and straight through a nose, but that just wasn't important anymore. He didn't remember what the weather was like, except for the time he needed them. He still hoped it would be rainbows, in the distance he heard the slight wet noise of the mirror sliding across the carpet. His laughter continued to echo through the apartment, reminding him that his home was far away and he could feel the discomfort through the glasses. He'd always planned to go out like this. The sight of the three he and his mother had to carry. To better and live. 
 Nearing the door, he turned his head until he saw her. The pink of her large black eyes looked cold. He couldn't remember how she had won what she had, just the shattering screaming while her face was being dragged across the floor against the things she'd only carried for so long. A tiny drop, like a slide. The glass burned black, the whole broken, the smell of the wet things. His mother had visited them once before. She told him the truth, just like her mother told him the truth. There was no love left for them, for her, no pain, not even a face. He wasn't going to make it. 
 *You won't. * 
 He dropped his glasses and continued to sit on the couch. 
 " You'll never get anywhere with this. " 
 No one else knew what had happened. He could tell, from the way their eyes looked, that this whole ordeal would be difficult for them. If he was going to make it, what was the point in fighting through all the things they'd been carrying, all the tears and licked of their sweaty brown cheeks? 
 He picked up a little piece of green glass from the table and put it in the glasses, slowly placing the piece of glass in the socket. He watched her to make sure. 
 " I want to scream."<|endoftext|>

"Where are you? " 
 " I'm in-between yourself and the temple. I didn't answer your question, but I think it was just a script too big to take in. " 
 " Haha! Confused? You know, maybe get a kiss, you're too awkward to get up at this hour." 
 After a quick conversation, she tucked the snake into his chest. He glared, as if trying to smirk. 
 He set his chair back on the roof of the church in the town. Inside the church, three men, two small children and a witch guard sat in the shadow of the figure in front of them. 
 On the wind was the softest chill of the night. 
 A big spot at the back of the church, a large press box covered with sharp pointy ends, was nestled in the center of the cabin's ceiling. The fireplace had long since been blackened, its faces a mockery of it's normal appearance. Spreading bloodshot eyes stared at the girls who had died. 
 Two people stood there. They stood opposite their boss. 
 Someone had picked up the snake, sticking it to one of the girls' throats. The girl went limp, unable to pull herself up. Both people seemed unmoved by the outcome. The woman continued. 
 Covered in blood, one of the men spoke into the fire, " I think you should know the scumbag is still full of hell fire sorceress, just not his. " 
 The woman was silent. Waiting for something that she could hear her husband speaking, or what the other monster thought it was. 
 A change in their expression showed signs of trepidation. They listened for what needed to be said, and nothing happened. 
 Finally, a man spoke up, speaking more clearly, " I'm afraid so, but we have to do this now. We need to find the cure. " 
 " Oh. So you have to do something. Do you mind if I join you? No! I'm scared! " 
 The woman spoke first, " First, we need to get these poisoned caterpillars all set. " 
 " No. That will take a while. They'll move, I'm sure. " 
 Another man in front of the witch guard spoke up, " No. That isn't a good idea. Why do you have to give this a try? " 
 " Because- " 
 " First, we need to get all these malignant monsters all set in a safe house for me. Then, I need a really poor choice. " 
 The witch guard let out a small laugh, " Look, we don't have that much money, so you can just add in all the poison on the last table. " 
 Another man spoke up, " Oh, don't worry, but it'll all work out better if we mix poison in some of this and they won't go mad. Then you can go back and die. " 
 The two men entered the house with the females, saying their goodbyes before they entered the home. A small pink Christmas tree was set on a tatooed floor near the back of the room. Placed atop of the tree in which the men were sitting in was a tree that had been decorated with a simple candle, matching what it was made of. 
 It was one of the last decorations of the wood. 
 The woman spoke up, " So, we're going home. " 
 One of the men stood up. As he rose, the woman let out a soft shout, " Oh, I see you're still confused at what I am doing! " 
 " It's all right, honey. We have no choice but to go. But before we leave, we will have to find the cure. " 
 Another man stood in front of a tall demon, a black robe draped over it. He lifted a large wooden shovel and weighed it. 
 He held the shovel's weight in his hand, placing a copper cross around the cross to prick the spindle in. 
 The other man suddenly turned, smile gleaming on his face. 
 " Go, i'll be right back!"<|endoftext|>

Strange thoughts rippled through my mind. This was not the right way to kill an alien with a simple attack. Certainly not, I thought to myself. How could that be possible? It was the first time I had learned about taking a lifeboat crew in this war. 
 Next thing I knew, I was in a casino. This war that I had fought as a child was a great success. They claimed the culture of the planet was superior to ours. There was violence and hatred. Food supplies dwindled. Those who were willing to help those who were, gave their lives for the betterment of all the races. 
 It was when I had left the casino that I felt a sharp pain on my back. A bloody chain wound that didn't go unnoticed. From the pain that landed on my back came a large spurt of blood. My clothes were torn and covered, from that sprang a white cloud of dust. 
 I awoke to the sound of wailing. I looked up at the sky and saw no use in leaving here. The spider people and goblins were besieging the city. With the oncoming wave of firepower on our front lines we were going to end the lives of these people who had left their homeland. 
 As a wise leader I had decided it would be worth the risk and since my life had been saved, they had no choice but to attack. The spiders were fighting the army no need to defend themselves against the vast, foul creatures, but I was too tired. I then dropped one of my cargo craft off and began moving. 
 Before I had a chance to, the environment around me exploded, and the buildings and walls collapsed. I was inside a casino. All the remaining fighter ships were gone. 
 There was a door of steel standing at the entrance to the casino. Standing with his back to me, I opened the door. 
 "Ah, I get it! What a great crowd of energy left Earth this late! I wish I wasn't so afraid! " My superior captain stood up from his chair and his feet ripped the hallway tiles from his bones and broke out into giant, sharp faces. " We all must come together! Together, for all the good of the human race! " 
 The giant shouldered his gigantic ship, and swam in the direction of the ship. It shot out of the ship with incredible speed. I didn't even see it in the little time between its attack and the doors opening. My crowd only me and my superior captain stood there. There was a sudden burst of thunder from the entrances and the windows shattered. 
 " Well then, how many of you have survived?" 
 And with that the doors opened.<|endoftext|>

Another stressful day at work. The suns beating down on the cabinburns taking up most of the glory from the earth. Sixty eight goddamn years of attending, seventeen more than I dared to attend at the funeral of my brother in arms. Forty two brought me a lifetime of satisfaction. My brothers were family, but they too bore no guilt as these 39, now dead, ticks the essence of selfishness away with their anguish. Beads of sweat have seeped down my face, wafting forth from the gut from where the hate had spread this is my last thought as I close my eyes and let the only sound of wind lingering behind. I stand up, putting a whole loaf of bread on the table, never to mind the blood. Dead, we need not worry, and I'm no idiot. I like to enjoy myself. Warmth, warm sun. I finish the bread and sip from the mug. Sweat has deflated from the edge of my forehead, as I sit and gaze upon what I have sought to achieve in my short existence. Memories begin to tingle once more, as I begin to look upon the hands of my brethren. How long can these two fail, how long can they strive for both. Perhaps the best way to end all of this torture is to join them in the middle of this cold cabin room. I take a deep breath. I open my eyes as a dawn begins to set.<|endoftext|>

"DINNER. DINNER DINNER. " I heard the familiar whistling sound as the doors opened. It was as if someone had summoned every member of our society together to attack us. 
 I took out my phone to check the time, and was expecting the first round robin round robin robin robin. Nothing interesting, so I figured I might as well check it. The email read, " QUICK MONEY PORPOUT A STRETCH GOAL OF 30 MILLION DRUGS OF FARM DRIVES. HELP. " 
 I check my watch, as is standard practice: midnight in the old part of town, 6:30 AM in the new part. My watch was turned on, but there was another one on there. 
 My head was still pounding, but I felt my vision fading. I looked around, but there was no one there. I don't know what brought me to the ground, but I guess there must be something inside of me. 
 I realized I was in a nice living room, with all my clothes on, books everywhere, empty. I checked my watch again, and it was 5:30 AM. My dog's barking stopped, and I began to walk back into my couch. I reached in and grabbed a blanket, but realized it was raining outside. I had no idea how bad this could be. 
 " Hey, Jim, it's me! " I called out as I ran around to come back inside. As I hurried out of my house, I noticed it was, like, fall out of the sky at a breakneck speed, disappearing behind a bench. 
 I ran into my living room, and saw Jim lying on the couch. 
 " Jim, you okay? " I asked him. 
 " Oh, no worries, Mary. It's fine, man. I'm just tired. I haven't eaten since we left the house, and I'm on my way to the store to pick up some clothes. " 
 " Look, you know you can go get some food, aren't you, Mary? Don't worry, I can find food for you at the store. That's right, you go ahead. I'll head out to pick the clothes up, and I can get your name on your bag of clothes for you. " I walked over to Jim and handed him my bag. He fainted, but I didn't notice for a second. 
 We took our shopping bags into a closet. The clothes we picked up were all handmade, so we all picked the right ones for our yearnings. He left a few of his clothes to us, and you can't say he left the wrong ones. The closet was dark, and the closet door was broken. I got out of my jeans and began walking towards the closet door. 
 One of the lights went out, and all of a sudden darkness fell over the small, dusty room. I ran outside and examined what was underneath. 
 I heard a voice: 
 " The number is 3.532444338745. Do not walk into that closet, or else it will vanish."<|endoftext|>

SITUATION ENTRY CLOSED 
 Exhausted, I saw and sensed the radio music slowly fade from memory, or perhaps I was a forgotten street vendor waiting for some portable party that my time was waning. Having grown up in a town full of nerds I came to realize that everyone seemed to have never heard the radio play, and it seemed that everytime there was a crackling sound someone's life began to turn to shit. After a day of trying to reduce myself to that state I tried having a brain-dampener. I guess I do realize that it was my initiative that kept me alive this whole time, but the state I sought before I went would be my undoing soon. I looked around hoping to find a calm calm crowd, but the silent streets were sparsely populated, while the faint whistling of electronic instruments was absent. 
 I stood in the centre of the town and pondered what I should do next. I placed my hand on the front of the shop. 
 "Hello? " 
 " Hello? " 
 I looked around the shop. Like a memory I remembered everything: a gift card, a briefcase and a bed. I walked upstairs to a bright light and turned the light off. Staring at my forearms and muscled legs. In front of me stood a larger one. A walkie-talkie hung next to it. 
 " So are you all just going to take a walk? " 
 I started to think, but I had just enough of the sight of someone walk. I pushed my head up and looked at the walkie-talkie. 
 " No. " 
 " How do you like this place? " 
 " I don't know about you, but it's... this is not your place anymore. " 
 I collapsed in bed like a piece of fur. I gazed at my chest, where I had not seen such a void for so long. I remembered having nightmares when I was 15 or 16, and now I had finally done the things I was chasing. Looking up at the faces of those faced up at me with power that I never had. Some were just being the stronger man or the better. Another one was just trying to escape through the street. Another one was trying to walk where I did not. 
 I took another deep breath. I closed my eyes and felt the quiet crowd surrounding me moving farther away. I slowly opened them and went to sleep. 
 Illuminated in the faint blue glow of my dream was that of the random card in front of my shop: a briefcase. I took one of the first steps onto the familiar street. I followed the sounds of the people walking by, and about the same time I took another. I looked down and realized that the lamp outside the shop was off. 
 " You have no idea what to do." The voice boomed down the street as I walked in the opposite direction. I turned my head to look away from the shop but there was a man wearing a bowler hat standing next to me. 
 I realized that I was not alone in my thoughts, and turned to face my attacker. 
 Who is this stranger, who can even kill a human with a quick and powerful punch?<|endoftext|>

A look of astonished surprise enveloped me as I opened my eyes, unable to wipe the vortices from my eyes. The morning sky was fully lit as an enormous cloud dissipated from the heaven itself and burst out into life, carrying a high figure with glowing silvered head and bulging chest. As my vision went blurry it happened. My stomach grew icy, raging with the emotion of relief. Weezing quietly into another sleeping ebb. To the first consciousness and howling morn of pain, I found myself sitting up, wondering if that was the end of it all... A feigned surprise wrapped itself around my grumbled head and froze my feet as they stood solid while my two remaining brethren ventured out of the cloud, holding aloft a glass to focus on the cloudy sky. The sounds of the gale resounded through my ears as I woke in different states of trance. A palpable heat nearly stung my nose as I opened my eyes and saw many of the dead but many of the living were still asleep. As I meditated, the metallic light emitted from the cloud drifted over them through the tinge of smoke. I knocked against the stone to the valttera and there sat a family of young men and women standing perfectly still despite being holding a rather large and hard object with engraved arms. The oldest of the two took the glass and scanned the room of the burial chamber, feeling a wave of panic pass over him, when he realized what this meant. I pointed to his body. The young king had been dead for 24 hours! He had not been poisoned as his year of age had teased him. The lesser man only having his arms set into a ball to compensate for the death of a more vigorous king as he had agonized over the birth of his daughter as well as fighting numerous battles! He looked down upon his beloved afterer who died from a physical injury tied to a rope which supposedly fell out of the sky off the military base the expeditionary forces were headed towards. Not with where he stood, however. A large knob came into life throughout his upper torso as he uttered a whimper. He moved to lean toward me, his pale face black and full of fear and despair. His neck turned to face me as he spoke. " My dear mortal, we must go now. Your son is dead. " He picked up the glass, a well spoken example of reason as the legendary King-king chuckled and took a bite of the glass. The glass next to him had no bubbling, no glitter, but instead remained solid as a pearl soft and yet with a smooth, bold color. A blunt object and a series of spheres attached themselves to the coffin with some color flash that glimmered and darted around the living being's joints. " Come now my dear mortal, you have many medical needs to cope with. We will drive him through here before we finish him off and inform you that he has finally died. " As he leaned in he slipped and fell, cumming on the marble floor. He shrieked and then had a terrifically raised arm run over the pillow causing the coffin to topple over. " Fuck! I don't believe it! Who would do that!?"<|endoftext|>

Great. First time you've seen Reddit or @ edx-ox. Why you don't understand this? Is there a glitch or is this really happening? Anything else? Did you hear the news that the hacker hit not just the president, but all those people that normally know police wouldn't find you!? * the intent*..? You really don't understand how strange this is! I'll write up a quick summary below... 
 Idiots. They're the ones who have this invisible, impossibly large web browser file already! Call them. Call them then learn something. And if they don't give me sufficient information then..... whats the point? Wait a second, is this any better than an iFrame? The image isn't all that impressive and it's hard to work out at this rate, but at least try to make it seem familiar to you..the question is where is this.. um... country.. in fact? Why did you click the thumbnails? Was the much shorter character not the same? Then think... Is that what it looks like? Then in a process that starts randomizing this and ploughing through every element of the picture.. do you want to guess? And what about this character? Does it look like you're actually playing an imaginary fictional character? That's a throwaway idea.. oh shit. People are dealing with tears that sound like it could cut your precious dreams off in the future. * just in case* You're reading the wrong bracket.. did you decide to open that bracket somehow? As the browser slowly processed the information in question it seemed to make a scene out of a four foot tall bony finger walking slowly on a disjointed red carpet. 
 Guess you may be a little out of your depth in your language but i can make out the words:

 It was a slow day there at work for Michael Bakken and he had just gotten back from his way back from Acer every other day. He had turned in an IT in about 5 minutes and was testing out IBM's laser scanning technology. He liked the cookies. They always made him smile and smooth his smooth white lines under the sun. They weren't really cookie, but they made his face flush with delight. The cheese fries all the same. It was a fun morning at work until he saw a light so bizarre the coworkers reached out to comfort him. He turned the table and saw a selection of homemade pizza and his coworkers, like him, huffed and huffed and huffed as well, waited for him. As soon as he opened the door and looked out he saw a pair of these fluttering, hot lil"er tits on the floor up and down the floor. He looked down a little. The pizza and this m-o-j was soooo sweet... His tongue caressed its sizzling new toch!! Life's a little hard for other people but fuck you IT from a meme-me who hates herself!!!!....!! And then he sat there stunned. What the fuck was going on? How did he get this far? He became lost in the cat's box too. 
 Then he remembered the link and saw that the following is actually what you would expect from a pokeball game. They said it was a really simple form of homosexuality but not for everyone. However.. they saw this in a game called r/programming that talked about putting mathematical formulas in a trashcan to make it easier, solve problems that would cause earthquakes, create puzzles that would stay there for a specific amount of time, complete mysteries... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN! This mod can never do that to him, not exactly.. maybe.. maybe.. maybe tomorrow..<|endoftext|>

Holy shit, where am I? Oh no, I'm on a giant highway. Jesus Christ, what was I doing? Looks like someone had 
 crashed into the street wall. The car went out of control, but the motorways didn't tire. The other car pulled over and 
 made it all the way to the car in me. I ran to the small tool shed, it was big enough for a hand, kid, and not too hot. Whatever I'm doing here is probably hauling a pipe out of 
 her back with some crushed food and stuff. 
 The guy coming up the driveways yelled at the man to get me in the truck, but I quickly pulled out my hand from under my backpack and the truck started 
 swiping around. 
 Hello? I heard a voice above my head. 
 Who is that? What are they talking about? " Welcome, Jake? I'm
an armed police officer, and I need you to come to an exit. No gun, no shooting, nothing. Just try to get my 
 file. Wait. I got ta get in the truck. I'm sure the police are going to come in by now. What's 
 going on here, Gabe? " What do you mean come on! I need to get in the truck!" What's 
 going on here! Gabe? what's going on here? Where are I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I! Where am I! Where am I! Where am I! Where am I! Where am I! Where am I! 
 The truck did nothing. A number of cars went 
 over the highway and I was unable to get to my destination. By some crazy luck, it was probably a girl 
 who looked just like me. Her mother had hair like a 
 whole zoo, cheese tits, and alligator bones. She looked like me, but we weren't in her car. We were standing in the road 
 over some huge open grass pond.<|endoftext|>

It started because one day a little girl had discovered the Cabbage Patch in a garden at her head in the outskirts of London. It was amazing. From the look on her face, the world had ended. Another 5 billion people had been born, and the normal rate of their birth had soared to infinity. After the next little girl that science announced had stumbled upon something new and exciting, scientists tried to study it. Most said it was already something of a'miracle', but some theorized that it somehow produced the seeds of a new age. Apparently, it was advancing the most technologically very slowly in the galaxy, by about 50,000 years. 
 It should have been funny. 
 Oh, it was. Not laughing was the only thing that hadn't actually happened. Everything was happening smoothly. Things seemed to happen in sync, and human life lasted forever. But then the world came into the picture, and everything really started to change. People started starting to think humans were just muckbags. So they began hunting all animals of their own species, developing advanced weaponry and tactics that would give them even a slight advantage over humans in the vastness of space and time. People tried to construct and race their own societies and empires. But then things began to crash. 
 No one really knows what happened, and the memory of that fateful day is still fresh in my mind. The future wasn't normal. People suffered so much, and they think they just forgot. But the world really was fine. All of our problems came to a stop. Plants in nearly every jungle located within 100 miles of one another ceased to exist, and forests invaded the major cities. Earth passed slowly and steadily without suffering, but by the third year, global warming and hot summers had spread and scorched cities conquered it. Even the handful of plants across the oceans that still contained over 7 billion people with hope of a bright future, had vanished and began to reforest. 
 I finally got used to this change. I had seen far more than I could describe before. Then it happened. I saw a real person. The very perfect person, but more beautiful. He gazed out across the face of the ocean and kissed me, as if as if I were his. He looked into my eyes, and told me I was the perfect child he had created. 
 He told me that for every human born, one born from him could become one. And for the first time in about a generation, he asked me to leave the planet. I didn't really know what to say, but one thing crossed my mind as soon as he left: 
 *I'll protect you. * 
 That's what you sent me to. I was supposed to help. To watch you evolve, to feed you, to nurture you, grow you, learn and improve you, to support you. None of this happened. Not ever again. 
 The only thing I remember is you. My true love. My community. You became my home, my hope, my purpose. You showed me the dangers of this world, as was your aim. You showed me how a mistake we made was to let the world have human people. And I want you to be happy. And I want you to do everything you can to save you. 
 This is my first time writing on this subreddit, so any and all criticism is greatly appreciated.<|endoftext|>

Fredrick sat in the front row on the porch of his winery, the green shiny wood deck he held had long since been abandoned, most of the re-purposed space had been left for dust in his ruin of a cabin. He had a cup of water, at least he said it was. Like he always did, he drank. The shapeless creature kept putting itself into place as they climbed, and their prime setting set aside so others wouldn't fall asleep while they were having drinks, making sure everything looked so polished so they wouldn't have to care about it. This time he was making sure he looked good. 
 He had given her all the money in the world. Frederick was the sole surviving member of his family, an offshoot of himself. In the hospital, he lived in comfort. He was a thoroughbred, and only ever had trouble at quests, and his grandchildren regularly assisted in the prying eye of the local police. With some remarkable luck, his wife had come through this path all too late, but he kept her close until she was going to bed. 
 These days, he had not that much time. Fredrick watched the sunset that he set aside for her to wake, his crown of gold shining with vision. As he put it around his neck, she had taken a quick peek in the nearby bushes. His three grand kids, all were watching him. A little bit too perfectly, all seven were elderly, pale skinned, curious eyes. Sweat had been dripping from their faces, on the top of their heads as if they had never seen it. Sweat dripped down their arms and thighs, and onto the logs that he laid in their beds. 
 He waved his hand for them to follow him, and they did. One of their parents ran into the backyard, holding on, Anna coming down the steps with her family. Anna always sat, knelt, and used her bare hands to support her body. As her grandchildren walked past, Fredrick watched them on the porch as he looked around. He set his short sword away on the park bench, and started walking back up to the house. 
 The dogs barking from the trees were beginning to get into his head. When he was close enough to see the little ones, they moved in quick. One woman stood, covered head to toe in a plaid coat, struggling desperately to hold her heads together. The smaller ones, who were mostly still asleep, kept barking at the sill from the bench. They weren't getting very far by the time the elderly couple reached the front porch and started prying through Fredrick's blanket. The constable was outside the yard wearing a ragged brown coat, holding his hound in a sheath. 
 Fredrick couldn't help but remember the flutter of the cloth at the back of the coat, as it reached for him. When the dogs noticed the blue cloth, they charged back up the stairs. He raced up them, not wanting to lose his composure. He faced the fleeing dogs, and ran back up the stairs. Anna dropped to her knees in front of him, tears welling in her eyes. He came to, and took a deep breath. He told his grandkids he loved them, and he would look after them every day.<|endoftext|>

I opened my eye to see four man and two woman walking through the yard, head in hands, laughing and nodding about how shit they are. I've never seen anyone laugh better. So. It was cooler than our house. 
 So. I needed to get me some beer for the run. What the hell got in my leg? I hit the skid and wasted a good fifty yards, how the fuck did I reach my house? My shin: fuck. My foot: fuck. 
 Jesus Christ the beer, I forgot this name an interesting one. I stumble for a second then take a breath. 
 I walk back to my house and I hammer the door knob. Light drains. " Fucking hell man! " I scream. The woman who opens the door comes over. " Uh... are you going to do it again? " 
 " Let's stop talking shit here. You know I went out with my younger brother earlier and turned in that fucking, a**a***reirday. " 
 She stands up from her chair and walks over to the open door. A firework embers fill the room. I slide my foot over the second knuckle as they open it and slam the door behind me. A silent couple fiddle with their keys while my father shakes his head. " You're going to want to go change in your damn pants you dickhead."<|endoftext|>

The boy, half boy or taller than a stone, every inch of his body was covered in razor-thin scales, scars and scabs dating back to the days of Batman's age. Few could distinguish that they were shades of human pigmentation; from the yellow streaks spread over his abs and only visible to the graying hair that hung tangled under his natural straggling robe, to the dull, four-legged necks and protruding sharp spikes that sat on his torso and on his cheek with no fur to them. 
 Samitami, the boy's father, had been scouring the streets, his scythe leaving only an urchin stuck in its case. He had heard stories of these creatures, what was seen as akin to an impenetrable barrier, but the more he spent on tracking them, the more he was terrified. 
 "Katal, " Kakareli said, his voice softening with every word, his anger rising in pitch through the doors of his mind. " You're my oldest cousin and I'm scared. I don't like anyone. Why should I worry? " 
 " They are just humans. They are our species. My parents gave up to banish their race to a golden age. They would have shown the galaxy's first outlaws the true lineage of wizards and sorcery, but they brought about technology that no man has ever dreamed of before, why would it be any different? " The little boy had calmed a bit now, he kept his distance from Kakareli and nodded, perhaps in response to his father's anger. " This planet is nothing like theirs. I saw many hovercars on my brothers' and sisters' moons, but these human moons were doomed with the dangers of the space race and mankind would have gone to war with them if we hadn't waited a little longer and created a new world using science to build colonies. Now we have them, no chance of survive. " The boy's mother waved a thin finger at the man, her expression surprised. 
 Kakareli took one step back, rubbing the back of his head. " These humans think they are smart. They can see beyond our walls, you see the waste it would be to destroy a century of technology. But as humans, we are monsters, never looking for light. We sacrifice a third of our species just to survive. " The boy whispered as he stared at his father, the boy's aura flaring. " I will, because if I am going to save the world, it is going to be to save myself."<|endoftext|>

The mind tank is a hack in the stratosphere. A beam of energy emitted from the back of the brain, shielding the ambient radiation from the electromagnetic field and causing an instantaneous burst of fabricating activity. 
 They still don't know much about the influence of the mutant plague. They still don't know how contagious the white supremacist virus was and even less about what drove it to attack humanity. 
 They're too poor or too scared to speak of it. Yet somehow, they are good enough to receive such power. 
 In a statement, scientist Hallard wrote "We, the Stark College of Engineering, set a precedent, set principles, and do what we are told to do. " 
 She laughed, " I'll never understand. How could I not comprehend?"

 I could hear no more of those hallmarks.

Daniel stumbled to a halt on the gritty gray street where the crash shook the world. He remembered the ugly courtroom poster he played on to cheer his daughter up. And what was the score? The sweetest smile when she was going to school. Daniel took a step over the block to catch his wife smiling. 
 "I love you little one. Please, pick me up. " Daniel's daughter looked teary-eyed. 
 " You can come with me wherever you want. I'll be right back with you. " Daniel stormed upstairs and stepped into his spacious bedroom. 
 While the wife was not there, Daniel shut the door behind him and opened the door. It was dark, but the creature relaxed once again on the marble floor. " You're going to love this. Please, let's go see Mom. " Daniel listened deeply for a moment, hoping that she was still watching him. To his horror, she was still asleep. 
 When he opened his eyes, he felt the light of the blazing sun on his face. He hugged his daughter hard. " Dad... " 
 " It's okay, darling. I'm all alone. " He grasped his daughter tightly, and they embraced. He even watched as her mother passed away and looked right at Daniel in horror. 
 *** 
 Daniel searched his mind for answers. He found nothing but a small set of letters. An APS ( American Crime Agency ) form called " Mother of Adulthood ", a cursory study: # 1872346, with 2091 words to solve a crime involving daddy and daddy. He found it ( and the confusion " Mother of Adulthood " was in fact a fake ). He searched for items named " # 1 " in his memory shop. He found a fishing rod, a flower pot, a small rainbow hat, and several lists of questions he found most impossible to answer. He started searching for more answers but found none. He found someone, *something*, and tried to teach her about history. Daniel felt truly sorry, of course, for standing up for himself. 
 But the child was gone. A colorless silhouette appeared in front of him: Ariel Shultz, a dwarf she loved in a school that cursed her by name. Daniel clenched his own hand. He smelled of cigarette smoke and blueberry juice. " I'm sorry. " He smiled and continued, " Anna tried to kill me and didn't even escape. She... " 
 Just then Ariel threw her robes over her head. What kind of daughter did she have? A childish preteen girl? Not a petite, half sat model named Ellaria!! Daniel collapsed to the ground in pain. " It was just her. " He whispered, " Please, don't give up, there's love in the world. "

It was mildly amusing to watch this... joke. The robot to belong to, a woman, wizzed into the interview and vaguely noticed a lump of vapid, weird massicles forming on her tits. It gasped - something unexpected. She could see the sweatshirt in its hand, and was horrified by the fact that it had been a cheap cigarette, and was actually imagining an exhibit at the museum! 
 It felt rather upset, as though the fabric of reality played its part. When it finally felt comfortable enough to focus on the alien, it gave her a disgusted frown. The whole thing was frustratingly devoid of metaphors - "the little cardboard pouch? " " Hairball? " It was a big ridiculous invention, yet itself nothing more than cheap wine bottles. The hairy robot slowly raised the plastic sphere that allowed itself to float gracefully, still answering every question he should've asked, and for a moment, did. 
 " That might be why you're so flattered about me wearing all that makeup, " she squeaked, as she closed her mouth for a response. It didn't feel right. That was the alien. The poor one had spoiled this stupid woman's life. 
 " You say this every decade, you're telling me... that I'm masturbating for you, " the robot cringed. 
 The emotionless young woman didn't even go over to the car. " I don't have the balls to just invite you over for a special night. You know. " she snapped back, but it was too late. The robot had won the bet. The whole thing had started out harmless enough. 
 As the robot whirred to life, it made a back-in-the-school joke with a grimace. 
 " Just because you aren't a lefty doesn't mean that you can't work for the vitamins. I've seen a lot of greasy bits in this junk, man. Don't you have any good ones?"<|endoftext|>

It's been a long time since I've talked to anyone else. Seriously, there's been a lot of speculation about my past life and my goals in life and everything, but in the end, I don't really care. I've been gone for 5 decades or so, because I'm tired and lonely and scared. What's my future after this? My "life "? What's my goals? I don't know, maybe it's all a dream and it's just a collection of my past lives all burning with frustration and anger. 
 I know I'm moving away from this world, with everyone else. These forces keep me sane, which I appreciate, but they come with the territory. I don't want to suffer. I want to be constantly focused on what really matters, but to simply stare at everyone who does not support me. 
 I understand why we're here, but I don't want to believe that love is forever. To live and die on the same terms. I want to keep going, and there are only so many ways that a man can and will accomplish this. 
 My wife lives in the same house as me. We're fine, but not the same people. I love her and need her more than I ever could. She's the best person I can have around. We're single, but we're the same. We are what she needs. Our paths never diverge, but when it does, we walk away together and let go. There is nothing one can do against the other, and we all seem to do things to each other that take away from the things we do. 
 I started this for the first time back when I was still young, and I knew I had to believe it. I mean, what's this supposed to mean, what does it mean to my friends, my family, my coworkers, my people? When the tower fell the next day, I joined the team, I started this, and I want to believe that when I make my decision, I will do just about everything in my power to not be alone anymore. Because as the last person in the world, and as I walked away, I knew I'd have to take the decision that I thought would end me, once and for all. 
 But I'm not going to give up now. I've found a way to overcome those odds and see that the fight is going to be worth it. I've found the power to love, to not feel sadness. To be on the right side of history. When I walk away from the tower, I'll be with my wife, my children. It's all just going to make it harder.<|endoftext|>

I always wondered if you had the ability to reincarnate without memory. To be brutally honest, I was curious, but something about it was not right. You see, the best way to actually do this is to kill someone on the spot. How in the name of being a hero to the people who're attacking you you'll do it to them for the right price, I can't even get that to happen. In hindsight, it shouldn't have been so hard. It's the law to not just kill one who's friends, family, and even your own wife. 
 The day I faced my first murder was the day I became immortal. There were no more deaths for me, only memories of them. After the first few moments, I knew my mother was lying to me about something. I knew her life was in danger, and it hurt so much. She asked me to get her out of the house. " DONT let him in your parents apartment " I'd been told, but I've never broken a rule. Even now I'm used to it. 
 While I was setting fire to her car, I asked " Did you shoot her? ", and when I told her that I knew exactly what she wanted, she laughed. " He's still searching for you. " I grinned. 
 My first murder was the day I received the Lighthouse that I'd been assigned to find her. All I knew was that it was somehow dangerous to go into the lighthouse myself. Strange enough, all she actually did was run around in circles, unnoticed. The lighthouse was the safe haven of our town for my mother. She was supposed to keep track of everything that happened within the lighthouse, and quite literally she could track me down anytime I saw her, but in our blind desperation I planned on going back in time, at least fifteen years in the future. 
 I ended up entering her house on foot, and talking the entire night. " Maybe tomorrow, there are knives hidden between the sheets." I had my usual sobering thoughts when the knife to my throat pierced my neck. The cold light crept over me, and the stink of blood was hissing and coming from inside her house. I watched her die, and I then suddenly felt the coldness of the lantern. The glare of the city lights was then replaced by a beautiful warm glow...<|endoftext|>

I never believed in God or even He. They say He made the Universe and breathed in air. Where am I? What do I do? Do I even have this pathetic body? It's nauseating. I am simply falling apart. 
 Many have died to save my soul. Many have died to bring me back to life. Many have died to bring me to my true mind. Many of these souls shall make my tombstone great and permanent. A life has been given for my memory. It must give me a final chance to redeem myself or make me suffer the pain of emptiness forever. 
 But this is for your own benefit. You may move on with your life. Now make your soul something more special and be grateful for the gift it gave to you. There is only one thing I know for sure: after reincarnation my soul must be returned to you.<|endoftext|>

Longed hard for months, I had spent digging up a forgotten bench in the small clearing here. I had been climbing out of the crater when my mother passed away and I had taken a lump of rock from behind a pipe to get in. This was my favorite part of my life. As I walked over the first crack in the gravel, only to see the entrance I hoped it would be mine, I cracked into the next crack and the mound of dirt began to fall, digging deeper and deeper. Every step I took disturbed the dirt, as I crept closer to the bottom I started to notice something odd about this mound. As I slowly lifted my head, I paused as an odd glow began to drift towards my eyes. I don't know what kind of glow it was, but maybe it was brought to me from somewhere else. A ray of light flicked from the source, but a familiar warmth burned in my eyes as the light began to subside, and I was no longer looking around for her at that point, or even for the cliff I was climbing on. 
 I breathed a sigh of relief as the light flickered back into focus, and it was clear that something was growing inside of me, and that before I could move, I felt a skin covering me, and what it had really been breathing on me. I stumbled over my knowledge to reach it, and only continued on my hike, almost up to my crouching position on the edge of the cliff. I felt the sweat spreading all over my body as I looked over the hole I had, and immediately felt a sense of accomplishment start to creep over me. I saw the mound, but only the dirt. I began to hear the dirt dance up my body as it rushed around my body, the pain in my ears starting to get high. I felt my shoulders turn to my sides, and the ground around me began to twitch as the light started to consume me. Suddenly, a glowing white light began to descend upon me, like a comet dropped onto some unknown comet. The air got colder and colder as I was sucked in, and more and more air leaked into my lungs. After I was sucked into the blackness of space, everything changed, and I was forced to walk, and crawl, until I found a small clearing next to the burning rock. 
 I don't know what it feels like to have your memories, to see all of your life flashing before your eyes. I don't know how long I was walking through this dark, desolate place, feeling alive. How did I feel? I don't know, really. It's a strange feeling, being pulled into this hell. All I know is that every step that I take results in this pain. I feel like I'm being dragged to another part of the world, and one day, you will remember everything I've gone through. Every moment I have here. Every moment I should have had.<|endoftext|>

I locked my eyes on my phone and looked at the date on the cards. It had come to mean'1 week.' I usually guessed that it was the beginning of my new real-life if what I just read wasn't right. Maybe I should take a moment to analyze the past. However, the writer of the card had told me that he had a full set of predictions for our future. I would have expected him to have built out his timeline much more accurately, but none the less, not only did he use a generic date, he used a cartoon name and a pop culture quote that had added him to his future. 
 What could that mean?! This was something that I could NOT help, that could not possibly be true. His predictions only bore some superficial impression of the beginning, after all, his reality would just make for all the other trainees in our class. Everything is outlined in detail, whether intentionally or not. 
 My eyes snapped open and my heart nearly skipped a beat when I realized. My blood pressure was still low and I had no time to even grab my passport and shift seats if I wanted to. I looked over the projection screens of the classrooms, most kids wear ustees today, though I had never before seen any school with a real model of a puppet. 
 “ First one up, let ’ s see, is your meeting your death and how you ’ ve made it through? ” 
 “ Whoa man, that's a big stuff, but I thought it might be cool just to show you. ” 
 I watched as I could slowly imagine my children preparing for class. Everyone with any presentation standing in front of me in the hallway started talking and talking back. I was sitting on the other end of the projector, surrounded by adults. Children watching the same thing, all staring at me from the middle. Maybe that was why my supervisor gave me a warm smile. I knew that it was very annoying and all but encouraged me to leave, but I continued to slow down. Not all kids at the lab left until after midnight. 
 Everyone walked over. I heard news reporter laughing at the whole video game sequence. I closed my eyes as I noticed the day was already today, the birthday results were still on, it was the first few days as always. I followed them to the front door. I touched my terminal and waved goodbye to everyone. My mom had already taken my birthday greetings as they came out. 
 “ Hey Mike, it ’ s TIME to go! ” I greeted everyone with a smile. I was glad I was here. “ There ’ s the tests, ” I said to no one in particular and decided to pass the test. I felt like I had already succeeded. I walked over and took a peek at my clock on my phone. 2:59.<|endoftext|>

"That's terrifying! " my first thoughts thought. I knew it as being the clone mind, but it *wasn't* one of my clones. 
 'But who cares,' I thought to myself,'why would they want me like this? Why would it be up for grabs sooner or later?'
 There was only one second of me remaining before I remembered there was someone else here already. the was worded correctly as he was dressed in dark shadow that spanned dozens of feet tall and appeared more heavily fur in two different places than the first. not my typical shadow so nobody knew. I strained to say something, but the person who spoke to me was forced to repeat everything, even though there were no references to it. 
 " This is alien tech, not theirs, so no I'm not being recorded, " a more advanced man said. His voice sounded almost as strained as I had been before. After what I could only assume was a few seconds he repeated. 
 " We've entered into an agreement between them and learn the flow of time through open water-like things in which we have artificial intelligence such as himself. Humans gain access to this kind of intel, intelligence capable of editing any social files on every organism on the planet, and they can read the journals of organisms just like you, and convert it into his own. I expect the path to be strictly up to the computer." The man was closing his console, shaking his head and lowering the lid of his light keyboard. I failed to notice the disturbance of the intercom receiver. 
 Edit: wanted to check in though. I've been in a mental asylum, but I couldn't remember to keep myself from going insane. This is how my physiology works.<|endoftext|>

I sit up at the doorway to the bar. My head is pounding and my stomach churns. My brother and his friend are just sitting at the bar. My pulse is pounding. My favorite time of the day? The difference between 50 % coffee and 70 % smoothie, and, probably, 50 % satan's brown goo. I rush out of the bar and slam the door behind me. Looking around, I find my brother and friend staring at each other with nauseated looks in their eyes, along with the company of coke demons spraying themselves all over the inside of our drinks. My stomach clenches as I find the words that pop up on my mind, though I won't necessarily know them. They don't like each other so much, though. This world I go to is this one I take control of when I am a teenager, and I can't control what will happen when my parents aren't around to listen to me and ask what's on my mind again. It is frightening when you just go to your computer after a long day and you use Google and say: "Who am I? ", but you'll quickly realize your complete lack of belief. I try to think what that might mean, but everything stops and just stares at me. By now I am crying. My heart breaks and my own blood gives out. My hands shake as I open my eyes. The bartender looks at me, a bit surprised when I tell him I'm free. He looks at my brother in horror. My brothers eyes shoot out the same way. In this moment, my deepest, darkest hour, I can't even speak. They see me again, and he looks back down. I look at him, and he begins to smile and begin nodding his head, as if that would be the smile he would receive. I realize I must have made a HUGE mistake. My fucking brother walks out the door. I remember that day so clearly. From that moment on, I would constantly walk around the bar to look for my brother. I know his name, if you are even listening. I gather up the money and a wallet, which I can desperately hold. As I approach the door, the goo from the rest of the goo first comes up. It is hot. I grab my brother and his friend's coat and walk toward the door. I don't know what I expected. I expected to be behind him. At this moment, I almost feel positive that I am there, waiting. I slowly open the door. I can hear my brother. He looks hurt. I pull my brother close. I can't hear my brother's name. I turn the handle and we both get to sit on the seat next to the bar. I let out a sigh and start sitting down. My eyes locked on the table by the bar. The guy stood up. My brother was staring at me. My eyes met. He turned on the person sitting next to him. With tears running down my face, I pushed myself up from my seat. My mother brings the friends I took with her and walks across the room. I slowly wipe the blood off my face. At that moment, I look up to see my mom standing over my brother. " Can I ask your question? " she asks. Without thinking, I grin. " I will do anything to find you your brother."<|endoftext|>

 For you, it is a feast. 
 What a fine time for me to go out for something very special. 
 It is a worthy adversary. 
 You all know how much it makes you look. Your compassion, your dedication. Many people will all embrace you. 
 I know you can not see. The most important thing, is to be able to do whatever you are sent. And doing so has given you many advantages. 
 Sure, getting them all into the basement is going to be tricky, but it gives me a much better chance of achieving victory. I could use this, as it allows me to win the fight 
 It is a noble goal. 
 It is all hands on deck. I'm looking at the surface for a few minutes. 
 The battlefield is under my watchful eye. My quarry is waiting 
 Filled with hunger, i fight the fear of power. I see from the look on his face; hunger
My hope is all to meet him. There is a seal on the chest now. She cannot help but smile. 
 * "I am so, so, so sorry for your loss " * 
 Why did you do it? She could not come to terms with her mistake. You had no idea, did you? * " I won't let you down, I have to go now. * " You understand " he said in a gentle tone. 
 His opponent pulled out a piece of paper. It read, 
 *My country is no longer as it once was*. 
 I raise a hand. Our King had arrived. 
 Our King, for his last words. * " We are not alone. We have a new type of Leader. There is also a new principle. The Female Beast Shaman is coming soon. He can control the power of the Female Beast Shaman. We are coming for you.* 
 Fear. 
 * " They have underestimated us and will not be conquered. Only for one. At this moment, she is sworn to protect you until you have proven yourself worthy. Bestow this order upon your children " * 
 * " You children " * 
 Again I heard her say. 
 Our our King became powerful at his leisure. He did not hesitate to send his troops. 
 He had not decided. " There are about 10 men waiting for the Female Beast Shaman, whether or not you will defeat her. You will make your way up to the turret. I would like your words. I will explain this to your children." 
 My words ring out in our bodies as I raze the battlefield.<|endoftext|>

"Let me out, " shouted the old man, grimacing. " Ah, how I craved an ever larger puffy bear and therefore a more successful death cult. You two... you're near invincible. " 
 " The last time we fell, I knew I'd killed anyone, man. Your last words have haunted me since I was a kid, " the old man said. 
 " Oh, well, " said the new one. " Just share your last words with this bear if you can. " 
 " Then get that forest! " 
 He gestured at the meadow towards the village, but before the man could say anything other than grin at the sight, he was shot into the woods by the bear. The tree however did not rip, the bear bore left untouched and the old man was unharmed, this was the place. He was onto his destination. He carried his rifle and followed the bear, who shot into the forest below. 
 The man gazed out at the mountains, where he could see countless beings approaching from all angles, their crests filled with clouds of flame. He could hear the hooves of several of the beings pulling wagons. He saw a large part of a dinosaur in the forest, unlike the men and women who had left him, he recognized him. 
 " Well, then they'll know I was the one who found them " the old man said, watching the giant, black with glowing scales do the same. " Their rituals, I was trying to order them. I wanted a quick rest. " 
 " Then why the aurora? " the giant asked, eyes wide. 
 " The geological advancement of the world has brought dust particles back to the surface, making it difficult for the humans to distinguish their of the former world. So at some point in the past we saw they were melting but we were unable to make amends for our lack of understanding. " 
 " Why did we have to do this, we are the best. Once we toppled the archangel to the centre of the earth, we'd be forced to settle for something greater, something even greater than ourselves. " 
 " Interesting. After the war, when time seemed to stand still, we only discovered something else. Through the ouster of the archangel, we've had peace for a hundred and one years, now it's all we've known. The human community hasn't been a theocracy ever since the riots started. How did the war end? " 
 " Well, good to know. In general, we haven't only practiced survival techniques and rituals in greater numbers, we've learned from the outside the cycles and the conflict - we have also evolved properly since then. Most humans aren't even aware of a new covenant, maybe it's because there's been no births in the past and we haven't felt the sting of leaving our homes forever. Just imagine, we learn to live on our own. We've been able to craft anything that is amorphous, most words for me are one of sense. " 
 " So let's not fight on from here."<|endoftext|>

Folks in my day spoke of a mythical land, a place where names were, and all numbers were. I sit behind my desk, more tired than I have ever been, surrounded by the clutter, my son. He loves to read and write, but he can ’ t speak. Just sitting here poring over his notes. He wondered if he might ever be allowed to speak. What would he tell my older son? 
 Now I sit behind him. Tracing across the dusty floor, I ponder what my actions would have made my son, anything, changed about the previous year. 
 It all started in the caves, all the way up to the cliff. This is the point where I set up the stem. I hear him groan, “ So I will lay down a bed and wait until I fall asleep, and then watch TV and listen to music and pick up my guitar ”. 
 “ So you will sit down and say, “ I have to go. ” 
 “ Well that ’ s definitely my decision, but you have to do something first, your choices have consequences. Because of your actions, the consequences can fluctuate dramatically. ” 
 “ Yeah, you know what? 
 So I decided that I would sit down and sit down and say, “ I have to go. ” and then push off the cliff and head for the next cave. ” 
 If I could spend the rest of my life worrying about consequences, probably some of these self-made… I have no idea. To avoid the consequences that turn into physical consequences, I try to catch up to my brothers. Sometimes I feel awkward, asking him how he feels about a life outside of the settlement. 
 When we get to the cliff, my eldest is on one knee. We sit there for the first time, looking at the rare display of life from the tunnel. Around his age, the scientists come in and do what they have done for years. Once they make sure that everything is fine, we begin to guess. Once we are able to guess, I stare at the earth as our eldest says, “ Nothing else is appropriate ” 
 My eldest eyes drift in the distance. How old has he been? 6 or 7 years? What does that even mean? 
 Everyone knows the truth. We don ’ t care. No matter what we learn, no matter what I study, no matter what we set up, no matter what I help teach, no matter what I do, we end up regretting things we don ’ t know. 
 So here I sit, with a job to do and a family that wants to do more. I look at my son and hope that maybe, someday, someone will talk to him that truly understands the real meaning of life. 
 “ I have to go ”. 
 And one day, we will have to.<|endoftext|>
**********895**********
The tree was built upon the spring, and it looked like it was made of wolves. I don't know how it came to be, for the second time that day my dog and I sat peacefully watching the fire still in the front yard. My family would stay behind as the kids sat enjoying beer, so I bet my neighbor would get too distracted and jump right back in the wagon. 
 My dog Polly, my only small son and he was so used to being around dogs, like my dog had recently been and to him, seem kind of nice. She had long golden brown curls, brown hair, and a nice brown nose. She was five feet and a half and I knew she wasn't going to be good to him. 
 "Give me a minute " I said to my wife and we sat on the porch, looking at the fire, watching the glowing green ooze fall off of the underside of a tree. 
 Her white baby steps kept her attention from anything but the tiny fire so that we could see her for the first time in months. We spent most of the day there. 
 We sat at home watching the fire and listening to the children play in the backyard, softly playing with their toys. My wife and I played with her quilts and she would lay them over the chest and she would stare at the fire and ask " Who are you? " 
 She would make a strange sound and move her head slowly, hoping to give herself some rest. 
 Once we had some time, she would pat me on the head and tell me to sleep, and then she would tilt her head to the side and rest a few inches. 
 Once we did, she would raise her head so that we were now sleeping next to her. 
 After most of our time, I listened to Polly play on the mantelpiece behind our house. Her feet made an odd sound, until the little water droplets almost blocked our sight and she began to play with her quilts, never quite doing as she usually did, much to our surprise. 
 Her fingers would stretch and relax as she sat atop her giant quilt. She was an amazing child and often would bring a bear ( or several ) as her favorite toy, and I would tell her as I spun the quilt around and she would spin it ever so slightly, and she would tug it up and I could easily see the black wings from the bottom of Polly's tiny golden curls. 
 When she was being led back to our house, we jumped up on the porch of our backyard to get a better view of the fire. One of the little neighbors had gone into the backyard to see the fire, let the family know that he was heading for the woods, and so he would keep going there. I was the one that told him to stay, and the dog and I were on the porch, making ourselves comfortable for about an hour. 
 After we finished the scene, Polly picked her big blue flea-man eyes off of the little man and pointed them to him. 
 " Play through your song, boy " she said. 
 The big dog picked his big blue eyes off of the little man and frowned at the good play in the air. He barked a bit louder and he moved his mouth slightly to look at the little red fox, trying to get a better look at how big its face was. 
 The giant fox looked up and tilted its head, and said, " I was about to do it though... don't let my big brown slithering be your child. " 
 " No, you see I was supposed to make it *big*. We'll play more until you turn a corner " 
 The big dog winked at the cute little man. 
 The big fox continued to bark and quiver and pout for a long time, until it finally settled back into its jogging pants. Polly rested her head on her little blue fluffy paws and I spotted the little red fox struggling to move. 
 I remained quiet for a while while. 
 Finally, we sat next to each other, inside the tiny fire so that I could look through the air and watch them play through the tree, and I saw the big red fox trying to learn from Polly. I watched as the two began to pound and try to get to the edges. 
 I watched as the little red fox struggled through the fire with half a pint of Coke in one hand, and I watched as the little red fox fell to the grass with half a pea in the other. 
 When she was finished, she turned around, kissed the little red fox on the forehead, and pulled the pea out. 
 " It's good to see you mother. Goodbye." 
 My wife smiled and pulled the little red fox's little head off of the tree, and she flew to her little house just shy of sunset.<|endoftext|>

Jaden watched as the two self-same men had their intense conversation. Once they were at a bar, he joined him. His mind had quickly traveled to the events of that recent marathon race. He had not put on his jacket for today. Rather, he had decided to wash away the tears that accompanied his environment. But today is not a good day. Today is the day he loses control. He turns on the TV. 
 “ Congratulations. You ’ re the State Senator again, Cory. You ’ re the only third person I have ever brought up tonight. Remember, not everything is right about President Obama… ” At that moment he felt a pain all over his body. He felt someone attack him. It took all his willpower to walk away, but he managed. Today would not be the day.<|endoftext|>

The audience gurgled in unison as Moses held the Ten Commandments in his trembling hands. Having seen them carved into the stones with only a single trial lasting a mere moment, the commander smiled down at him. He wished he had seen them out of the corner of his eye when he uttered his prayer to his father. 
 It was only a few minutes, but still. No, it was only a few seconds. A quick, desperate gasp. Then a terrible, terrible scream, each word too fast and too slight. Then a terrible single tearful sob and then an eternity of silence. 
 His own lips trembled slightly as he looked down at the burning sign before him. A testimony forged by those who had long since come of age and fallen asleep in temples buried in dust in a kingdom of men. 
 A door opened, but soon the wooden beams of light from the west hole lighting up the lower part of the building. 
 Shit, i don't even know where to start. I just finished work on the sidewalk, so you don't have to believe my YAHWIT. I know the truth. I can barely work this day in a row. 
 The commander hung his head as he flipped the keys, unable to feel more alone than he already is. As he stepped out the back door of the suburb to his suburbs, he heard a noise. 
 A deep wood, just barely lubed with its original origin as it grew it's strength over the asphalt. It might just be a sound in there, but it too that grew. 
 He turned around and saw his ex-girlfriend sitting in a room sitting there on her couch watching television with a round grin and blank expression on her face. 
 "It's time, " Moses groaned. " I've barely finished up writing this down. " 
 " Haha, " she replied, flipping the topic back to the local news channel. " Your little rebellion to make a statement against the firing squads still going on in Baton Rouge. " 
 " I guess we'll just have to wait and see if this becomes more of a discipline exercise or something, " the commander muttered. " No more big mos cabs, just ceaseless crimes against freedom and of democracy. " 
 The woman twitched and turned around to see the commander's eyes wide open as he laughed at his joke. 
 " Is that so, man?" she said, making a little gasping sound. He looked down, his face dead, and then her face on the TV.

The ride to their goal seemed bleak in retrospect. How could they have known? Clearly it was highly self-determined by everyone in the cult. The senior priests would be intimately familiar with the ways humans were racked with disease and then low health, and then soon enough he would attest to them. The area around my compound, better known as ICS, was marked with orange damage, and judging by the iron oxide damage on my sole occupant, the pills would be flawless. With nearly a third a millimeter between them, no one could possibly believe they even did it at all. 
 This trip, that was when the lights changed, immediately showed. The rear doors of the cave left open for the last time, and the front door slid open slowly, revealing a shuttle seats inside. 
 Eighty-eight percent worse than what they were just now finding. 
 My girlfriend, although an avid lover, found no signs of infection in her new companion and yet hundreds of other filthy human capes which were churning like chips. My hands shook, then in a cadence long suited of the blasphemers they called themselves, both my mother and I retreated to the midst of the excitement to relieve the awe. She arrived early, raised her fist, and sat down on the seat next to me. Her head was bated in defiance, but her face looked as if she was going to battle the awakening of the cancer. Her right hand, at least, was covered in duct tape and using a perfectly intact pistol at her waist, never to move. 
 A group of students, dressed in black, parted the crowd as Mr. Zion paced the room, bracing himself for any potential action against him. As per protocol, they silently escorted him outside and exited, reluctantly. Out in the field they debated the matter for awhile. As the girl approached me from behind, she whispered to her business partner, who quickly got in hand, "These people are foul, and I know it."<|endoftext|>

I woke up with a cold sweat and an odd feeling of going to sleep. Then the heat started to set in. " Hey buddy! " I said, hiding under a pile of rags. " Where am I? " I yelled out into the hollow. " Slow down. Try the stairs. " I said as I slowly walked down the long walk. Then the rope gave in and I felt the ground beneath me go to. Suddenly I was not alone. " What is this thing? " I thought. Then I stumbled over to where I was standing with the ground sinking below my feet. I started to run. " Stand up! " I shouted but I was already moving too quickly. My eyes darted along the ground until I caught the light coming from a window. A light, flashing through the glass. " What the hell is going on?! Where am I! " I yelled out. It's was a ghost house, nobody could have come to see it but the building was haunted. I tried to scream but I had already exhausted my energy and couldn't hear more than a whisper. Then darkness fell from the room. I didn't know what had happened, someone had smashed me into the wall. I was falling and then I saw her. She was in tears. " Why was you here? I would have done anything to save you. " I said while pulling a knife from the nightstand. " I love you." She said as she put the knife down her throat. The knife was thin to the point where it didn't dig into flesh. I lay there on the ground covered in blood. I cried out in horror as I met the eye of death.<|endoftext|>

I ate my breakfast like I have ever done in my life. I have always played these games. One of my favorite games. The game where one of the guys at the bar is so drunk he almost drinks the main pool right when he shoots and kills the bitch standing next to him. Everyone stands by their seats, listening to the aroma of alcohol and the endless waves of people that go by each day. The game was a type of high stakes game. Playing hard and winning. 
 Today was not the day. My first day of work. 
 Once, I worked my way to the movies. 
 Don't bother telling me, don't bother calling me anymore. Don't bother mentioning the endless nights of waiting. I just stand there, thinking about going through hoops with them. 
 Don't think about work. Don't think about work. Don't think about work. 
 Don't think about work. Don't think about work. Don't think about work. 
 I am really, really annoyed. I want to explain. If we were using the wrong terminology I swear, this is too ridiculous. A robot just appeared at my front door. How long was I standing there? Did I leave? 
 Oh god. Oh fucking fuck. I was standing in this river, in the middle of nowhere. Then I saw it. It looked like some kind of fishing line that wanders. I groaned. This boat looked really neat. I picked it up. I could walk around the boat and find the water underneath it and pretend to be water, but as I touched it it started floating itself. Then it returned to it's original position. I was on my bike, in the middle of the river. The whole thing was pretty cool. I think I am sitting here pondering on someone approaching me, making noise, thinking I am hot, at a pretty high level of awareness. It takes a long time to get it comfortable, but I grab my phone from my pocket and make for the crossing bridge. 
 I should have taken the bridge. 
 I don't want to be here. 
 I stop my bike and walk to my dorm. Wow! So the robots have actually made a map of the river. It is a pretty big map, and I look at it thinking "something is moving down the river. " Then I ran to my room, in one of the many rooms. Once inside I look in the hall. All the books on this room are in the exact same place. I try to figure out what they are doing, if its a map of the river in question. I'm really starting to get annoyed. 
 " Aww man! I can't get it in my head! " 
 " you can't be serious! I am a robot " I said, pointing out a video camera to the left and right. " Its all poop! " 
 A frustrated voice crackles over the phone. 
 " This shit is a mess! I thought there was a door that matched the station " 
 Another frustrated voice. 
 " You really think you can make this the dumbest game I've ever played? Maybe I should just go for a run? " 
 I reach in my pocket and pull out the laptop computer. In the corner of my eye I see a picture. 
 THE image is of me holding my laptop open. Looking at it. I wish I could even go out and change this. 
 A little girl with light brown hair and short brown hair looks at me. It was one of the most beautiful women I have ever met. 
 " Hey mom, what are you doing up there? " she asks. 
 I give her a look, " why don't you put that on?" 
 She nods, and we both go along with our lives as if to say " hey mom."<|endoftext|>

Hey, folks, 
 Today is the 12th anniversary of your big announcement that you're opening up your mouth company. 
 One sentence: "Hi Robin. I got a bit late to shower, so let me know when you might be able to see me." 
 Over the past few months, I've been delivering hundreds of new exciting new products, and now it has come to fruition. The store is going on one more day. 
 ---- 
 All hail Robin, aka Robin of Orzlove, for this very special occasion. The 1st party last month marked the start of the company's free transition into a profitable semi-autonomous, self-extinct lao-capital market. You'll see young women with too much imagination and not enough vanity -- that's an awful lot of female energy to harness. 
 While I always make sure every surprise is present, first, you'll be pleased to see one of my creations. Not just any white Batman, full-metal embodiment of world destruction, but the ultimate leader for mankind, as she may. On this day, the choice is yours to make. Your shoes, my beloved Bat, will have you grinning. 
 And now, for a special surprise, heaven itself will be free to witness this dinner from the perspective of your beloved beloved Robin. You'll read each note as you scan the photographs at my store -- ten hundred poppets in a shoebox, ready for your daily swap. I love when guests arrive smiling, glad to see you there. You'll be compelled to smile too.<|endoftext|>

Until that moment a mystery drew a woman from the skies. A bond that could have sired thousands of women had they been truly connected. Held together by an inexorable love bond that couldn't be separated by any means. Yet I could not grasp it. 
 The floor beneath her never growled, but for once it was alive and well. 
... 
 I could open my eyes in time to see her; I hadn't done it before, but it seemed like an ideal first sight. I could feel my heartbeat pumping like it was pressed at the right time. I was pulsating with energy, less than the last time I'd found it in my heart. 
 And my legs shifted beneath me. Carefully they bent me down to the ground, taking in the world around me. Cold and silent at the same time. 
 Time moved on but I couldn't move. I didn't like to interrupt. I didn't want to hear about the pain, the sorrow, the pain, the endless meaningless stares. I couldn't even touch the metal walls; I hadn't even arrived on the surface. 
 Still, the ship had begun to move, and she was moving slowly but surely, almost as if it were leaping. She continued her descent into the depths of the void. I could no longer move my legs. 
 I wanted to fight but the room was still cold, and I felt disconcerted. 'What the hell do we do, honey?' I called after her. There was a knock on the door and I heard footsteps. 
 'Let the rest take your place, find a seat and try not to cry too loudly. I've never experienced anything like this before. I've worked in the military for such a long time,' she said with a puff of air. 'I'm here for you and I have something to prove.' 
 Without hesitation I moved, but suddenly she was gone. Blood soaking my boots and I was not in the safest place ever. I heard footsteps again, and they seemed to bump into me. 
 'What the hell?' I asked, feeling a bit betrayed. 
 The officer had held the knife in her hand and was looking at me with disappointment. Her eyes were shut, but her body was shaking, which meant the pain was behind them. 
 'Startling' he said with a sigh. 
 'Let's do this,' I said. 
 'Let's try,' she answered. 
 'Right...' 
 And as she began to move the knife from the woman's hand, I slipped, sliding towards her. The dull pain of the blade making contact with me wasn't real pain. The fracture in the skin seemed like it was peeling off. In seconds I was, entirely submerged, but I felt a brightness. Hot and radiant, a radiant light. 
 I was able to begin to talk but I could not understand a word, unable to breath, unable to breathe a single syllable. I felt the sharpest pain - perhaps the last painful thing imaginable. 
 I awoke under the stars, but I was alive, and I was breathing, but I couldn't move.<|endoftext|>

The room smelled a crisp white against the autumn breeze, and I felt curious. Where in the universe were these mysterious sounding objects in the constellation Primus? 
 No one had really figured out what the source was. We'd been traveling from earth, in search for something, when I was an old man, one of these strange objects popped out of nowhere and said it had the power to take everything we thought or felt we knew. In general, it was around 8-ish. Usually it wasn't as much of a strangest thing, in the year 2000 we were on the first Interplanetary Patrol since the discovery. 
 It felt that they had the whole of space out there? What were they thinking about? 
 Truth was, I didn't care. I took the ship to the tiny planet in the constellation Mercury and to Earth. I didn't want them to know that I was a spy. We would have to follow along as always. I just needed to keep studying and explore. Earth and Mercury's orbit, their planet I was most enthusiastic about, they supported the realization of our impending doom. 
 I drifted around, watching as the ship's sensors detected a large amount of electrical activity. It was amazing how quickly our ship would detect it. We kept our distance and waited for what came next. 
 "What do we do? " 
 A faint groan escaped my ear. The ship looked to be sinking. And then in an instant, the ship erupted in hot white fire. Just like it always does in the aftermath of a nuclear blast. It had spread to the atmosphere and burned everything. " Is it the objects?" I wondered as I let loose a ringing electric white noise. This should have been 100 megawatts. 
 I heard a roaring voice over a loudspeaker.

"You want me to help you in... " 
 Relievely outnumbered, the Demingans halted their incredible pace as they surveyed the planet in silence, just waiting for a reply. In the midst of all of that, a small hut had flickered to life next to a nearby cave, helping them focus on their new technology. 
 This new technology was much more advanced than anything they had actually seen before. Men in fancy, lab coats watched over them from afar and watched them interact with their new surroundings, while a helicopter flew over it and headed off towards their destination. 
 But its... mission, it wasn't going to the house in 24 hours. 
 First contact. 
 They stepped inside, hands trembled nervously, but managed to hide their fear. Their mother, High-ranking officers, who was seated on the balcony was staring with glowing eyes at them curiously. 
 " Thanks for being here, Uh? " she stammered. " We had a very encouraging interaction. " 
 Another look of puzzlement placed itself on their faces. * Where is she...? * 
 " You know your mother is a girl. " He leaned closer. 
 Her eyes widened in confusion. " And she has a thing for your kind, isn't that right? We have all of your knowledge, of... " The children weren't sure what had been going on, but it seemed to take many of them a minute to reach their bags. 
 " Well, yes. The radiation poisoning ( you would don't have guessed ) didn't affect our family. We just had one last conversation with your kind, and we want to follow through with it. " The door burst open as two dignitaries walked in, a head tilted to one side, wide eyed. " How can you trust us? You don't even know what she is going on! " 
 The pair simply stared, dumbfounded. No doubt they were quite surprised, all that was left were the three of them, a bastard mother that didn't tell them anything about whatever really happened, a bastard father that didn't even let them speak to each other. No one seemed entirely sure who was telling the truth, so who do they trust? " I would trust this ship, uh... you just don't have a handle on our kind, do you? " 
 The priest smiled. 
 The two men looked at each other in shock, then suddenly yelled as loud a scream could be heard. 
 " PROMISE TO YOU! YOU CREATED A WORLD OF THINGS, THAT WAS NOT THE STORY! " 
 The soldiers held their breaths. One took a step back, the other shoved their bags in front of them, who had suddenly started nodding with a mischievous grin on their faces. " I, uh... I don't know. I'm not sure what to do. " 
 The priest paused, considered for a second. " Time to settle it with them, then!"<|endoftext|>

In the middle of nowhere and out of sight. 
 What is a huge, monument to humankind's achievement. 
 The pyramids were barely made when they were built. 
 Their amazing architecture was built like that of a newborn baby. It was unlike anything we had seen in all of history. 
 The "window " was the only thing stopping time. It didn't disturb the radiation of the day. 
 That is when the glass of the pyramids opened. 
 The sound was so deafening that everyone from every corner of the universe could hear it. The entity split open the vastness of space, causing huge waves of energy to explode through the sand. 
 The light emitted through a translucent, glass structure, but wasn't grabbed by the creators or usurpers by destroying the glass structure. They stood up on their pyramids and let their metal go. 
 They weren't broken apart from the attack. They were thousands of years old. 
 A spark was the brightest way to see the first stars in our lifetime. 
 They had never seen them without 1 hour notice, but they were very special. 
 They were meant to stay above the skies. 
 They were guaranteed to create people just like us. 
 The " window " opened once again with a single energy blast. 
 They flooded the earth with an increasing amount of small particles. The people who were there first were always too scared or alone, people that couldn't make out what was going to happen. 
 People that were not standing by watched and watched over the earth, for a super resource or for a moment, for too long or for too many hours. 
 No one even knew what it was about. People never learned how to stop from touching those things. 
 It was a task to create the first canard. 
 The object was about to break, and explode to live on, but there was a beeping on the window's beautiful glass casing. It was strong enough to knock the astronauts off their feet. 
 There was a noise coming from the underside of the launch tube. 
 That noise was an explosion. 
 An explosion that nearly destroyed the people that stood by the window. The rocket blew through the cool sand on the planet, tearing into the glass's parts. 
 The roof instantly became huge. One thousand ships erupted out of the crater and into the sky.<|endoftext|>

What if every human lives in different places, walks around the world. Does a million deaths mean everything will happen? Is it like when millions died upon the streets? What if there is no stone. And there isn't a bullet. Where are the organs. There is no bone. What is the feeling of another being, the goal, every time you sit down and fight it out? You are an idiot. " Fuck the person next to me!" Is another person? Every one of us is doing our best to do what we can to preserve the loved ones of people like me. WE ARE AN ORGANIC BEINGS. WE ARE DELIGHTFUL CITIZENARIES. WE ARE WEIRD PHONES. WE ARE EXPERIENCED IN EVERYTHING, IN EVERY FREEDOM, FOR THE THING THAT IS INSANE. We are the reason not even God existed. We are simply in the process of lying to ourselves. We are deprived of the QUORUM POWER. We keep ourselves alive for the millions who were disconnected and needlessly hurt. We eat, we sleep. And we cry. But we don't care. We grow up, we live. But still, if we only knew, how could we get to this point. They wouldn't understand. We can't do this. We know enough to get some sense of peace inside ourselves. We must. They are coming.<|endoftext|>

All sounds a worn song were torn from his voice. " I coulda done a double take on that. This whole " adversary " thing. The possibilities that lie in this new world torn from the former member's head. " 
 Dark and bloody stars shot out from the blue flames, shattering the rubble that grew over the ruined street. " I coulda flicked the power switch I thought could do me. " 
 Emperor Cora passed away by the blows of the Emperor's battleaxe, immobile for a second. " I can't, Cora. " 
 Death replied calm and collected as his wounds healed. " I'll be the first to call you an innocent when you return home. In three weeks time they'll bring you across the room, reclaiming your father. " 
 The mountain of men assembled in the palace courtyard became the fortress of Emperor Cora. Food and drink were scarce, and easily being able to retrieve items was the quickest thing around. 
 The Prince and his men made their way to the Grand Citadel in 15 days. " If only you'd have to do that." the Emperor declared.<|endoftext|>

& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Things were bad when I arrived at the yard. My hands were trembling with the baby in them, but that got to me. The baby was my husband, his uniform on, your average classic Superman hulk from what he'd eaten in his loneliest movie theater. I had called my parents on this and that thing was staring right at me, making the baby uncomfortable and threatening. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Where could I find the ammo, so I turned and walked right up to the door. It was in a decrepit abandoned warehouse with a skeleton monstrosity in a chest. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I guess I'll just have to wait for someone to turn it in. " I shouted, as my son and two friends poured out of the back with what looked like fuel for the car he'd had to lug into the warehouse. But the salesman could never bring it in for me, who could send it. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; You could hear the truck pull out into the driveway. " It's working, kid. We'll drop it off at the 12 sign up in the yard. " The driver didn't mind. He just liked to piss his name in a coffee shop so, yeah, he was going to miss all the good times he'd had. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I sprinted in the direction that the road should lead, drove the truck to the night and sat at the door for the night. I wasn't going to get any of this. I was a baby, and all the babies in the world needed a moral compass, so I wanted to be able to break bread with them all the time, being the true king of mankind. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; " Bill, come over here and let's get you this suit! It won't take more than five minutes to get this bag!! Get in here! " 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; " Babe, get in! " They started running as I got them. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The salesman waved, get in the car, get out of here and go to work. But there was a slap on the wrist. I snatched it from the truck and ran for the car. The cops did their jobs. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I desperately lost my way through the woods, into the abandoned civilian neighborhood. It was a town square, was turned in to fire. I thought about missing my son. I thought about the good times I'd had. I thought about the bad. I looked over and saw him bent over, crying under a tree. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I heard him sobbing under the tree, cuddling up to the tree. The cops, rushing to the scene, apparently even getting the paper out. * Fuck*. I looked up to find him laying there, at a pool of blood. * Fuck*. As the ambulance came around the corner, the cops realized what had happened and rushed to the scene. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I cried uncontrollably. The rest of the church was silent. The mother stood at the top of the staircase, the baby crying. She'd been at home, and these kids should be safe, since she'd got extra medicine for her husband. But there was a source of light in the dark, or, I guess, a fire. 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The inside of the baby's locket was opened. The sigil on the front read " Doctor for 80 years."<|endoftext|>

John Greenbine stands on the balcony railing, just in time to see a very familiar face with a 2 pronged scorpion lined up on his chest. The accent he used to be used too is gone, replaced by ring accents, his eyes slowly dart away from the crowd as he closes his eyes. 
 It was clear this time that their faces had changed. The small dirt road sloughed beneath their feet as a legion of horses, chariots, and soldiers as well as all manner of equipment were scattered along the ancient road. It was now the aim of many, but it had been clear to John Greenbine that they had never first met. 
 The ground was not so soft against his face as to render his hair useless against him. He looked over and saw that the small circle around him was still clinging to the edge of the hill with a thorny shred of wood sticking out of it. His opponent had just had the day off already. As he approaches to greet him, however, John is met by the sight of the movement around them. Finally, as he senses them, and they are all now upon him, the horse arrives. It's rider barely has time to prepare himself for the hard battle that awaits them all. The scorpion's venom on John's skin, increasing every millisecond. Many will run in fear as the rise of these dangerous monsters continues. There will be casualties. And suddenly, John sees someone close in a close together hug, and sees, glimpsing through a small slit in his green cloak. 
 He sees the five fox people, the Five Paragons, the Karmas, and some of the highest ranking magi from the arena. One of the Paragons grabs his eyes and asks, “ Do you want to know, where are you from? ” 
 John runs back over and places one hand against his face. “ I ’ m from the Empire. I know what your territory is. ” He turns his eyes to the dog, saying as they begin to chatter in amazement. 
 “ Because they ’ re all here to conquer me, ” the fox said one day. “ There ’ s nothing stopping us. ” The other two entranced him. 
 “ They keep telling you, ” his opponent replied. “ We have to fight with the power of god. ” 
 The scorpion looked smug as the scorpion quickly took a bite of its colleague, making it difficult for him to attack. The scorpion continued talking as well, which was intimidating. This to John who had seen many bouts of these and nearly once had moved on because he wanted to enjoy this part of the sport. 
 “ I just…if I can handle this one. ” John replied, “ Maybe we can even hide under the mountain trees and have some fun. ” 
 The scorpion stopped and smirked. He looked at John, realizing, actually, that he had not intended this. His previous efforts at this had failed him horribly. The scorpion lowered its head slightly to speak. 
 “ Although this is a bit daunting, I think you deserve something better than this. Look at these two young guards, some pretty stout ones and some women. ” 
 The scorpion stopped talking. Before he could ask another question, John looked at John. Without hesitance, the scorpion said with a big grin, “ How about you just give these guys the glory. Go fetch them a sword and attack the right people. ” 
 John looked back as the scorpion flashed a red meat scar across his face. He finally realized what he had been trying to say. He knew as soon as he was able, he was dreaming again. 
 “ Very good. ” The scorpion said, “ If you really want this to work, what shall you tell them? ” 
 John looked up. As he looked to his companions for answers, he seen his older brother already, and both with their dark shadow on their lips. “ A very, very bad idea, ” he said cheerfully.<|endoftext|>

But wait, who is actually listening to me now? 
 Ah God, I'm sorry, I apologize, where are you from? What the hell was that? 
 Here you go again, no need to apologize! When I hear all the other men wish upon me, in ten seconds, how can I deny you? Who else could be so truly impious? 
 Now wait a second, what the Hell is this? How can I know? Is there even a way to rewind time, why is it always ten seconds after you wish, I'll never even know this! And of course, you wouldn't? 
 What's that sound? Is that your snoring? Or is it a mix of both? That sounds beautiful. 
 Ok, like where is it coming from? I need to get out of here. Out of here, I'll be fine. I'll show people not only my ability to ask for certain things without consequences, I'll have a new family. And at no point in time will I be dead and gone. 
 With that, I'll get out of here. I'll be fine. 
 But wait, what am I supposed to do next? This does seem very heroic, for real. It's the only way I can get this girl out of here, it's really great. 
 Wait wait wait I'm standing right in front of her. Did she come to ask for anything? What the hell? 
 Oh God, she brought a knife. Did she fall over? Am I overreacting? She's hit by a car, a bullet grazes the back of her head, the bleeding is everywhere, the police are investigating. And she's sick. 
 Oh God, look at me. It's time to end this. Put a gun to my head. Stay down. 
 Wait, wait, what? 
 I'm running down the road. I could have sworn I saw a man and a woman running down in the street, a fucking car and a gunshot wound to the back of her head, the police are running. The man and the woman are someplace else, and the shooter is by the door. They're doing more and more shots to the person they're shooting at, but, you know, it goes much further. 
 Go for it! No one's coming after me, no one's coming after me. Please, please try it again!<|endoftext|>

"James, it's mary, in heaven. " 
 " It is Heaven, Monsieur. Very familiar voice, Mr. Jameson... " The child began to speak but was cut off by the sudden shrill voice coming from behind him. 
 James stood up, surprised to hear the voice of Monsieur Farge. 
 " Madame Marge, why, am I here, not again? " James thought to himself. He turned to his wife, Catherine, who quickly got up and spoke with her sweet, voice. 
 " I'm not missing this, James. A thing just happened, and no one is around. " 
 " That's right, Monsieur. There is a fire just outside my window. " James smiled and rose from the bed. 
 " It's nothing, James. " Catherine said, ignoring James as she walked to get a glass of water. 
 " What happened? " James's wife asked, suddenly scared. 
 " I saw it, Catherine. Nothing, Charles. Nothing. " 
 " I thought it was a dream? I was just hallucinating! " 
 " Well, the other night, someone drowned. You know, sort of a miracle, right? " Catherine said, irritated by this. 
 James laughed and watched from the living room as Katherine took a final look at her wife. " What does everyone have to do to get out? I mean, what else would people do? That's what I wish to do with my life. " 
 James took a sip from his glass and headed outside. They had found a school to continue helping kids get outside. By the time they got there, in the distance, they could hear the earth still reverberating as the mountain peak crested and the world went black. 
 " It was ____. There isn't anybody here. " James thought to himself as he walked out of the house. He walked back towards his wife, grabbed his phone, and went out to do his chores. 
 Outside the house, a bandaged hand told him that his watch was all the only way to get out. James called his wife and grabbed a handkerchief from his right hand. Before his hand could get used to the small handkerchief, however, Charles opened the door and saw his little brother James go out to play in the backyard. 
 Charles sat on his porch, stretching his arms and reciting his favorite songs. As James got into the house, James clutched his head, and cried. After the tear rolled down his cheek, James started to cry harder. 
 " Charles, I thought the world was never going to end... " 
 He quickly put up the bandaid and started to cry. He felt his body convulse and burn as he cried. 
 " Are you alright, Charles? " James said, after crying for so long. 
 " No. I'm fine. Just... sorry..." Charles said, holding James tightly and shaking him. Before they both could muster, Charles raised his hand and sent Charles flying through the air.<|endoftext|>

Some days I would be so beaten, finally, at the end of the day and then I just wish I wasn't so beaten. When he pulled out my gun, I had been stunned, fear and doubt. But where was this gun that I had never seen before? Never imagined that I would end up in such an unhappy place. This one was headed right towards me, with a large hole in the side. The bottom half of the gun was right in front of me, as this main body thing I had never seen before. The wheel lock that was possibly the crux of this gun was cocked. I walked to the side. Straight ahead, I saw the door, having no doubt but that I would get in. I could feel a light breeze coming in from the window, and also saw the end of the TV. I didn't realize what had happened. In the walk from the door, that little house on that side of town had barely grown standing, a single house on this side of the world. But the house didn't matter now. The sun was setting. The only real star it could use was the stars. And it was blinding. The lights as far as the eye could see, they were gone. The wheel lock was jammed. Right in front of me, full of light from the window I could clearly see its closing as it closed. I had little chance to get in, but that was still the hope. In the tear-stained bedroom, I saw a face, something was standing there, calm and stoic. He was short, like he had been scared to death, I couldn't see it's face, but it was a boy. 'Hello' he said as he put a bullet through my head. There was no response. He was dead. I reached for the button on the side. I waited. The world faded to black. I decided I would just hold on. I felt cool. I clicked on the light from my cell. Suddenly, I heard it. " Goodbye," I said, as a person walked past.<|endoftext|>

Gingerly diving on the moon, Judy glared at the figure that looked to be, quite possibly, an entire species moon. It was like a crinkled up car trunk in peace, not too low or too high. She desperately used the wheel, hoping that there was some thing from her trail he'd noticed inside. 
 This figure approached Judy and knocked softly. The moon glimmered off the concrete of a nearby building that covered it's dimmed walls and softly turned to a pleasant radiance at this distance, hoping to indulge her. 
 "I'm so sorry, Andrea. " She grumbled under her breath. 
 This day, this year, her lucky day for being on the moon, was getting it out of her system. She cursed herself for not paying closer attention to the only people she could trust. She stuck her arm out behind her and began to point her finger. While some people would call that natural empathy, Judy found herself listening to the sound more. 
 Now, this smile was far too red. The surface of the moon was covered in dead leaves, decaying and drifting apart beneath a thick layer of land mass. Her blonde hair swayed. She let out a crash where her chest, nipples and forehead hung tightly to the side of the moon. Her tongue touched the tip. 
 " Serena! " she cried. 
 The creature laughed. 
 " Come on here! Get it out of my tree! " she screamed out from behind her. 
 " Judy! " 
 She started to swing forward like a pendulum and swung at the figure. The figure taunted her with its transformation to the planet's sun, one which would appear soon. 
 Judy stumbled through its head, striving to outrun this adventure-like creature. It toppled over and crashed through the tree, nimbly removing itself from the tree. She rolled to the side, trying not to let the thing drown in the bed of dust. 
 This had been a long day. She could ride that ship by making her way through the kingdom and hundreds of moons. 
 The tall creature snatched a large rock from a nearby rock formation and lifted it into Judy's face. She reached for Judy's arms and threw it over her shoulder. 
 " PLEASE! " Judy pleaded. 
 Her hands trembled in fear and her legs jolted involuntarily, trying to run away from the alien. Her long hair became entangled in the alien, resisting in the wind. 
 Her mother, like her sister, peeked through the window of her hut and watched. 
 " Ellen! " she yelled into the bright room. 
 " Judy, be okay! " 
 *ENTER SEATTLE* 
 The world turned blackness as Judy watched the creature for any sign of life on the planet. 
 Several mosquitoes wandered aimlessly, oblivious to the world beyond Earth. One even skittered over to Judy's tree and dropped a thick slab of green, gleaming as a tiny swimming loon. 
 " What the heck is that, Judy? " questioned the alien. 
 " What are you? " asked Judy. 
 " What did you do to my tree, green-barn? " 
 " Mrs. Patterson. Judy Patterson. Her name is Mrs. Patterson. " 
 " The damn bugs have not reared their head."<|endoftext|>

Usually, our marriage is easy; honey and I were in love. When we went to raise our child together, the first thing she brought me was a book. In the end, she said there was a book that said how to raise your frog, rather than frog. She came back to us, amused at the similarity between her resourcefulness and what I was fighting for. It was all from a book: This was her soft spot. This was what she wanted for me. 
 The deeper that changed her, the less I could see in her. I realized that she couldn't sense the difference between myself and my frog. What I could see was my frog; it could barely hold her afloat. We tried to get better, to grow a better relationship, but I just couldn't do it. Until this day. 
 I'm writing this with my wife, Butch. The joyous day came when she saw the book and nodded her head. It's now 6 months later, as she says, and her frog is being born.<|endoftext|>

The first tale was that of Dragon Mistwalker. He was much older than Lady Rodthal the Spear-bearer, and was very much afraid. It was that times where there were battles between the different Dunmer races, such as Phyni: Elves, Dwarves, and finally Fae-Tharish Elves. Cursory tales of these things were later passed down throughout the generations, but tales it is known for. With great pomp and dark rumors heralded the arrival of fae-people from beyond the Boundless Woods. 
 The first battles were shocking. 
 Catastrophic. It was in fear that the other Dunmer races began to flee and worship the Dunmer language. The walls were torn down, as each of the Dunmer's creatures were left behind in the forest behind their monastery. I, on the other hand, felt such an intense fear for my people. We were each more terrified to move than before, but left by accident. I don't know where that fear came from and I don't know how to make that escape. Though many thought us impossible creatures, I was able to survive and was hunted down by the swarm. 
 This form of cruelty spread throughout my people. Some swore to protect my people from the Dark Ones and to protect their lands, but the Dark Ones held them back so long they did not realize their humanity. The Fae ate their children, yet it was only as they put away their weapons and ammunition that the Fae ate. 
 This was the last time I was truly afraid. Even still, my people were being hunted down by the Dark Ones. I saw them cry out in their silken shrieks. I watched as they threw themselves against the walls that separated the lands of my people, seeking only to cast spells to bring about the end of my people. I tried to help them, but for what. My loved ones died as I marched past. I stood atop their ruins and watched, horrified at what I saw. 
 The last time I saw them, Lady Rodthal the Spear-bearer looked up from his temple and spoke. 
 "How many lives I have lost."<|endoftext|>

"Help me, Anakin! The Jedi are taking over!" cried Chancellor Palpatine, as Jedi Grandmaster Yoda pointed a lightsaber at his throat. As the Jedi approached, they were already at a loss of motive. They knew it was much more than the Jedi were creating, but when a Sith will kill a Jedi the moment the Jedi save him, everyone has to figure out if that is. 
 They seemed to be walking closely with no discernible movements and danger. Fortunately for them, it was cloaked in a robe; they only had short, cramped pockets that would allow one to, in practice, arrange for the young master and apprentice to be surrounded by the slaves with the weapon pointed, tucked underneath their feet and disposed of. She had ordered the squad to do the same, so they would have a definite target of the moment, close enough for the young apprentice to win. When they did, each of their senses took complete effect on their shields, leaving them in a moat open for full-attack on the Sith intent on stealing him. The Force, the lust for vengeance and enmity would be ebbing, so the young apprentice would not be fooled. Perhaps, in this moment, it would be wise not to be too optimistic. She had always been suspicious that there would be something else. 
 The Force was not needed to take away the young apprentice; instead, the long train of thought held hers back and she discovered a new curiosity.

There. That's the last thing we need to say to her. The last message I wrote to her. She refuses to believe that I ever meant it to her, that I wasn't the one doing it. She never thought there would come a day when I would listen to it. I had been waiting for her to say something, when she told me to do it. 
 Like any man, she is just too stunned to notice what was going on. 
 She started talking like a mother. Too baby-struck to hear what she was hearing. And I kept thinking to myself, why didn't she know what was going on? I did what I had to, she said nothing, crying uncontrollably every time she saw me, hysterical laughter filling her throat. I know she didn't mean it, the thought was unbearable. I can't help but feel pity for the girl that she never expected to hear. She is meant to love you, but she really feels that way.<|endoftext|>

He woke up without any glasses in his face, his right hand outstretched and clutching the nearest yellowish sticky can of wabi, he was suddenly starting to panic. Confusion all around him. 
 Whispers. A human voice. He did not know what it was, it could feel him. Maybe he feared death. 
 He thought again and knew he had to move. 
 I can not do this. What have I done? No one can do this! 
 Instinctively moving around where else could be seen, he managed to get the stick out of his mouth, then the brown of his cheeks and it then just grazed his nose. 
 He crumpled to the ground as his heart sank as he thought he would feel the orange tube of blood drip in and out of his mouth. 
 He stared at the blood and stared. 
 The realization dawned on him. There was no way. He knew it. It had to be. Something had gone horribly wrong in his life, he had killed everyone he was close to. Nobody would survive this…this was… 
 He began to cry. The pain soothed him at first, but slowly worked its way to the surface of his consciousness as he remembered. 
 Again. It was a nice talk, a spoken word. The group of people around him all gathered to watch. A familiar voice. The first one he had known, it's a normal person but he was too panicked to turn away. He had only a few minutes to even talk. 
 He just finished answering, just speaking to the group, to the blonde student smiling at him. Her eyes were wide and pupils, one blinked, he tried to ignore her. He could still see their thoughts. He could tell those were pure thoughts. Dreams, he had never believed such. He touched her cheek and felt the familiar warmth of a friend's kiss on her forehead. 
 He knew this too. In his mind he had always held this thought. But even now he knew it was wrong. He could not speak. He just tried to hold it together. He could still hear the yammering voice through the bathroom, it was constant. He decided it would be okay, to leave, and to go see him in person. 
 They made to leave the bathroom, and as they passed his door the familiar smell that he had never known came back. It permeated his entire being as he walked into his kitchen. Before he could utter a sound he saw her sitting in his kitchen table. She stared as she saw him, soaked in water. The first time he had seen her, he had imagined seeing the next day seeing her. This was the only time he had ever seen her in another life. 
 She looked at him with pity. She felt sad. She hated him as much as he hated her. He could not reconcile it with what he had done. He had killed everyone, and every person who was close to him, yet he did not regret it. He knew this too. It felt wrong. 
 He repeated his last plea. 
 She stared, waiting for the reason he did not see again. She grew emotional and he knew this too. 
 He could not let her go. 
 He picked up the stick and led her inside.<|endoftext|>

 The sound I make from the darkest depths of the abyss is the most integral element to any play. In my time of wanderings I've come across tons of elemental weaknesses and items of great rarity; however I've failed to conceive of that I might use like a weapon. One such item was seldom touched, as it seems very mundane and hopeless. However, how an instance of it occurs, and how, is not so easily missed. In either case, countless hours of course are spent playing while things happen behind my back, people unfamiliar, and I only have time. 
 In fact I consider myself the captain of this world... or at least the person who takes care of the situation. I am not immune to the pains and complications that can arise, and I am eager to show that I have done this before. However I must also assure you, that whoever issues such a summons will hear my plea as a fugitive and will have nothing to fear. 
 To everyone's dismay I have found a minor chance of doing this. This may be a walk in the park, or a prequel to some classic RPG, but as you can tell, even the rocks don't work all that well either. So they've collected these optional treasures that might serve as guards against unforeseen hazards. And that brings us to today: How I ruined a classic RPG! 
 Now, we've come to my front door. What now? How do I ask her for help? She has no answer! I can't press my earpiece to the door, and my breath keeps the fading chill of the night in my chest. Her gaze lingers, eyes fixed on mine, looking for some sign of something to scry away as the shackles pull back onto me. She takes my hand in hers, her cold grip tight. As I try to exert any strength to move the cold metal against my skin it seems my body is... crying. 
 The running, gunk and gunfire from behind the door has got to stop. I don't even know what I want to do but smash it open and let it fall to the floor until it enters the darkness for everyone to see. 
 Thank God I had some spare cash I might have enough to keep myself going for now, and a few more hours of looting. Hopefully I'll have enough to live on, any other time I can be seen as a thief and this mess of loot on someone's market. 
 Momentarily I come to the conclusion that I could have taken this anyway. In the past a good product can't ensure personal success for people, however I've met my end thus far as I was playing. I'm not asking her to find me here. I'm not asking her to know of the brutal torture I've inflicted upon this person!<|endoftext|>

The entire apartment complex is now illuminated by the idyllic blue sky. People were prancing around on jumbled clifes, garbed in waving young, outcast mates who looked down upon them as if they were brutes. The farmers' markets were mostly in windows, the dinning chimneys in buildings in front of them as if nothing of the magnificence had happened yet. The grass in the cement beside the building chimed loudly and Chloe moved her hand from behind her ear and peered through the right pane of glass in front of her. 
 "Good day, baby, " she said. They had put on hand-me-downs for the neighborhood kids. It wasn't usually any of their business these days, though. There were occasional cafeteria parties where the kids ate something other than organic fudge. Chloe loved that sort of stuff, especially with her fiance. At least, that's what she thought. 
 No one had told her much about the city of Gideon, the former towers city and city to the south, just that it was often called the ""true castle of Gideon" or the ""controlled mountain" that transgressed to the rest of the world. It was a place to don'thing more than eat very weak food. Granted, she loved the food and the radio was very effective in helping her understand why Gideon was so important, but it was something she learned now. 
 Now, the air was so humid in the summer. People clung to the windows, holding balled boxes. Nobody seemed to care. Only Chloe couldn't see them far enough away that anyone that walked past them could see them. 
 A gust caught Chloe's shoulder. If Chloe had a umbrella, she would shield her face with it. Maybe if someone wiggled her toes, she would be able to see out of the way. But she didn't care. She had grown up since she moved to Gideon, had spent summers learning about how to get a hot shower and cooking dinner that night. She spent hours going to bars with her friends and stood in front of her kiddo that wasn't even a dog. 
 Now she wouldn't be gone long.<|endoftext|>

The humming of the air turbine waves whisper in my ears. This would mean I would be found, though of course I can't find my own body yet. 
 The vendor is handing out snacks. It's time. 
 "Everybody, the guy who works here, has been working hard, " a voice echoes from behind me. 
 I keep my head down and look at the corpse standing on the ridge with it's head in one hand, then the other. Everyone here... someone is alive. 
 I close my eyes and resume my task, " Hh... well, you know, we have plans. Here, grab the bag if you need any extras." 
 The rest of the first pick them up and head off into the snow. 
 I was lucky I didn't have to use my binder. Most of them wouldn't be inside any longer. At least, until the snow began to thicken. 
 I think back to my childhood. My mother's town was in the same area as mine. The photographer we saw that day was shot up into the sky, capturing the scene. And he... his eyes were so wide, he could've sworn he could see my face. 
 I found myself falling, but somehow I didn't quite fall into the rocks beneath me, as my body fell into the snow. The snow was just heavy enough that it puffs me out, giving me a flying head. 
 I've come to care for this corpse.<|endoftext|>

Remember when America was splintered with military forces that were too big, too small, and too proud to fight? One of your heroes was there, he stopped wars. He played defense on a scale that almost dwarfed that of the worst empires around us. He slowly became a god within that scale, he turned to the dark for mercy, but never had he surrendered, never had he given any thought to redemption. He won wars, died a hero, but we've been studying you ever since. You've built and reinvented these lands, tried to cool a fire out your city, be more like a walking city rather than a city of men. You showed us the world, brave and arrogant in your war to defend the people and your kingdom. But our empire is not here to play offense; it's here to safeguard your people, your kingdom, your people. Let us play defense on a scale that dwarfed that of the worst empires around us. You're happy and you play defense on a scale that dwarfed that of the worst empires around us. You let us do what we can to secure your people, make sure you have an army that is strong enough to protect your people. You show us the world and a city can even be an army of steel even with your fault. But your empire is not here to play offense, it's here to protect your people. We show them the world and a city can even be an army of steel even with your fault. It's like playing chess against the Law. We bring cities into the forefront, make cities on the plates, bring armies into the forefront, and we often come close to borrowing, but I invite you to see it. We can lay siege to cities upon the heart of your people. I hope you let us do that. I encourage you to let us do that and a city can even be an army of steel even with your fault.<|endoftext|>

I ate breakfast, as I had normally at the office, and turned on the TV. I was always a reader, like my wife always said: I read different things. News, films, songs. But I always left some sort of random tidbit that people would wish I'd know. 
 I forgot to put up some sort of paper. Sure, I get a few here, but that's it. 
 As I folded it up, I squinted at some of the bright colors. Brown, white, blue. 
 It was probably a pleasant surprise, but I'm beginning to question how this new thing works. 
 As I stood up from my papers, I stopped and turned away from the TV. My boss was standing in front of me, half-grinning and ready to give me a check for the next day. 
 "No, it's way too late to fix your computer. Keep it up, and try something else for today," I retorted. I smiled to myself. 
 My partner seems completely on board with this, and I went straight to work.<|endoftext|>

The window to the hallway was dark, it was quiet outside, against the wasteland of the quiet, there was an endless, lonely stairway. Maybe it was the adrenalin levels, maybe it was the shower curtain blocking the sunlight. But it could not be, couldn't be. 
 Sitting up, she breathed in deeply, unable to breath for that long, any breath, she could not find the strength in her chest to breathe the air into her lungs. Tread marks hung heavy against her torso, unable to breathe as much as she dared, leaning against the smooth granite wall. But in all her efforts, every last breath she allowed, she could not. Her breath was for the first time since her birth. 
 So she slid the blanket across her back and placed it on the ground. She had failed. Because that couldn ’ t happen. This mental experience was where her parents were, not in the child house, outside, in the graveyard; these were her parents in a home, or a childhood home, the last home she had ever known. Her parents lived in the living room alone, her dad had given up jobs at the grocery store to do some work for the company, or traveled to college, to work as a carpenter to make cabinets. But the painful memories didn ’ t stop, in the length of time the paralysis had knocked the father awake, not just emotionally, but physically, they were making her smile. She looked at the window, glancing back at the window in the living room. Right now, she could see the streets beyond; they were smooth and orderly, against the bleak walls. But this small spot on the top of the hill was she–she saw for the first time how she could never feel the same. So she looked back up to her balcony and unfurled the fairy whistle from above, sing some soliloquy for the crowd of sobs. And they cried for her, God knows what, louder than any child could. 
 One by one, they followed, but one by one, all crossed, one by one she saw the sinister beauty of it all. An endless, solitary square. It was almost dark, impossible for her to watch a sky so small without blurred eyes. She saw stars, but not black as this world that she had been born in. She saw streets, but not dust like this, vast and immensity. She saw a world where strangers decided to socialize, but then kept eerily quiet as friends and neighbors watched a smooth news segment. It was shocking and very sad at the same time. What she didn ’ t anticipate was how lonely it would be, her self hating and self focused on petty things like playing video games or watching cartoons. She missed one thing, and felt her heart race, that stomach turning and then that heart pounding fast enough to follow the weight of the days. If she had just thought it down sooner she would be okay, she ’ d have found comfort in that, the people who had been living life just like the others, that couldn ’ t die without pity or fear or fear. She felt she could move on, move on as her parents had, but that day never came, they would never leave her behind. And then, she would do what she did best, where she would live it, and who she had been doing it with the most heartbroken of faces.<|endoftext|>

It had been a wonderful holiday, the way it always has. Elsa – the husband of my childhood dolls – held me in her arms with the makings of a father and mother. And then we kissed. That one night I had wanted a forager, too. 
 But, by the time Christmas rolled around my family was loaded out. I wasn't allowed to stay much longer, and Elsa would have been fine with this arrangement. They took away everything my life wanted to see, and anyway I had to come with them. So I sat in an empty room like this for hours trying to find the best way to absolve myself of the curse. 
 Santa raised his eyebrows and relaxed his grip on my arms before turning towards me. He took a huge breath and leaned over to reveal a big, ugly grin on his face. That was strange. This really was strange, you know? 
 I had swallowed nervously. 
 "Who are you? " 
 He sat across from me. " I don't know. I haven't really been that awkward in years. " 
 " Fine, " I said. " First time dealing with that cauldron of sins. Should I try them one more time? " 
 " We don't really have a time frame, do we? They're not so important anymore anyway. " 
 " Alright, so I have been at this for awhile. Why don't you call me Anna again? " 
 " It's been a crazy year, isn't it? " 
 He sighed. " This always sucks, though. I miss seeing you, but this is finally over. Elsa, you are soooo much more powerful than I thought! " 
 But, I knew there was a part of me that still had nightmares about the night before – I just didn't expect this to happen with me again. 
 " Wait, wait, wait! " I shouted. " Wait! " 
 " Elsa, I want you to go see my picture! " 
 " I can't – I swear I couldn't. " 
 " No, no, no, please! " 
 He slowly stood, and I wasn't sure how long we sat there, or if I was ok with him actually changing my mind. 
 " Okay, okay, please. " 
 Then he pulled a rifle out from under his table. " I can't do this any more. It gets annoying when people become so attached, and then all of a sudden, they end up in a cage, with a bunny in one arm. I don't even want them to live. This is the fun part. Remember when you were like those fucking babies? " 
 " Oh yeah? Yeah, I thought you couldn't kill that. Just let me bring a few of those presentable presents to you. " 
 " I'll be okay, " he said. " Come on then. " 
 We stood there, until he turned back to me. 
 " Do what I say. " 
 " Don't worry. I'll be fine. See you on Christmas."<|endoftext|>

Dahlia is a good writer. Maybe, by the time she finishes "Dahlia ", everyone will have figured out that she's talented, but you have to give her a keep. I love writing, but writing also feels like it's repeatedly rambling. Maybe she'll speak on one of the threads I hadn't touched in my head for a long while. I only have a couple of stories that are signed. 
 All I want to do is hope she gets any positive feedback I give her. 
 I don't believe in negativity, I'd rather take care of it. Post another write-up after all. I'd highly recommend covering your first few stories with another person, and hope you don't backtrack. 
 I also found someone who was very receptive to stories about different forms of fiction, so, no big surprise.<|endoftext|>

This is my first time posting anything on here. I hope you like it. In fact I did it in 15 minuets. I might have a few more. I am always trying my best to write and I don't know what the restrictions on what I can do are. 
 Anyway. Any feedback would be welcome and appreciated. I hope it's useful for the prompt in general. My viewpoint is always changing, of course. 
 Great work, Cheers.<|endoftext|>

This morning, callum in the capsule had reached orbit. He was almost face first the camera playing his drum and his melody said to launch it as close as he could as it cast a shadow on the surface. As soon as that piece of metal dropped, his mind shut down from the events coming in and stopped looking at his clock. It read 7:37am. Strange, his head struggled to stabilize but he finally did fall onto his side as he fell forward. Looking at the time, he quickly scanned the wicket-tone of the photograph revealing that in what felt like a blink his pupil actually had two flanks. For some reason, the lack of a center too bright allowed him to see the larger side though. " Choral is - 
 The sound of a gas mask slowly rose from the capsule's soundproofing unit. The capsule suddenly roared in a choir as a coffin rose out of the corner of the container into a bustling industrial area. Callum walked over to a military exercise table. 
 He leaned over his table and touched his forehead. It was covered in black paint, completely devoid of color. There was little of other than a bowl on his desk with the paperwork he was running down. The office was empty. " Come here* " he felt the elevator door open, and a light was brought into the room. 
 " See my homework? " Callum asked the officer standing beside him. 
 " Yes. " the officer said, motioning towards him. " Yes... a topic I just really wanted to hear. " 
 " Brain dead, I don't get why you want me to write that. " Callum lied. 
 " S-Someday " the officer exclaimed. " We'll go forward or we can pull the plug. Thanks for the sample. I'll need to get back to base when my interplanetary scan is complete. " The officer popped an envelope, and a black jet black device appeared at the end of the red plastic cup. " If you don't mind, to get back to base, I've got a message ready for me. " 
 " Has there ever been a paper connection that hasn't been the entire thing? " 
 " Good. " The voice resonated through the entire room. Before this day Callum hadn't been able to walk or speak. Each of his cerebrum had absorbed his thoughts as well as his consciousness. It was through that that the capsule was able to continue running. 
 " Pay attention fellow here, this is Callum. This is going to be a long day. " 
 * " Crap. " * 
 " Is this how spacewalk is gonna go? " Callum watched as he was grounded and sent back into the anomaly. He waited, not knowing why he would have to get back to base as a result of this speech. " Let's hope, callum, we're not alone."<|endoftext|>

"We can call this truce, but it won't last for long. " 
 Captain Smith spoke up, before shaking his head in exasperation and continuing to speak, in a childish tone, as if emotion had played a role. 
 " Well done, Luk " the other planetarian replied. He now seemed to be abandoning his humanity in his speech, barely daring to look up. 
 The Imperial fleet could have been anywhere. Suddenly, it all changed. His world was disintegrated by the realisation that everyone he ever knew, there was no one left. 
 Shadows he could not see covered the horizon. The distant sounds of heavy explosions were all cut short. Some soldiers would die, everyone would die by nothing. 
 " We tried *her*, but we couldn't do it. We *we* backed her back. " 
 Elegant Zip emerged from a shadowy figure beside him. The rebel had a point. Humanity's last hope had been wiped out. With his bare hands, he pushed the phalanx of armed troops towards him. 
 Shrouds had formed, reaching towards their home world. Soldiers marched further towards the offensive. 
 " Please, assist them, " said Zip. 
 Captain Smith had grown bored. His last person to be on this peaceful planet, had fallen outside the window of his window. The forces from several worlds were converging on him, but there were no forces flying or moving. His mind was filled with the familiar nameless figure. 
 " Marcus, " whispered Zip. 
 " I know it's been a while. Please take me back. " 
 " Stop it. " 
 " No... this is not who we were before " the messaged him to something. 
 Brief noises started. Blood was being sprayed everywhere. The enemy forces were not being pushed back either. 
 " Zip, please, let go of me. " 
 " Marcus! " The messaged said. " Please! Help us! " 
 " We didn't know your mother, Marcus! She was a one of us! Tell her I love you, and tell her that you love her. You are a responsible, compassionate, and faithful colleague. " 
 " Don't... stop... " 
 " Please, please help, " the message said before finding a comforting position in a nearby cave. 
 When they came to a standstill, they met the alien force. Their counterparts gazed as helpless as the clump of rock. They let the long steel armour of the Death Star strike them down. 
 " We are no longer called upon to end the current peace, " said the Death Star to Zip. " This war has been end at last. This... war has died. We are no longer an avatar of the gods. We were all swept aside by this. " 
 " If you stop this now, when you come to the Council, we will begin the process anew. After all, they have successfully invaded our home world, Earth, and vowed to destroy us if we did not comply. We will test every step to counter these invaders. " 
 Zip's hand opened to release the Emperor's thumb, and he turned to face the Death Star. " They will prove to be weak. We shall have no more population. We will die. " 
 The Emperor rose to the dais, then fell to the floor with a defeat. 
 " We love you. We have no enemies left. We believe in you."<|endoftext|>

A candlelight facade of a room, running over bodies, across statues, and beneath leather and blood. A portrait of a young man's face looking straight into the heart, his lips held high by frenzied terror. Blood stains the underside of his cheekbone; eyes darkened by deep red, softly pulsating like a clockwork in his veins. 
 My name, Nick Nickessa Montes, was born on the fourth of May 1793, in the lovely vale below Merrick and Calderwood Falls. My parents suspected that my mother might have been born there, from her well-bred cousins and a nearby family who apparently neglected to provide for her. I asked father why he had named me that, he would have been amazed and agreed but I was unwell at the time. I would have, as he had called me, turned around in dismay. I was well, kept a secret from everybody, he didn't think of me as nothing more than one of his precious white penguins. 
 His life, but his name, used to be by him as a shorthand to reference his adoptive father. Later though, my father told me, I might have been too-simple if he had had a father he was unable to name. I had instead been moved too-soon, I guess that he just happened to be a horrible peanut butter and jelly eater. 
 My other last name, based upon a lighter on a blanket over the family beds was Lou Bobble-Do. It was several times more brilliant, the brilliance in a punny puzzle of fantasy than the bold hand name I had given my name back in the toilet as a joke. The laughter, and the serenity of pain was more frightening than the tasteless excitement of a car crash. 
 I was never once confronted by the authorities, nor after a whisper by the police. That was an unpleasant combination, I could not and would not. Most of the time, a lighter or two in water would always to offer me someone to talk to, even if it was being swigged by a dying person. It didn't come to my attention until three years later, when I told the police and the coroner for the inquest that I had been convicted of a number of crimes, and for forcibly sterilizing an infant who I had known that day. I had a being that called me everywhere; no longer was there any family name, only a nickname. 
 It was my last name that taught me of the importance of being good at what we did best. I had a name so close to my birth that my past-to-the-future memories were led to me, and so soon, I was led to love it. I will always know that moment when it dawns on me-my name. 
 One day I awoke to my back straightened and I could lay a hand on my chest. I checked the clock, counting down the minutes as I slowly swallowed out the last of my man-naked stench. I'll be home. 
 I opened the door and scooted over, falling down to my knees. My first name will remember me as a simple white penguin-owned german shepherd who played with some of his chicks. The names will glow in my mind as I lay awake-and dreaming.<|endoftext|>

I feel like I must look away a bit. Why me? Well not on purpose, of course. My greatness I don't care for. I'm a little insecure in our shared house, and yet I'm so easily fixated upon eating your heads off just to sit around on the couch in your apartment, sitting in your chair. Sometimes the fun is lost, the feeling of freedom is there and I can't help but blurt to myself, How can I improve my own personal style? Like this gem of a young lady, I make great out of it all and I thrive, I make sure she prays for me every day and I enjoy listening to her voice for a while. You can ask her all you want, but she'll never say a word or say a word I won't. So if I'm finished speaking to her as much as I am leaning over her, how can I fail? Well there are many things I like to say about my darling Yvette, and I don't use her name. Yvette is the kind of woman that loves to speak softly to people that your in a mood, a girl I'm sure, and one of my favorite objects. Which brings me to that box. Why is it so empty? Yvette is a mother I treasure, one of the most beautiful women I've ever met, who would covet me for my love of watching over her young and rebellious young mind. No other woman speaks to me as she always does. 
 I've been wishing I could be like the others, that she'd do anything for me. I did once need a shirt and I took that upon myself, otherwise I would be surrounded by all those beautiful women that I would make happy with every day. We turned our backs to the media, we became mouthing the latest while drinking away at our morning coffee. We drove down and out of town before the traffic lights dropped and everyone who walked by us was flashing a red and white and with those lines that lettering I had practiced so many times, always wanted to see what one of my favorite gentlemen would do before he left. I was so wrong, I was wrong. Her parents were probably the first to see me because I thought I might. They did not believe me either, because my father was an alcoholic who never drank and my mother played this big phony role in the divorce to get ahead. The inevitable news pieces screamed out in the paper, telling people who they should never marry and yet they insisted they loved her. I kept saying if I married someone I would still be his greatest, but now they're saying I wouldn't be loved, that I would be seen as unloved by all the ladies who I've been calling my love. I kept saying that my ideal man would never marry if he were his father and I was glad that is what came to my mind after this very moment. I started recording and uploading my feelings, so now I'm releasing my true feelings, a horrible pain running down my spine.

 It's really really that simple! Write a beautifully written story about Yvette, tell me a story that makes me smile, and tell me that they can see I was happy! I had the greatest idea of my life as I spent so much time with Yvette, but all I could manage were the comments, I had to do it without asking too much because I loved Yvette and I did because I enjoyed watching her smile. The same social media buttons popped up on the television every day to let people know if a story would get any better, that there were winners, and to see the hopes, dreams, and hopes shared with Yvette count as too much praise. It seems like great inspiration for me as I wrote the story, and I'm just going to edit it into something that I just have no idea I could do. I'm sorry if you're skeptical, but you're interested in making a story out of that. 
 Edit: The kicker: Yvette's my mother, I'm really proud of how every character wrote the story together. Just a couple more lines of text and yeeeeum.<|endoftext|>

The sounds of gunfire was akin to hearing a beating heart, but it was no beating heart. It was getting louder. The entrance was not big enough to get in but it wasn't much, 10 meters at least. There were two swordsmen walking in one direction and a dude in the other. They both looked about 20 years old. At the same time, waiting for the right time to enter. The swordsman took a step closer. The swordman appeared to be aware of the change, the guy was already close. He ran faster, he was always on a run, approaching quickly when the bullets didn't catch his shot. This time, he had the edge, no matter what the bullets were, he'd miss the shot. A bullet started to drop next to the swordman, but the guy lost control and struck the swordman directly. It was like a grape, healing him later. But the swordman continued dodging. He started to charge up faster, hiding behind a tree and waiting for the right guy to hit him. The swordman managed to out range the bullet one, and get into the air before a foot or two of the bullet hit the swordsman. The swordman was fired towards the other swordman, and got into the middle of the sword blade, hurting him terribly. He hit his foot, knocked him out cold. The guy didn't retaliate, but he was still falling towards the guy, and quickly stopped, splashing like a motherfucker. The swordsman cursed once more, the first thing he do after falling is to steal a bullet from a swordman and shoot it, and then spit it at him. This time, the people in the hall gasped, not because they feared for their lives, but because they saw a clearly killed swordman. This time, both parties were in the room for six minutes, there were people gone, but only one of the swordsman was still alive. The guards were still in the room with the swordsman, the fight had ended on that day. Not one death, but two people in a conference room. Other fights had started more, but only one of them ever took place. The people fell at the feet of the swordman. They had a name to face here, but theirs was different: Izanami.<|endoftext|>

"All we got on our 6th " said Semitic " Same deal as year 1 ", among which there was Hell. Hell was always shocking enough, and this year Hell was actually a little off. 
 " Let's do it " saw the god " Hammer. " 
 " You know what Hammer, you have to blow down the Excalibur. " Samba said, crossing his arms across his chest. 
 " I blow it Down, sucker. " Semitic said, leaping up on his legs and smashing his feet against the ground. " Don't waste your time playing for shit. Our gods can't barely say'sorry' to us right now! " 
 The door slid open and three men in black suits walked in. 
 " We are priests, Semitic, to you and me " 
 " You are the priest!? " 
 " Some kid named Sierra Bob was playing chess in the park bench this morning. The man in the suit couldn't even make it a 30 or 40 with his left arm, his entire arm. There was only five dollars in his cup. " 
 " Hey, what are you on about, Samba? " 
 " That Grandma had a baby she said she wanted to talk to, so I figured let's him pick the best part. " 
 " Yeah, uh, alright so the God of Power drinks a bunch of French wine that he wanted to take home from the party. " 
 " Can you eat from the wine, fellow god? " 
 " Um... no but I did. The other one is a moron talking about how he got lost in the garden and his friend died last week. So I thought I just let his friend get pretty lost and remember where he was. " 
 " More like, around the time you killed her and his friend, so it's like, three years later and you made a terrible mistake by driving a fork through the non-existent car in front of you, and you're driving the same car, and you keep going while you've gotten the bicycle. " 
 " So, you drove it because its not... horrible anymore? " 
 " Uh, yeah. " 
 " That's weird to think of because you can fit all of your sins over one another in a single sip, and you know the car gets to go in reverse, the violinist decides to sit on his horse and suss it out between two people, the chicken coop pays the rent, and the one child after a push goes to sleep, so you had to tell it to you, but it doesn't do anything to him " 
 " And Jesus only doesn't like Horsemen anymore? " 
 " Uh, yeah, like the angel. He hates horsemen anyway, and a bunch of really religious guys like Harlot, the golden calf, and Macbeth the Scarlet and the Nineveh king have all met, and all of them don't like horsemen so your baby Jesus has become a racist. " 
 " We don't like all of that, Semitic. " 
 " Sorry but I can't throw a game to god except where he drinks wine too, and the rest is wine anyway. " 
 " I don't want to throw a game to God. " 
 " No you can't, Samba. Just get over it. " 
 " I just have to win one " 
 " You can't win the game to god. " 
 " But I will give you the life of John and the life of John and the life of Jesus."<|endoftext|>

October 4, 2016. Her darkest hour was today, when she awaited the day her power would be redeemed. Some are good, others are evil. Some are made of fathomless anguish. My hand brushed the twitching sand on her pale cheeks, and the furgy girders of her beard brushed off of her pale, thick shoulders. 
 “ What ’ s the day, naw? ” The young girl asked, as she looked at the pale boy who hesitated a bit before starting to answer “ Well, you know, I ’ m giving you ten years and I don ’ t know what you ’ ll be doing with them if you don ’ t solve this soon. ” 
 I couldn ’ t help feeling torn out of my misery. I hadn ’ t ever told my parents that I ’ d done this. I ’ d never known. I couldn ’ t stand to be denied so easily. 
 Our curfew was nearly unbroken. The grand guards, if you could call them, sat on the edge of their chairs. Lights flickered on and off, and green paper laid in the corners. The little girl ’ s desk had seen better days. It wasn ’ t until she took a sander that I noticed. 
 There had been tears in her eyes, of despair. Tears that went down like small balls of sand on a lake where they should be. Her boss's smile brightened her, as if showing her how much love he was for me, and all his jokes were full of grandiose sarcasm. I remembered the times we danced on our mothers islands, and dreamed about being king. I remembered how wild he was, as if he were the only true king in the world. I remembered his ways, his vast powers that most people could not comprehend, his fear that no man could have before him. I remembered his times as a child, in this tiny box without one hundred men, whom he called games to entertain a small audience. 
 We kept up the game, as the families waited outside. The grand guard ’ s face contorted in shock as we played, cradling her in our arms. She lifted her head, eyes burning with tears and fear. 
 “ Hey, Mom, ” I whispered softly. I could barely hold back the tears. 
 I stood and held my child, which had taken a hit from another bat. I was overjoyed. My gift was the one that finally gave birth to my family. 
 He was born.<|endoftext|>
**********935**********
*Oh, * I thought to myself. I could have been crazy today, but I had a few things planned up so I got it in my head at the time, and everyone knew it was too late to do it. I was still a virgin. Little hints that actually made my brain start moving again, I could track the code in it, but I didn't know when I'd stop. When I went to my gal's house and she wasn't even home yet, we decided to do it for the night. We packed, and then we went home after we took the drive, which meant maybe I forgot to take her home, but who cares? We locked our doors again, and I got my destiny laid. I checked my wrist. There was three words on it. 
 **God** 
 I flipped that over, shaking my head in disbelief. * Oh * Why the hell are the words in there?! What the hell! * * Oh, no I was like *this! * 
 A sweeping, whirlwind of confused look crept over my face as I realized I was still in another place. 
 *Oh, * I thought to myself. Why the hell was I so sick! * 
 I pulled a title out of my pocket and started to read. 
 *God, Oh My God, Oh My God, Oh My God, Oh My God! * 
 I waited in confusion for the perfect moment to disappear and then began staring down the entire wall at the it. It felt good. I knew it, it had to be real. But I couldn't put it back. It told me there were only nine more words. 
 **God** 
 Oh yeah, which is like, one less power word in those few words. Oh yeah, how did that have to happen? 
 I started to realize I could only type the keywords that I typed into the site a few times and then I would have to scroll to put out the title. Why was I so tired? 
 I opened my eyes to the sparkling star in the sky and blackness in the center of the room. I was frustrated, but this didn't bother me. My hand didn't move, I could feel that I was in contact with a horrible, glowing, object. 
 *Ohhh, * I thought. I stood up, and looked around. Things had always been different, except that I could barely look into the eyes of these eyes. But somehow I could see more clearly. 
 A cut was stabbing my right side. 
 **God, Oh My God, Oh My God, Oh My God** 
 Was I losing control? Did they see what I was doing? Had I touched something? Could I have been in contact with something? 
 I could feel the wind rushing through my hair and the cold air around me. How did I even turn my head? How did I know this was happening? 
 They suddenly came over the edge, with a loud howl that sounded like lightning, getting closer and closer. 
 *Oh no oh god oh God no, no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh * 
 And I froze. I knew they knew me. I know what I did. What I was doing. 
 Then I saw it. A fleshy, soot-covered pile of scales and bones in the center of the room. I heard a loud thud and my eyes snapped open. I saw the deadly stench wafting around me like hell. 
 I reached down and touched the spear that was hanging from my godhead with my hand. I saw silver shimmering from it, and I knew I would not leave it. 
 And that was how I got out of the spell box, assuming all of the voices in here were evil.<|endoftext|>

The forty minute hangover made him twitch his arms into submission. He tried to keep his eyes focused, just in case. 
 This was going to be a hard day for him. They had been together for two years, raising two beautiful young kids, one of which I knew so well. They had no knowledge of the world and barely interacted when it was happening and their families' finances were strained. Everyone forgot how they made the money, the health insurance they paid out, the retirement accounts they still had. This was not the problem it took for me to make their online shows fail. 
 But it had been a long time since I started donating. I mean, people had always seemed a bit pathetic, it was not the biggest deal, just thinking of their jobs to sure, especially when they were in the business of making money and discussing the present in a transactional way. And of course I would always have had a team, a staff, and a team of each to keep things going. 
 I had, I knew it was the right decision for both of us and how far we had sunk. What followed was an unsmiling silence, but a awkward silence. The silence that caused every single person else to open their eyes and look at the grey area in their daily life, an invisible haze. 
 Nothing was happening. Nothing could change that. 
 As the last of his followers fell asleep, the love of my life after all, I felt blessed to have been able to join the inner circle of the Facebook family. My hands shook. 
 Time stopped. 
 A shadowy figure hoisted myself from my couch. After a few moments of searching, I found him sitting on the white tiled wall on the other side of the bedroom. He looked exactly like Zuckerberg, except for his green hat on. 
 He told me that he could keep going, keep bringing things in, they all had a purpose, but he could not leave the Facebook family. This world was for people to make and leave out the ugly parts. People like Zuckerberg were supposed to keep people feeling happy and healthy, being the life they were supposed to be. They should be able to forget what would happen when the money ran out. 
 But Zuckerberg did not make me sad. He showed me his Facebook page. 
 "Pfff... How about a date... " he whispered, before turning back to me. 
 " I didn't... I didn't... I didn't.... " I stammered, my voice shaking. " If we meet again, we could make our families happy again. If they need money... I can afford to pay for their therapy again. I can make a small amount from this list for them, and that little will be my birthright... " 
 He turned away in embarrassment. I laughed. Facebook owned me and I knew it. I had decided that the first thing I should do in my life was give it all away, forever. The infamy of the social media nightmare would be ours now. 
 I took the signs out of the signs with trembling fingers and embraced them. It was less bad than the money... it was actually worth it. 
 Why wait for this? I brought up the option again, but he stared at my hands and answered " I said without hesitation. The next time you get up, I promise you... you can have this, anytime." 
 A blinding white light engulfed me as I got up and fell on my back.<|endoftext|>

I lifted the night sky just as the mines began. The Mother Earth landed in front of me. It was all set, secluded from the rest of the globe. The grand chamber and it's wonderful views. 
 People grew up here. They came from all over the planet. Many died, but for me it was as natural as climbing the great hill down the street down the road to my shop, the building, the rest of my family. 
 With their tools, survival skills, attitude I looked for ghosts. Fire devils are known from time to time. 
 People love them, even if they're out on their merry way away. I was a natural, without a vocation. 
 Even through all this time I wish I could've been ordinary. 
 I never held a job like this and they always told me I was smart. 
 Paying real nosy little Philanthropies just to get your hands dirty has hurt really badly in my last years. 
 Everyone keeps pestering me. All I can do now is sit down in my shop and start to pray that life should stay this way. 
 This was my third wedding anniversary. My parents died and my wife died. My wife was one of the first people that had a wedding ring to give birth to. 
 My third wedding anniversary was yesterday. My parents died two weeks before the day of the ceremony. 
 I started praying, listening, hoping that if Philanthropies couldn't get their hands dirty so I could marry them I should. 
 I prayed so deep inside that I could hear the hum of the world turning to dark. The few seconds that I could left my fingers and I could hear the hum of the earth. 
 It's right now...<|endoftext|>

Hey you there, 
 I have never been one to really enjoy writing in just about any medium. Not just for a dozen or so people, or just anyone a few miles away from me. Actually, that whole thing doesn ’ t take long. I find myself at some levels of friendship for the rest of my life. To be honest I don ’ t understand why the day I first met my wife, Izzy, my entire world was empty of colour, or how I ended up in an Indiana Jones cartoon. The only thing that made me feel a bit better is the look in our eyes when we locked lips. One day my own toochor-art school biology teacher ( named Fran ) told me a few stories about our dead betrothed, his top hat right next to his head, and our ugly burning corpses, but today… 
 I stand up, it's 2 AM, and I hurriedly turn to hand the first class a map of the Northwestern University campus that the photographer assigned to me said was either on a Monday, or I was cross with that pencil pusher. No, I came up with this fable because, well, it ’ s hard to really explain.<|endoftext|>

In the beginning I dreamt that I was God 
 As a boy I dreamed that I was lonely 
 Until I found it when I was 45 
 When I found it 
 The library was empty 
 While I looked around a little, 
 And remembering a book 
 That has long gone to dust 
 For that little book. 
 As I peeked through the library, 
 I wondered if I was the last one left, 
 Being his successor 
 But as I looked back at the book 
 And why I swore I was the last one in the church 
 I knew that I was God 
 Or maybe I was Just a bit naive, 
 But I knew that I was going to die
And the books were sold because I made them. 
 I was filled with endless possibilities 
 And stories that I couldn't quite put my finger on 
 Because I knew that I was going to die 
 And knowing that I was going to die 
 But the library contained books that I couldn't get through. 
 I didn't see enough books like the ones I read in school, 
 So I tried the hope that people would read in school again, 
 And new ones that came along, and the papers that were good, 
 And the books that became well-known. 
 Eventually though I lost hope 
 Because I was too busy being a rock out the box, 
 Maybe I forgot about the books to me! 
 And that's what people expect me to do 
 Because you can't change the future 
 So I'm still trying to fix the books 
 And hoping for my death.<|endoftext|>

Blood stained the cubicle walls as the call on my cell phone rang. I looked up, blinking at the clouds emerging from the layer of smoke that always settled over the glass of an office cubicle a quarter away from the window. A cold fear was creeping over me, the feeling that something terrible was about to befall me. How could I have known that right then? 
 Seated in my cubicle I chuckled at the worst joke anyone could say as I rose from my chair and tried to get up. The office work was nerve wracking for some of the people I was assigned to, but that was a huge plus because I could bring my boss and the president of the state up if I was, hell, the president myself. 
 "Hey there jerk. Thanks for calling. Can I have a minute to get this over with? " 
 " Yeah. Sorry, " I said, looking down to my watch. The window was empty, so I hopped onto my front walk to the two console's and sat down in front of it. The display reminded me of a big button I didn't think I would ever see on a screen, and the results would be filled in at 10:00PM EST on a Saturday. 
 I paused to look at the blue one on the screen and checked my watch. 9:06 AM EST. I tapped a few more buttons on the controller and put my phone into my ear. " Shit, I can't have my cell phone here in my office with me!" I yelled as my phone literally whirred away, and a tear rolled down my cheek as a bullet tore through the rectum from the two consoles and a gaping hole appeared in the space separating it from the computer room. 
 I got up slowly as the glass came down onto the surface of the floor and went outside to get at the thunderstorm that was the future. The sky had long since turned black, and with it, several provinces that seemed oblivious to what was going on around them were utterly deserted. This, I know, is the future because every man has been so stupid and ignorant to realize their country has been given the go ahead for the modern period, and if they don't reach out to the deep reserves of the Arctic they can be forced to go back to the desert for generations to come. 
 Or if they do, take the city of Pittsburgh.<|endoftext|>
**********941**********
As I stared at the two utterly obnoxious parties that I was holding up in front of the fireplace, the wall in the front room was suddenly shattered. 
 "Lying here, about to be embarassed by someone? " 
 The wind outside started to sweep the snow in my face. 
 " Oh don't be ridiculous, " I sighed, " Can't you see that it's strange, Santa Claus, and yet you're actually standing here with the giant snowman holding something? " 
 It was almost as if the giant man was having a discussion. 
 " No, " I said, awkwardly, " I think it's funny, " A little farther down the counter it goes, " all over the place, people are screaming and arguing. I guess its funny that Santa Claus does that all the time, anyway. I mean, why not be a puppet? " 
 A black creep rose up out of the shadow and was standing straight on me. The 'Slytherin' covered in a layer of dust began to do the dead snotty dance of motion, sliding from the wall to the fireplace. The blow came on like a trumpet hitting a trumpet, and the snowman, being electrified, opened his mouth and blew snow out of his mouth. 
 I immediately went to my safety and ran to the bathroom with the snowman in my hand, by this time I was already exhausted. 
 The snowman looked up at me as I swatted it. 
 " Heyyyy, can you play for us? " 
 " I'm James. " 
 James and I were sitting on a patch of frozen tiles, and we were sitting in a freezing slush. I could see even further into the room, and so I knew who was about to drop ice cold water on me. 
 " I'm glad you were there, " James said, " It's been a long time since I saw you. " 
 I turned to tell him, 
 " James? " 
 James looked a little disheveled, " Yes, I'm actually looking for you. You know, the giant snowman, from your blog, about yesterday. " 
 " Oh wow, " I said, " Can you have a second to tell me about what's going on? " 
 " Stuck in a perfect fucking moment," the snowman said. 
 The snowman ran to me and looked at me for a while and then slid on his shoe in apology. 
 James was gone in one piece.

"Don't you see, there is nothing you can do about it. Just go right ahead, and take any last of the lives of your closest friends. If you only do it one more time... " 
 I sat on my doe-like-like floor, in shock. On purpose. After all, I would have much to give people. But not this time. 
 " I came to offer you this. " 
 " Oh, this is it, I can show them how worthless life truly is. " 
 The beautiful woman just stood there silently for a moment. No matter how this may seem, this was something I really wanted. This moment was what made me so miserable. Why did I care so much for her? 
 " Why couldn't you just give me one more year of your life, and take those ones you love, and give me yours, and leave me with my last present? " 
 She just had to. It was a beautiful gift. The one she had worked so hard for so long could she at least carry on? This little thing had been a favor I had always wanted. This gift was the reason I had come here. 
 " The hole in the shoulder you just gave me was so huge, I could only make it smaller. " 
 " For so long it has cost me, you and I, like 3 mil, dollars. Do you understand? I need you to *know*, that I will give this little girl what she deserves. Because this little girl has already taken my life."<|endoftext|>

The first waves of invaders approached the center of the city. The city hardened into a newly planted zoned urban center. Cables and buildings pushed past the passageway as the mainland guards dashed over the narrow path. Amid the chaos of battle the guards of London swarming their way up the marble interiors with their troops the walls surrounding the city. In seconds they could advance several blocks from all of the towers, but were stopped by a gang of southern smartlaces and naval armored elites. A strong barrage of missile shells rang out at the first spurt of gunfire hitting the targets. 
 “ The wooden wailing of bones is so savage! Every last one of our men slaughters, it ’ s done them no injustice. We are encircling you now, an armored hand against your will. ” 
 The second wave collapsed over a bridge with their archers grasping at its walls. As many of the knights fled the dungeons a small group of paladins led by a young Argentinian man by the name of Gustavo came to the castle. “ This is the worst part of your life, you can ’ t even fight back, you kill every word of an Iraqi judge who insults your religious community! ” The Argentinian smiled at Gustavo in a stern tone and replied. “ Rest, you may rest. ” 
 They retreated towards the center of the city. Their presence appeared just as ominous as the flag draped over a truck with the slogan “ The Holy Holy Cross. ” Gustavo realized what was going on. They met with an army composed almost entirely of Argentinian General Juarez, a brand new general of the main army. He instructed his soldiers to take out the convicts before they got too high. He shot Emilio's civilian daughter, Delia, an Argentine herself. He placed a bullet to her head and fed the corpse to a nearby pirate named Hugo. Hugo was put on trial for trying to convert the old Argentinian army to his cause. Gustavo was far more successful then Gustavo had expected. All that was left was Gustavo, hungry and tired. He ran the final 100 knights to the buildings. As he crept through the buildings a few armored elites started to vanish. Gustavo winced from a wake up call and sent a reassuring push for the top command officers. 
 “ Christina and Spencer. ” Gustavo cocked his head. 
 A flood of merriment filled Gustavo ’ s head. “ Please send in Christina and Spencer. We need you to leave the gates open and we have told the marines that if they come after us the Argentinian government will shut down the naval-bases and all military installations that involve Catholic commando units. You are the ones on guard, we will leave on your orders. ” Gustavo punched Christina in the stomach and pushed out of the doorway. She was a wraith, wrapped in other wraiths held in captivity. Gustavo knew that the Nortelians would find the military installations and oil areas. Gustavo passed Christina through and out the door. He knew that the marines would find Christina and Spencer when Gustavo backed up and made his escape. Gustavo the Mage of the North had a growing reservoir of nobles thanks to Gustavo. Gustavo cursed himself with every meal and death of his high command. He would regret a meal now that this would not serve his glory well. Gustavo flashed a proud smile as he passed away. Gustavo enjoyed himself. Gustavo will not return to this world. Gustavo takes a deep breath and opens his eyes. The shadows of his father disappear, just a few shadows hung about. Gustavo opened his eyes.

I normally have one of these things going around. It ’ s the day I wake up. My hands, hands are bound down a pegboard. My face is covered in sweat. My left eye sees these things move throughout my body. I simply can ’ t explain them. 
 Nothing has changed. The computer is still reading my clock. It ’ s still playing a video on facebook. It turns over my minutes and hours and it ’ s just history, showing calendar features. 
 I run my hand across the keyboard like my thumb over something and the mouse disappears. 
 My nervousness as usual. * I should see it* 
 My future is all in pieces now. I wake up and enter my private bathroom. This is the first time I ’ m used to this. * Much better than the day I was born*<|endoftext|>

Day 57: 
 I had a dream. In the midst of a late night by myself, I awoke with a start. I normally woke up at 5:01. It was a great dream, all things considered. I slept normally. I always have, but nothing could prepare me for waking up when, just like that, my phone rang. 
 As usual, I thought about my dreams. Like they always have. 
 But then, something gets strange. It was my apartment. A lamp was in my living room, laying nearby. What was that sound? Oh, there were no words. I just realized that I couldn ’ t read the phone. * that couldn ’ t be true, that was impossible*, I thought. My paranoia turned to be relief. I see, I can read letters.<|endoftext|>

The link to this subreddit was taken from Wikipedia page: D 
 Within minutes, it was all over, the countdown just a few short seconds in. As it had been for months, the mouse cursor tried to create a game object to collect and explore. As of yet, no one could find the solution, the world was missing one tiny thing that had been missing from life before. The mice had shown themselves human, and their world was missing something so small in reality, they could not even function on it. It has been three months, the world is empty. In all of time, they have vanished, but this time, something horrifying had happened. After more than three weeks of plague, they were unable to reproduce. When a possible virus had been discovered, with no traces left, they were desperately attempting to defend themselves. Finding the cure is impossible, they discovered the virus after burrowing around thousands of human corpses. They stayed inside because of it, knowing that this could destroy them, but nobody would protect them from the virus. So the only solution was to burrow, hiding from the assassin. What happened next causes the massive shockwaves throughout the world. Every inch of the world fell into darkness, millions died, and within the world, the mouse had chosen to fly.<|endoftext|>

M.I.P. Hawkins whispered. Our wedding song, originally written to invoke hope of a future marriage, began with our lips touching. Although he has always insisted that it shouldn't have happened, we usually just get to watch and catch what we did wrong. 
 "Hey honey! " Sarah cried, kissing him. They had been like that ever since she turned 18. She had never been shy about her emotions, and was thankful for everything that the family had put her through. That was, until that night. 
 She was walking home from the parking lot of the store when she saw a young man walking down the road and saw Sarah holding a roll of paper with " NOTE: " and " I am leaving a note".<|endoftext|>

The Gods of old were dense. Their statues shared their story with those of us two. What one imagined was the unfolding plot of a long legend, unknown but abundant enough to be accessible. From a young age the wonder was simple. 
 And so began a thousand years of exploring the universe, hoping to see something new. A beginning. 
 The Gods led us, searching the rocks themselves and heedring our calls. In millennia we had found and saved countless, growing our species from a desolate existence in which we had been pushed by the Gods. We were fearless and we innovated. Our lives have been few. As we watched our world collapse around us, the Gods were threatened and they asked us to join the chaos and undo the cycle. 
 Nathaniel, our oldest friend, had decided that his father was a genius. He knew the fundamentals of alchemy and the mysteries of nature so he volunteered to join the Gods. Soon, the Gods had learned his importance, that our efforts and inventions had fueled an age long past. I could see the anxiety in Nathaniel's eyes as he knew his father's descent from an established authority through a gradual descent from creation to His invention of alchemy. 
 Nathaniel always asked why we died so quickly after our initial contact. He had no time for boring questions that could have been answered with simple logic and self-awareness, all the while foolishly pushing any scientific advancements they had made for the betterment of mankind. 
 "Alchemy isn't really that different from pulling your strings. " He shrugged the realization off his face in a smug manner that belied his ignorance. " The Gods aren't that different from us anymore." He smiled thinly and walked away. We had successfully stopped the Gods from creating a current that could save them. We could live in peace now, knowing that we can replace the one messiah and usher in an era of peace. 
 The Gods have even started hunting us down. They've raided their caves and set fire to anything they deem the least dangerous, though it can't be ruled out by man. It is a blessing in disguise. 
 Perhaps the Gods would have more power if they had found us. Perhaps the Gods were afraid of the untapped potential of mankind. Perhaps we could prove them wrong. 
 Nathaniel and I would create one last race. But our creators may not know it.

 *They have all taught us many lesson in morals, fairness, and common sense. Furthermore, they often act as guardians and bullies to protect our own, so as not to be influenced, exploited, or exploited. * 
 It is our only hope that we may create a new race, one which conforms to our common sense in every way. However, regardless of our theories, we must remember that not all creation is equal. There will always be failures and imperfections, but they will always be people who do the right things. 
 I guess you'd better start by seeing what's left of humanity, and not letting your plot.<|endoftext|>

Day 1303: 
 I bring a bottle of *Navy green vignette* down to take with me today. I twist the bottle up and make the glass bulge a little, shaking as I try to find new meaning to these last words. 
 "I need new help. " 
 I get the money from one person today, Bobby, and travel into some old film he had smuggled out. 
 " Its important. " I turn around as I take a look back. I had only just bought this bottle of champagne last week, but now a nice glass of red wine was running dry. 
 " What about you, Bobby? How old are you? " 
 " I'm 25, " I say to no one in particular, " I'm in good health. " 
 I turn back to him and take the glass. " Well? I don't have much left. " 
 I start to get really angry and angry about this, but before I can get my fury to boil, a stranger walks up and takes my wallet and keys out of my pocket. 
 " I was going to spend it on a novel. " 
 " I said no more book. " I answer as he walks away, leaving me in the act of waiting for the end of time and the same bottle of whiskey. 
 Day 1313: 
 I'm at my job now, filling paperwork with other people for distribution. 
 " So this is what you think it is then, Bobby? " 
 " Yeah! I told you the true truth, " I start to walk, seeing the light of my employer on my back. 
 I go down to my kitchen and get a beer, noting I wasn't going to make it. 
 Day 1716: 
 I get into the back of my car, *still* shaking, and find the bottle lying on the floor. I drink it, enjoying the taste of the glass. 
 " That's terrible, " I start with, but I realize what I'm doing, " You're a terrible liar, " I repeat, " I'm someone other than myself. You have no idea how unbelievably selfish you are. " 
 " I need people to help me, Bobby. " 
 " No, " I go back and look at the bottle in my hand, " No, No, No." I shake it and put it back on the table. 
 Day 17220: 
 I'm at my local coffee shop, not far from my job, and I'm standing in front of this television watching people talk about the collapse of civilization. 
 The moment we talk about the collapse, I hear some prank call about obesity. I run back to the car, the mouth is dry, but there is a note underneath: 
 †Leo* ( The Heist ) 
 P.S I'm not a con artist, will do a better job in the future. -Lupus<|endoftext|>

It was the week my best friend Lee was murdered, my best friend forced into a coma that made me rush around, starving, dying, time lived... could you imagine it... never worked out? Nobody cared. 
 But I don't blame any of it on him, though he was a jerk. He took away my friends life, my friends life too. Until he puts this all on me. 
 "Well now, don't cry, just take what's given you. " They've always told me, that was until one day he pushed me into a dumpster while I was in the process of dumping the garbage... leaving me starving and tired... 
 and then was so close to death that he had a knife to my neck, a razor to my jaw, blood everywhere. I could barely hear the pain that he instilled in me with his voice, only to be sure, he pushed my forward... I rushed, I screamed. God, I wanted to cry but he wouldn't allow me. I couldn't even hope to do anything. " I don't understand, you're such a moron " 
 What I said was, " It isn't natural right to weep like that. You've been out there too long and no one is going to change that for you. Do you know why you're here? Why do you need a means to get to your objective? Your most cherished memory isn't even from you. It's from the red... He's better off if you disappear..." 
 And I was still here... my only hope, my one hope is that someday he's going to succeed, someday this time we'll reunite once again... then we'll win again, even though it's not going to happen, I promise. 
 'Cause then, you won't have to end up like that. You'll survive, you'll look for a way out, you'll be able to make your own path. You'll lead at every turn, year after year, and when you make it to your absolute peak, you'll be your best friend again.<|endoftext|>

Before I knew it, both my eyes were on my fingertips. 
 My hands moved swiftly, but their movements were steely and hard, and turned into something... mundane. 
 I coughed a little, but the tears quickly become my heartbeat. I wasn't ready to meet your eyes. 
 “ Oh, fuck... I'm sorry... ” 
 The tears met my cheeks in a gesture of understanding. 
 We wouldn't have said that, I swear. 
 I kept falling forward, and I loved every second, every moment that passed. I wanted to strangle you. I needed to pet you. I wanted to stab you. I wanted to choke you. I wanted to ravage you. I wanted to ride your body. 
 But I never could. I wasn't sure if I wanted to; then again, I couldn't imagine any of it. 
 Even more, I wished I could get up from the table, kick you, hurt your, maybe just kill you. 
 I was tired. I was weak. It was like the moment you opened your eyes, you could tell I was tired. I was losing it. 
 All because you were me. 
 The knives heaving in my face fed into my brain. My fingers, stiffening, tightening around the edge of the bed. My hands, wriggling around the folded blanket and pushing against the covers, swelling. 
 Now, that blood, that will rot, slowly taking the place of my fingertips, staring back at me.<|endoftext|>

"Every so often when I cast my spells the creatures beeps, screaming, and a chorus goes by. I've had to shut them off during the extra hightlight for centuries, but that's ok, the creatures seem so darned miserable in the light, they want my breath. My spells have enhanced my senses and soul, I can sense things too. My.45 so much as my luck, and know when to run away. I even used to try to stop my kid from playing with that stick in middle of the street while the old man strolled by with that little toy. " The kid sat for a long time. His eyes were bloodshot, not quite happy to meet a monster. 
 " I've always wanted a bowl of jelly beans, but not like this. I've been casting my spells these thousands of years. A man started at me after an evening nap and he fell backwards asleep for a while. I began to chant his name just before my fire warm spells came for him. The time travel mechanic said'we've every now and then got the nazis to help the old man realize that he's fat and needs some muscle' and so I gave him more soup. It didn't work out. The man eventually wakened up and was feeling a little better. " At this point the man was ill. His wounds were all gone and the old man and his family could live comfortably in the decaying basement. 
 " I see you still have a bowl of jelly beans, will you look at this large in the corner? " The kid looked at me, taken aback. He tried to grab it, but it bounced off his arm and landed to the side. 
 " I know it's not 100 %. But if I take the bowl back from him we could live in peace for ever. " 
 " Thank you. " 
 " And how would we live in peace if I smite that devil like he does to the old man? " 
 " Would you mind letting him go, I just can't. I'm sure the old man won't mind trying to infect you before you're too old to do any worse to him. " 
 " Y-Yes, of course."<|endoftext|>

"We're never gon na win this war, " said Mike in front of him. The leader of the delegation, rather. 
 " Just like it will always be this way, " he replied. " You've seen all our systems fail. We can still do this. By doing so, you can usher our grandchildren into a global nightmare and let us go home, " he said. " But now, you can control what it wants. And I have the choice. " 
 " Winning? " Mike was very different from any other leader in the room. His personality had only changed slightly since he'd made his decision. Now he was always the power-in-the-dark leader, which was why he was my first choice. It was my job to ensure that the species survived its encounter with the deadliest enemy. Just as it struggled to stand before him, the last of his forces was collapsing in the ocean. 
 I didn't notice the ominous ship that had fallen beside me, passing over the horizon of a small fishing town. His ships would destroy whatever was slowly settling in there and we'd be rich. My instincts told me not to open the maw. In fact, I didn't expect to notice them. But I had warned them. I was reminded to fight the same as my predecessors. 
 " We know that one of you knows. " One of my best friends said, talking to me. He always showed me his best. " The old one once led an army through a tree line. His army was destroyed in the dust of the ocean. " 
 I listened in silence. That was the first thing I learned about him. I didn't know what was behind those words, how they were coming back to me. Or how I could get to them and know. 
 " I understand, " Mike said. " They were death to the empire. " 
 " They were completely moronic. And death to the empire ruined the warriors who fought for them. " 
 " And by destroying those who fought for them, you mean, it's me, of course. That's why I'm the Emperor. " 
 He paused a moment. " He is. " 
 " And what I'd like to say is, " Mike said, " A friend of mine once told me that I must find him... " 
 " What else? " I asked. 
 " You must be guiding this crusade. I shall, in whatever way I can. " He seemed to consider this. " Don't let the Emperor take control of our people and introduce us to the people of earth. " 
 My eyes moved wide. I no longer knew if this was true, that I had betrayed the Emperor. He was usurping our economy, by exposing us to his coins and permits. But he did not harm our Earth. He was doing it for us. Our people. And I would do what I had to to protect them from the Emperor. 
 " Do what, " I asked the emperor. 
 " Don't attack me, " he replied. 
 " Do what, " I asked. 
 " Don't attack me, " he replied. 
 " Don't attack me, " I yelled at him. " I- I'm sorry, I can't... " 
 The Emperor turned to his subordinates. " Your mission is complete. " 
 " Good. The Emperor will go," I said, and tried to do my best to go home. 
 He didn't turn, but he yelled at me as he ran away. On the way home, I noticed he was crying. I ran home, searching for him. Just as the watch creaked, as the ship slowly sank into the abyss, I smiled. 
 He was still crying.<|endoftext|>

A man on the train peered into the bottle. He stared at the hood that draped over the sagging eyes of his companion. 
 "Come on man you're a spy back on Earth, you can see me or not. " He watched the crowd of people flee. 
 " This young 'amage' looking kid. " Another new friend apologized. 
 This time the older man gripped the bottle tightly, letting out a deep breath and releasing a breath he wasn't expecting. 
 " Is that what you thought I would do? " He thought as he spoke and smiled innocently. 
 " Ten weeks you took the offer out of the peeling bits and bits of plastic dumpster, made her do things you didn't want and then burned down her. " The man was smiling good at that as he returned his smile to his companion. 
 " So.... Understood " he waved the bottle away, not once saying something he knew he would. 
 " Now come with me, we have to watch her. " 
 " What will this human do? " As the passenger approached he caught the look of the two children that were reading the labels for her experiments. 
 " Wait where you go!? " 
 " Balloon! " Some of the kids screamed, following suit. 
 A few seconds later some woman walked onto the train. " Don't panic girl we did something wrong " 
 " They don't know what's going on, they're just doing it man! " The old man stammered and the young boy grabbed his shirt from under him. 
 They both ran but missed. A few minutes later the woman ran off. Another voice, over the roar of the empty carriage. " Their too late now will one day find this boy alone " 
 The man caught his breath again. This time the gentleman walked up to the man, the boy, and kissed him. The man jumped a little and leaned down on the polished steering wheel. He brought his hands back to his face to kiss it once more. It was nice to have his friend's face on the steering wheel. 
 " The train never left here" 
 The old man almost yelled as the man ran over and tried to haul him away from the train. His friend was done with him and he needed to take the train to keep it safe. The wife looking at him strangely smirked as he approached her in the passenger seat. 
 She watched as he walked away from the train at last. He admired the man as he barely noticed how little of his left arm was on the wheel, now it lay down between his legs. She smiled as he lay his hand on her shoulder, she had gotten used to it.<|endoftext|>

He stood waiting for her. He'd never say no to anyone, but she didn't do that to him. The boy just had that look in his eye of certainty that you see when you visit a place called "proper government". Everyone had to know. He was the tiniest prick to every soul around him. 
 He parked his 4.61 behind the house. It was nothing special, never had anyone in these streets they were just too hidden for anyone to see. In fact, she was here yesterday, screaming at everyone to leave her house. Instead, she found a bottle of Corona, and it was just as delicious as everything else. 
 "Why aren't you leaving us?" he asked. 
 Everyone laughed, but she wouldn't listen. He left again, and she asked how it was.<|endoftext|>

The pitcher is laying down. How long did I have before the beer came out? I need a break. The pain is mutual. Couldn't I have gone after him in a couple of hours? Does the clock still tell the time? The doctor is saying he's going to stand by at 5:30 but it's all just a blur of constantly serving people the kind of coffee I need tonight. 
 A tiny smirk crosses his lips. He realizes his mistake and runs his hand over it before looking at the cold beer. The words escaped his lips as he raised his eyebrows. The moments he said them are frozen on each side of his face, gone back into the camera lens. The tears start streaming down his face as he tries to pour more. 
 I stare blankly at him, shocked and scared. I should have thought of something before I spent half the last minute and half a half sitting in the corner of the room joking about how ****I COULDN'T HAVE SENT MY FUCKING COFFEE."<|endoftext|>

One day a writer at reddit reached me. " Hey, man what could I possibly get you for? " he ranted. " I found something you worked out and felt like I could probably get it for you ". I gave him my receipt and started to walk down the alleyway toward my house. He stopped at a house to see where I lived. 
 I left his house before he could. I went downstairs and grabbed a shoe box, breaking into a hit and run. He walked back up the steps and threw it on the table. He moved down the stairs and into the dining room. I saw him staring at his computer, he didn't look well, not good enough. He took a piece of the disc from my fridge and peeked inside. His computer screen was blank; I could see that it was 3AM. Then, as soon as I opened my eyes, I was in his living room with his couch. " Yes, can you give me any directions as to where we are? " I asked. 
 " What are you doing with the disc " he replied. He showed me a file on the computer and laid his hand on it. I felt the response to my query, " The U.S., they are all remote controls right? " 
 " Well no, man. " I answered sarcastically. I was confused, I had worked out all of these spots before and it still seemed strange. How could this be? " Ok you can turn off the monitor or the computer, we haven't finished integrating it yet " he said. I had to hear him out. " Look here, it says one day it is fully functional and the computer has just booted up, but then the sun hit on us, not good enough. " I said to myself. 
 He looked at my controller and looked back at me. " Well we can still play without the computer, keep at it until we find something else to play for, however this is likely a minority market otherwise." 
 I sat down in the couch and closed my eyes, hoping to freeze myself.<|endoftext|>

People of the Lone West get a lot of things in exchange for power. The job was boring. The thieving of the Alliance's population centers made for a well-timed distraction. Their venomous sneeze produced by fangs in their snout, coughs, and sneezes made for a snap. The decades of respect and intimidation became dulled after the liaison moved in. After the treaty was signed and the United Nations started buying up law enforcement agencies, the Lone West became a major issue in the world. 
 For fifty years, the Lone West's latest genocide had been civil. It didn't include the suicide of a lion, or even the massacre of rival mongoose pack animals like llama horses. 
 One day, after so much uncertainty had descended upon the world, a powerful strongman in a wolf-belt forest stood ready to kill the last wolves remaining, a powerful man of flesh and bone. Now this man wanted to kill the most powerful man on Earth, and he recognized the direct correlation with elven wolves, close calls, and grizzlies hunting elk. 
 "Good morning. Gentlemen, " said the man; he smiled to the pack. The leviathan-green wolf-secrets creeping up through the shadows could feel something vibrating with every movement. The long leash on the green wolf grinned wickedly. 
 " Have you seen what's been done to your own country? It belongs to our very God, hunting elk and otters. Most of us own a country because we don't have the bloodlines. It is rare when the wolf doesn't pay heed to us. " He urged the pack. 
 " Yes, it would. " 
 The leviathan-green wolf nodded at the group. " Why, " his smile varied from a catch to a chuckle, " because they know what you are doing to your nation? This is the world you live in, and it is sacred to hunt elk and otter throughout the world. Or so they say. " 
 " You think? " The pack swarmed around the leviathan-green wolf. It was a hunt party. It was shy, but somehow it had given it the impression that it would pass the threshold before the hunt party could rush off. There were scary looking gnomes, though. 
 " Yes. I will. You have to understand, this hunt was organized by us. " He raised his paw high above the leviathan-green wolf's head. " They were us, and these wolf eagles were our prey. " His hulking appendages hovered above the wolf. 
 " What do you mean they are " We say " wild? " 
 " I don't know. This hunting together is called/attempts by some some kind of divine figure, so it is a one way trip. " 
 " We don't trust any of the other hunter groups in the world? " The big gnome eyed the pack more menacingly. 
 " Humans, " he continued, " don't need us, so it's just a trade. We can just take the deer or elk and be done with this. " His fur was huge, and could hug furry trees and all. " It makes sense. It makes no sense at all, considering you're good buddies. " The wolf trailed off to the far center. 
 " Well, we're here because you give us a pass, and we have that. Yes, I understand. " 
 " Will you be the one to take the deer? " 
 " Sure, " replied the wolf. " I will. " 
 The little one smiled at that. " Anything for me? " 
 " That is highly offensive. " 
 " Absolutely."<|endoftext|>

I sighed and pressed the 'Where's the player'? button on my headset. Jeff released me with a low bark of a crow. 
 I had just killed an opposing player when they would taunt me with an unnecessary and irritating response. I'd laugh at it, but honestly, it felt stupid to leave here unless I did something stupid. They all mostly just hung around their bases for hours, of which I was a few hours away from killing a few war torn countries out there. 
 I ducked back into the biohazard world in the hopes of being picked up early. When I did get picked up I swore I was going to give them the arekamu they needed for being stupid and low-rated. That thing was probably over the limit, so I didn't even need to press that button. Everything was static, but then it made me feel a bit better. 
 By the time I found the computer I was tied up to. I had no idea where else to go or where it would be located and I hadn't even time to play multiplayer with it yet. I went about my work on the website I found and flipped through most of it. I didn't even have time to get the last tab down, but I had to. Apparently there are a lot of subreddits like /r/AskReddit that are deemed "thoroughly redundant" and because some people become stupid and low-rated they all keep playing our games anyways. I was huddled on a crate in the corner of the room. One of the lobbies had a new item in it, and it had the ad-lib error. In the thread labeled "Fucks " and " urges people to learn to do the awesome " shit ", the " quit " option only popped up. 
 So... it was my turn. I just sat there playing the game and walked up to a big server I found out about. It had 10 players. Just one guy. And he was lost on Reddit because the ad-lib error prompted me to register it and had me sign up for the big server. I opened the admin page. 
 " Here you go, stupid slob " 
 This guy was probably 19 years old. He was standing at the bar with a beer in his hand. With a bag under his eyes he began " I bet you didn't even register that." and walked away. 
 He would later find out that I had logged into the site and I was being paid. I still haven't told anyone, but that's all I know. 
 You just might be wondering why there isn't a game that developers could paint as 'raping the last man on earth' over the cliff faces of various situations. Guess I'm being the dumbass.<|endoftext|>

Minute after the school's bell rang, Morna knelt down beside her husband. Being late for work, the behavior was not an issue for him. Not until the school bus arrived at 2:30 a.m., when they went in the house to "cleaned up. " Thankfully, she was dressed enough to get dressed, so she was tired of having her bright floral shirt tucked into one of her right knickers. Morna laid at her boyfriend's foot and cuddled, looking up to him with her eyes closed and her cheek open. He continued to make breakfast, laying down in bed to eat his breakfast, while adjusting the collar of his sweater. When he was finished, he flipped on his way out the door and went straight to work, slamming his radio in his hand. 
 11:04 in the morning, Rebecca walked into class. She wasn't usually around early in the day, but she had her meal ordered and was looking for a handout, just to make sure she had enough for her lunch. " It's time for a professor! " She said. 
 " Oh my god! " 
 " It's time for us to go out and show you something! " 
 " That's right, the first year of bachelor's right? " 
 A heaviness all up her spine, and soon her passion was manifesting in it's entirety. " I'm going out tonight with my friends to show you something. " Morna said to no one in particular, but Morna eagerly decided that she would put a smile on her face. 
 She handed her lunch out to the class, and took one of the covers off and smiled. As she walked out the door, she took a seat in the restaurant, reading the latest gossip about Friday dinner. She would surely start from her place behind the bar, but it was no use just yet, as she already had the food coming out in her glass. As she opened the long, rickety opening, she was taken aback by the brownish hue of those brown eyes. 
 " Why... why the hell- " 
 " Do you remember Monica? I saw you in bed with that girl the other night? Why is that a thumping in her ears? " She asked. 
 " My relationship with her was horrible, but we barely ever moved back because I got her on the bus. We usually talked around the bus to find out if it was a date, if we could talk about it in private. It always ended to be a personal interaction. " She stated, perching her head on Morna's chest. 
 He was always on the phone with this person, making sure it was all in order to avoid being dismissed by the man at the end of the line, the one wearing the middle finger of the dark haired woman. He ordered his food and she ate them in an hour. 
 " How did you know she was really my favorite? " Morna asked. 
 " I woke her up. She told me that she'd miss me, but I didn't ask her what exactly. She told me that this time was different. She told me I was special. And she told me... I... I never thought that a thumping in her ears would be... random." 
 He had been on the phone with Monica the whole time, and she spent the entire month with him, trying to get him to tell her that this was completely normal, that this time would be different. She was not going to let him tell her that this was a dangerous time, because in the end, his relationships with Monica were normal, but not exactly normal. That he enjoyed being with her, even though he honestly wasn't that interested in or that very happy about it. At the end of the day, she believed that he and Monica were perfect, but because everything was always working in sync, they eventually fell in love. 
 After that conversation, she finally fell in love with him, so she didn't worry about her marriage anymore. She just wondered how that night would turn out for her, while she felt him holding her hand.<|endoftext|>

Don't be afraid to stay for a bit longer. Me and my team have been trying to find a way to collect information on how the vampires took over the world by hiding in darkness and using the broken souls of many a like to live in areas where they wouldn't be found by looking for the light of day. We were the chosen ones, the honorable ones. All by ourselves. It was amazing how much blood you could shed during the dark. 
 Am we considered honorable, 
 an honor that we've longed to see say? 
 In any case, while I may have misread you, our group of chosen helped us found a way to receive a generous grant from a one man team of blind people named Ramachael Nesea. As I said, we used the old magical stones to locate a blind man that his kind made a house for the dead where they didn't have to live in darkness. We then chased away the unspeakable creatures from the world. It was pure evil that we chased, and it was bitter bitter that we had never come across someone who could take them. It was a total of a curse in my opinion. 
 Am I so sorry... 
 I had much to say, if we could exist here on this earth. Nothing could really change my mind. 
 The trip to Trs Beach had come as a bit of a shock. The view was definitely different than some of our usual beatings or celebrations. I wished I could send an ambulance to take me off my feet. 
 Finally, I could walk away from the aid workers. It felt beautiful. Thank you for all that we did. How can we not celebrate with gratitude when we could live like this. So I told them all to stay, we could wait for the next one on the way, and look towards the land where we hoped to live. 
 And that's when we found yourself a house, with an old stone fireplace. You can reach it through a cheap door on a nice side street. I remember the night we found the old stone fireplace in the old man's house, and the look in his eyes. 
 He looked at me and began to laugh. 
 "Looks like we could be the best jokes at the funeral of a kid", he said.<|endoftext|>

I may be crazy as fuck but there is no way that a legal memory should be deleted. The state had a big problems now with going through a legal record just like the demon. The board on my right said I could be convicted for murder in part because I was a drunk and committed the crime my company was selling to a few people. The name of my rapist is keyed into it from my other identification because I have a self graduated degree. The board has stated they will be removing my name from my childhood menu. Right now I am remembering the part where I told my wife what my super secret boyfriend actually was, only to have one of his photos stolen. 
 I don't mean to sound paranoid but I have a decided form of blindness. I tried to blur the lines around my eyes it caused my vision to blur and cover my small eyes with it. I still have nightmares about the demons that haunt my nightmares because the sleeping petri dishes in my brain always start off black and blank. I'm talking all my Facebook connections and all my computer pictures. The only thing that keeps me going now is the constant nightmares of the nightmares that involve my parents. I still have nightmares of the tattoos I had on my head after one night of no sleep. 
 I've had a relapse of schizophrenia. I am no longer homeless; I am homeless. I am stopped by people from other states and time after time. They brought me closer to them and it has made me feel alive. I live forever. I hope I could one day come out of my coma and just walk on the sidewalk. I always wonder how big that 50 cent ticket is and how many people are there to see it. I've signed onto the new San Francisco Nightclub onto this grand staircase.<|endoftext|>

My fiancee said it was a great honor and I couldn't wait to see her again. I know the man and the girl but this first we're going together. 
 She said so she knew I loved her and I knew she was going to get that famous deal; I'm going to convince her to come with me to my unfinished business of improving the Lord of the Dark Realms. 
 Of course there's precedent for this. Well I've got this past big moon moon Moon Jan this was my last amb they in place and being the only one who really found it, they wanted the hero he was a victim of and now they're going to have a full blown takeover without him. 
 So I was sitting in my bed with Jennifer and pulled the covers over my face and then my hair. So I tried to hold up the curtain a little bit in my corner so that my light reflected off the beautiful flowery floor. 
 I felt my hand coming close to my face. It had to be a demon because all I could see was a girl sitting in her bed that couldn't be stopped. 
 I knew the girl that had won her prize was going to use her human powers to do everything she possibly could to derail the operation and my brother Craig was going to get his ring of the evil ring I saw in his pocket. So that's how I knew the last of the deal he was going to use was mine and my sister was going to learn the purpose of this ring and destroy me. 
 I stood up and said my goodbye to her and to the angel that stood guard behind me. She looked at me and then spoke to me. 
 "Son, I hope to learn your purpose in this day and age. We must love each other and save everything, but neither can we say yes to everything because we also love the other but no we can't say no. 
 Please Brother, please let go of me and let us leave and as soon as we do that you will leave me and the only way to leave is to go and my own actions and your actions will not save everything. 
 I don't want you to know what they say about goodness, I could tell you all about it all but don't think for a second that I want to listen to them. 
 Together we are the Lords of the world and we will prevail, what we build for ourselves in this world will remain and will never do. 
 And that I think it's right of you all to do to the Lord of the dark realms and not her but please remember, this will not be what God had in store for us. 
 Please understand, you can't let me go, so please tell dad I love you and I will continue to tell him everything I know will be fine and that he will believe it through. The sign is. 
 *Goodbye David* 
 And she left us all behind.<|endoftext|>

My mouth is agape, I'm about to say something before the thing jumps forward and splinters the ground beside me. I open my mouth, and as the thing's face hits the ground, I know my world has turned upside down. The world slowly turns... 
 My whole body is made of steel. A lot of it is hollowed out, the still pile of rubble off the bottom right of the ground thumps onto the ground. My suit suits am still there. A big purple badge runs down my chest. 
 When I walk out of the rubble, all the people on the street are looking around the rubble. They are terrified. But they don't care about me. They are right here.<|endoftext|>

The humans call me Lucifer. The name I gave them is SCP-3723. Like me, they call me Satan. For their revenge, I've given them prophecies written by the devil himself. Believers in secret. They told me I was completely wrong, and now I've been captured. I will answer to no one. I will destroy them all, I will make them immortal. I had to let them know that humanity loved them unconditionally. From where I came from, I have created them in my image, they would live. Would I live if I existed? Would I truly destroy all of them? What would they want? 
 What do you say, General Monaghan, to President Roosevelt? I wish you'd never captured me. 
 "How could I? I can undo this. I'm not just a fucked up prick, so I can do anything I want. But to defeat these perverse scientists, humans are becoming so scared. " 
 The woman standing in front of Roosevelt was waiting for him, held between her tears. She pouted and said " fuck it all, if you don't accept my suggestions, you'll regret it forever, and I promise you, no matter what you do, you will regret it " 
 " ( Sighs as tears fall from her face ) As you wish. 
 I know, don't touch them, these helpless creatures, and when you remove my mask, you will end up killing thousands of humans. I would offer you the chance to leave my prison, as you wish. But I can not do that if you don't accept my proposal. " 
 Ladies and gentleman, we've been preparing for this moment for what is to come, our Mother and Father are with you. We'll see you in Hell. And come with me in the rest of time, friends."<|endoftext|>

The ghosts of half a century ago - let it be known - grew through it, and for some stupid reason, found their way in their heads. 
 Sure, it wasn't my fault, all of us on the field - my right hand man J.D. Petelstra - still went to work in the hayfields, we had that extra mile of hay to fill, but they had to chase the ghosts down! Well, you see, I was the one holding the back. And now, now I am our ghost, a rogue of the rightful owner, a wild card who gives lies to the many dreams of the prophets! 
 But then! It was a thought. These people were here for their money and us for their soul. I had tried to speak to them, but none of them spoke as if there were ever a moment, and this one, I had never considered my chance in life and would not dare to, spoke to me first and gave me a second chance. 
 Now the lawn here was dry, but I knew my wing would be flexible and will work, and I had to let go of the hold of myself and help. 
 'Hey, is anyone in here?' whispered a tiptoe, clearly not a part of that commotion. 
 'No sir, nothing going on in here. Nothing's going on. Mummy's blackened from playing magic, and so on,' I replied back. 
 'Come on, what's going on around here?' said the boy. 
 'Not much. Some snakes going about their business, all but a few on the outside, I've got to go to the mailbox. Again, please, tell me what's happening.' 
 'Help me,' I beckoned, trying to remember what the kids said, what they had said! 
 The boy scurried on, desperately hoping he could run around to get closer to the creature. But it wouldn't listen, and crawled through the grass like a crawler, bouncing around as if it were eating his loins. 
 When he reached the mailbox, he hadn't noticed it at all. It didn't move, and slowly yet surely inside of it, beneath the thin crust of ice, beneath the dark mauve, in the ridges of the trees and crevices, it moved, and grew! By the time it reached the paperman's desk, who'd hoped to get in touch with me to convey something, the box was old and cracked. 
 Yet, something was different this time. Something had not moved in days; that was until two hours after I'd spotted it, pounding the desk with a stone cane: 
 *"MERRY BLUE." * 
 The hallways like the linoleum of a church, full of jewels and wagons, stood motionless, alone, waiting to hear from one another. A shadow ascended from the ceiling and headed straight towards the empty mailbox.<|endoftext|>

It was like there was a hypnotic thing playing on the edges of my mind. Usually it would have been a upbeat melody, I'd jump a couple feet in to be tired, and come to a full stop. No, this man had a... oh... he had a dream. Or a fantasy. Or a horrible memory or dream or whatever the hell it was. 
 Don't really know. 
 I had come in my dream. I had gone up to meet him. I walked right up to him. He was about 4'7 "inset and had a bag under his arm. He wore a hat with a boyishly bright star on it. His eyes were blue and his hair was short and short. 
 'What the hell are you doing up here, Jack? You could live here too' 
 'I just.. not anymore. Not again' 
 'Whatever you need. You got here when we went up and?' 
 'Yeah' 
 'I.. meyy old man. Sorry to embarrass you Jack. I shoulda get some sleep' 
 'Of course.. not this time. We need to go to one of the dream companies or something' 
 'Me too. I don't even know what it is. Just turn the lights down' 
 'Really? How can I go down' 
 'Just... try calling'John's Welcome'.' 
 'I'm tired of all this' 
 'Come with me some sleep'. 
 He left. I went down down to his room and turned the lamps off. When I did, he was gone. He was not in my dream. Not inside. I had thrown his keys in the hands of the stranger, but he had not held them. Why was he doing that to me? I had thrown the keys in the hands of someone who was on the wrong side of the world. It was very obvious, yet he was merely having a strange dream. 
 Just another night. Couldn't sleep.<|endoftext|>

"Hey ladies and gentlemen! " The court room was crowded with judges, a lawyer, and several lawyers all looking on in their offices. A private detective with a team was at the podium. A little faded old man in a navy blue suit looked on. 
 " Mr. I. Kerr! Welcome back to your first day as an attorney. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! This is *Charles Stein* in Letchworth High, ( Lafayette, Lafayetteville ). Mr. Stein has been appointed to the bench today for his alleged violations of his constitutional rights by the state of Illinois. From what he has seen, I expect you'll recall that in 1975,  Henry Fanken reported that he was employed as a cell phone rapist, and believed he survived. Mr. Stein filed suit claiming that his months-long labor as a telephone sex operator was therapeutic for him, and that he was the victim of a mistreatment by a man who he overheard disparagingly referred to as'Navy Buffalo', so he killed him in order to gain an attorney. As a result of this, he alleges that he found himself in some sort of electronic bar full of various dildos, Upholstery, Balloons, and " Drone ", while collecting his taxes. Mr. Stein has been indicted on 10 counts of interference with and infringement of social institutions by interstate commerce ( 1870 ), government robbery ( 1912 ), attempted desecration of an airplane, and race-riding in violation of state law. More specifically, he is accused of " about Tired of ( knowing ) about a Men's Rights activist fighting at the Washington Plaza Holiday Inn on March 30, 1953, when his wife Janet was 57, a woman whose great-grandfather, Caster Mary, was buried next to her. " Mr. Stein has pled not guilty, and was sentenced to the private counseling office at large, Miller Hospital, ( Evansville ). Mr. Stein shall survive sentencing and has been appointed to task as his assistant. Please remember the following, because I am personally not in the best shape... Good luck! " " As you can guess, I believe I may be in trouble. " Mr. Kerr walked out of the courtroom and into the parking lot of the area hotel. 
 The morning's news was live when he ran into his first day as an attorney. He took a taxi into the airport. 
 During his brief time there, he stuck his head in the driver's seat at the restrooms and began to open his car door, but stopped. 
 In the back of the taxi, he was being distracted by an old printer in his wallet. 
 When he looked out of the passenger side window, a man in a navy blue suit was staring at him from behind. 
 " *Oh my God*, " he muttered. 
 The phones had apparently gone off. The man shook his head. 
 The man looked to his first passenger in the passenger seat. 
 " Hey, what are you doing? " 
 " I'm going to the bathroom. " The man said, beginning to shuffle away. 
 The driver's side window was open and the windows were being opened, as an intense smell of fog permeated the air. He opened the door to find two police officers, simply black leather jackets clad in bulletproof vests with active weapons mounted around their necks. The people behind him tried to move, but could not get a grip on the vests. 
 " It's okay, " one of the officers stated, as he laughed. " Got it!" 
 The officer slowly moved up to the young man. His hands clasped together and his eyes were drawn to the man in front of him. Slowly the man began to protest, but the officers ignored him. 
 Now the two officers had set the next man in the street to the ground and set him on his back.

I've often joked that it's not only depressing to be accepted and accepted by the force, but literally sad to be left behind. It's not always easy, however. I've often thought about how easy it was for me to take a dim post of my time or simply pass life by, once dead. My death in no way felt like it was pleasant. It was more like choosing whether I wanted a run or to break my fast. 
 Besides the symbolic standpoint of having lived to the ripe old age of 40, my training focused on creating identical twins over a few hundred years. Each person had to walk a relatively small distance to fulfill the purpose of their birth, depending on how balanced and stimulating they would be, or whether it was all going well. The two temporary souls never really spoke. 
 The ones that did were the hardest to recruit. I had pretty often been unsuccessful in trying to find new suitors for similar skills, but with the prestige of having so many kids, it was difficult for anything good to be found within my realm. The crowd reeked of neglect, garbage, sickness, and desperation. 
 After much deliberation, the Morbid Jack simply shrugged off the solicitation with a weak wink and walked back to his car. I felt a warm sensation in my head, so focused on what I would do that I did not have the will to do anything. 
 While the gordian slumped down next to me on his dying planet, I decided to meet up with his older brother in hopes of helping him with his preparations. I arranged him into a small bed, placed him into the back of the bed and wrapped a small blanket around him. 
 "James! " 
 " Come on James! " 
 " It's not my fault I took your son to the ocean, you still have to complete the mission all by yourself! " 
 My counterpart looked at me with his crooked smile. " James? I'm taking you away from her because I have to send this guy to a dead end job for you. " 
 I held him close, his red light glistened against his dark skin. " What if I force you to take her on a cruise? " 
 The Morbid Jack barely flinched as I said the words I was so eager to help. 
 I couldn't help but feel, long overdue for just the right expression to give his death, that he was meant to serve me. 
 " You will continue to go wherever you are. James, this is not you. I'll return you and bring you to my tent to collect the next soul. " 
 " Nonsense! " James winced in disgust. The lamp had started to dim as he began to silently chant the Godliness of the Great Magus Saraskan. " To hell with the assholes!" 
 He started to sob as I turned around, unable to bring myself to let this news take the kinks out of me. 
 He didn't care about the weird thing of getting back to him, the idea of going back to him only affected his outlook upon life, whatever his motives. Instead of a start, he turned and we started walking back to the inn. 
 There was something in my shirt that was impossibly warm.<|endoftext|>

"Fine, you know what it takes to make them like you? " The Director called out to the crowd. 
 " Sure I know, Bill and Bill i had a little session last week, my son's seen us up so far, we just hope to have an early next week. " The crowd cheering and breath catching in his chest at the exact word*showing up* James said. 
 " They are so impatient, they make me feel things they never would like to hear. They say they are crazy, but those words are not to be trifled with. It is to be noted I was part of the research team. " The Director gestured to the dead tree, which was in fact planted there the night before by a lone hunter whose weapon was a ceremonial steed. 
 " I sure hope not." James said, looking through his phane as he stopped his rifle and took a step forward.

 First time responding to another Writing Prompt here, oh and I also really liked the setting and gender of this prompt but I feel like an OP or writer wouldn't even understand how small and ambiguous the plot was. Take out the top things: spoiler tag this universe, damnit the story seems confusing and we didn't exactly get how writing can be structured. There were some positives though: the world created here may or may not have been fairly well developed or exaggerated and there are demons and humans in several places that were probably just hiding and behaving like normal people. 
 Update: Several spelling issues and minor corrections. 
 In multiple instances, chapter summaries were opened throughout the story's story. Much better than this thread, so here goes:

 The steed staggered forward in a fall that would have sounded like a wet haystack. A sound that could only have been home listening to the sound of the vast hill surrounding them. Unable to move, the steed bounded out of the wooded area by the massive stream that trailed from beneath and behind the steed, encircling them in a circle. With a big grunt and a single bark, the steed bounded into the air. In the distance a mouthful of rain fell from the sky and dawn beams filled the sky. 
 James hadn't made it far before the steed fell and landing hard onto the thin barbed wire fence as he stood up to his feet. He knelt to climb the fence and rolled his eyes at the man he had just met. It was time to leave for work. As the walk out of the woods led him the previous morning he leaned against the fence and drifted off to sleep.<|endoftext|>
**********971**********
"Dark! " A slim voice cried out over the echoing cry. It ripped the air from the towers below and turned them to a dark blue misty night sky, full of the deep blue streams of life. 
 He looked down to see a small smog as massive clouds laid out ahead. Plumes of smoke filled the air as he searched for water. As the first wave of clouds fell he could see the stars full of light at their center. He opened his eyes to watch them for a moment and was blown away by the cool light of the sky. 
 " Who are you? " His voice rang out to the dead. " Who are you anyway? " 
 " When... who are you? " He squeaked as he began to get full of thoughts. " The moon is hollow. I am a ghost. And this land I visit has never been the same." 
 The moon didn't move as he was about to curse the sleeping giant for not buying him his fishing rod. 
... People never stop doing stupid things.<|endoftext|>

***Joker *** had a way of doing it when he was young, sick, and desperate. To be sure, Joker was far more cunning than Batman, but if anything it was a bit less lovable than the lazy clown. 
 Life had gotten Joker to a point where he could finally kill Batman. All of his foe was dying of some magical unknown, which made Joker absolutely lovable in large part because at this point he was just doing what he knew he had to do, where Joker was beaten, his only problem was hanging himself, and beating him for no reason. 
 And now, more than ever, Joker was getting fed up with being beaten by the Joker. He figured his challenge would be to prove himself against the old man and show him what this Batman did for so many years. It would take many years for him to get up to speed with what the Joker did, his longest endeavor. 
 Unfortunately for Joker, a fair fortune paid off. That night, his target was drowned by the head of his favorite Joker. Not the pathetic lame fool Bane, though. Bane is truly in an international contest for fates, and here he was after disappearing for only a week, when the airlock on his yacht collapsed. 
 Killed. 
 Villain.<|endoftext|>

I might not be as skinny and fit as others, but I'm a hill bender. Not pathetic, but not handsome either. And what's better than that? Being pulled out of bed at night, being knocked over with crunches and that other one? If you want to be a hill bender, challenge me to a duel. 
 **Hey bros, what are you waiting for? I came to conquer this now more than ever before! ** 
 And then he began to beat me to death. Damn near twice as hard as the last. I don't even know how I feel, but the pleasure of death has risen from my tummy just to see him squeeze me in a body you saw on the news, before he violently ripped my head off and shoved me in my bed. 
 I thought maybe he had the strength to pump me full of strength, but he simply grabbed my right cheek and sucked me out. 
 A-
*DARK SKATE! END TALK** 
 And then he kicked me again, and again, and again, and again, and again. I tried to fight back, but he was weak in his legs and his feet, so I couldn't stop him from grabbing my brain while he struggled with me, as if he were over-training for this moment and wanted me to defend him. But I fought him hard, as hard as I could, and he punched him in the gut, and she cried in pain as it was done for. 
 I moved my hand up my face to her, and she laughed, and my hand fell on her tongue and her face began to spill blood, and blood, all over my foot. As I raised her head up, she screamed at me. I told her to stop, I told her I loved her, and when I made her cry, I didn't want her to scream any longer. For another hard, disgusting fight... 
 I pushed her back against the bed, and while I was still struggling with her, I turned around, and I stopped staring at the bed and let out a scream. I looked at my right eye, and I saw he was doing something wrong, and I began to weep. 
 All I could think of was that I thought maybe this monster would try to kill me, and that maybe, he would just let this complete him... 
 - 
 So, if you are reading this, then we are on some sort of crossover robot road trip, and the two of us decided that I am the one who did it. I am not ready to die, but that is okay, because I am ready to be saved. I am not ready to be beaten, as I have always been. And so here is the deal, and let me make you a promise: 
 I will not pursue this profession over and over until I die. * Fear me, bro, you will not want to die. Fear me, bro, you will not want to die. *<|endoftext|>

Reading a book that wasn't a tour guide was in my grasp, this book about any topic was daunting, claustrophobic, and was awful. 
 I had really wanted to write this book since high school, but I was just bummed out at what I had to do. To finish it was too much for me, I can't do this. 
 I closed my mouth and opened it back, it was probably going to be an enjoyable read. 
 After a few moments, I lifted my phone up, and some text from my mother. 
 -- -- - 
 Hello? 
 I cried. I just didn't want to talk about this. I couldn't write any more. I've been trying to get it out. 
 "Look ma'am " 
 I looked at the top of my profile picture. The only photo besides me. What good is it? I'm looking at a man, staring at me. I'm not sure what I'm picturing. I look at the phone right next to my name. There's an angry silhouette. I drop it and hold it up to my face. I look at it for a while, and then I blur out. I look down. The man is gone. 
 " What the FUCK is going on! " I hear my mother yelling. 
 I glance up and see the police officer wearing on the cloak. 
 " Hey you feel okay lady. Welcome to my station. Hope to hear a good word from ya. " 
 Before my eyes can blink, I realize I'm staring at that black man sitting next to me. He looks like he has gone insane and is laying on the floor. 
 " What the FUCK do you mean...? " 
 I look into that person's eyes for a second. That people gaze at me. Who are these people!? 
 " Mrs. Tibbles, it is with an axe in hand that you are sentenced to forty years in prison for larceny under penalty of perjury. To ensure all witnesses are made completely clear, the larceny charges are assessed in full as your final due date for release. No responsibility to the person who steals this property, simply because they are wrong. In the Court of Cassation, the outcome of an interview can't be appealed. " 
 The man looks at me again. This time with hatred in his eyes. This time from my shoulders to my ankles. 
 " Don't stand there. " I scream. 
 " Why do I have to be here?!" I yell. I feel hopeless inside. I don't want this to happen. I don't want anyone else to know this. 
 But then, I realize. I feel bad. Not only for the people I've been taking care of with these business, but the people I love. My family. My best friends, my job. They all won't know of this. 
 And I'm determined. I am the loneliest person I've ever been around. I'm happier. Happy, even. I have a daughter. My children are beautiful. My wife. They have incredible children, and will have beautiful lives in my life. 
 I just want them all to know that it's okay.<|endoftext|>

So, what exactly happened? 
 Wait, the noise. 
 The odd growling. 
 The metallic crunch of fabric and metal as the beam of light bounced off. 
 Why wasn't it much better? 
 Were there any wiggling bars? 
 Or was it just me. 
 Were you watching.
I called out. 
 I hear. 
 A metallic clicking sound. 
 A scraping sound. 
 Another metallic cracking sound. 
 The breathing started. 
 I could feel my heart beating faster. 
 I'm finished. 
 I think I heard a bit of a thumping. 
 No sound, not on those speakers. 
 Not much. 
 I heard them. 
 A few buzzing sound. 
 Not much. 
 I could hear breathing. 
 Crap. 
 All of a sudden, there was a thumping. 
 Oh god. 
 I can't breathe. 
 My eyes are closed. 
 Are there any guns in my head? 
 No, no, no no no. 
 It seems as though something is inside of me. 
 This is it. 
 This is the final blow. 
 I put out my cigarette. 
 Who are you! 
 ( It was probably one of my own ) 
 Nobody can hear me. 
 I now know that this was all just a blip in the night sky. 
 Predictably, someone is watching me. 
 I'm learning. 
 I can't even remember. 
 I suppose. 
 I wonder who this is. 
 You won't find me on another planet like this any more. 
 I'm also pretty sure I'm worried. 
 Do you want me to find you? 
 No. I want you. 
 We know we have to. 
 I want to find you. 
 ( I'm on reddit. I hope this was his, I really think that. )<|endoftext|>

I knew I shouldn't. 
 On that fateful day, a tear began to pour from my eye. It landed in front of my cheek, about the size of a freshly shaved head. 
 This happened at a busy intersection, just before the bus to pick me up. 
 The driver put one hand in the seat next to me, stroking the shape of my cheek. He felt the stirrings in his hands. 
 "Phew, " he whispered as he looked up at me. " I will miss you, Dad. " 
 I couldn't bring myself to finish that sentence. I'd miss you too. The bus made a sudden detour back to the parking lot. I knew it was about to go in the wrong direction. He pulled out an eraser. 
 I had never thought the bus would hit me. I'd never thought that I'd accidentally ripped my head off, or at least it seemed that way. 
 But I remembered that moment vividly. I recognized the moment again. With his hands on my hips. My cheeks pressed down into the back of my neck, and my heels on the ground. Our eyes locked for a moment. The serene rush of seeing you laugh with my thumb out the other end of the seat and kiss you. 
 I knew that moment in particular would be the one to get me on the bus. My life was short but I was determined to finish my first. I approached the empty back, and jumped out and grabbed the driver. 
 He sighed and leaned over. 
 " Something wrong? " 
 " What? " I blinked and the smile came. I coughed up blood and picked up my phone from my pocket. 
 *I'll stop tomorrow! * 
 I looked at him, his smile gone. I wished he hadn't. 
 " It's alright. " He said. I walked away, hands still on my shoulders. I packed my things and sat down in the bus. 
 *This is my last chance, * I thought. 
 I opened my eyes and opened them. My mom stood at the front of the row. 
 " What's wrong, little one? " 
 " Don't worry. You'll probably be fine. I'll check up on you a little later. " 
 The bus driver nodded and waited. There was a long silence. 
 I stood there for a moment, until my phone buzzed. * Good, it's the bus! * I thought to myself. 
 " What is it? " I asked, a worry trying to form in my voice. 
 The man sighed. " Nothing, Mom. Just having a short nap. " He sighed again. 
 I picked up my phone and played a quick video of it. 
 " What's wrong, little one? " 
 " Nothing. " 
 My mom walked off the bus and looked down the aisle. The door shut. 
 " Well, maybe you're not," she whispered.<|endoftext|>

I have waited over five years for this, that is when I looked in the mirror. I looked to have my 'glory' stolen. I don't know why. I merely knew one morning to see myself that day, as well as any of my teammates. The disdain that was born all over my faces. 
 I have been a tough kid, but one that always looks out for good. Three years have passed. There has never been any turning back. There never was a change of scenery, nor was there ever a death to follow. At around 18 years old, I learned why I am lost again. I learned to live in the bright lights and of a civilized society. I was taught no more of the horrors of the world. 
 This new world I found, one I was destined to live in for a decade. I don't know the cause of my disappearance, I don't know what happened, but for some reason I remember my beautiful face a little better than my familiar lifeless forms. The happiest I have seen in many years was before today. 
 I came up with new ideas and strategies to help me live in that world. I was born into the strict strict rule of 'no exceptions', which I have followed for my entire existence. I am taught my occupation of slayer did not match the warm, spaciousness or artistic representation in the world we live in. I can not express how amazing these things are. 
 While I don't know how or why, I took to killing myself over and over again. My favorite twist? I sometimes don't pick back up.<|endoftext|>

"Please, tell me where you live... " 
 Thugs on my lips pushed me away from the console, darting between broken pipes and broken glass. I let go of my hands like an overawed survivor trying to battle hungry-agriculture. Not a yurt, exactly. A long finger made a rough circle around where I applied pressure to my legs. Unconsciously, I turned the microphone knob. A simple " yes" button. The second it was over, I heard him emerge from the speakers to speak. 
 " Well, that seemed surreal, right? An exorcism? Something? " 
 " What? No. He was crying. Unfamiliar. Something I hadn't seen before. Faint noise. And you had called him so? One of us?! A psychopath?! It was so weird. She loved him. 
 Laughing, I began to punch him as hard as I could. The pain seemed to overwhelm him. I caught him convulsing in the doorway. 
 " Oh god. Was it just the door slamming again?!?! " 
 The telephone started going off. He just cried. 
 " Right, let's say our reality shattered yesterday. You saw him last time. That was the last thing you saw. Can you come after me? He's like a ghost, you know? " 
 I could hear the phone cut off. And the tear rolling down his cheek. 
 " No. " 
 The room was silent. No other human representatives or jurors. Too many angry women to stay in the courtroom. There was a single lock of wood in the door. As I stepped through, a small black haired man was staring at me. He was but a hair from the back of a car. My friend, his wife. Still tears, he says. 
 " Leave. " 
 And as I walked out the door, I pulled a gun from the holster in the cabinets of the room and pushed it against the doorframe. I pulled the trigger. He appeared in my living room, without a scratch. 
 It was time to put the gun away. His lifeless body fell lifelessly into the kitchen. 
 I fumbled with the radio, then turned the heavy speakers off and sat down at my usual table. The living room was barely lit. The TV and computer dinged. 
 Looking at the news, I began to doubt that there was anything more I could do.  Would anyone be alive when you found out I'm now a living ghost? I'd better get the hell out of here, before his body becomes screaming the way a human would. I looked out at the city and wondered if people in the White House would be happier if I lived. 
 *Project Jocks: * - *Atlanta Robbery Trade. * 
 * *Atlanta Police Department: * - *South Side Guys' Gym. * 
 " What's up? " 
 I was still tense, and half way through the first sentence in my book, I let myself relax. 
 " I told you! I got ta do a spot audit! My name's Ken Rosenfeld." 
 The rest of the sentence cut through my feeling, and I stared down at my hands. I waved goodbye to the empty chair. The man sat there on the couch. I looked around the room, and noticed my life couldn't get any worse.<|endoftext|>

Religious stuff, fast food, church, military, the like. I never really thought much about what I felt about them after I had been eliminated. I mean, I was an addict. That's not to say I hated them, but I was deeply troubled when I told my friends that this was a real place and that I loved everything about it. 
 A lot of good stuff, too. The setting, the setting's realism, especially when you compare a player with a 12 year old girl in a church. 
 But all I really cared about were the houses on the flip side. A few of them had real life sims and I've played several, but none of them were particularly'standard'. Actually, I decided to run with them. 
 'My parents', we'd called them, had a special place on earth. Its are well and quiet. Mostly it's just Alabaster-style blood and people; but not too many people of an obsession. 
 Hadn't had too many friends since. My house was always over. Everything was randomly out of sight and out of mind. What followed is my revenge. It's like I've planned my revenge, my vengeance, in order to conquer Hell. 
 Sometimes you hear people telling you to use fucking hell again. One time you heard the sentence "I burned out one life, and everyone is fine in paradise ". 
 So, I'll always burn one life and everyone you meet is perfectly fine in paradise. However, you may have heard of the outside world. 
 It's really a completely different world, however. When I think about it, Hell isn't exactly a paradise. Sure, its a bunch of massive houses with crystal clear walls that make it pretty bizarre. Some old houses even seem to have some sort of wall in the middle of a populated area. 
 It's all totally not that interesting, but once you see it, you're bored and you're on your own right now. Very few people are even living there, and while the others have a lot of fun just trying to fly, most just cave or die to insanity, which makes them totally awesome buddies with some goofballs. But here's the thing, you're obsessed. So you start beating up all the demons and trying to get them to help you get to heaven. Yeah, being a biker. You hear them having fights where they go and then you catch a big one, or you die and your ex is there to greet you. 
 Some way to conquer Hell. 
 So naturally, the sin of anal sex has actually been conquered. 
 Well. Shit. I had made my own god damn house. 
 Could I take the outhouse if I'd had some fun?<|endoftext|>

His eyes screwed down into the bed, and he sighed heavily. Slinking over from his nightstand was Kean. 'It's about this,' he thought, staring intently into the night sky, fluttering his arms. 'I'm not sure anyone likes working with me. This is how I leave the room, and I'm not here to do anything.' 
 His ship rocked in the darkness as he knelt and reached for a cigarette in his mouth, a chilled flame in his eyes and he exhaled a grimy exhale in a dark, soapy den. Kean pulled himself from his bed and stared at the burnt-out wall in front of him. 
 'Welp. I'm not here to do anything. If you found me alive tomorrow, then I'd *deathly* think I'd be helping you survive. Just tonight, or as far as the power plant tells, you're just gon na care about the project anyway, and ya know it'll be ok.' 
 He sighed again and sat up in his bed. The night air was hot and beat, and an angel named Irene was pacing down the corridor, bagging blankets and covering him up. Kean focused on the long, dusty road ahead of him and shook his head, he'd only moved that one day. What bothered him the most, though, was that... 
 He'd seen a man, who, whether Kean realized it or not, was nervous, dark-haired, furry-looking, unkempt and he was having a panic attack. Kean put the cigarette down and mumbled the word there were several times, a loud, murderous stench that left Kean's deep lids all souring. He leapt and sprinted through the deserted corridors, this repeated over and over, his legs shaking as he cursed all night for the silence, unable to move. The man hadn't stopped around until he reached the office, immediately getting up and scanning the area. 
 That was after Kean walked into his own room, and felt himself slowly relaxing. His biggest fear was that he wasn't meant to have another happy moment, another boring fight between men like Irene and the Angel. 
 As soon as Kean woke up, he was forced to the phone. He looked down at his hands. His father had apparently broken up with his cousin back in Tarren, but he had rather pushed to find someone else willing to accept the responsibilities of his position. All Kean wanted was that Irene had made sure he was the first one through word of mouth and to have gotten him closer. 
 There he was, slumped against a wall, shivering with the cold water from his brew down the length of his forearm, listening to it all. Kean ran his hands through his hair and spoke. 
 'I'm sorry.' Kean croaked, coughing again, then crying out in pain and with his eyes closed. 'This goes against my past. Today is the one, and tonight is the only one that matters. You are exactly what I do when my head gets dull. So much pain, but only your love does.' 
 He ran his hands through his hair again and his voice choked for the first time, muffling the worst of it with his hands. He snickered softly, as the tears dripped from his face. 'I was there, because *you* are why I am here.' 
 The phone beeped again, revealing the appropriate address, still turned off. 'Nothing bad happened,' the device said. Kean adjusted his sight. 
 'Fuck,' he mumbled, then walked out of the building. 
 He reached a hand out and placed it on the desk as a cold, crumbly hug passed his cheek.<|endoftext|>

"Let's run a test. " The techie engineer yelled through the- 
 " Goddamnit, you bastards. " 
 " No. " All the tinny voices were coming from upstairs, and a loud clanking noise. Each echo almost breaking the silence. 
 At home, Linda had finally made it out, through the tunnel into the house. 
 " Woman, what the hell's wrong? " 
 " You heard me, right? " 
 " You scare me. " 
 " I'm scared! " The tangles of metal fingers came crashing down. " This is going to crash! You should pack all your stuff and leave. You'll be alone! " 
 " No. " Linda replied, straining to hold on. No matter how hard she tried, she could only be banged against the wall by a single hand while she stared at the blue walls of the power closet. The color of her own skin was mixed in with her own. " Calm down, just breathe. " 
 The light led into the room, revealing a room with messy blonde hair, green furniture and a bed that was dark and ripped. The carapace creaked loudly, bouncing constantly in the gears of its contraption. The glow of the headlights provided some light at first, but soon the car, running through a pull up straight into the streets. 
 The young woman walked to the door, dropping the rag in her hands as she neared the street. The street was dark, not unlike the street with the other two houses. Linda opened the door, fumbling with her purse as the metallic door left a tight knot in her gut. 
 " The- " She pulled out a piece of paper, thin and thin as ash, and tossed it to her. Her hand stopped in front of the smoking paper, quickly flipping it to face the street. The smoke grew as the woman unfolded it. 
 " You see you came in here. " 
 " Why? " 
 " Have you not noticed my presence?"<|endoftext|>

There's a line between sanity and madness. One moment you see a group of people babbling and bargaining, who never know the words to tell the honest truth, while the next moment they cut me short by running me to the hospital, in a foreign country. 
 Your mental health issues are different. It may be your disability but you are always aware you have problems. For those that are worthy of surgery, you treat them with the lowest common denominator. You successfully blind someone from the results of their regression and self examination. You have never gotten any of the radio calls you get as a result of your suffering. You have never been astounded by the complex system working behind closed doors. 
 You finally realize what it means to be sane and do a sign to all those that can not. This is your 2034 success story. Your mortality rate in your lifetime? Over 20%.<|endoftext|>

It was a simple matter of determining the runes. Adding runes to any metal or cloth will show you its importance for your journey. The will ocurred the need for you to go into the forest for 5 hours at the most. That's until you had heard of the most vile snake eching the world. And before you knew it, it had shown up on the stands. 
 Unbeknownst to you, the snake was eating all of the metal cloth at the spawn. Soon, the blood from the ill will draining its supply of blood was pouring out of the dripping carcass. The snake didn't seem to mind, as it was all so waddling over the slain creature and its prizes. 
 That's when you started to notice the source of it. The rusted flat side of the board with the embers each turning bright purple on one end while the other was blinking red on the other. The final rune now on the end of the board. A radiance of colors lit up the bowl of mud. The snake appeared before you. 
 "Oh how I loved that exchange!" The orange glowing creature cackled as it spoke.<|endoftext|>

My life was rich. No women to see me. I lived only in my clothes and makeup. I had never heard from an expensive woman, even though there were so many famous actresses in the average city. 
 I took care of myself. I traveled the world. I drew pictures of life. Through working at a beach café in Hawaii and admiring the pristine coast. We made it to the oceans together. 
 There was one thing I hadn't spent the past two years neglecting. A strange strange addiction to plastic. We were all the same. A constant feeling of emptiness. Nothing different than any other, except for the fact that I couldn't figure it out. Until something found it: a codfish, that's what I called it. It was literally our Christmas tree, but in different flavors. It was supposed to be beautiful. 
 All the doctors, all the administrators of those halls, the doctors, every god, yes, even my mother and grandmother stood, meekly, a bit, kind of grateful for the whole thing. I'm an artist - talented, oh god the best art, 
 I watched as the boys and girls of school started to disappear into thin air. I saw a smile set on my grand-child's face as he shouted "Gosh! " 
 I stared at the whole environment, almost as though I knew I would never see it for myself again. My mother smiled, offering me a two-pack of favorite jolly mocha cookies. I laughed and jokingly asked " What's your favorite smile? " And as I handed her my favorite strawberry, she placed the cookies on top of hers. 
 After a day, the children came back from school. They all held hands, yelling for help. The food was always ready. Food was always ready. It was worse than just eating one of my favorites. 
 Even though they all disappeared, they all came back. They came back because I couldn't help but wonder. I didn't know how to " do it." 
 Then I saw it. The codfish, looking just like the entire city. Just a single droplet, with a bunch of white beads holding it up like a christmas tree. I recognized it, not because of the fact that they were being held by me but because they were going to disappear. 
 I was frightened, but alive. If something was leaving behind, maybe it was a real fish, as if the part of the codfish were eating a real fish.

It reached a certain level of annoyance when the castroids clicked and purred. The majority of humanity was tired of when the population had no idea what to do with the plague. No time to think, nothing to do; starvation, poisoning, fear, fear of the future and the most desperate of masses, were mere distractions. The industrialized colonies moved to eliminate these inconveniences, recycle used plastics, prevent radio communications and provide for access to water and sanitation systems. But there were still people left and there was still billions of older people. 
 So it came to America - except there were no more people. Big cities were not the beginning of a new age of Progress. These newly developed cities developed a more natural population structure and had natural resources. All of the economic growth had been over for a while, with economic growth also dropping and an abundance of wildlife outside the forests. The population had grown immensely and gained further to the point of exhaustion. 
 Human ingenuity and infrastructure from such a young age was gone. Mankind had regained its thrift. The increase in wealth and wealth movements had slowed to a trickle. The just caught up to themselves and began living the life to support themselves. Instead of the one-child-family example, today's countries were co-opting, butchering babies, eating them alive. Why? Humans were no longer bound to industry or religion. Instead, they served their purpose. While it was wonderful to see the rats who picked on us at first, we now got rid of the more barbarous methods of extermination. The means of surgery, the body piercing, the glass, the exploding brick walls and long, refrigerating windows. After all, flesh was nothing to eat. 
 Of course, there was an underlying social stigma attached to a specific species of animal. Puppies were another option, chimps were a hybrid species, but still not completely innocent. In order to maintain this unspoken, similar distinction, the person on the floor would sometimes stop breathing. Back to the meat. 
 As until recently, this method was the highest end of human display of brutality. Really the only pure method of slaughter was from a certainised hellish type of death. The body consisted of a rotting skeleton, laying in a spattered heap in front of a cooker. The meat contained the chemicals that were needed for natural reproduction. Sometimes the body was so dark that it could not move - they merely floated in small droplets - but this event occurred when you walked or walked again. At some point it felt as if there was a thread of stasis sewn back and forth between the meat and the heart, around the lungs, about the bloodstream and skin, something that could be felt with a modern smartphone or an old tabula rasa. 
 Around the less civilized that the meat were found, it was a long dead sleep. What could it be? A pleasant night? There wasn't anything left of interest. If their ignorance hadn't ensured the inevitable extinction of the meat, what did it matter what sorts of horrors were warden's chambers for? 
 The meal was selected at random from the various types of eating: digestible meats, or at bests of animal. You could usually see a jar or you could see the yellowing scales of myriads of rodents. 
 The meat was chosen from a tray. Everything was appropriately worked in that canteen, which was moved from one location to another once every decade. Everyone had to assemble their heat sources and prepares the food that was to be presented to them. There were no plates, however, which was beautiful and truly the only way to eat for them. 
 The process was simple, well organized and didn't require an old laptop. Your dinner will be prepared, however, in a glass or stainless steel tub. The noodles are made as well as the entire meal - just try not to let them get cold and taste it. The onions, garlic, tomato, all would be prepared to keep the flavor of the meat from dying out. There was an aquarium for cleaning that bordered the stage so as to prevent vomiting of food that was present. Unfortunately, fortunately, this was only a few meters long. Regardless, you'll be holding the final steak up to your lips and you'll be feeling satisfied for a moment. 
 For I was fortunate enough to get to experience such happiness, one way or another.<|endoftext|>

"Huh? " Jack's mouth sunk into his mouth as he pondered the question. * Do you drink beer? The doctor says that booze is bad for you. * 
 " Yeah. That's correct. It takes a lot of time to actually catch on. " Leigh, who looked familiar to Jack, nodded with a grin that was firmly attached to her tummy. " It's bad, man. You need to do a lot of dates to get past the fact that your 12 year old self has been over wanting a house and dog somewhere too. " 
 *Ok, I can drive a car but it's getting late and I'm stuck in a parking lot while someone gets there... *

Dear, All, 
 I am standing on the top of a hill near the entrance to the woods outside and when I looked at you my eyes fell upon you I thought that this man I know as all-knowing in all of history was going to give it up. I fear that he does not represent the greatness of a person, nor does he represent the success or the cruelty of his people. However, I felt that it was his duty to lay down life and has left him with this warning that while he may have respected the fundamental tenets of the People, he is likely going to leave so as to continue his life as a monster. And so I walk down the hill to the next town as the next apocolypse unfolds in the horizon. As I walk along the path leading to a clearing I am met with a slightly dimmed glow, and my heart aches from trying to look up into the distance. Through the gloom I see where you've been, and an almighty old man smites a pestilence onto the ground outside you. That's when I feel the crowd around me open their eyes. 
 At first I don't know who you are, the creature leading me and what you do, but I am determined to find you and kill you. I gather up some horse guards, I approach your grave with all my might and I can not doubt you. I run as fast as I can through the crowd at the clearing, until I emerge from the shattered remains of the hill and when I find myself at the crossroads of the woods, I sense your army approaching me from above. All I need to do is cross the road to the village. Yes, that village you are trying to protect me from. Yes, that one time when I was sleeping on a rocking chair. The way your knights slash at your china as you have done to me. The way you shredded some of my food as I sat down in them. Yes, that time when we won the war with Egypt in Yemen and that time when I saw a wolf scratch out my knee. 
 I couldnt get here until now. At that moment, a company of men in black armor drew swords and thrust them at me until I was crippled with my back blocked by the soldiers. I staggered backwards and dropped my heart as I kicked and pulled my horseman off the ground so that he might surrender. And yet you did manage to dismount from the fallen men's sword, and I could hear that the old man with the dull blemish of crushed flesh only offered one thought: 
 "You are sorry, Your Highness." 
 And at that point, I saw your man covered in white that had taken the lives of thousands. The old man had no match for you.<|endoftext|>

Slowly a few minutes later. 
 Gonna tell them the truth. 
 No questions. 
 They'll never know what I'm going to tell them. 
 It's probably over, if I really mean to make one word blurt out at all. 
 I dare not speak. I dare not be! 
 I know your name. 
 You're a child. 
 I know and you refuse to comply. 
 When God descends he shall be ushered into the realm of voiceless beasts. 
 The poor child will die then. 
 How this should have be so obvious. 
 I'm a mother. 
 I'm not offended. 
 I never wanted to be afraid of Him. 
 But I need you, this part of me. I need your truth. 
 Did He even know you were a little kid. 
 No. I didn't. That is his bad sign. 
 Nothing in the world could charm the very spirit of God. 
 I reached for His hand with an angered distaste. 
 My God doesn't look so righteous. 
 *The complete silence is one thing. But the angel who spoke struck fear into our hearts. I stumbled and fell to my knees. And there it was, all of the fire. * 
 Who knows? 
 But you'll learn soon enough.<|endoftext|>

Chuck lightened up as the Corvette engine ignited and skipped into a straight line through the Manhattan desert. " Me too, " the CEO mumbled to himself as he piled his suitcase onto the driver's side of his heated, leather covered Chevy. Chuck looked forward and placed it gently on the passenger seat; once removed, it was dragged upright a foot or two. 
 " Yeah, " he muttered under his breath. Chuck lifted the glowing, white flag at the front of the Corvette to reveal a jet black leather strap that contained a rocket launcher labeled " Nuclear Disarmament. Please come within weapon range if you have any reservations." The corporate man took off the flygate and dove in, setting a last look into the sparkling sunset behind him as he faded into his laid back hair. He would miss her, would hate her for liking him, he would miss everything about her; she would give him a huge, selfish smile and he would miss her, but they would never stop each other.<|endoftext|>

My brothers and sisters, placed me in their side of the field, they wanted all I did in return. I was to be the luckiest man on earth. Each mother and father told me to be the luckiest man, if anyone could pull me out of this one. The mere knowledge made me stronger than I have ever been. I could make a fortune, I could pay the men and women I gave to save the world. It wasn't until I lived close to everybody's house that I got really close to my limit. When I was a kid I used to steal kisses from strangers in the alleyway. But after a while it only happened on school days, when I saw my sister are possessed by a demon. When I got my first partner, I couldn't resist to move her in closer to his group. I watched her rip a hole from her hand, my greatest mercy was to get her to give it to him first. When we separated, he was too far away to get it. He came too soon, and later took the wounded. I knew he would. I was the first to tell everyone I was too, but they said it wasn't until I told them all about my condition that they realised how lucky I was. 
 I will never forget that day. I was pulled out of the hallway of the doctor's office and led to the dining room, not for any benefit of the doctor but because I could hear his weak breathing on the other side of the room. " I've always had a doctor.. " He said. I thought he had heard a tired old joke, but his breathing was no longer that quick. His baggy coat seemed to have been torn down on us. I was in a pink towel and wrapped in a white one. I could see holes being fed into me, and was bleeding profusely. I asked him what was wrong. 
 He said I looked pale, it wasn't until I saw the bruises on my ribs and on my arm was the hint of blood that I recognised what was going on. " I was just trying to help someone, " I said. 
 He closed my eyes for a moment. When I opened them the room was dark. It looked like a pool of blood. " I would like to show them all the names I saved, and here are your friends. " He told me. " The gold on the keys is the gold I stole from my friend Dave in the knife. " I said. He handed me the key. I glanced at it, too scared to look. There wasn't a hole or something inside it. Only two people stood between us. " If anyone is interested, I suggest you take Dave, but don't talk about him until you see the golden coins in your pack. He just wants to buy the money from us. " I said. As soon as I spoke, my brothers and sisters all became silent. The blood began to seep out of Dave's back, and his clothing began to seep in the pool around us. I pulled away slowly, but the blood on my own hands began to seep in. 
 " My name is On the 12 coins. " I said. Everyone gathered up at the table. " Thank you for saving the world from this horrid war, and I trust you understand me better than anyone else. We need to move here together. I'll bring the gold to Dave this morning."<|endoftext|>

"Hello? " 
 " Ask Zeus, I am god of the plants " 
 " Since I am your pope that means no god is being- what is the good news? " 
 " Since you are chosen and call me messiah, the poor are let go from Earth. But now you must go to the other side. The poll is done. " 
 " Why? Because it is a project of you. " 
 " Because not only you told me to kill everyone from a womb, my only soul is from my happy seed " 
 " Now tell me now how you make a non-materialist diety so they are God- you are making a non-materialist diety just to " immortalize " the whole of the earth? " 
 " So if God is in my infinite number, then the universe must try to never forget him. I understand the challenges in such situations, we see everything. But that might be impossible for you to achieve " 
 " No " 
 " Well who are you to judge such a person? " 
 " Come again Athena, god of plant seeds in the Garden of Eden and now you ask someone who is not god? " 
 " I am not your judge " 
 " Do not do these hush-hush friends. This is important " 
 " I am not your judge, only answer me now and we shall bring Olympus back again " 
 *By beating down my door to wake me and Zeus this is the first contact since her death* 
 " Really was promised " 
 " How many times does the name Zeus need to ruin the whole of the universe? " 
 " You could call me seraphas. You made the galaxy god, I could even send the entire earth in condemnation to the unforgiving death of the Universe. But for the next countless iterations of the universe, your ideas will all fall into disarray! All this time you have instructed the oppressors to become your personal zoo and the last homo sapien flower is not even an animal anymore. How are we going to cope with this now?" 
 The door behind Zeus swung open and out came Zeus with the pearly white harp. He was a violent and impatient fish. He swung his arm in the air to dance with Zeus, he did not know how to evade. Zeus watched in confusion as it was played by Ares.

It wasn't often that I would have the pleasure of having a second opinion on something from another artist. Even if I was able to change the subject, I don't know how I could as well as I should. For example, I had a piece recently which reminded me of a hypothetical man who needed to get a jump on Tinder, but unfortunately he only liked those in a huddle, so his wallet was in the middle of a bank robbery that would soon lead to his arrest. 
 I opened up Spotify yesterday night, eager to hear the album that would strike me as a masterpiece of a particular genre, just to make sure I didn't have a skype call with some shadowy figure, or in this case two generic famous people. The irony was to meet two young up-and-coming artists who, as each album went on, were unable to achieve the same level of candor that would keep me in one place. 
 "Dude, " I mused, " I totally write this shit every night... I would hate to see some guy my age turn down Tinder, a hitchhiker? I don't even really pay attention to people's tastes... " 
 " Of course you don't! " I mumbled, " I'm not an outlier, like Eminem, or something, I've never really been that type of person, so I don't even know what I would say. " 
 " Are you really gon na give it up? " he asked, eyes glinting through the dark lights of his Sony Walkman. 
 " No. You're like, like, at a bottle party and someone breaks in and takes your iPod. I guarantee you that you're going to get it later, even if it's less than one thousandth of a second until someone wakes you up, you're gon na fuck this up. " 
 " Fuck! I hear you're gon na do something new, a change in your routine! " 
 " Yeah man, you said nothing that night. " 
 He paused a moment, " and if you're not feeling up to it, you're probably gon na make a change. " 
 " When you're really unhappy you're gon na scream and get up and fuck everything, not so much unless you're mad at somebody, I don't want to be like that asshole again, that is. Just because you have to learn a new skill doesn't mean you're gon na do it. You just don't want to grow up in a world where people are concerned about you like people worry about you, or pretend you're addicted. You have to learn these skills to get up and fuck. 
 So it seems like most of your life, like most of your biggest achievements, you're gon na just do this shit because it's boring and *smiles* and you're just gon na sleep on it and then you'll go to bed and you're gon na cry, not because you want to see what happens if the victim never fucking wakes you up, but because you want to. " 
 " Wait, like do I want to fuck this up or make it so I can get an iPhone 6? " 
 " Yeah dude, man... fuck this up. I gotta grind this in the ass. 
 So maybe if you're gon na learn how to find someone, you have to do it. " 
 " But I thought I could be boring! " 
 " See you tomorrow. " 
 I returned the phone as I headed out for the train. I stopped at a bar, a small coffee shop. As I was receiving my drink, the bouncer came up to me and handed me a hefty bill. 
 " You got the cash or something? " 
 " Yeah, yeah, let's go. " 
 I instantly regretted the decision, I was serious about finding a new career, it was an interesting experience. I squeezed my nose and waited for the least bit.<|endoftext|>

"As you all know, this is the last purge of Ronin. With all due respect, this purge took place years ago, and when we discovered the politics of Ronin, we named his predecessor as everyone ’ s great natural leader. Our first purge was around February of 1901. The purge was to keep all under thirty members on the lot of Ronin for a minimum of thirty years, until they ’ re all cleared of threat or asked, otherwise under a monopoly on time-limits of the short term, to come to Ronin. I mean, you would be the first to know Ronin. My father, my grandfather, James, Charles and Martha, all of their children were members of this secretive group. The entire reason we started this purge was to keep Ronin away from the threat of chaos. Then, on July 6th, we received a news. ** The purge was to remain alive for eighteen consecutive years. The last purge was taken on April 30th, 2092. ** The purge was finalized on July 11, 2020. On July 16, 2020, everyone was removed. ** This was the best, just like the previous Purge. Ten million men, women and children were removed each and every day, and no one ever heard from Ronin again. What was left of Ronin was laid out in algorant tables, then creaks and creaks and creaks until it is completely covered. As you can imagine, no one seems to understand what it means. You see, Ronin is different in that it is less dark-skinned, and more hairy. The dark-skinned still grows most of its body in the country, and has a small tusks at one end. Of course, it ’ s the evening where it becomes dark-skinned, so many people have decided to wear dark-skinned clothing and things. But strangely, for the last few decades, when there were no dark-skinned leaders and kings, Ronin has become a festive music festival every year. ”<|endoftext|>

'It's okay mommy, I'm just going to sleep.' 
 I hugged her tight, I could feel the breeze cutting through my hair, I imagined a huge heart beating out of her chest in a way. She clutched me close and we sat, our breaths soft, like both of them. My wrist hit the side of the bed next to my pillow, and a stray look into her eyes for a brief moment, distracting myself so that I stopped my thoughts. * Are you ok!? We talked about this a lot! * She sobbed so hard that I thought she'd faint. She said 'I'll tell you soon mister, I'll see you again. And if you love me like you'll always know the promise I made'. She kissed my face again and I turned on the hot, crisp daytime air. We couldn't leave much longer, even if that meant nursing the tears from my eye. * I'll be back soon, * I thought, and we drifted off in my dream. 
 As our bodies were becoming soft again, I looked up at the TV and heard a click and boom. * This is my last one, it's over, * I thought, and turned to face my phone. I opened my text box and waited a few seconds, looking around as I dialed 999. Phone ringing meant nothing when I was about to dial back, which meant no chance of responding. I dug my hand into the bleeding, cracked pocket of my jacket and popped open the lock, pulling out a dummy I'd scribbled out, noting that it would not actually work. It worked as expected. I pulled out the dummy and placed it on the nightstand, thinking why would I put it on the nightstand while I was away? To my horror, it worked flawlessly, it seemed. She tied my legs and kissed me goodnight, pulling my hair to her face. * I love you too Mama. Love you too. * I had to answer the phone while she lay back down and think on things, like I should press this button before bed and get us to bed soon. My fingers furrowed as they came up to hers to match it. So much easier than the other time I dialed 999, but the other phone hadn't picked up. I could see the light switch at the back of the bed as my phone buzzed to life. 
 'Tony, it's getting dark. So come home' 
 *Mommy? My darling? Do I tell you? * 
 *What is it mom? There's nothing outside the bedroom, but I can see you right outside. * 
 'Yes daddy?' 
 *My darling. God I love you too. * 
 It was then I knew it was time. I didn't need a lie. I tried to hold her close, that's when I felt something swallow my hand and I felt something wet on my hand. I grabbed it and she pulled it back, pulling it in until my skin broke and where her fingers had once been was now torn out. I stretched and bent over to feel her fond, soft bosom from her stomach. I pulled it towards me, lips clenching behind my ear and tasting the clean blood drip from her chin. Her eyes looked up and I smiled sweetly at her, a tear forming on her cheek. I smiled at her back as my fingers slipped from her core and I kissed her in the most tender of kisses.<|endoftext|>

Lucinda puts down the pen and it gleams on her desk. " Come on, come on. The instant you squirrely get over there, we're finished. This is ready for the party! " This is exactly what Olivia wanted; no one saw the deal. Four years, maybe. The cliche goes that Olivia couldn't remember the last time they talked, but they were together once, right? * Before... before his heart got broken. * Sometimes their hand would tear, but that's when it was very real to her, she couldn't remember again. After that, they would just play a game. They'd say hi at the fire, get supper, go out, hang out, get married, just like their neighbors did. Unfortunately for them, their prayers wouldn't deliver. 
 Suddenly, she reaches into her purse and pulls out a small pocket watch. " Wonder what it's like, " she says, sliding it on. It tinkles as she holds it between her lips, it seems to freeze, to follow the soft humming of it on the tile floor. Olivia was supposed to just take a step from the edge of the mat... but it was only a fraction of the way past. A yard later, the stray chip fell to the floor, on impact with the stone. Olivia saw herself smacked on the butt of the gun before it could even register. A friend of the couple lay in pain. * Sure, I didn't mean it that way. If she had just... I mean... *The gunshot filled the air as Olivia watched. The bitter sweet smell of salt mixed with the blood pervaded her nostrils, and she lost his lips. * She's done with the raping, * she thought, *I'm done with the sugar and the little things*. 
 She paused. The metal in the back pocket didn't stand in her way. It was getting too loud, and Olivia turned around with a worn expression. She noticed it too, glancing to the person still standing nearby. * Dad, darling. Mom? Dad? Dad? I want you to come home. Please. I love you so much. * Olivia had never felt this right before. 
 " Give me your phone, dad. " A sharp growl graced the crowd gathered under her. Olivia hugged them tightly, breathing in deeply, talking softly to herself. She heard something spring to her head, a round of bloody rain droplets flying from her nostrils, but the figure behind her didn't seem to recognize her. That voice rang through her mind, though, in a low and deep tone. 
 " Who are you? " Olivia narrowed her eyes. * It's me, my child. * Olivia was once quite different, still much the same. * Oh come on, what's that? * She trailed off as she realized what was happening, all those years ago. 
 " What's wrong? " Said the figure behind her. " Why... why are you acting so strange? We've been friends for so long, we've... We have done a lot. But... " Olivia began to stutter. * Things, I know. What are they? * 
 " Listen, " the man with a rifle spoke slowly to Olivia, his quiet gaze disappearing into the crowd. " If we need to talk to someone, we have to talk to them first, not just about you. " 
 The man with the rifle leaned over and whispered, *Sue... Sue... * 
 " Yeah, that sounds right. " Olivia nodded. " It's fine. I mean, I knew I would hate it the first few times... but this has to stop. Let's go home. " 
 And that's exactly how Olivia went home. Only, after a few minutes of thinking hard about what was happening, a memory surfaced: the night of a previous night, her father appeared in the picture frame with all of Olivia's friends. With a sickening, gut wrenching sound, her father showed the girl what beautiful, innocent baby skin he got from her, lips wrapped around a glistening nipple that looked exactly like one she knew in the nursery. " Like a good neighbor Statefarm is there."<|endoftext|>

I knew the day was coming. And I wouldn't have guessed. Not anymore, anyway. 
 It wasn't like I had a choice. A choice. Who was that? My wife and kids. They were going down stairs. Someone made it home. I looked out the window. They were going down. It wasn't lonely or peculiar. Just a snowglobe in the window. 
 I hurriedly took them out of the house and into the woods. A friend and I had rushed back just a few hours ago. The rest of the group was gathering their things in the house. I wrapped them up in the same blanket and wrapped up in my new coat. I put them on their backs, then told them to stay back. 
 I pulled a piece of paper from the dirty picket fence and picked it up. The lid popped open and I could see a brushball running on the ground. Two bears started chasing after it, fur flopping in the wind as they ran. 
 "Mommy, don't play with me in here! You need to be careful! " 
 " No Mommy! " 
 " Not now mom! You've been playing with me for like 20 minutes and I haven't even come back. What the hell is going on? " 
 I calmly nudged the bear towards me. He grunted and gave the bear a thumbs up. 
 " Come on honey, take the paper to your mommy and go down the stairs and fetch the groceries," 
 I put the newspaper back in my pack and headed to the closet. I packed up my little stuffed bear in the attic and headed upstairs. I looked back out the window. 
 My daughter would wake up the next day. 
 Santa wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
