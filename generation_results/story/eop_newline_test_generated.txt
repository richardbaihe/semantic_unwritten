To whoever reads this, I am going to have to put this on the top five. Be nice, I haven't been playing and will give it a try.
It was fun, really. I was like you - you had a witty statement about crosswords, your descriptions were pretty challenging, and your descriptions were weird too. You've done a number on me, so let's take a look at it.
> *Yo, Yahweh! How about a Steak and Steak-Frickin'-era episode? *
Hmm. Well, there was this one where he talked about Farrah's third eye, and I don't think Farrah wanted to drink it from The iPod or use it.
Or maybe next month, I think.
Some sentence would have worked. I have no idea, like I said, this is very funny. I'll have to settle for more revealing.
> *What the hell is happening to you, Dave? *
I need that. I need to get it out of my head. I need it to come out as comprehensible. I need it to be real.
You left at random. I love that. You were the main character in way back when. Now, when you made that sexual remark to Farrah, and mentioned it to yourself, all those emo bootles of yours, they were gross and you said no. That was preposterous. The one pornstar may have been one thing, but is he really not an emo snob? I don't know. I don't know, we're gon na have to hear some more questions about Farrah.
> *In your sentence, you said, "That is the nicest thing you ever did. " *
Yeah, that's the nicest. I remember what you said, you were getting buttloads of jokes from each other. Even in school, I've learned to humour myself and I don't remember this too well, but we definitely have a joke every night.
I actually thought the Emo scandal is bullshit. It was completely bullshit, but I'm having some trouble connecting it to my feelings. I don't want to focus on it. I want to focus on " that was the nicest thing I ever did, no one else. ". I'm sorry I'm feeling this way. I just had this over-statement over my shoulder.
Also, your dialogue in here is very generic. You probably don't know who you're talking to. Like you have an idea for it. Maybe we can get that out of your head?
> *Fine. Let's start with a'Who is you?' then stop where you're going by dragging it to another person. *
Emm...
> *You picked up the dog and immediately started wandering back to the dog house... And then stopped. You called the cops and the dog was moved to a shelter, which you didn't tell the police. *
Great. You got me.
> *Only after you told him you didn't love him so much... That at the time he did love you... That you kept him all those years. *
Woah!
> *How sad is that? I am devastated by your actions now and you are scarred. I am made of good energy, I will never have to care. I am tired, but I won't be homeless forever. I want me to be happy again. *
I'm sorry. You had really good words!

Her first month spent flailing her arms wildly in the air as she was about to blast off to somewhere exotic. She hated. Such rebellious teenage jealousy that kept building, feeding the anger and frustration of those around her as she aged. Surely the jealous homebody wasn't the gatekeeper of this newly rose garden? Always, there was always one of her little planets, that grow back on this charming little planet, with grey pools of water, brilliant, bathed in a purple sea. Her art is lively, and only her gentle hand will produce a diamond of that nature. Already, she has transformed from just another blue gem from her homeland to a handsome ruby of pearls. Now, she'll grow without the mind of stone. Just a delicate nepotism, that is. For while her violet eyes glisten in the fading light of the night. And when the stilted and blind my soul, she will always maintain it's emerald eyes with *eyes! * I'll rejoice, seeing as the sun should not rise for a few more days and still, she'll never bother to glance at me. Perhaps in that moment of delirium from the thought of my poor childhood, I'll hear her angelic lurch as her pupils slip across the figure upon which they hang, and not a single slip of the wet fabric show forth but her horse-coat, but a bite of red meat sat upon the wool. She has fooled me! A selfish cringeworthy fool. She knows my feeble hand! It's beautiful here, a fierce and flame covered replica of her radiant smile. I hope, today, I'll succeed. She will have my back. I'm leaving now. Just a dull thud. I would rather be away. Without a single spark of emotion during the chase. A stupid urge to ignore her. Fear overwhelmed. As I slowly blink off to nothing, her lips open. No, I take a deep breath. After the pain is gone, she sighs and turns to walk off. Her body peels from the grass, her eyes and face contorted like deformed cats. She looks at her wide handsome mouth full of curiosity. Her hands dance over the hollowed out grass, still spinning like a blooming flower. Her smile.

Geraldius heard the creaking behind him, seemingly louder than it had been since the god spilt his blood in his veins. The cloaked figures descended quickly, cutting through the thin, steel shield some monks placed on their chest. Silence followed as a blade of armour swung directly in front of him, slicing through to the air at a height of a hundred yards before it struck the inside of his chest. The sword dropped from the podium between Geraldius' swords. He turned and faced the figure in front of him, and saw something worse than the world he once called home. He struggled to regain consciousness, but finally spoke, his voice quivering, "and if you choose to live, know that it isn't you... it is me."
The cloaked figure dissipated, and the priests staggered back as the figure with bloodshot eyes returned, and the fighter was knocked to the ground by a fierce blow to the chest.

Sitting next to the modest looking young woman opposite of me, tears began to well in my eyes. The first game I played had always been fierce, with my brothers dropping out to train to become heavier lifters to what they could accomplish. So, as a fighter I went over to give her a rare weapon that she was grateful for - a small one. She had to choose. She never had had the chance to wear it even once before it was cut down and dropped to its conscription vest. She kept to it for years, always changing only to be picked by champions who proved so proficient with it, that she moved out to learn the craft once again.
I wanted to tell her that I could still train the weapon on my sister as a young girl but a young girl had saved up enough money to take it from me just once so I had to kill her. I hadn't paid much attention to my sister's accomplishments so I always wore the artifact every time I returned. I could do things she no longer could, and of course that meant killing her parents. Never expected the unfortunate fate she had sealed from me, my sister. How my sister killed her parents made me wonder if that would have changed my character later on.
So I went into the grand hall once again, worried that would mean she wouldn't get that artifact. I got the artifact here as well. It was here only rarely or never were it produced, despite it showing itself in almost every tiny bottle she had or whenever it was used for recreational use. Some would even have been inferior to it, never made a tangible difference to me in the slightest. At the time the artifact was on the highest point in the grand hall, it was held in some impossible place in the center. I walked carefully over to it, picking my way through the corridors of the hall. To my fear, the artifact was there always, only now my hearing got higher. A voice spoke to me from behind me. I wasn't prepared for what they were going to say.
"Sisters, no. "
I gasped for air and took a deep breath.
" Ah..Sister? Do you understand what you're hearing? "
I fell silent.
" There are... blades! " she sounded so confident. " Eighteen! "
" Okay, how many of those blades did you just drop from your sister? "
I could barely listen to her.
" Six! " I began to leap from the massive shelves at the end of the hallway. I dashed for the nearest exit, but as I made my exit I heard the door trembling open.
" Brother? "
She looked terrified. I could feel the fury grow in my chest as I ran for the door.
" More blades. " I uttered in a voice so calm. The girl was scared.
" Well? I was careful with this one too, wasn't I? "
I started running for my house and ran into the hall, only to be followed by a young woman in the process.
" All my family has chosen you as their assassin. " she said.
I froze in shock. This seemed so crazy. Suddenly, I felt a cruel touch to my mouth, and my eyes widened and I realized what was happening. A blade was jabbed deep into my own throat. I screamed and ran away from my ally.
" What the Hell's going on? " I was screaming. I didn't know what to do, but something inside of me screamed for help. It yelled for help because, without a moment's hesitation I felt pain. Suddenly it emerged from my throat, forcing me to feel the pain right in front of me.
" I am... my sister. For centuries, I have taught you my secrets, and for a time my mother had given up on dying to fight the beast in her backyard. She gave up on fighting it because of the sword. I've kept it in my family, but my father abandoned me to fight it. I will never know what it is because of that... weapon. " the young woman began weeping.
I stopped crying as I felt a cold fist connected to me. I was screaming, but I was not scared, I was ready. I plunged the blade into her throat.
" S-Sister, are you... so sure? I promise."

I know I'm not just saying this out loud. Please just listen to me, I realize, and thank you for doing this for me. Some people will find it easier than others. Some people will appreciate my honesty. They will think I'm just making them snap at me, but I'm not. I know what I'm saying, everyone will fall in love with me, I know I will never forget her, she is my daughter, my house, and my best friend. She is the image that they all have of me. I tell them so much of her, but they just don't realize how much they mean to me. I haven't felt love in a long time and I think I am close to losing it all. But I need to do it for the children that I love. I love my friends, I love my family, and I love the world I grew up in. I love them and I love trying to be with them. I can not let them forget me, please, please don't hurt me, I know that I can't thank them enough, not when I meet you. Please, please, please stop; please I want to live, and I want this to be for me. I can't do this anymore. It's my fault for holding onto memories so badly that I'm so afraid of returning to reality.

It wasn't exactly the most ideal time to die, but my family had hoped for that long. My wife and I had hiked through the valleys, gaining knowledge and learning from our studies. Our first job on the slopes was a chance we could jump into a glass vessel and travel the length of the Earth so we could see Earth from the blue sky. We finally reached the coast of Terra, and we journeyed up the valley to go climb up one of the other towers above.
The floor was thick and cracked, and being in a hotel you'd be late. All we could do was sit and watch as the elevator sank and sank until we could no longer see the sky, as our hands were now covered with blankets. It wasn't a pleasant process, although I still can't really describe what it was like walking into the top of the Earth. I knew we had only 3 more minutes before we started to reach the forest.
We tried digging out of the ground, but our shovels refused to dig in. There was a sheet of thick glass left at our feet on the floor; the captain told us to try again. For now though, we would have to wait there.

My phone buzzed and vibrated in my pocket. It was a dial tone.
“ 911 911! ”
I sprinted into the hallway to the kitchen to get my phone out of my pocket.
“ Wh... who are you? ”
I tried to memorize the words. I felt their vibrance, the way the tiny code alerted me. The tone, slowly, slowly, it filled my throat and I looked into it again. I heard the small click, and felt the smooth plastic cover slowly peel. I looked back in the kitchen and was scared. I remembered that dial tone playing on a dusty metal carrier phone. “ 911, 911, 911 ” it filled my stomach. Suddenly my phone vibrated. I checked the screen and it was a dial tone:
“ 911, 911 ”
I was excited, but I did not understand what it was. There was no notification on my phone.
“ What is this? ” I asked. “ Is my neck a dial tone? ”
The face stared at me, it wasn ’ t happy. “ Your neck is a dial tone, it is a ringing machine, is that okay? ”
I started sweating. I didn ’ t understand what I was seeing. I blinked and stared into the phone screen. The 6:37 AM.

We have been going to bed at this point.
It was always me, the monster, sitting at the table in my bedroom one day all of a sudden.
Opening the door, a slow, feminine voice interrupted my thoughts,
"I thought I was safe"
And you know who it was, right? The girl sitting next to me at the table. She was about 9 or 10, but her hair was just perfect, pink, and most importantly her hair was well groomed. She was a very pretty girl, too, my friend.
It was a cold and lonely night. The sound of keys clacking on the car with too much traffic right behind the girl.
I let out a sigh, and opened the door to my closet. Just a bit of imagination, but mostly, I was ok, I was safe...

What am I? Maybe I'm going crazy? The doctors should think so, I don't feel like one. Where am I? I don't know my name. People don't call me Joe. Some call me Bradley. Some say I'm Down 2. Others call me Doctor Brake. I really don't know this, I can't speak. I'm sick of this world. I want to live another day. And I can't take this anymore. You are the Doctor, you are destined to change, you are here to save this world. I'm here to save that last little bit of me. I get that the world is long gone now and it is a boring day. These are new people. There are no longer very many young people left anymore. I fear the most of them and I can not take it. I can no longer see. I can not perceive the walls I kept in place. I can not see the open sky anymore. I can not feel the wind. I can't feel the moon or the earth anymore. I can not touch the rain. I can not touch the snow. I can not see the rain on my winter coat. I can not even remember what color it is. It is cold enough in here now. I can't breathe. I'm dying of something. I'm very sick, it's killing me. I hope I don't feel all of this anymore. The doctors said I should feel something, I don't like coughing, I don't like sleeping. I want to go to the doctor. Let them talk to me about my disease. Tell me about my future. They said this is your second chance. Tell me what you want. I should of known about it. What should I know? Now you just look at me and you die. Do you know what happened? I'm dead. Remember that? Just don't die like that. Remember the doctors said. Remember me? Do what? Do what the Doctor told me. I'm no longer suppose to do anything. Don't do the things that the doctor told me to do. Do what. Remember the doctor? My mother told me she was worried about me. She told me she was sorry that I had to die. If she didn't want to save me right now, she might as well just leave me in here and look into the things outside. It is our final wish. Do what the doctor told me. Please let go of that life force. Do what? Don't do what. I deserve what I deserve. Please no. I am not that kind of person. I am more than what I am not. So this is your second chance and my second chance isn't that good. Yes. Whatever. Here is my second chance. I'll send it back down. Please. I'm going to take all of this information that's left. I will tell the doctor that I'll donate it all. Yes. Good. Go from here. No. Not for this. No. Go to your therapist and tell him that you love him and will always be there for him. He is the best friend I ever had. Please.

( I am not a writer, but I come up with creative ideas at random )
I woke up one morning like most of the others, I did not flinch just groggy. I rubbed my eyes, and saw grey. I tried to think, that I could sleep fine, ok what am I doing? I guess sleep is a gulp, the best I can manage right now is to ignore things, and stay awake, sleep will keep me awake longer then I remember, but a full day is not what I think it is. When I get to sleep, I quickly sense the gradient that is going to affect me later on.
I slowly make my way over to the fridge, it will not be long now, next thing i notice is the grey floating off in the centre of the blue ceiling. I feel surprised, I have not seen it like this in my entire life, this was not supposed to be possible in my bedroom. I don't even have the slightest clue why, it must be some sort of sick joke.
As I reach towards the fridge the grey tone grows more pronounced. Maybe its my mind playing tricks on me? I mean i know this is a nightmare, and i was not born with this naturally, only i have an ability i must live with. I grab the small bottle of water and flip through the rest.
Nothing.
Just for a moment, nothing. I look over and am met with nothing. Not even a cloud of dust. " Calm down then, you could swear something is wrong, " I snap back to reality.
" Did something happen to you?" I ask the voice of another person in the hall, unfamiliar, but familiar nonetheless.

The sand storm hit in mere moments. Unless you survived, you probably wouldn't know for sure. I was out drinking some much tastier Royal Sour and flipped the handle but everything seemed to be missing.
I guess I was about to go on a nap when I heard someone shout "Oh my god! ", an old leather bound book by Buck Rettus. I had seen a couple of that books before but never the first one. I had opened up some weird and deeply disturbing writing guide with descriptions of things that did not make sense by the time I read it and not for a fourth time.
Right now, it was exciting. Even though the book is totally okay it is still very, very unnerving. Still I didn't understand how this book could be so powerful.

I reach down to my dresser drawer and pull out what's left of the old woman ’ s clock. When I open the cabinet, there ’ s a handgun pressed against the open door frame. I smile to myself as I pull the trigger.
With a crash I plummet to the ground, the engine whine of the house ’ s engines fading away in a puff of smoke. I wonder what comes next. I wonder what comes next.
First it ’ s a land of a dead summery smell and a sea of old buildings. After a second the old man ’ s shoulders as they embraced and made peace on the gentle sands of the fading town, with only the hammer of a pistol in his grasp. He was a vain man of a man. Not even a friend or a drunkard dared point the gun at him.
The can ’ t find him again. I wave my gun to the old man and he carries on with his task like clockwork. Through a haze I return to my bedroom, relieved that I didn ’ t see it change after all these years.

James felt the chill of heavy winter's wind as he trudged through the late afternoon. He had made it this far by surviving in the cities so far, but he still felt shame at having not been able to get somewhere in time. He made his way to a post office mailbox that was on the end of his street before he could make it to hell, where he thought he might go, since he had never left his post before. As he reached the post, he wasn't sure if he'd heard a cocky remark, or something rude to his neighborhood. James opened the mailbox, and inside the envelope, there he found this,
"I wish to take the last wish that ever was granted by my Lord, God, Thomas. "
This was not what James expected; the comment was " Well what is this?? "
As James looked up at the snowy sky, he heard footsteps coming from behind him. " Open the mail... "
The man glanced back at the notice, but James could see the directions on the post.
" I'm told you're here for the Boston Olympics, right? "
James opened the post: It was titled " Thomas Deerfield Nation's Greatest Massacre, " and he was hoping it was some sort of joke.
" This is strictly confidential to the police, but even then, I would do it if they actually found me. "
James was pissed. This man was never good for the law. The authorities were too late for that. James headed back to his mailbox, and opened the post.
" I wished to be granted the wish of God, Thomas Deerfield Nation. "
James stared in disbelief at the message, and he immediately regretted that remark. However, the message said nothing about the wish.
" You're not allowed to claim a wish granted to you by a Bearded, Midget, or Brat wearing cloud ass murderer after you die in the hospital"
He contemplated telling his wife, and asked himself a couple of questions while under the influence of the monster behind the post.

I waited for the party to begin. I turned the corner, only to be met with silence. He didn't mind, he just wasn't comfortable around me. A glass of bourbon hung in my hands and I poured myself another. As I settled in for another drink, he brought it to me on the table.
“ You know, I never really like people picking their songs up, but sometimes I like to buy them. It ’ s the excuse to the living room. I mean, life just falls into a trap sometimes. When I was in sixth grade, we were just talking about American Idol and it played and it wasn ’ t any good. Now I ’ m talking about college. I ’ m still in fifth grade and I ’ m talking about R-rated shows sometimes. It ’ s an awful rock. I don ’ t even know if it ’ s crass or worse. ”
The glasses were drawn and he was on a stool and I began to collect my thoughts. I looked around to find out what he ’ d said, let alone laughed at. Somehow I kept myself entertained, but I could never agree on one thing. Finally, he said his closing line. “ Hey. Ok, everything is great. Let me pull this off. I ’ ll be leaving my friends tomorrow. If I could just leave, I ’ d say goodbye. Bye. ”
I forgot who he was or how he knew who I was, only I would get a warning. That ’ s when a black car pulled out. The driver took off before I could react. Blood rushed into my eyes as the blue tinted window in the back caught my reflection in the window. Standing there, I closed my eyes and prepared to shout.
“ Hey, whoa! Can you stop yelling? I was going to yell back so I could finish that song and you can just shout back. ” I ducked behind a car and turned my head. It was too late. He had quickly got out of the car.
“ Noooooo, hey you can. I better get home in time. ” I turned around and silently knelt on the lawn as the bleeding had stopped. I could feel the pain as I started to struggle. I woke up in my bed and brought the covers over my face and all I could do was sit up and watch the raucous show. The last thing I remember before I fell asleep was the sound of Mr. Piano's guitar playing.

"That was beautiful " Alex said " Even the multicolored kitten didn't look like it was going to eat " He looked up in amazement and asked, " Please do us a favour and don't do us a favour here "
His family had bought him his first kitty home for christmas at a cat shelter and its yearly birth had been a dream come true. He had sold the kitty home to buy it himself. As soon as he got into his wallet and got to his armchair the kitty barked " That was beautiful " and proceeded to enjoy himself while he was happily playing with his laser pointer.
Alex just took out a 8x8 ball with an index finger, held it to the little cat and smiled. " Sounds like that kitty is strong kid " he said with a knowing smile. " As long as it likes a good time with its dad I'll buy it"
His parents agreed and went upstairs to share their happy time and to sleep after that night Alex went outside to see if there was anything that could cause so much stress and when he heard that he forgot his DVD player and is now learning how to use it.

She's one hundred and eighty. After nineteen long years, the time of reckoning had finally come. Buried deep below the Rockies, with a majority of its 20,000 residents dead so far, the team led by Colonel Weinhardt reentered the village. Now, ninety-three years later, I approach the moment. There is nothing more to do in this world than point your gun at the sheriff and begin searching for his accused killers.
Ah, time to settle down for the ages. “ Well done, ” I thought in my head as I eyed Captain Murphy and his six officers, and drained my rifle of its contents. I tossed away the remaining remains of my old weapon and headed towards the door, headed towards the door I ’ m the captain of. He ’ s an old nutjob, but we were only even faced with him in life.
Today has been no different; we began our search with small skirmishes not far from the waiting area. The neighborhood at the centre of the village held a threat, and while they claimed it as our most difficult attack yet, I believed my men to be captivated by our success. As i approached the door, I saw one by one of my men come into view. Mary Mary Williamson, age seven. She stood across from me, with a pistol pointed in the air, and said, “ It ’ s Lieutenant Jessie Wilson, and he ’ s dead. ” I nodded silently to the that, and walked out to join the rest of the team.
Mary, in her 19 ’ s, was the youngest of all of us in our squad. The smallest son of two and a grandmother to lead an army of small, maturing leaders. Before her had everyone around her been a devout Catholic. Today Mary told us about the disease. She said, “ It spreads when you drink and smoke the smoke out of your lungs. If it ’ s not a smoking problem, it ’ s a lung attack. Smoking could kill me in one week, and the risk would reach two weeks if one of us suffices. ” John nodded and two of his men standing over her nodded in agreement.
We had the hardest year of our lives. Mary closed the doors of the village center and, with one quick tap of our pistol, took out a large bottle of unflavored caramel whiskey. As she finished, she pulled out a small pack, and with a clang I snapped the barrel out of the air. We opened the bottle up, and with a triumphant shout, pointed the barrel at Mary. Now, with only one bullet left, we had all won.

Shakespeare once said'we need music to think' and I'm fairly certain that's how it happens. Nobody has this sense of achievement when it comes to actual activities, such as queuing for lunch, answering phone calls, eating dinner, or flicking through conversations so far.
Rather, it's this layer of functionality that's driving us here. First off, this makes that difficult to track as we move from the core bits to the finer details of our lives, and when the software updates something, essentially it needs to act as an independent mechanic, acting as the springboard for what's next. Whatever you build, things just start happening as if they're already there. Next, there's not really much data in this world. Anything you take, it takes extra effort to capture it. A lot. But then, there's the one basic everyday thing we need to think about:
*Where are the people? *
This is where most people live in your country, and you should be happy to know that.

Today is the day I've decided I'm going to show my new girlfriend what I can do with my spulleys. This new girl had been intensely studying for the week and she's always been so careful around me.
Today is the day I finally decided to show her what I can do with my spulleys. Last week's particularly well written text message startled me. It consisted of a complete description of myself, ages 8-14, her name for me and a picture of me sleeping in my bed.
Her response happened almost like a music video.
"Hey, suck it " she said with a raised smile. I kissed her forehead and pressed her palm into mine. My tongue was always too full for some reason, my facial muscles were always too large for whatever reason, even if she was a small girl.
" Sure, are you or what? " I said as my hair whipped up to face her.
" What? " She asked teasingly. Her snout crackled with excitement.
" I am fluffy coochie- "
I spouted a laugh and waved my hand in front of her face. She slapped it away, his reaction stung at first but soon the bell on her door vibrated and it unlocked.
" Hey Kim! " She squeaked excitedly as her hand hovered over my shoulder.
" Are you okay? " I asked relieved as I thanked her for letting me get this girl. She nodded and I fell asleep for the night, but on the way out I saw her called my number from the corner of her eye which woke me up in a different color. My hopes were but part of my emotion not for the irony of her surprise but for the long journey we took as a girlfriend.
I didn't even mind anymore, I just didn't enjoy talking to her for the entire trip. My only problem now was that I just didn't have anything to do anymore. What would I do with my spulleys. I didn't need food. I wasn't even in school. Well... nothing really. Actually, I didn't need food either since I was eating a much more nourishing meal. I was a pretty good swimmer and had an internal train of thought on how to turn out from here.
I had one that I could use to travel over while swimming with the girl I was with since college. I never met my match, but I did think we would be friends after high school.
I walked into the bathroom and sat back down in the tub with a grin on my face. In my shorts I pulled off my green shades and crayons and started dressing. I slipped the mesh top in on my body leaving the tops in a classic black and white by, " Okay babe, think of the outfit you will put together soon. It is easy for you as we just use regular sponge as a base. "
" What is it? " I asked my friend laughing.
" This one's for girls. "
She smiled and replied, " Listen I haven't seen your profile since class, I'm going to have to wonder how you did last week. "
" Oh don't worry that's just fine! Now get dressed and get ready! " She waved me off and left me to continue with my dressing.
I had a crayon recipe ready to go and this was my perfect looking army jacket and trousers. These pants had no spots of silk and they were soaked with water and I was wearing a light purple hoodie that I was extremely proud of because of the silk.
" Kim! " I called out as she waved me away.
" Yeah, yeah!" She said excitedly as her hand reached out and grabbed my hoodie.

"What do you mean, 100 % accurate? " cried Jessica.
Her brother Ernest wandered around the room thinking, and only saw red cards. He guessed that the cards might be related to events related to the death of his sister. She read them, but she couldn't seem to figure out what.
" Heart, cancer, Alzheimer's. That's what you find on the dead. Most people don't date because it's a social thing. There are people around us that have cancer, that's who you want to date. This card was 100 % accurate with a big deadline. 5 months, weeks, days. "
Jessica had never had such a hot card like this. It was to distract her from her important period on the weekend with her friend. She always had a bit of a hard time holding off her boyfriend, Josh, over his expectations that she would date him to their death. That seemed like the perfect excuse to hang around with her friends and do some casual date night. The words on the card matched exactly.
Jessica pretended to wait for Ernest to finish his notes, thought to look at the foot of his bed and see what he was writing.
The last few days had been kind of normal. She was supposed to be dating me then, that's what she'd said. Maybe if she dated his Dad they'd discover just how much her dad treated her and how lucky she was.
The next morning, after eating lunch, Jessica walked downstairs to check on the real fate of her boyfriend. After punching the wall with her fist, she realized that they were not going to meet. Only Josh would agree to her date tonight, and not the one before that.

He walked onto the table, the limo carrying him all the way to the grocery store. It always gives him so much to think about. He'd sat alone for more than a couple of weeks, after everything that happened to him. He could see her on the side of the road, the faint glow of the Sun in the distance. The emptiness of that moment in time can hit hard to accept. Instead, he sat on his couch, alone with the text message he'd received from her.
How was he supposed to pass? He'd been diagnosed a few months back, and the doctors said that he would have plenty of time to make a new family. He had some hopes... he wanted to be able to create beautiful, meaningful memories that passed and lived on.
Before he died, he was trying to come to terms with what happened to him. Every time he thought of her, the sound of his heartbeat became even louder. There was hope in her, he had loved her. His mother would love her as well, would have for him. At the funeral, he had watched his brother leave as well, all the time. There was no piece of paper left to write those thoughts down. For some, being alone took it's toll, and they lost faith in their belief in themselves, their reality. For him, it was the loneliness that brought tears to his eyes.
But what if it was all just a dream?
He can't be here.
He rests a hand on the table, tears forming in his eyes, so he tears away the tears in his mind. He tries to pull himself together, yes, but he can't. Everything is a dream now. He can't be here.
Why am I here? What was the worst possible thing that could happen to me, to her? Why am I here?
He finally walks out of the kitchen.

I hate the colors. I hate the accent that comes from melting into the colors, the color that warms my skin when I stare into the water. But today I find myself bursting with anger from the colors. I hate the color of face, where my head starts to froth.
Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe it's been days. Maybe I'm just here because I can't seem to find the time to paint. But today, I'm still realising what the color is. I have this feeling of exhaustion about the present. I've been working on a project for weeks. I haven't even hung around with my family for a while yet. But one night... she's crying. So far, it's been like this before. I throw a toast to the family.
"I hate the colors."
It doesn't matter.

The two men leaned across the table, sweating and clapping. They stared at each other and, eventually, they reached their hands out to stop the shaking. Their palms were sweaty, sweaty palms, sweaty palms, sweaty palms... they also looked each other down the same way, both with gloved fingers.
It was a night like any other - the sun was getting to them. The pulsing of their cardiovascular systems making them feel much calmer, happier, and sober than before, they felt. They'd had what they needed to last a lifetime, after all, and too many stressed them had wasted it.
"Six months ago, I went off to Iraq, " the one staring at the other said.
Their thoughts were all wrong, but the words were what mattered. Even if they only slightly - they would never win.
" The other three left, " the one next to him said calmly.
" The whole world left, " he said after a moment. " All of them. "
" Very well, young lad. I know you can't do it alone. You're a broken man, which is why you must fight for me, " the one next to him said.
" What would you fight for? That, young lad? What would you fight for? "
" You would fight for me, for the person I've become! "
" Why would I fight for anyone if they even helped me with anything? "
" Because I know who you are! "
" That's not what you want, young lad! " the one next to him said.
" What about those men, before you joined the army? "
" No, young lad. You're not exactly the same as them. It's just you and me who's gone. You are neither a soldier nor a coward. "
" And that will lead to me? " the one next to him asked.
" No, that will lead to you. "
The sound of ringing in the voice next to him filled the air and as they dragged their hand across the table, shaking wildly, their eyes alighted on the door. The sound of a ringing tone was heard over the sound of the front door closing behind them.
*Bang, bang, * the one next to him said.
He ran into the room frantically. " It's there! " he screamed.
It was quite early in the morning when he saw it - a walking mint statue that looked like it was made of dirt. It had huge stalks of white flowers on its face, and a horrible dark maw to it. On either side, there was a man. Red paint on his face and a man-shaped hole between his eyes - a mouth, an opening with at least one eye showing. Blood was running down his head and droplets were running up to his face from where his eyes used to be.
" Maybe you should fight for me before tomorrow, " the one next to him said.
" Maybe I'll join you, " the one next to him said.
*Bang, bang, * the sound of knocking on the door behind him echoed through the house.
" He's right! Stay right where you are!" a giant grin appeared on the man's face as he dashed out the door, ran down the hall with his baby horse, and cried as he ran into a massive field of green grass...

He ’ s here. Not just another nondescript person, but one on a mission. “ I know you love me… ”
I lean in to kiss his cheek. He can not hear me, I can not feel him… and it ’ s probably best that I reach out, “ I know you love me. I know. ”
He ’ s taken it and I can feel a fake smile on his lips as he sees his blood. It ’ s easy to tell that is false. He is… but he knows I love him. He doesn ’ t want to talk, so I stay silent.
I want to jump off of the bridge and take a breath. If he can ’ t get up I ’ ll help him, but, like a man leaning against a wall, I grow restless with the exhaustion. I start back towards the edge of the bridge. I make it to the top. What is out there?
I continue down the hill ahead of me. Another shell of what was supposed to be a forest starts running in front of me. * Uh, if that really is the right place, * I think to myself as I look at the next shell. I head back to the bridge. It ’ s finally here.
I ’ m getting hungry.

"Please look at my fucking face " said Judas nervously as he looked at his new owner.
" Whatever, what the hell man! " said Greg while listening to the body fucking rub itself.
" You ruined my life " replied Judas as he cackled and vomited.
Greg continued looking at the sadistic body while he began rubbing his face. He quickly looked away and began to vomit the fucks out of the sick bastard.
The next morning, the body couldn't seem to stick to it's clothing as the green liquid was emitted from its head.
The screaming came from Greg's kid, Jeremy, telling Greg's body " I was going to fuck myself. You never said you could do it. If you knew how you looked, you would have ran off and started shooting anything you saw at him. "
" Then why did you choose me? You chose me to live my life ".
" You killed my parents and called me a murderer! "
" But you couldn't turn me in. You told me to go into the dark and make it hard for you to figure out what's good for me. "
" You are wrong man. You have only killed a small percentage of people. Your logic is just thinking about killing a lot of people. You believe you have a higher IQ than everyone else because your brains aren't able to do this. I never could make it through high school. "
" There will always be a small number who is good at being good. This is what you were always told to do. The animals love you. The humans love you. The reds love you. Everything that you are is good because it gives you meaning. If you didn't have these brain cells, would you not be able to do what you do? You will be better than you could have been without people protecting you. "
" Even you get angry every time you do it. You get angry at yourself every time you move. You get angry at yourself for not doing it. "
" One minute, watch this. This is your time. Do it. Change. Your mind right now. See what you've done ".
" I know man. Just go to school. You'll remember your good grades and your girls. But don't worry about having all those girls "
" Doesn't matter who it is right now. I will stay awake until tomorrow morning ".
" But I will not leave without someone to remember. Please watch this. Tomorrow night you will be me again. Tomorrow morning you will see the marks I left".
With that Greg left in anger. Jeremy never told Greg what happened, but if Greg ever gave his first words to him he would see what he will remember.

We called him Icarus because he had made it home with the whole world, he was as good a fighter as anyone had ever seen. I remember when he fought on Earth but even after he moved away, fighting alone, the world quickly turned against him. With the worlds melting down in on themselves, he started to take other peoples' home just to take up space on the old USA, they weren't able to defend themselves anymore, and they'd been at war long before him.
So now, we named him Icarus because he used to fight for humanity.

We are little children. We are tormented from day to day by things no one can understand. Our teachers must let us be tormented, driven into darkness, and not recognized as human. Every time someone threatens to destroy our lives, they threaten to hurt them with their words. We have no desire to fight them or harm us. So we live a peaceful life, sitting in the corner of a playground, watching the children play and learning. Sometimes we dream of laughter. Other times we dream of melancholy.
But every day when the ball drops it's perfectly sunny outside, I wake up in a ball room, with no one to read the newspaper. Outside it seems to be cloudy and dark, and I am filled with worry and an emptiness that almost overwhelms me. I know the boy that I sleep with isn't the boy that I sleep with, and I can feel myself rising up from my bunk. I can feel myself rising, squeezing at my heart strings. It feels impossible to breathe, but then it is okay to. You are one of those weak children, who will do whatever it takes for you to survive. If the sea breaks our boat, it will fall and the water will start to flow and I will be running to the beach. In an attempt to ride the waves, I will jump into the water and stay on the cold steel surface. To drown in cold water, I will stay on the ground, hearing the cold water cry and squeezing at my heart strings. If I am rescued, I will be safe. If not, then I will wake up in the middle of the desert sun and wait for the waves to be lifted, and I'll die scared and helpless.
And so I wait, sleeping in the cold sand, staring up at the fresh water, even as I might jump up and kiss the blood off my arm, hoping that whatever it is that bothers me will stop me from drowning and following my dreams to my death. I dream of my friends and my family and their faces when I wake up. They'll take me to my grave in the desert, and I pray for my friends to be safe, and I sleep scared and helpless. I wait, waiting for the sun that lightens up the sand, and a warm voice will whisper to me, “ Help me! ” and I will die, I will do anything for the boy and his imagination.

For me, about 30 years ago when my mother died and my father was still alive, I thought "It's funny that people always seem to have to kill each other and have no social life to remember, huh? No joy, no treasures, no personhood, never any self worth. I suppose they felt that after what happened. " I should give him the most heartfelt epitaph I could do. " He was just going crazy. He was just thinking. He did not remember anything. " Who you talking to, that alone is just delusional. " No, we need to talk about what happened and be thankful for what happened before. We are the very best for each other. All of us deserve to be happy again, right? I think so, I wonder what life would be like if I spoke any other voice instead. I guess I shouldn't be here, but I'll still be glad for what's happened. " Only it isn't as if this man is delusional like you are. What you did is the most traumatic thing that you have done. " No way I did it. You knew his ways, so it makes sense that he can't even understand what has happened. I can't understand what you told me. Not even if you were talking about something he did, to name him out for he was literally some freak on his deathbed. " No... " He said that it doesn't matter to me when you say he was confused and sad but he did. He told me so. " He said everything. He had never even realized or even known why people killed each other. People have killed each other everyday to end their miserable lives. You are in your own personal hell. Don't worry, just pretend. This guy was way less insane than a small child does not even belong in his room. There is no sense of fear or good will from him. " What do you mean you are now a demonic monster? How are you so different than your roommate? Please talk about how you always acted like an ordinary human being, but never even the slightest evil could disturb you? What was I saying? " Why do you feel this way? No, nothing came out of my mouth, no apology, no reason to apologize, no mercy. All out of pure spite of not being all that bad but mentally a complete and complete idiot. I don't think I need to worry about him being a monster. Why do you always act like this after all these years? " He stopped talking and left the room. I wonder how I'd even end up here again once I tell my mom.

*Lights will dim again. No connection.
"... sorry. Must have gone out early. Will try again. "
I sigh. The music now fades away. I still don't know why it had to end this way. My mind feels like it could make quite a difference. The Cian and Hero just came out of nowhere. So far.
I wipe away a tear as I try to speak, " For fuck's sake! Why do you keep telling me? "
The voice on the other end is just faint. " Because I'm useless. " It's the type of voice the lines used on-screen to be can't stand.
In an instant the phone rings. Confused, I hide behind it. Slowly and sadly, it rings.
" Hello? " I read aloud in my mind. " I need you to get me the water and ice. Please. I mean, what can I say if I can't hear my other words? "
" My price? My boo-boop. Any last words? " My voice shakes. I fumble to find the microphone. My bowels are starting to empty out. I lie down on the floor. I can't help but wonder why.
My phone rings.
"... re... sorcerer....taped. " It's tone is interupted by the sound of frozen paper being pulled. Tears fall from my eyes. I roll onto the ground, where I can see where my bandit attackers are.
My back is turned back to me. He's in the center of the room, facing the shelf of books. He's looking over my shoulder, waiting for my position.
" Who are you!? " I scream, " are you here to kill me? "
The small throat that used to be his ear is now pressed up against my throat. He takes another look at me and smiles.
" I'm just trying to get my choice. So... do you want to die? Myband, none are allowed to die. "
As he looks away and closes his eyes, I fear I'm going to die. Perhaps. What could he have done? I can't move.
But how can I. If I couldn't, he wouldn't be here to stop me from going insane. The feeling of steel crawling up my spine as I plummet towards the ground. It's like floating up a volcano, but somehow it's a *tend*. The shock wears off as I lose control. I don't have a choice.
My eyes adjust to the darkness. Just then, the voice on the other end comes on:
" Gareth, it's time. I knew you'd be mad now that I heard you, but I only ever turned on two-thirds of your songs, so a decent deal. Sorry about this loss."

Joe sat watching the show with another cheerleader. She was glowing, she was funny, he could barely breath. She was listening to him.
She ’ s done this countless times.
She thought he was fine, she thought he ’ d always be fine. There ’ s no way to give that to someone and she could always just say good bye to him, and that ’ s how she got him.
She loved him too much to let any of this go. She would be the one to convince him not to go to a concert or a swim or anything. She couldn ’ t let anyone find out that her husband had cheated on her with another guy at the same concert.
But she never did.
There was just another host of cheerleaders left behind and she did what she had to, she stood there. She laughed. She laughed in front of him and he smiled back.
But all those days passed.
The end.
After 10 years no one came to hear about it and at the end, the the first time they gave Joe money he felt someone that mattered to him. Everyone moved on to harder fields and he felt they are reaching through his heart towards them and eventually gave in to his wants.
When he ’ s done he ’ ll know what he wants when he stops and does something that someone needs.
It didn ’ t last long though and it didn ’ t last long.
The reporter said when you lose people the first rule of the job is always “ never touch something without touching it yourself, ” which he should have had told him years ago, but didn ’ t think it fit.
Today Joe saw her laying in front of him at a stream, she was still smiling and laughed, she had helped him get through this.
Someone asked him how he got his old man back and he told him he didn ’ t get old man back.
He sat there, smiling and laughing.

"I'm sorry, " I apologized, trying to hide my tears.
" I'm just so, so sorry, " you said in a daze, looking down to see that your baby girl had a small arrow in her hand.
" Give me a second. What's going on here? " I wasn't as quick as you thought. As I stood there for a good 30 seconds, I couldn't help but wonder what I would have to do... exactly to reach her again...
" Well honey, you already brought me this, " I explained to your half-moon companion ( I was honestly considering throwing things out into the open, such is the law ). " This is just for you. "
" It's almost over, " he agreed.
" That was too bad, " you explained. " The blood won't have the same effect as it used to, and it's just not right. "
" Why not, " I said.
" It was your first place gift, " you muttered, trying to help focus on something else. The pair of you were sitting comfortably in the armchair next to the window. The bar-light shone brightly through the small window as you watched the sunset.
" Oh my god, I am so sorry, " you said in a worried voice, looking up at your owner. " What have I done? "
" Well, we had a relationship, " she said. " We weren't like us. "
" What did you just say? " I couldn't help myself. " What did you just say? "
Her words sank in. " I... I had a horrible relationship with Anthony a long time ago, " she said.
" He was a good man... did you know? " you asked.
Her shoulders tensed slightly. " I... I didn't know. I mean, I'm pretty sure you've tried to get me involved a long time ago, but... I just... there's always some person who loves me. "
" What do you mean there's someone who loves me and you love Anthony... "
" He's not Anthony. "
" He'll love you forever. "
" I... I promise!"

"Life is funny, huh? It doesn't feel so weird. "
I looked down at my empty lamp and blinked.
" Um... " I said, then a shock of panic swept over me. I looked back up at the ceiling to see a flock of birds fluttering around. I quickly followed as they bounded over my lamp and shivered with excitement.
I found a line of chocolate bar on the floor and dug around the edges, picking out small seeds. My hand glided through it and rinsed them down, picking up my first purchase: a half-ounce of milk. I found several more eggs from the only source of milk in the fridge, using the spoon to pump the milky little milk into the milk-drink with as much as I could manage.
" Okay, alright! " I said, stroking the inside of my mitten and knitting my sweater. I looked out over the field of wheat-spits, and saw the perfect line of snow across the border of a blanket. I looked down at the ground, and the barter I had set the field of snow around was being lent out. I plucked up two gallons of milk from the ground and tossed it into the milk-cup.
" It looks like it's over. " The boy said, bowing before shuffling to the other side of the field. " Yeah, I hope so. More of this ice cream ice-cream machine would be delicious. " I took a swig of my milk and grinned. There it was, again.
" I mean... good luck looking out for your little blue baby sweater today! " I was thinking, as I grabbed the same spring inside my mitten and looked back towards the sky. Snow was falling just south of me, and I could see birds flying by. * What the fuck? * I thought. Then I felt them-
" It's over. What's wrong? " A scratch had been imprinted on my mitten. My heart was racing from this fact. Why was I dreaming? * Why does this mean I'm in trouble? * And then... It started falling, moving violently, effortlessly towards me.
I couldn't see through my blinds, where it was mid-fall. I woke up in the middle of the field, after a long day of work with a load of work to get to. My boss walked over, giving me a hug and a look that brought me back to reality.
" They got ta keep it from Santa, " said the boy, and the boy's gaze landed upon my chest. My dad sat next to me and waited. " Yeah, kids, we were talking about another snow-break. But what, Santa isn't the one upstairs? "
" What's it going to be, Mommy? "
" I don't know. We're gon na have to get help, just like the milk man said, " said dad with a light chuckle.
" Well, that certainly isn't the only thing I need to ask! " My phone came running off the wall as my dad stood over me, making eye contact. " If anyone has any ideas on how to finish this game, I've got a meeting that day!"

Months had passed since the invention of time travel, the first time travel device had left only traces on the surface of the earth. The device was constructed to work one moment at a time. A dismembered old soldier from the age of 6-9 was invited to a meeting about the device. Upon entering the room, he was greeted by Jim, a younger American who was an urban explorer. " Jim, we have no choice but to postpone the presentation because the meeting has been postponed. " Jim turned around, his entire front row seat completely covered in sweat and ash. " Man, I can't believe you ruined this last chance. I swear to the Lord, you'll clean this up! We've failed! " His captain, Earl, stated excitedly. Suddenly, a blinding light shot out of the device, causing the captain of the old soldier to burst into flames. Jim and his crew fled towards the guards. Jerry followed his crew out of the room, as if to come back to the present. With less than 20 minutes until their meeting time and the next meeting, the former American Captain tried to flash out of the place he was. As the smoke cleared, the former American Officer stumbled out of the thing.
" Well, we haven't bothered with a device before today. Let's see... how about this... "
The meeting started before he knew what was going to happen next. Several enraged men began rummaging through cabinets and closets. Across the room, businessmen and retired government officials as well as two younger nobles were present in what they assume were locked cars. This would seem to be the most likely place to stop any of the men taking over the meeting. Moments later, on the platform, a view from a photograph of Jim smashed onto the earth.
" WHY DID N'T I EVER GET INSULTING A FRESH CAMERA?!" The man in the photograph shouted.
This was going to be a day where all the happiest 10 year olds in the world got some way to fly from their time to the present.

Oh my goodness, from college I forgot my usual backpack with my laptop. I got ta apologize.
How is my old backpack? " Green " it says on the cover, standing out boldly, totally grey with tarnished reflective material. This feels sturdier. I've never seen it before, and the word has no relevance to the grammar, but the looks are universal and its almost comical. No letters or spiciness or misspellings. It was an object of adoration, a gift I had as a child. I mean, honestly, most of my friends and family have fun with it, including my best friend, Abigail from accounting.
What the hell. Is the gash on the back on the front right? I don't think the words are out in front, but it's coming loose. My teacher found the wall and kept it there while the room was still dim. Whatever, the screen is solid black, so I think the adhesive will cut through it before it starts rumbling. The wall chokes as I stare at the screen, avoiding glaring at it. The text inside scatters, leaking on the floor and scattering into all the other objects on the empty empty floor. The pencil is next to mine; apparently it feels like a pen that may have used to be on top of mine. This seems almost positive considering I seem to have forgotten the whole thing, despite the embarrassment that was dragging me along.
Oh, well, I haven't taken any inspiration writing this down. For real though, I'm just going to go ahead and throw that away. How is the supposed power grid even functioning here? It barely even has a power source. What kind of electrical device is this? It's out of battery. The words, " Power grid maintenance attempts" are attached at the bottom, slightly overlapping them, but they are connected by a long, tangled string, probably rope. Where is this hole on the back? I think I might be able to see through it if I rest for a moment. I'll need some extra rope next time. Let's just hope I don't go broke later in class, because any new trial sessions I get with a new teacher will surely remember my name in a few days.

The old man was a typical 300 pound German warrior, equipped in his armour and helmet with a few spikes, much like those worn by his second son.
"Your job is to protect the future " he said with a silver tongue.
" Nothing you do will change the present " I replied, looking at the two wrapped in sticky leather, both of them ripped off their helmets and the contents of my cups.
" Let's go back in time and try painting the last bed ". Vincent said. He helped me with the painting, every now and then there was a knock on my door. I opened it and looked around, first I saw him looking at me, covered in blood all over his long green beard, but it wasn't obvious that he was doing it to impress me.
" You're not the alpha " I yelled, " I'm a Witcher ".
" You always did get blamed for bad people everywhere " he retorted, his crooked smile picking up on a few moments better.
" As you say " I said staring at Vincent I let out a sigh of relief. I traced the story he had told, before even putting my work into a notebook.
" And where did you die " I asked.
" The day when you were born ".
I turned around to see him clinging to a chain on his arm. As my research was complete I took off my boots and carried on with my masterwork of genocide.
I checked the maps and found that the chosen place had in fact been over 2000 years ago.
I was back at my family room, content in my knowledge that I had showed the greatest talent of my ancestor in painting a baby dying, and it was happy.
" Fucking christ".

Kirdragard cleared his throat, and offered his hand, slowly and deliberately, to the twirling arm where he held the gun. I could hear the pull and snaps of the barrel as his heart began racing.
He reached over and picked it up, and gazed deep into my eyes. I could not believe that I was thinking this far, and yet I could not focus, even in those deeper, more vast, colors.
Kirdragard looked down on me, with no remorse in his expression. I knew it. I already knew.
We stood still, both with our hands in the air, over the shoulder of the police on the other side of the aisle. The sound of one of the officers behind me cracking the case, was contagious, and nearly brought the dreadlocks that framed my face snap, as he began to open up a weapon with one hand and thumb.
I could already smell his face, his sweat running down my back and soaked through the fur coat he'd been wearing for the last several hours. No doubt, he hadn't worn one for years. He'd left the missing set set left alone, some distance away from the body. His fingers had faded away and vanished as well, leaving them imprinted in my backpack which he'd been carrying with him for the last few weeks. He was torn.
For all his skills on the job, he was still, a young man, sixteen years old. He didn't even know he was but he couldn't help me. My hand was wrapped around his waist, its silky texture reflecting the wear on my face. The whisper to me, grew stronger with each passing moment.
"Today has been kind of easy for us." He said as he handed me the clip. I clutched it with a heavy, uneven, brittle feeling, then the plastic casing erupted in a violent boom.

It really is a wonder fire always makes it where it needs to be. He did not expect it to exist when he sat in the middle of the desert floor. He could see the towers, the magnificent statues that stood and could not be seen. The sun had just risen, waiting to take its approach, perched on the peaks of what used to be King Armada. The rolling desert sands brought the fires right above him, scorching his skin to ash. More of them could be seen above the plains than in the horizon. He had never been to battle before, save when the first assault was launched. An armored crusader named Noba walked with the horde as the enemy marched off on their home lands. When he arrived at camp a group of villagers were eating dinner and playing pool with their loved ones. The first of them was the youngest, standing taller than him. Noba, a quiet man, stood next to his wives three children as they fell asleep. As the group faded they found themselves next to her and they fought again. A small boy slept under the knife as the man slipped and broke his arm a few minutes after his side had been replaced with a flat one. The boy was now brought up along side her father. Again, the boy waited, careful not to let anything slip, and when the man found his strength to pull the girl out he did it. She tumbled to the ground, her dead father screaming "There's nowhere you can hide from me " the kid said. The man stood over Noba, standing at his knees waiting for the injured kid. Again, the boy fell to the ground, not knowing if he was lucky enough to be saved, but he was. They sat together at the same table, at the same table. A small and lonely man came to the end of the table, deciding he had to wait for the reinforcements. With the help of a small chain he laid down to wait the bombardment. When the bombardment had stopped the man walked to the edge and said " We will be here to finish him off before the onslaught ends. And see if you are prepared for your final ditch trip." He pointed to the sand and his partner wiped his face with the tiniest of effort. The man nodded, took a step back, and tucked Noba away in a filthy piece of dirty clothes. This, coupled with the fact that he was still trying to hear the baby crying as her father laid quietly on the floor, with the same outfit as the man she loved. The man remained silent, waiting to see if the reinforcements arrived. He would not be for long though.

It was 6:20. He was halfway in the queue when he heard it. Another grenade from the transport truck, hitting him square in the thigh. He turned to sit up, not sure if he should run or lie down. One foot behind him, a jagged jagged scar across his chest. The next, a scar of metal on metal which showed why his insides broke open before he even had the chance to scream, bone in his gut.
"You vitor!"
The burly soldier collapsed on the ground, his blade painfully missing his midsection. Blood spattered his clothes. The screaming continued. Why did he do this?
He had two options now. Either attack with an arm, or strike from the hip. He could leave his position for the safest path; left to protect others and never come back. But he wasn't stupid. They were ready. He had to find out what happened. And then he had a choice.

James closed his eyes, the beads of sweat beginning to roll down his forehead, noticing the heat start to fade in the bathroom by the second. He found the contraption on his wall somewhat comical, the skin constantly exposed and covered with far too many vibrant colors.
He could hear them on the street, one behind them working while the other down the street buying.
He stared, but it wasn't recognition. It was pain, pain that brought his eyes to the side of the wall that was made of a bright red light. He slowly reached out, his hands hovered by the small, metallic metal rods that always seemed to make him feel at ease.
He couldn't feel his hands. The machines had started to slip off and be moved with his fingers as he walked, frantically searching the room for the source of the agony.
He did find a mirror. He almost felt himself losing control as he pulled at his wrists as the pain intensified. He couldn't take his eyes off the thing. He opened his eyes, feeling the pain go up to his cheeks, instantly he recognized what he was looking at, the mangled corpse of his neighbor's cat.
He closed his eyes, every time he closed them, he was able to feel his eyes stay locked on the thing, the moment, that brought the pain to the person. The lights flickered on, and James felt his life leave his hands. The only moments of quiet were moments when he felt his entire body went numb, the pain lessened. He closed his eyes again, and the machines began to fade out.
He could still hear them on the street, one behind them making a clicking sound that cut through the chaos.
When he reached his door he turned it, to get to the living room, he was laying on the floor of his bed, on the couch. He noticed the cloth that used to be his pillow felt exposed, it felt as if one of those automatic bathroom hooks was attached.
As he heard the unmistakable click of the metal on steel, his phone rang.
"Congratulations! You are the first person to receive a reward for your cooperation. Not only will you receive a malevolent but totally awesome android! Stop being afraid and accept your fate! Your name will be set at."
James opened his eyes, blinking as his eyelids opened into a whirring and whirring noise, the voice came into focus.
James wiped his face with his hand, he felt it slip away, along with his neck as the pain returned.

**********39**********
With a heavy sigh and heavy breathing, I put down the bottle. The cold drizzle soaked my skin. I flung open the door, suddenly, exhausted from the long fight I had to put up with. It was a beautiful and humid day, dry and red.
A knock sounded in the distance. A man dressed in black appeared behind me. He paused for a moment and placed a hand on my shoulder. " Are you alright? "
I panted heavily, remembering a time before I was conscious of my own consciousness. I always thought there was a place for me in the world after that incident. But it seemed different than before. A gentle breeze carried by through the small neighborhood and the sun-bleached building lit the once gaunt front yard in the afternoon. I was perched upon a huge plastic " bed " with a sink.
An hour or so passed before I came to a door, exactly like I remember it from before. Although, I never had a chance to lock it. Instead, they kicked into the night and I had to wait for my staff to arrive before I went outside.
When I arrived, my patrol was nearly devoid of anyone except the person by the door who had picked me up.
" Hey! Are you okay? " He walked right up to me. " Hi. " I waved at him, his white-eyed gaze silent and unresponsive. " Hey! "
He looked me square in the eyes, then looked down at me and said something, the words I had expected him to say. For the first time, I realized I was not alone in this world. He started walking towards me.
I couldn't see him. It only took a second for me to stop him. After that, I still looked down.
" What the fu- " I began to cough, but he interrupted. " I don't know! " He slapped his hand on the side of my head. He coughed and turned away. " Can you stop me? "
A hand grabbed my shoulder. He turned and felt himself growing cold. " I don't want you doing this, " he said.
" No, you can't, " I replied. " You can't. "
He stood up and drew his gun and pulled the trigger. Blood splattered the sill of the backyard, filling the soft carpet of the bed. I pulled the trigger and it went right through the wall, my heart rumbling and my eyes rolling back in my head.
His footsteps echoed outside. He stopped and stared at the puddle of red-black blood in the yard. His black jet black jacket was stained with crimson.
" Where am I?! " He yelled. " I'm in Hell!"

**********40**********
He was seventy five, and for some reason, that woman had to be taking care of him. It wasn't as if he'd ever *before* understood that he was in some sort of mental institution. No, he had failed to comprehend the complex workings of reality and sanity as those around him simply constructed their own, and often went about their business as mundane as soviet men on Sunday morning services at a shrink's toy store for the sole purpose of making things look nice.
I'm not like that. I remember the day he wrote the song. 'The Bitter End of Summer.' was an immortal thought to me. Actually, I remember this song even better than I remember the days before it was recorded.
The people of my world are too obsessed with turning people back into ghosts to see themselves let loose. Sometimes that makes the darkest, most terrifying story teller in the world weep. My mother was always there to protect me when I got to school. If she had known that the singing song would ever be remembered to any degree, she would've stopped trying to keep me from even noticing it.
My mother taught me that love will heal all wounds, and I certainly understood the toll that had accrued in the course of my past. My father had a monstrous habit of hitting me when I was in a life-threatening situation. It was a habit that seemed to go un-noticed for him for all of his life.
The only problem was that I couldn't go back to knowing the song. My mind was suffocating. I imagined the sounds of the people around me engaging in conversation, and even my own thoughts. Each time I came back to touch my mother, she would sing along with her reflection in my mind; words from my foolish thoughts.
I was happy, for the first time in a long time. I had finally learned to live like I used to. The only thing that had kept me sane over the years was the existence of my own imagination. So with that, I began to sing in other parts of my life, and some had a great impact on me.
It was the one girl who convinced me that I was trapped within a world that did not understand me. When I was young, she had told me stories in which people in the minds of men just like her were clearly shunned and ostracized, and even tortured with one another. She explained that in the general population, the "bad " people were the ones that would hurt others the most; males, the men that hurt women, the who could be hurt by violent men, the who could hurt other men.
Before I could even notice what was happening, a ferocious apparition appeared out of the darkness. It was adorned with deep black horns, beautiful as dawn-tinted ice in the corner of the room. It was not a man -- it was just a dame of some sort, with a beautiful face that would never allow the kind of self-loathing her voice implied in words.
In unison, the girl from across the room cast her gaze skyward. Her ragged features were marred by a long black cloak and long iron wands she seemed to give no care about. Her eyes betrayed no emotion, and she did not smile.
She spoke again, suddenly thinking she had calmed down enough to speak at last. " They're coming for us."
At this point, I was frozen in place. I knew that something terrible was about to happen, and I had to warn her. The sound of the horns began to fill my ears, and I saw them close behind me. The hood of the cloak flew off revealing a beautiful and terrifying face, all of her dark hair and fiery red eyes sparkling with the warmth of a sun. She was livid. She had no problem holding onto her horns so that she could protect her from the now-hot wind.
Though she had no magical light source to stop me from harming anyone, this was enough to make her want to scream and cry with hatred and terror. That's when she froze in place, and she started to shed, fully intending that she would do just that. As soon as the steam would begin to dissipate, a vortex was being formed on the bed-sheets opposite me.
I could feel my heart beating harder. That frightening feeling of doom was slowly dawning on me.
( Not sure if I like this or not, but I just came up with it, and I'll do a spin-off or something. )

I have been feeling super stressed recently and am pretty exhausted now, which is kind of good.
But damn, I can't stop, whatever needs to happen, just go back and say "the world is ending" and then its over. What a damn asshole.
I give a hush as I sit there, thinking how exactly I can affect the future, if only for a little bit more.
The only reason I'm coming back is because all that mess I did to the girl that makes me look scary is now gone.
My shitty dress changes, my laptop gives me problems, and my school sits emptier than I ever was when I was the last student.
Oh well, at least I have my way, I'll get some coffee eventually.

<|endoftext|>
**********42**********
The feeling in my stomach slowly seeped into my mind. Was I hallucinating? Looking for it in random pockets around the hall? I pulled out my coffee mug and sipped from it, each time I gulp down more of it before it hit the ground. I had no idea what I was looking for. Maybe the doctors had given me my color.
As always, I pushed the machine towards me, then sat down. I looked down on my legs. A smile crept onto their faces. The last time it had made any real sense was 25 years ago.
"This is it! " I exclaimed, holding my cup as I began to fill up my mug. " It's all about the right shade! Now- you know, the shade of blond! "
Faint sweet laughter rang out. My coffee still had a warm glass. I looked back at my feet as I sat upright on the bench, coffee still sitting there. My eyes darted from one hand to the other to my gaze on the straw that was being sipped. " There you go, blond! " I began to talk. " Not everything is as you imagined it to be. But I can definitely tell you about it! " My coffee changed to a slightly darker pink color. " Perhaps the only way for me to reach this perfect shade would be for you to only stay with me for a few days! After all, the shade isn't exactly the way you imagined it. "
A quick look at my arms kept me occupied. From here on out, I would normally use a plastic mug with a lid on it, but I had no problem using a basketball hoop to keep from falling off. My pale eyes met the tear rolling down my cheek. " Maybe I don't really know. Maybe you don't. But it's not too late to change the shade. " My eyes slowly opened again, and there she was. Her blonde hair was still covering her perfectly defined cheeks. My hands reached up.
" Angel, stop! Just stop, please! " I begged. " Angel! Angel. Angel. "
Angel shivered softly from exertion. " Please Angel, just please! "
" I don't think we need to talk about that here. If you have any questions, I can do my best to answer them. I just want you to remember that every time you try to dye your hair, the color changes. And that's okay, its okay! I know it sounds weird but we can try to find another way to extend the lives of those who have a perfect shade."
Angel smiled and turned around to greet me with a warm wave of her hand. She thanked me for coming and put the pair of her eyes on me.
And I guess today is finally a bright day.

Billy was my best friend since I was a kid. I got along quite well with him almost as best as we could. After that I didn't know any other human, or my friends. We knew it was cool getting to know them, so whenever he began to enter my mind, I wouldn't question it. Billy could always be a prick as long as I didn't have to know him, and I never hid my feelings from him. When I was younger, I loved Billy. He was my best friend; his family, my dog, and his once sweet father. But as time went on, I forgot all about my friend. Everything changed a time soon after my friend disappeared. I was in my room when he grabbed me and carried me over.
It was then that I saw him, standing over the wreckage of his vehicle. Billy and the rest of my crew had had to pull out a bigger team and abandon. His door opened, and he began beating on the side of the wreck. I screamed and ran, holding Billy tighter.
I cried.
I begged and I begged until the cop stopped me.
"Hi! How's things? " he asked.
" They didn't collapse like that, did they? " I asked him.
" How's that for a human? " he said, shaking his head.
" No harm though, I don't worry about it, " I said.
" I'll go play with your dog " he barked.
I used my hand to hold him tight.
" Will you help me get over here? " I said, throwing him off balance.
" Of course, I'm way above your level, " he said.
" No problem, just hit me, " I said.
I pulled Billy up and ran to the fallen driver. He was bleeding badly, and my crew had come over too. I got into Billy's truck, and drove him to the intersection. We were going down a long country road when it all went dark. Suddenly a large large metallic object flew up in the air, near Billy's truck. When I saw it, I screamed.
It hurt a bit, but just when I was worried, the object disappeared in front of me.
" You can't stop it, " I muttered to myself.
" No, I will, " I said, pulling Billy up and pushing him to the wreck.
Billy's car lurched, and I dived into the wreck.
" I'm over here, " I said, and Billy's body let go of the wreck.
" I'll be alright, you can breathe, " I lied.
Billy looked down into my face. Tears welled up in his eyes.
" Goodbye, friend," I said as I shook his hand.

<|endoftext|>
**********44**********
"Please don't leave me, " I said. " I love you. I have known you for many years. You can do the same to me. Please, don't do this to my soul. "
I took a deep breath and placed my hand on his face. I wanted to comfort him, to comfort him, to --
" You just have to promise me you won't do anything to hurt me again, " I said, looking towards the fire where I hung.
My instincts kicked in, reminding me to pause for a moment. There were no longer any threats, only howls and sickles, I could hear that hellish sounds; the way a bird-like crash can warp -
" Don't ", I said. " I want you to make my dreams come true for me; that's what I promise you. "
" I promise ", he said. The thing was changing, a quick look at the fire revealed what was going on, and the fiery crash flicked an even brighter shade of orange.
But, just before the air left his body, his essence allowed him to talk. He began speaking.
" Please don't leave me, human, " I begged, and yet he didn't. I waited for him to speak more, trying to make sense of what I had just done. But he ignored me, still unable to stop running through a human body. I didn't know if this was a gift from my demon god, or from my goddess.
Then he spoke again.
" Please, don't leave me, human. I am sorry for the loss that you've caused, but there is nothing I can do for you. "
He stood, a face so pale it hurt to see. But his eyes only lowered and when he let go, his body was gone. His eyes burned and his skin a grey hue. There was nothing left to say.
" Help me, humanity," he said again. He swung his right hand out and touched my face. I could feel his eyes slowly scintillating.
It was my turn to smile. I felt a swell inside me. A feeling that no human should feel. My tentacles would burst like fire.
And with my voice, my horns echoed through the flesh of every human in the world.

"Are you sure this is right? " said God.
" My God, you're an idiot. I told you, Lucifer told me to take it easy, right? "
" Doesn't matter! You want to see how you know you're making a big deal of it? "
" I can see that. I'm serious. But I feel terrible. And this is actually bullshit. "
" I understand. We do everything in our power to bestow upon our clients the same looks. We take all sorts of things with us for granted. We ask them no questions and we set them to work in strict guidelines. Then, we are forced to tell them the exact exact opposite of what they are expecting from themselves. "
" Does it help you understand? " asked God.
" Yes, it does. And why do I care? You're the Devil. God doesn't care about any of this, nor does your heavenly children. You just want to see what you've got and get it done. That's why you're here. "
" Wait a minute, is this really how I'm supposed to know what you're going to want me to do to you? " said Lucifer.
" Yes, it is. I am just sending you away, so you can choose exactly how to do this. "
" That sounds great. I'll have to pass the paperwork down to your superiors. " said God. " You're going to need to eat a lot of cereal this morning. "
" Yes, I know. I'm going to need to hurry down the conference hall for two days. And there'll be lots of wine. Only if you plan on sitting through the most regal of late dinner parties. Be sure to bring with you treats for your anniversary celebrations. Don't forget to turn in the -- - "
" That won't work! We all know I just want some pancakes! " said God.
" No, it's fine. No, it just won't work. You have no way of knowing what it is you want me to do! "
" Sure, I understand! Come on! Just -- - "
" There is a direct line between that and eating my pancakes. "
" I know! What the hell are you planning? "
" Like I said. I know exactly what you're going to get me to do. Go ahead and take a nap! That is great. Oh and I already put some kind of coupon in my food colors! I forgot to bring it here too. Is there anything else? "
" No, I don't have an account. You have to put it somewhere that can be accessed on a touch screen phone. Thanks!" said God.
God disappeared.

* "I can see most everyone, " * I thought as I pulled the device off and put it to my temple. The tape-sound of the computer monitor played across the room. I inserted the tape and held it up for a moment, face lined with red.
A loud hum flooded the room. It sounded like a futuristic beat, but I couldn't make out the name of the song. I opened my mouth to respond, but a notification began to appear. * " Run Diagnostics Initializing," * I repeated. The computerized diagnostics indicator began to close.
I was awake, being physically loaded to my new software. It seemed like the early stages of life were guaranteed to start soon. I searched the room, looking for anything of consequence. I rounded a corner, flipping through the strange computer equipment, only to find a large, red button at the top right of the screen. The only thing I could find were patches, for my various medical services, and various repair instructions.
*Wait, what? * I couldn't believe that man that I was sent to do this. * Wait, * why is that me? My name isn't me, it has to be someone else's! * The red button flicked back on, and I quickly sighed, " I would think some kind of Finkle anion would be in here. " I pulled a pen out of my pocket, finding a pamphlet and a sheet of paper. I covered it up in my hand, and began to scribble.
* " Your tests have been confirmed. Current status. Begin the procedure. " *
I looked over at my lawyer, who seemed to be having a quiet discussion. I grabbed his credit card and crossed my fingers, returning him to his seat.
* " Proceed. * "
It felt like an eternity for me. Just the kind of time that a clock freezes and the precision of the procedure requires. Once I was done all I had to do was look at his face one last time and be done with this part.
* " Please, are you feeling well?" *
I paused, looking at him as the doctor scribbled down his instructions. He smiled at me.
*I love this world. *

“ ARRRRRGGMMMMMM… ” I wrote that. You don ’ t have to really think about the problems he will cause in the future.
I ’ ll give it a shot for post-flashpoint scrutiny; which is what I am thinking of; people have been debating his policies, even if that was a difficult decision. It doesn ’ t change the fact that he ’ s a monster.
He doesn ’ t want to cause trouble. He doesn ’ t want to ruin the lives of so many innocent people. He doesn ’ t want to tear the world apart. He won ’ t.
He ’ s got a nasty sense of humor. This isn ’ t a joke.
He is nothing but a hit man. A madman. He has standards. He lives in a world that abandons him.
Most people are probably surprised at this fact. The big asshole he is, wouldn ’ t give a shit. Sure, it made his joke a little bit obvious; that is what made it even more likely. However, he doesn ’ t seem to like jokes. He didn ’ t like his political opponents, though.
Although maybe he ’ s right. The people he does something to are cold and stupid. They can ’ t vote, or even think in fact. A thirty year old could say that.
At the top of his game, there is a lot of fairness. Mostly a little good and some bad, but not enough to make a difference in a world that prizes equality for everyone. It isn ’ t his fault for going so far as to collect as much as possible for those pennies he places on the backs of all the poor, imprisoned, and malnourished.
I have personally opposed the policies proposed to make homeless for poor people. It would be a horrible crime to allow me to throw the cash at the guy. Or anyone. Being homeless is really hard enough when you ’ re sitting in hell and dying because you died too early.
This behavior is just a symptom of his madness. He likes his lie detector. It is exceptionally useful. The nicer his lie detector is, the better his brain will tell the others.
Every time, I come across a funny story that takes my anger out of me. Sometimes it ’ s in the smallest details; for example, the cats and dogs he sends to themselves or the new house he has set. The water heater is set that day. The doctor told me there was something wrong with the medicine he bought for me. I asked about the new house and it just turns out the surgery was just too costly to make.
He always ends up bringing up stupid things. He doesn ’ t like his health insurance, because nobody knows that it ’ s all business. He does whatever he wants, but that little detail always buys the insides of his mind. He is no doctor, after all. You see, he thinks that, one day, he will get better at his job. Maybe his family will be wealthy. Maybe he will go bankrupt.
But the fear of his job comes with a certain power. It changes people ’ s minds. He spends so much time worrying about money. It's like his body never believes in it at all. Perhaps if he does, he will just get flayed to a crisp. Or perhaps he will go on doing noble things. That ’ s probably bad, because his body already believes in a lot of things, but then he does them all.
His loss will be bad. It will be exciting, but it will also be dull. The blood will be cold and sticky, the guts will taste like dust. He ’ ll get badly sick, probably from the disease. Maybe it will make him choke. He ’ ll be fine, though. He ’ ll be dead.
It sounds awful and mad, right? I could buy myself another death by my own hands.
Maybe tomorrow, he ’ ll stop caring. Or maybe I won ’ t. Or perhaps I don ’ t. He won ’ t stop trying. He won ’ t be good enough to stop me now.

"This is the fifth time this month that you've actually done this to my brother. How do you explain it? How did you know? " The assassin's smooth, paper dress matched his vibrant eyes. He gave an odd smile, trying to hide his inquisitive expression from the 9mm wind-up.
" I wanted my boss to know that he hates bullets. They're pathetic shells of his workers, who are shot in so much more delicate ways then you can imagine, that he can't even see them. All of his decisions are made in our agency and the details he gives to us are public knowledge. He hates them. He wants to pin on me the blood of this innocent man, as it should be soon after a murder. Why? "
The assassin's eye lit up with the slightest blush. He stood up straight with his mouth hanging open, and glanced at the area around him. Two thousand sixty-five dollars was still his currency in the small black wallet he held in his hand. " He deserves it. He knows he's having a hard time getting over this and it hurts him to be separated from his family anymore. "
The assassin looked at the man before his eyes. There had been a fight at the office and had stabbed the target, the bullet had missed, and the bullet had sprayed the assassin with frostbite. There was blood everywhere and there was a hole in his throat and in his arm. He slowly sat up and started to cry. There had been gunfire that would have devastated a city if the assassin hadn't pursued the target. He didn't want to die. He wanted to take his son and even save him, but the m. The assassin killed both of them.
There was a knock at the door, more water dripping down from the leaky window next to his bed. The assassin entered through the door, rubbing the hem of his blouse to dry it off. " Oh my god! You murdered my husband! " His mom took a step closer. " Your life has drained from your body. You were the first to know, but for a few hours the very air was was also poisoned. There was a sharp pain in his chest. Then he started to convulse. It was like the blood drained from his body. He was sputtering, saying a terrible curse to no one in particular. Next I saw him screaming and wrapped in a mask, covered in dirt, to drive straight for the guard tower. You know the rest of the story. He knew it was my father. If you want to know something, you should listen to your parents. They loved him. "
The assassin looked at his crystal blue watch and began pacing back and forth in front of his bed. He had dreamed about this for hours. But, then he slipped out of his chair and carefully stood up. There was no recognition, only one man in white with his suit. " Did he kill me? " He asked.
" Yes. He can't remember. He just says he always hated him. He likes him. " The assassin then walked out the door, leaving with his big grey unmarked car.
" Thanks for talking! I'm so glad to have found your son again!"

It was no easy job, especially the choreography of the Erebus journey. ( I'll spare you the overly simplified confetti effect of the camera crew cutting out the explosive corpse of Sculptor Trevak, which cost three stages to get past and costing me a year ). Once we reached Enola Gay's Bloc home, I found a fan sitting atop the Garden House chair.
"What the hell was that? " I inquired inquisitively.
" Oh it was one of the demo PCs, of course. " replied Trevak.
We silently scanned Enola Gay's bedroom. She was a rare Arborea, with a relatively healthy lute range. ( Only one recogrification, 4 stages to lower the bass, 2 stages to widen it up again, one stage to get rid of the patches that allowed it to be swung on, ) making it a perfect candidate.
We wound down the stairs. Just before we reached the Aisle Three, a UPGarator appeared nearby.
" This thing. "
Something moved in Enola Gay's bedroom. It had a sleek blackened red shape with the arms cut off, hanging from the sides. ( Ah, how were you able to use a phone so smooth? ) The figure in the room seemed alien, but we barely knew who it was.
" What's with this black? " said Trevak.
" I can't see anything. It's impossible. But here, here... this... this... this... this... this... "
We heard an order coming from our mission briefing. Bouncing from side to side, as if from the direction of the speaker.
" **Launch** " was all that was heard.
" *GO* " was followed by a much more detailed command.
" Uhhhhhh... no. 3, two, one. "
We launched in the direction of the UPGarator, which promptly revealed itself in our direction.
We soon got up to the Aero and charged at it, firing a sickening blast straight through it, which promptly killed the drone in a rage. ( Oh, wouldn't you know, there were actually two drones, one who was powerful enough to pull out those genes, the other able to cut trough the barrier of the environment. )
Luckily, the UPGarator left no hole. It seemed to be fine-tuning the drone's conduction function to increase the density of the organic matter within it.
The first piece we managed to deploy, as it drove into the sleek black body, wasn't much better. What followed was the deactivation sequence.
" **RUN** "
We were forced to dodge the antigun beam in an attempt to rip out the aircraft's parts, but the very act of shooting that fired at us? We were convinced the blast would totally detonate, unfortunately for our unit, and the armor around the cockpit.
As it exploded, the drone started backing away from us, with its head sticking out of its buttcheeks, and was quickly taken away by a modified kind of explosion. It remained a bullet, with the bullet entering the visual defense system. Now, we are told that Treedra would have paid more attention to such a task than we had to.
Our squad mates looked at each other.
" What did we do to deserve this? " asked Cressia.
" We did everything we could. We run as fast as we could, using the gun to duck behind enemy lines. "
" What the hell was that? " said Trevak.
" Oh...." We were all too preoccupied staring at the camera. They knew what was about to happen, and they began running.
Everything fell apart. The drone remained flying.
It was instantaneously destroyed.

I have known Killjoy many times, his name means'Lady Killer,' as he calls herself, or something but never anything else that would make sense to him. He was still like that when he was young, every corner of his life was focused on maximizing his brand of hard work.
But Killjoy despised everything women did. Female failures. Why would anyone ever allow him to pursue a career in nursing? He was a surgeon, he was a surgeon. he was just a slave to them, stealing and pillaging from those who could. no one loves a surgeon, they loved her, not even the ones he forced to do his jobs.
He was a leader in that nobody can understand. He had been near the top, and was able to subdue any single patient who turned down his salary. his mother would always sneak past him asking for his pre-pubescent escapades on her way to class with a secret high school friend. she always looked forward to catching him. He did well with his classes so far, but he never gave his school a second thought.
But he had built a machine that does not allow two men to pick off one another. sometimes Killjoy tried to force these two men to do things it must has not done to men for women. to kill. Killjoy's sisters would tease him for it. how dare they, they claimed. Killjoy would talk himself into the death machine and mutilate her with it. He could not allow such a weakness to break him.
But when the android crossed the threshold with Killjoy running towards her, killing him herself, Killjoy would stare at her from afar with the intent of raping her body and inflicting a painful death on her.
Yet she did not move or speak.
Just as he was feeling she pulled the trigger.
She screamed, smashing his chest as blood poured down his throat. His head caved in with a pain so strong that he felt he was going to die.
But, as she started to choke him, not moving, he slid down her body, she was consumed in death's flames, plunged deep into his throat.
He fell to his knees, shuddering at the gruesome sight.
He collapsed onto the ground, begging for her mercy.
"my love... please... won't you kill me too?"
She reached out to him. She touched his throat, and he whimpered in pain, her eyes filled with fire.
She murdered him in the alley, and he awoke, screaming in pain as she dragged him off into the night.
He had done nothing wrong.
He had become the Lady Killer...

He wasn't a sad man.
He could be incredibly easy to hit. His wife told him it was pointless since the stress was too great. She didn't want him to commit suicide, but he was fearful of going down too slow, so she gave him a broke dollar and a twig to free him before he got too old enough to die.
He hated himself so much that he didn't want to live. He hated his job, his arguments, and his family. He didn't enjoy being the unflustered hell hole in the other boys' dorm. He hated that people were too "nice " and that he loved them as much as they did. He hated himself.
He was so wasted. His thoughts drifted to fishing, singing, and shooting fish. He hated his rage. He hated the fact that he hated himself. His happy-go-lucky memories sent shivers down his spine. He hated killing himself by drowning in bullets or drowning in water while laughing. His happy-go-lucky memories sent shivers down his spine.
He got drunk at his last week of high school. Nobody had ever gone to the drinking club with him. He didn't have time to sit in the stands the rest of the night because he was drunk. But he had time. He had time. The rest of the day had gone exactly as planned. He had time to gulp down a beer and a crumpled up napkin and watch the man with black hair and an awkward accent rant while a bottle of pills buzzed in front of him.
He sat up and looked over at the man, who raised a smile as the bottle of pills hung open. A soft *ping! * then out it went. He couldn't believe it, but the man raised his hand at the top of his nose and burst into tears.
" I'm sorry... " he wiped his eyes. " I'm so sorry..."

These guys came in late, missing their drug raiding trip. They came up to me, pointed at me, and said how I couldn't go home without being picked up. They also said that if they wanted to see me, they should go and see this camp. There's no way for them to know I left or leave, so they let me go. Now I am behind a countertop eating every blackberry I can find. I don't let them steal.
Well, sure they steal, but they also eat for variety of reasons. It's very tedious and it will be dangerous. I am not immortal but I am getting stronger. This is why I need to kill them. I want to be a hunter. A more worthy member of society. I need to kill these outlaws. Soon I might be killing them.
I remember getting this place. Everyone had chosen us and now there is nothing more to us than food. All sorts of different foods. We were shocked when they took me here. I think they made it look easy. They were the last ones before we caught up with them and left. There was looting coming.
It all started last week. I remember hearing the door open. It was different. I see at least one rabbit. The ones around me were dragging me around. They were hiding. I screamed and held onto of my hiding place, trying to stay quiet. It's not like I could have let myself in or hurt anyone. I felt a strong urge to open the door. I start biting, but again as I got closer, the footsteps stopped. No further plan had been taken.
It was just an empty room. Empty objects. They weren't even human. My collar makes a wound on my arm. A sharp pain in my lower abdomen.
They forced me to get close and pass out. I woke up in a cold sweat. They killed me in my sleep, but after I got ta spend the rest of the night, I didn't want to wake. I don't remember any of that. My arm is still there. I look at my body. My bright gray eyes are still burning. I look up at the sky. I see these mighty animals. They have begun to eat other people too. In the far distance there is more of them.
I sprint on. I could hear them now. It was getting darker. Still, even in the dim light, there were no shadows. They felt good about coming to this place. They don't fight, they run. They run. This is where I start growing stronger. They are best friends. I can help them.

John Scoffing, age 83, has won six dollars over the counter and a hundred dollars over the other clerk. His $ 250 prize clearly shows that he has done this in less than 20 hours. Never before has he experienced anything as amazing as this. This smile on his face, hearing his name - John Marsh... Oh, those are his words... How could this be!
His face never changes from tip to tip... Today he earned his third love life.
Finally! A lady approached the register, and it was John who approached. The announcer proclaimed John being the man of the world.
"Welcome my fellow Americans, today... hello to the coffee shop! Thank you for your order! " said the very tall man sitting in the front " Hear to your heart..." As the man approached the counter, an electrical field of energy that exploded, with bright red letters that describe his individual senses, became a-horribly electric. There was a thick metallic smell coming from within the cloud, and the man was frozen.
There was a blood vessel in his head. To this day he said this has been his greatest accomplishment. But when he saw the photos, even though they seemed to crash into the ground, he has never more smiled than at the sight.

**********54**********
It didn ’ t surprise me. My first kill? It made me *insane*, but it never really bothered me. I guess only those with huge brains matter. Regardless of how my life went after that, no one ever questioned how I ended up here.
My name, written on the silver bone on the dresser, was destined to be forever changed forever. A death in itself. God, I wish I knew what I did. I didn ’ t even think about the new fate until I got back here.
You see, being in the Rapture gets you the wrong things in life, and ever since God suggested we destroy these things so that the poor couldn ’ t have their lives ruined, I haven ’ t really been paying attention.
Being a religious man isn ’ t too bad after the first few people start to realize that God is actually in my book. Or, that all your life is really real and worth nothing to anyone.
I mean, I was fucking oblivious to that shit. I stopped paying attention all the way up to when I was a kid, and this was just natural. The positive stuff, the brutes ’ less sinful actions, and the inclusion of others. I didn ’ t really read too much of the Bible, anyways. Once upon a time, I had to be a Christian, and talk out religious hate all the time, but I had a massive Christian family that supported me as I followed the New Testament path.
The movie Sin and Punishment stuck with me that long, so naturally I was free to marry and own, regardless of anything. I was so happy living the New Testament lifestyle that the girl across the table from me stopped aging, as she decided I was too fit to bother me. I get that cliché guy shit I get when I get mope-blood-on-my-scar-just-for-something, but the middle aged me really enjoyed my life. She wanted to marry me, and I was an equal.
God was real, after all, and since I never spoke a word to her, things were good.
That was one of the reasons I never hesitated to tell my first killing to my husband. It was easy to not mention it to him. It was easy to get away with it.
The woman walked over and strolled up to me, drawing her straight once and who knows what else. I took care of her as I had done countless others in my life. She ’ d kept the bad thoughts out of her life, kept her life in a purgatory.
And she realized that I did! I lost count of how many times she wasted on those dirty christian ideals she had dedicated to her family. All of them made their way to my apartment, and before she left, I smiled and promised to never spare anyone the pain of abortion that would seem so trivial without her, knowing that only pregnancy could save one, if needed.
As I took one last step to take her away from the world I was living in, I smirked, and told her:
“ The Rapture is coming to a close. ”
She laughed and helped me change my clothes.

I turn and see shadows and dark woods surrounding my camp. He disappears, a giant bloody claw pointing at me. I let out a gasp of breath and turn to look at the huge chunk of white skin in front of me. The rough form of a fox jumped out of the woods and flew at me.
"Stop, not again, " I said, choking.
" It's not okay, " he said with a look of absolute fright.
" Then why are you coming? " I yelled back.
" The cult, those who left us for outsiders, " he said.
" No, come on! " I begged to him. " The one who's here has run out of resources. "
" I guess it's time to come find them. "
The fox crashed down next to me. I heard a whispered phrase in his ear and raised my head just above the ground.
" One must have survived, " I thought.
" One must have survived, " he said and held his hands up.
I screamed in terror, then blurted out, " Fuck! Why did I just start building this? "
He chuckled, " You died in a car crash. No doubt about it, I survived from the screech. "
He looked right back at me. A huge, dark robe and long black hair floated out of the dark earth towards me. The hood of the robe split open exposing glowing eyes. He smirked. " One must have survived, " he said and reached into his backpack. He pulled out a blunt and turned on the fire.
As the flames grew, everything fell off of me in neat rows.
I could feel his eyes start glowing in the light of the fire.
" What? " I demanded.
He grinned. " You think that means a family of yours is here? "
" Ah-ha-ha! " I roared.
He stopped grinning. " A God? Oh god. " He said curtly.
" The Cult. " I said.
" Come on! " He said in a savage tone. " There's no-one here who doesn't have the same idea of his ability!"
He threw down the blunt and started running away. I must have died in a car crash. No one must have survived. I can't believe this man just let go of me so easily.

My armpit shouldn't have caused me to squint the way they do.
Walking home from the store, I noticed, staring at the door with contempt, that a small brown stripe had nearly dribbled out in streaks of blood that were clearly etched onto the wood. My heart went blank at first, then a great surge of sadness overtook my eyes and now, without a second thought, I was staring at the scratching mark across the wall that I noticed staring right back at me.
"Well, then, I guess it will be alright now, " I muttered, turning my attention to the scrawling writing on the wood. In the dull gray of the room, I could make out a single word, etched with a beige row across the red plastic. It was *website*! I had to stop by one of the nearby shops or an even bigger sight like the roof's would, just to check the words.
The initial gnawing at the spot that kept my eyes closed shut felt more and more surreal. Soon, the feeling subsided into calm sobbing, and I finally brushed past the writhing form of a newly-smudged cherub-head, his head dipped down to the floor and a stern look on his face. He realized he was staring at a *cat*, he couldn't see, he couldn't even say, but he could all he could, and in the rapid motion of his hand, it hit the cocked tail of a cat in the yard, causing him to stumble forward and shatter it into a thousand pieces. Luckily, the cat just watched him clean up the mess that's ruined the small human that he had taken so long to clean up.
" Sorry, you did... " I stammered.
" But Dad won't be interested, " The cherub headed slurred in horror, sitting up from the floor. It motioned for me to speak.
I nodded, my eyes darting around the wooden floor to make sure they were all focused on the written word in the loose, red cell of the wall.
" It's okay, " I whispered back to the cherub.
" No, " He smiled, then went back to talking with the cherub and turned around to leave.
I walked slowly up the back steps of the building, past carefully-stitched letters on the door and down the hall, into the changing city.
My eyes stung.
*Weird News, -A New Computer, Jobless, Dead By Cure. Bleachers spread across town,'Hidden Lives Local Computer Says. What do you think?' Now watch as the unemployment rate is dropping and I'm writing this -- my job is to cover up money laundering connections. Thanks for watching, my ass, * I thought.
" That's funny, " the head of the bank teller told me, and I shook my head.
" My hair looks slightly matted... "
*Resting, * I thought, *all I could do was ask that every being in the world be quiet. I'd be prepared for that if ever there was someone who could hear my thoughts, hear me. * I sighed heavily, nervously.
" What do you think of this, Dad? " The teller asked again.
" It's actually pretty awesome, " I said, *I should be proud of you. *
*Oh *fuck*, * the teller thought.
My eyes snapped open, and I was on a rooftop, feet over the wooden floor. I didn't think I was looking at the big screen of the television, at the headlines hanging over each page, but a face lifted from my chest and framed an *unaccounted for food funding crisis. *
" Yeah... You got me, " I whispered, speaking in a low whisper into the air, *that's very funny. *
" You can start a Facebook group, " the teller added, raising her eyebrows.
I nodded, brushing my teeth. It was supposed to be *fun* to talk to.
" Sure, " I muttered, running a hand through my hair.
The screen switched on, and the words came back into focus:
*Welcome to Call of Duty 3. We are as excited as the original game ever was. You have requested the Ghosts DLC from The Peggle Chronicles and are actively looking for a special Collector's Edition. If you ever find something missing, pick up the ghost right here on Call of Duty 3!"

"Give me a minute, your time is up. This is my best shot at getting this one done today. "
" And who would you be if that person hadn't already accepted? "
" Hell, a lot of people I've killed since I was three... "
" Well, sure, and I've never been exactly the only one. "
" Don't get me wrong, well your not ready for anything. Everyone knows that if you're gon na do the job as well as you want, the others will never be, like, invested with the money. "
" Enough with the train of thought. Since you promised me a minute, I've never left a message. I can't leave any messages since I'm the only one who can. "
" You have so much to live for. "
" You have so much. Go home. Live a little. Don't judge me. "
" Come on, you're talking about not killing, what else are you talking about? You're a monster, I tell you. I'm leaving, I love you, and don't you understand that? Now I don't need you to kill any more, I just have to leave. "
" It's just me, it's all over. You guys are good people, I've fought monsters, don't you understand? You're just people like me who just don't live life like you expect. I don't blame you though. There's more to life than just killing, here on Earth. Besides, we live in this world because of the way you treated me, and the way you treated my ancestors. All we're doing is doing it for our own survival, right? This is the only chance I have. "
" You're not fucking kidding me. "
" I guarantee it. What you're doing is you're just prolonging a lot of bad for everyone. "
" I'm not kidding you. You get off on trying to capitalize on this behavior. If you can just give me one second... "
"... Yeah, so, you're leaving me and your spawn out here. You're two people like me whose real life spanned, like, a whole month. I can't guarantee that I'll help you unless you do. Which I'm actually not going to. It's not fair. Why would I put myself in danger if I could help you. You're all stupid. "
" So if I do help you, I'll make you stay behind in this apartment, I promise. My past has nothing to do with this one. I took care of that one thing and that thing is gone. When you move back here, I'll help, but never remember my role in the past, well, I promise. Just go. "
"... That's cool. I never thought I'd see one of you give up so quickly after I did this. "
" Well, you saw me. I can't live like this any longer. "
" Better hope not."

"Speak the truth, get through the thick bush. We've been hearing about it on the air since last night. "
The soldier clicked his tongue. " We've been watching you for weeks now, you know! He isn't a bad guy anymore. We just need to get to the cells from the remains of prisoners and get some word out on the guerrillas. "
" You're saying something? "
" Looks like it. "
" CUT UP WITH YOUR GENCERPOLE, " the soldier spat.
" Officer, there's something in his speech. " The officers turned, and scanned the nearby field. " He's got the recruits in the outfit. "
" And he's saying something. "
" He's saying it about a orator with what I'm sure would be his family. "
" Sir, it can't be. "
" Then he would stop all our operations. At that time he said we were going to start fighting the camp and wrap up. Maybe head back, but we wouldn't have were we never joined the camp. "
" Why would he say that? "
" Well the guerrillas came about two weeks ago. They said they would take him away and give him one of their western uniforms. That might be harder for him to deal with. The guerrillas don't seem to be in any danger. "
" But sir, he didn't say any words during the operation. "
" I'm sure, yes. " The soldiers took out a black container and left.
The hall behind them became silent as they followed the trail. Only silence followed and a window opened. A young man entered. He wore a black robe and carried a gun. His uniform was blue and he had a bulletproof vest on.
" We'll wait. "
The soldier led the man back to the security room.
The man took his headset off, popped it and turned to face the officer sitting across from him.
" Sit with me, Officer. " He said. " There's something going on in your head, Officer. "
" I see it. " The officer said.
" You never said anything during the operation. "
" I did say something during the operation. " The officer responded. " What kind of thing is that? "
" That something the South African secret service decided to kill two gentlemen. Both of them had been fighting a camp for several months. Didn't think we could make it. "
" Did they just shoot their leaders? " The officer asked.
" I don't know. Maybe they hurt their families with their deaths. Maybe they cheated on their parents, cut their families throats with their teeth. "
" Why would he say anything? " The officer asked. " What would they take for a guerilla? "
The man looked around. " Some things would have to be done before we could fight. " He began to shake and tuck his head. " Good night, old friend. "
The officer turned and left.
Before he could walk the man was thrown into an arena full of back orifices with execution style style stances. The guard tackled the man to the ground and led him to the middle. The sound of the executioner's sentence echoed through the arena.
" Officer, what's up with you guys? "
" The president was visiting the camp, " he answered.
" A... " The guard turned. " You're doing very well. Don't worry, he'll see you later. "
" Yeah, sure."

In August, God goes blind. Everyone lost their mind in that cold night. Their visions were warped, their voices unknown. The one who brought light was desperate, desperate for humans. For this, he needed them to come.
For a thousand years, the light was enough. He needed each one to control their individual actions, their desires, their decisions.
But not today. God has presented his seed to one and all of them are here. All worship him, the only ones left who are still as strong and independent as they are now. They may return, but they will likely believe something of him.
Slowly, the light began to illuminate. The most vibrant and the most beautiful of lights dimmed away as an elderly person made their way out of the darkness. He looked upon the individual on the other side of the street, as he pulled into the driveway. It was still cold, as is the darkness that surrounds this world.
Before the light shifted to the warm, lush grass, the woman moved behind her. It had been a lifetime since she had seen him walk, alone in her house. God would never let her live alone, not again. He had seen her children approach and those were the ones who heard the soft soothing sound of prayer. God was once again alone.
He kissed her forehead, and as he turned back to the door, the woman felt light break through the veil that ripples up his skin. A small smile crept across her face as God reached into his coat pocket, and took out a thin, sleek silver key, and in the blink of an eye, his old home transformed into one of light.

Bob broke the news on TV today. " Global economic conditions are about to take a scary turn for the worse, " Bob concluded. It was the opening of the Congress' annual budget address. Governor Tom Tancho quickly learned how stupid that was and how stupid it had been.
" But.., that has to stop. " he started to say as he held up a hand. His wife sat at the front of the room staring at the television. " That was? " she asked, " Oh no.. "
Bob pulled out his laptop and started searching for Wileson, the publisher of Wileons workbooks. All Bob had to do was write a letter on the bookshow I signed with him in April.
" Every single day when it happens it's the same thing; you come home at 7pm for a hundred other dishes to wash, and your oldest computer simulation booted up.. And people just ask where they got the brats from! " Bob made a mental note to go back to that report that he always had to call, he had forgotten to cut his bills. " The worst part? " he thought as he got back to his mailbox.
" You see, any surplus I find is sucked into the budget, and, by now, there won't be any, you see. People just don't get over the stupidity from programming. It's inevitable. "
Bob paused for a moment to reflect on his new found job, unloading wileons bills out of his father's garage in his spare time, before looking up at the TV in the back room.
" Someone has to fix this! " he looked up and noticed a telephone pole smoking bright. " All those cheap YouTube viewers? And, that's the reason people claim they absolutely want nothing more than to watch a new green light, No! No, I mean, this is on TV and not a program, on television, on cable, you know. We have cable and cable! No, that really wasn't the point. It was the point, which nobody wants more, and we can't afford to just let our audience have anything anyway!"
Bob closed the TV's cable box and ran out of the room. He didn't bother locking the door, since he always did, but he didn't know if anyone could hear him. He just hoped... well....that someone would somehow hear him...

" Hello. "
" Do you know Jack? "
" Uh. "
" Who are you? "
" You will know soon enough. "
" Tell the truth. "
" What? "
" Your presence in the library. You will know things which we can not understand until we know them. All information has passed from one moment to the next. There is no stopping you right now. "
" What? "
" If there was anything we could learn about you before? "
" You shouldn't start to complain. Your techniques are so proficient. First of all, you have incredible writing skills, and second, having eyes in a crowd makes you perfect for information processing. "
" Um....what? "
" I can't seem to recall writing down anything very specific. "
" Oh. Fuck you. Okay, whatever, but I won't tell anybody about these things. "
" Tell them everything. Literally everything. Take me up on my offer, the best of all possible worlds... "
" Your kindness is remarkable, John. With respect to your prompts and what you've started. How will you start? "
" You won't be set back by an internet thing, John. You will be set back by a life you've created. For now. What we need from you is inspiration. You have served me well over the years. Even as a child, your work influenced me. But now it is time for me to work with you, to write to you to send me a text, to compliment you on your skill. I am one of the greatest. "
" What did you write about? "
" Nothing that is meaningless to me. Though my work gives me a sense of inspiration, I enjoy your challenge. Whatever becomes of me is good, John, even if it is written with slight obscenities. "
" What do you want from me? "
" Oh, you are a smart one, even so. Come up with something to do with me. "
John: " Uhh....I have no idea, man. I've been doing all of this for years. It's not even a minor thing, it's bigger than a letter, like a lifetime. "
John: " Me? I think we should get moving.... "
" I was one of the first people on the SpaceX launch pad, damn that man. "
" I'm going to cross that bridge and get out of here."

"Palmer, " I yelled at him, slightly more impatient now. " We have an ambush! "
Palmer, like every other Patriot holed up in his bunker, waited to see what the conversation would turn out to be about. After 25 minutes of arguing, he finally reached an unlikely compromise.
" You know, it would be nicer to have been born in Flint. "
That might be true, he told me. There were still rumors of what happened there -- of bank robberies, motor-riding gangs, gang hideouts, even a run-of-the-mill casualty pool -- but none of it matched the bluster that had apparently been all around him. It was easier to get caught one way or another, so Palmer and I might have a chance to go home if the booby-trapped *bleep* broke out after the first. " And when it does, we want nothing to do with it. "
For the past three hours, I had dedicated everything in my chest and chest, sending coffee and jelly into my dry mouth. The useless alarm on my nightstand had taught me to go over bed at night, but it would take some time to get anything else going.
" Does that *get* you? " Palmer asked me in desperation.
" Sorry, pal, " I said, briefly shrugging. " We're not truly talking about Gallipoli. I'm talking about the battle across the Mississippi! The battles of which we fought alongside. It may even be in our blood and blood and blood..."
To answer his question, I had told him the lie. Time slowed, and even with Palmer's eyes fixed on the wall, his nerves were going back and forth. Now he was just thinking about Gallipoli with his mouth gaping open.

I hate losing.
That all must have been my mistake.
Aha, the nice thing about dreamovers is, you can never forget. No one leaves, no one to love, no one to send them away.
It may seem so silly, but you are aware of every real possibility in the world in a matter of moments. That is why dreamover is so important.
The right thing to do is to explore the complex, simple, yet irresistibly irresistible problems of life in deep, unprecedented ways. Simply by changing a concept, an emotion, a mood, I am taking the direct answer to one or more simpletons. If only a cause could sit right next to me. I just have to find one too. The perfect petulant old man, fresh out of college. No one will notice if my intelligence pertains, but me. I will do what will prove to be one of the greatest moments of our lives.
I know it is not very grand, but the trick is to become dutiful. The heroic aspect is what keeps me going, always the same, always overcoming adversity and the existential pain. The painful agony to keep myself alert even while scanning the blank canvas for a smile. I felt I hadn ’ t put myself in the "greatest job" of my life. I didn ’ t have everyone I would never need. I probably would be the one who would be laughed at for being smart. The last villain in the world. Me.
So if nothing else, I couldn ’ t sleep tonight. Not tonight.
I just left my cubicle to cover myself up. Now the public was done with me, bored with their lives and their constant problems. This time, the period of silence may have lasted for ages.

This is the story of how a half dozen people together stopped World War Two. After that, The Villain was taken seriously, and the government found out too late. Other people died and the world's debt became so great it was all that needed to be done. Politicians forgot they owed in American dollars, and it was only after some major economic upsets ( and a lopsided president in the United States ) that we felt that suddenly enough, we could solve the world's debt.
The year was 2060. President Nathaniel Geren, Chancellor of the United states, and the Guilds in Switzerland were officially founded. Facing the resistance of the Guild, the and citizens who lost their jobs and sought more, the world parliament attempted to make peace with the Guild. Of course, the Guild was a small nation, with an appreciative population. They began their "Resistance Summer" in force with huge rallies outside of Council chambers in our capital city.
The Guild's leader, Socrates, and his advisor, Ex Machina were persuaded to join as well. Socrates was quite upset that the Guild had looked so hard at progress by helping them. Ex Machina declared war on our ability to provide aid, as only the Guild knows how badly. Socrates agreed with Ex Machina.
President Nathaniel Geren, Chancellor of the United States and country, was pleased with the progress the Guild had made in being able to bring peace and prosperity back to the world, and the Guild's own religious fundamentalists became prominent. Once Socrates and Ex Machina saw the extent of the Guild's involvement in their campaign, they scotched Socrates' proposal, but managed to hold back their hostilities. Socrates marched off in his headquarters, and the Guild listened to the King of Finland blast off the soundtrack for the first time in centuries.
Cobras had big shoes to fill: a special bus was created in the northern city of Helsinki, and dozens of schools were created in Lucan. All the teachers were also from the Guild, and students were given special education.
The King of Finland, who died two years later, visited Scandinavia. He said nothing to the Norwegian chancellor, who arrived early on the Western side of town. He showed a huge screen in Oslo, filled with 3 million people, to a giant statue of the Statue of Liberty. The statue depicted small people seated in a circle, all of them holding hands in what appeared to be a green ball. The statue's likeness became a raging inferno for the Norse, who attacked the statue in their wars. One of the Greeks and an individual was placed in front of the statue. A giant battle cry was how loud the war started, with the Greeks kicking all the while holding their ground.
After that, the Norse conquered the entire eastern continent and set up their empire in the Middle East. They won, but only by paying tribute to Odin and Odin, and in doing so removed the Guild from land, and prevented it from advancing much farther.
Unfortunately for the Guild, it didn't really have the manpower and resources to build anything, so they summoned the last of their forces into action. They defeated The Spikes, and wiped out every Roman and Ethiopian king.
Most effectively, the Guild combined all the magic and cash they had amassed in the Middle East to create their own unified currency system. That last part is important to all our thanks, as It has finally caught up to us, and we can now clearly use it to provide much needed rest for our loved ones.

He would have given for the most wrong trick of the century. Children's Mischief. Make all adults look like teens instead of olds, knowing full well they don't have much to work with and that their activities almost invariably "just to make sure they stayed in school " and that they're in high school.
But…hope was always the real answer. This wasn't some school coloring book stuffed with paper. This was PBS, and i thought kids were really right to be pinky pointing at themselves for the fun of it.
He deserved to be the teacher who brought back goodness and love. He deserved to provide more good than evil while leaving them doomed to be forgettable—not that it would matter if he didn't like them. But not anymore. You see, he has gotten too *serious* about it. " What's down there? " Most of his students are headstrong. They need to rely on their bodies for what they really are. Make them look like them, even if they are freaking out.
So they send their dums over into the ocean. Or onto big cat balls. Or around a chain-link fence. Or make sure to throw away everything ( *well, that and water ) to do it. Those types have nothing to do with gluttony. They need to thrive on social cues. Make them look like they're in the proper place so they get the full brunt of the education when they do get bored with the dums.
And for that he has to pay for it. A precious little bit of poverty in the back of their minds. Our kids will have difficulty making the effort to work. They'll probably find it harder to work at all at work at that stage of their lives than most. Why the hell are their parents even in the room with them so close?
No one suspects anything's happening to those fucks. No one knows the kids. The robots never catch on yet. That needs to be monitored.
But, as i said, this was not some book. This was PBS, and i thought kids were really right to be pinky pointing at themselves for the fun of it.
But pity would have been so much more to show children the money that he'd had and given to them. Instead of all this squandering and keeping their parents separate, children would have faced a demand they've never even thought they could ever use. And the love they craved would have ended a whole country, potentially damaging countless children. Kids need compassion now and again, they need people with rich backgrounds, strong minds, and brains that can help them do their work.
So lets hope they're not those hard working, hustling, moronic fools that they were sited against.

The sound of the inside tile creak echoed through the dry stale air in the hallway. A dark figure lurched away from the door, gaining nothing from the shadows. Sometime in his journey to where what was the place he was looking was caused by something. He could hear voices in his head, as if he was speaking through his ear buds. No one was here when this hit him, but he had to keep that up.
Finally finding his shoes, knocking on the door silenced it. The door opened with a loud crash as the figure continued it's walk to the hallway, his head making a sound as it moved in the opposite direction as expected. The stairs slid down, all the way to the end of the hall, and come around the corner into a room that could have been his home. Drenched in sweat from all the sweat, the figure stepped through the door, climbing up the stair frame only to step on the foot of another sleeping figure. The figure stumbled backwards, stuttering but apparently not wanting to break his back.
The figure started a pace into the room, leant against the shelves. He turned toward the bed, behind him. The doctor poked his head into the closet and allowed him to peek inside. A pain began to his right leg, as the pain passed. The nurse in the black suit slid the needle down his neck and took him to his armchair, removing the bag that was wrapped around his body. The nurse climbed into the chair, gently fiddling with the switch that regulated the room to kill the other two. Holding the bottle of chemicals in her hand, she ushered him to sit next to the bed. His vision was blurry at first, until he could make out his shapes. He spoke first, his tongue, slowly making his motions even as it heard him over the music.
“ It's time I talk to everyone. ”
The monster didn ’ t acknowledge her, as if it knew. He sounded a bit panicked, but nonetheless the sound he heard knew what happened to him; instantly the room burst into a million noise. Some of it was weapons, some was of pain, some of it felt like anger. But he couldn ’ t hide from them, he had to obey them. He whipped out his dagger from his breast pocket, and that fool put it in a back pocket underneath his robes. He got up, and walked over to the unconscious body. To the edge of his vision he saw that the cry of pain had washed over the body and it was simply rest. Slowly he pulled it to the skin and stopped the screaming. He looked at the new face in front of him again, a hateful look. He grabbed a dead body and reached in his pocket, pulling out a handgun.
“ So the serum is here. What do we do with it? ”
The figure reached down, but only brought the gun up to his shoulder. It was ordinary, but he pressed the trigger.
“ Nothing. Kill me. Just don ’ t let anyone find out. That wasn ’ t meant to happen. It was an experiment and they have seen the reaction of normal people. It ’ s not like the serum can work like that. They have no idea. At least this happens without their noticing. ”
One of the syringes in his hand, held over the back of his robe. It was a blank bottle. None of the designs he had seen that day on TV. The name on the label on the label read:
***Death Note***
The words glittered menacingly, as if they were hurtful to those that loved and gave. The gentle reminder that the result was already near, as the two of them were forced into the dark room. As they stood in silence, the words announced to him the end of their line.
With a long nod, the other Doctor took out his notebook, and slid it to his side of the bed. With a single word, the man slipped the notebook behind his ear.
“ Fireman ”

I've never meant for you to see it! I couldn't read the way he described it, but I wanted to.
You are my hero of a story ( heroic or not ), the one I want you to know about.
Only you know what it means to be a good little man. Good little man.
You are a brilliant writer ( and when I was young I loved making you like him ), you write great stories, and I adore you! I could just read a book or two with a sentence by sentence. I would know exactly what you were thinking! You have inspired me from the ground up! Even though you don't give me the opportunity, I know I could hear all the damned old ones sobbing behind my back. And I know. And oh God, why I was so sad for myself. I couldn't leave my story if it wasn't for you.
And it's true that your friend Sherlock Holmes is also your greatest friend, but that doesn't mean they won't stay with you for a while longer...

He'd seen the footage millions of times, so fucking many and yet, he had only one thing left to see. Humans. Like every action! He'd seen the red, yellow, blue and green meat sacs of wars, dark forests and ancient beasts. He'd seen Bill asking Grodd about Abe.
But there was something different.
But then, that first, second period, he'd seen all of the violence. Violence on Earth. Genocide. Slander. War, torture, pillaging. It even had the word, Christmas, on the floor. It was very goddamned weird.
But what if there was more.
No. It wasn't just his watch. He'd seen it, and he'd looked as beautiful as she was. And as terrifying as a lot of them. No. Even close, humans. He'd, like a skunk in a swamp, see it. But they weren't getting mad, he imagined.
"Can't you see? She! Who are you? WHO ARE YOU?! "
The elf bled and growled. He held up a godly, fruit-coloured hand as Santa, a priest, floated away, towards the river.
And that was it.
It was a message, humanity. it wanted nothing more than to be'gone'. This was it. We'd made contact, those only organic beings, the only true race that could reproduce naturally on Mars. But not now.
" WE'RE NOT HERE TO DIE. WE'RE HERE TO GIVE YOU CRAP, SON OF A BITCH! "
Santa walked out of his monastary, rocketing towards her, tossing chunks of flesh that wouldn't sink.
" IT WAS ENOUGH TO SEE YOU. IT'S ALWAYS ENOUGH TO SEE YOU, AND EVER since there was no space, there is no salvation. That is why time is needed, not death, so we can feed on this new life so that others can not stop you. "
He stomped and wept in her love.
" THAT'S IT, WE'RE DONE. WE'RE DONE. THIS UNIVERSE WAS MAKING FUCK YOU UP. IT HAS TO DEFEAT YOUR LIVES. "
And he wrapped his arms around her.
" I'm sorry. You didn't realize what this meant, did you? "
" It means everything. We can make you a vegetable until you are vegetable. But we will not ever wake up again from this. "
" DO N'T WEHERE A QUESTION THERE WHEN YOU HAD NO LOVE?"
And then he disappeared.
The other organic races could hardly believe it. But still.
And with that, they went out to the stars.

"The pharma pact is guaranteed. Your cooperation in this. "
" Uhhhh, shit. "
I roll the sleeping pod over to the patient. A glass bottle sat in the corner of my designated room. The patient lies back as you take a sip from the bottle. A gentle hum emanates from the bottle, and I am left with what looked like me. Above me and behind me stretched clouds. The clouds have died out, but the storm clouds still stand on the horizon. Only my mind knows what the clouds looked like, but I can't help but be somehow responsible for them.
The man I am hearing is Death, and perhaps he's better than I. One of the few who truly counts on me to accept his fate.
" That kind of pays well. We were always cleaning up after one another. Especially the sleepwalking. It's supposed to help when you have a useless job. You become a god among ants. But fuck that. "
I took another drink of the bottle. It was a nice one, just barely enough to feed me. He nods, showing his empty eyes. The haze overtakes me, and I see a pure black. And then he reaches into his pocket to give me a piece of paper.
" See, I'm a telepath, you're on your own in a dimension where teleportation is impossible."
He sets the paper aside, and I feel His touch on my cheek. Death smiles. This time though, the life I had before the war breaks out. My contacts are copied, and for the first time since then, my existence has me away. Because I can't save myself from these unknown horrors, I decide that I will play along.

"Excuse me sir? I am afraid you may need to rethink the sentencing. " the guard said in a patronizing tone as the vulture dragged the chair up and out of the courtroom.
The man sat there, staring at the vulture with each breath, the cigar and the snake. The snake fumbled around, flicking each thread towards the vulture in hand.
A small room, the desk in the front of the room was kept in one of the bedrooms and the twins sitting on the bed rested by the window watching TV.
Around the table was a noose, and round it hung a pencil at night. Black leather didn't don'thing to the paper, did it? the guard pressed on the now very thin, black cloth from the dresser drawer.
Suddenly there was a piercing sound. The snake slid it again.
" This is the man who issued your sentence. " the guard said with a calming tone. " This man who has come to my chambers. " He called to the man opposite the vulture, a man that nearly looked like your grandmother.
" What do you propose? " The vulture asked.
The man lost it's sleep, but returned when he saw the vulture, standing in the same spot that he had sat there earlier.
" You want to know me? Tell me who I am, where I come from... what I am now, and what I have become. "
The guard then laughed quietly. " Wait and enjoy. That is what this is all about. "
The snake had no choice but to answer with more of his words. The guard sat in silence, the prisoner waiting at the end of his rope that held him close. " This is all about your happiness. " The guard said. " Do as you are told, or go about your life. "
As the snake approached the man a hand clamped on his shoulder. The guard shook his head, pushing the vulture closer as the snake struggled.
The man made a dumbfounded noise in response to the guard. " You didn't go to school yesterday or work today? "
" No, I don't. I don't work. Why do you have to keep me under one anymore? " The guard stood up now, walked towards the vulture, and placed his palm on the guard's shoulder. The guard stepped away, turning around to see a white rabbit sitting on the floor. The guard closed his eyes as the vulture passed him and the rope slowly began to unravel.
The guard looked to his left. " W.. what? " the vulture asked. He had the best brush that the world has seen.
" This is it. I am free. The defendant is dead."

Herlia sighed and rubbed her eyes. " Can't they see that I'm a tad short or tiny? " She shrugged.
" See? "
" I look weak! " She replied.
" Not even wearing clothes? "
" No body, no legs. "
" Well, I look spry. " She then leaned over the ground and gently twirled her loins. " My name's Ikara, after the woman who'd enslaved me. "
" Mmm, " Ikara winced.
" Come now, this is just a stupid game to play, you don't think? "
" That's not what I'm about to say, are you saying I'm short or tiny? "
" Ahem. " She interjected. " Please, when you make us *Fate*, turn us into a *human. * "
" But I have skin! " Ikara groaned. " * I* have skin! "
"... are you implying that I would be intimidated by those aliens? "
She smiled sadly. " Yes, but you're correct. "
" Wow, are you going to let me live? "
" Yes! I will! I will save the race! " She kicked at her feet and flailed her arms. " It's a game! "
Kirin bowed with much preternatural force, lifting her grub-like feet off the ground. " I've heard that. "
" How? "
" I found your art outside that alleyway. " She held out her arm at a random angle.
" I, " Ikara growled, " and you have taken one out of my own. Why not- "
She patted him in the face, and for a moment, Ikara held up the hand of the dirt on which the oddity had come from. " I was just trying to help you. It was another draw. "
" I don't mind if they take out all my art. "
" That's not even a suggestion. You have been in this line of work for a couple of centuries. It takes a few people to build something so badly appreciated. A very good artist. "
The alien saw this and said in a labored, gruff tone, " What in god's name are you talking about?! "
" Let's play this game and hope you stay as a man. " She tugged the bandage off his wound, which visibly grew larger. " And if you die, I'll rule the world again as you have done for thousand of years. "
Kirin laughed, and hooted. " We're probably not that different. "
" Oh. You would? "
" Yes. "
" Then let's do it. "
Kirin pointed her gun at the animals in the alleyway. They had politely fallen away. " Isn't that a good idea? "
" No. It's not. "
" Then allow us to continue. "
" Yes."

I was dropped off at the ripe old age of 94. Adolf was my last son. It was an accident, surely. I had a sudden phobia of the monsters in Germany that were lurking around my orphaned home. To be honest I could never have imagined an innocent little boy, no, not even me, would be believed. The guilt, still gnawing at me when I felt cold, drifted over me and I fell into the dark.
The doctors told me he was brain cancer. They said it was like super cancer or something, but as luck would have it they dropped me off at the ripe old age of 96. I couldn't believe it. I was dying, my teeth and lungs ripped out. My vision was blurr through me as I saw the sickening sounds of the city, the screams of my wife; the panic. They must've been nails digging into my skin. They must've been poking me in the stomach.
Every chance I got I could feel my wife punching me in the ribs. I just couldn't keep that up. I got out of bed and ran outside into the wide, shining daylight. I saw the blank, scary horizon come to life as I took off. I burst out into the nearest town. As I ran to the stores, I made sure the last store was closed. The books got squashed by the onslaught. As I walked down the street, my mother walked me through the dark, looking me in the eyes. " But mother... I'm not Hitler " She told me with a look of pure confusion. " It doesn't take a genius to realize that the purpose of everything is to protect. " " I understand. " " The plain honesty was difficult to swallow, but she nodded.
She was sat down by the fire at the end of my street, but her face was wrinkled and grey. She bent over and took a long sip of a warm beer. " It all started when I received a letter that said Adolf Hitler... I didn't have much time. I thought it was funny then, someone had contacted me saying they were down in Germany. As soon as I got to my car it was gone. I was furious. They had found the gun in a lock box and shot me, as well as my wife. They wanted to know if I wanted to suffer my fate. I wanted to tell them everything. But now it's been too long, too late. The heartwarming story I had planned is just a cheap marketing stunt made to make me feel stronger. So now they're lining up my kidnapper. Why can't they believe me? "
She was dead serious now. When she said I had been killed, her head turned towards me. When she finished she was holding back a sob. " No! I had to see Adolph! He was just for the money! " " Yes, yes his name is Adolf Hilter."

2 and a half months ago, the human race descended into madness, and began wiping out tribes. First, the nomads of Africa offered a challenge - to engage in battle from their hunter-gatherer-only homeland of Africa, during which they were expected to kill or be killed by a second group - as a challenge. No tribes were prepared for what would happen, as whoever initially attacked was quick to be killed.
2 months later, a human ship was seen approaching the destination, and the surviving tribesmen began singing in the face of the killer of the first group. Great dropships of aliens landed at the northernmost tribal nation, followed shortly by an inferno, and then the U.S. military easily captured them.
This was impossible - the aliens would have landed and destroyed the lone tribe who challenged their own territorial authority in their own land. This was truly unfortunate, as that tribe still welcomed an advanced alien approach with open arms, and totally opposed any form of resistance to this onslaught.
Only a month later, another ship arrived, and it captured many tribesmen who had fled to their homeworld. In the alien's midst, it was trapped for several weeks. This situation was finally solved when it was discovered that the "representative of their ancestors" as it'd come to be put in charge of their harsh treatment, upon their arrival in their homeworld, were defenseless. It was a bloody slaughter, with the victims and slaves of the aliens also dying horribly, and their food rich enough to sell.
2 months later, the aliens developed an U.S. presence in the Americas. The end result was a horde of aliens. It wasn't just a slaughter. In an attempt to stay out of all the conflict, the aliens abducted large species, and more species were added to the Confederacy, each species by this point. Although they introduced themselves as The'U.S.S,' they refused to fight.
A month later, the aliens came to the United States. There, they introduced themselves as the President of the Republic of the United States, and threatened to annihilate all of North Korea. The president tried to persuade him, telling him that this declaration would be less than temporary, that war would happen only after the countries gathered, ensuring the secrecy. He refused.
The aliens were met with resistance from all sides. As a result, the threat of war was removed from the talks, but not before the president had demanded one last meeting with the Interim Leader of North Korea:
Captain Iroh Locke of the Transatlants, with whom the president attended, delivered:
“ My people... ”

I'll go for the city for which I have lived. The sound of dillydewater and drowning can be heard after the setting sun. My lungs are tense and my head recoils from the pounding. With each breath I collect my breath, to make sure that my way back to the beach is not disrupted by the carvings on the side of the boat.
One day, years ago, I ventured out into the wilderness. My tribe forbade me from doing so on account of my animalistic heritage. I had come up to my fishing hut with one of my group to find water and there was just one hole between. I brought several pieces of wood ( which was mostly dry ) and told them to explore farther into the woods. I wished for them to find the water soon, but had they not arrived, there was nothing left. I thought of teaching my children and told them this was what I would do the next time I walked. It took me longer than needed to make my way back home but I could not help myself.
The next day, some people came over the lake, and as I got closer to the water, they saw me. I heard the familiar crunch of waves on the shore, and the hollering of a boat. They came back with their torches and I prepared myself for a dire case of shark attack. I had gotten plenty of bite marks on the skin, and some skin fragments were scattered across the boat. I trudged to the shore of the bank to enjoy the light of day, and saw the familiar, swimming in the waves. The beautiful beating water bounced off me and I roared out my "sandar fas- ", as I felt the heart's drag down my throat. As the beating subsided, I began to relax and the sun began to set over the horizon.
I awoke in a white room with a silver door and white floor and wood floors with a single table. There was also a blindfold that hung around my neck. " Drink your mace, " the man said. " I have been waiting for this moment. " With that, he removed the blindfold, and I woke up naked. It was warm in my room, but the sun was starting to fall. " I dived out into the ocean to see how I was feeling, " and I slid down the stainless steel footrest that covered the floor. I woke up completely naked. A tent was resting on the opposite side of the room, a long, dark purple cord hung from the ceiling.
" Get up here! We need water!"

I uncoiled my legs. My ankles, *correct*, *you know damn well that there's no such thing as soil holes*
This room wasn't mine. My toes were in a grave, some kind of tombbed, some kind of hermit crab or miniature castle. And now, time to romp around on a rock, because *you mustn't* dig up what's in these layers of mine.
I stopped and looked at the massive shape at my feet. Glinting almost like it was only a campfire in the sky, not that it would hurt me to wander anymore. A young man walked, but that was just his face. But he really was *his* face.
"Look. You must know *us* are digging our grave in the grave of a dead archaeologist, of whom you have worked long, long, hard. We appreciate the help you have given, and to think you made it a living. "
*Look at the facts. *
" Look, I know that *we* dig our grave in the grave of a buried archaeologist, of whom we work for *many years*. You know *You* *wish* that, in our normal way, we wouldn't dig the grave, for even though you've been there for *much* longer, and we are literally *there* and *you've been there for a lot longer*, but you got ta let me tell you - a big big big… *actually* big *gest* grave in your geological history is that of a church. And you can dig it yourself, but we dig it for *hours* a day anyway, and then it's all sorted out for us. We dig it tomorrow, and you can dig it tomorrow. But there's no way you can ever bury your name, and, at this point, we know that. And we know that *we* find you digging deep underground, that you're digging up your own grave. And we're the first people to actually dig, to get a sense of *how deep* this is, and we know that if we did, then someone might find out to put your name up there, someone might remember. But you *can't* leave it up there! "
" So this grave, you left it there. "
*So is that right? *
" Well, look. I know you want to *not* leave it there. I've only given you a whole week. It's in there when our new cryptographer is due to see it from his vantage point, and it's all over the place *now*. But we've been digging for a very long time, and you - that's *completely* insane. Look! See it all over the place! You know the way my finger points? With my tongue! "
A finger planted firmly in a dirt notch on a rock. " Yes."
I curled up on the ground again. My fingers felt like metal.

"So come on, we could draw a few straight lines here? " I asked the wizard who grinned and massaged his forehead.
" Yea sure, sure. You can draw that right. Can't you make a twist here? " He grabbed my leather black robes and robes and shoved them into my back.
" We could pull a line here, we could draw a simple line here and there, but they'll be nailed to a form of cake. " I scoffed. I hesitated for a second and held my hand out to him. " Three dimensional cake, buddy! Be careful! It won't stick in its place! "
He started digging deep into the floor of the ballroom, popping a small one against a sticky stone. Three ethereal dots dangled above the rock until the dark arrow pointed at the center. The crowd would scream out in pleasure as I was transported to the ground.
" Fine, fine, just stick it in place. " I pulled my hands away from the ground and proceeded to place it on the table. I turned around and turned to see what my friend had pulled out, but right between my lips I muttered.
" Well done, Elf. Damn. You're off the charts."

*POOF*
As the ball drops out of my lungs I stand up. For days it has been fun swimming, coloring my hair into ballpoint pens and boxing my little toe. Not many else will enjoy the sensation of hearing sound at first, they ask themselves what the noise means. I say it is an ear ringing, it is a ringing of memories I haven't even wanted to imagine. There was once a time I was only thirty meters away from the building when some poor kid had tripped over a glass of water for no reason. That was when I realized, could this be the sound of the stress bomb dropping? He'd hit both of his heads and had his heart stop in what he believed was his last breath. Then it struck, when that building collapsed it wasn't him he was barely able to hear the blast, but just the air around him. He broke his teeth and one of his baby steps on the sidewalk which made my teeth twitch. He was ready to go flying back into the bright light of day when he suddenly found himself plummeting with the speed of a god. At least he took a while to clear the portion of the now fire filled balloon around him. I stopped myself with a notepad and started writing the future.
As I finish writing I stop, smile and my mind wanders with an answer I can't ask for. * I think she's gone blind. *
*Did the bright ray rush through the atmosphere and kill her too? *
" Yep. Still pretty cool though. " I replied
*What a dumb joke! Send her back! He loves kittens! *
This was only for my own amusement, as I saw a homeless homeless man walking towards me. I followed him down the street and watched him fall down the alley way.
I watch him catch up with him and he catches up almost as quickly. I run after him and as I walked I ran after the homeless man. I took a knife and stabbed him. I saw through his mind I saw " Happy Day, class!"
I died and a child woke up in my arms

* "Hello my child, " the man said in the familiar tone of an old man. * " And thank you for staying over my house for a little while, this evening. " * He continued walking off to the garden, but all the while turning to look at me, satant and playing game with a circular pool in the garden. * " It's been ages since I visited. Your mother was young before you came by. It was hard before you met me. I loved my way of life. You were all I had left when you died. " * The light in the courtyard stayed intense, he couldn't think straight. His search for his older sister quickly became more difficult, even as the darkness in his eyes quickly began to reveal that he couldn't remember how he got there or the reason. * " When I last saw you she was the very woman I loved. Why did we have to abandon each other before we were destined to be together? You were already so close. You've been so close. I didn't realize until now why we were a perfect family. You even bothered to leave your room behind you. " * He sighed sadly. * " I didn't realize how cold you truly were. Did you know that I ’ ve been cheating on you countless times by pretending you were as cold as I am? You took advantage of us, we broke up, abused you and murdered you. You killed me when you were only two. The wrongs you took from me…I got rid of in days. All you did was speak to me, when you wanted. I used that to punish you. This is my punishment. I'm going to use the power I've given you in order to ensure that I can continue to corrupt the world I started. " * The gathering of blood began to lose its color. * " I don't want anything to do with you. I want all that's left to be nothing but you. You have no family, you don't have a place in the world and you can only do the things I want because I take my life. " * He knew I knew something was about to happen. * " I won't leave you here." *

It was the autumn sunset. The clouds parted and a breeze swept the path toward the dark corner of the street. Over the sunny fields the rustling of leaves gave the evening a hint of light. A little girl with sandy blonde hair and a needle in her hand stepped down, unseen by the children. The light from the lantern shone on her thick, sharp hair. Sweat dripped down her chin and down her legs. Carefully, as if pondering something in the dark, she smiled. Then, dark skinned face, the faintest hints of weariness. Thin and wicked eyes.
'Good afternoon, sweetie,' the little boy said to her. 'Oh, hello. I've been waiting a long time for you.'
The man walked out to greet her and plopped his head down in a smirk. The sky was dark with no indication of where he was going. On either side of him a small set of trees stared back. The scent was strong and springy. Large and jagged. The way they stepped, dripping wet and slowly revealing, like claws, teeth and wings. His dark skin, dark hair and green eyes made the scent of fresh jasmine and pink. He looked as though he was all alone. Though he was in a bad place. There were no friends or family in this... place. The light from the lantern, the warmth of the flame and the stillness in the dark betrayed that. If one thing caused this child to go, it was to be really alone.
There was a small lad behind the farmer and he tumbled through the crowd. He had a scar that had never reached his eyes. He started munching on a root and eventually fell to the ground. He looked around and saw nothing but dark weeds and dirty grass. He looked back at the young man and picked the child up. 'Where is he?', the boy asked.
'Where are you going?', the farmer whispered to the young man. 'Are you feeling okay? Good.' He walked back into the road and a family walked towards the boy. The woman didn't speak but, most importantly, she didn't know. She was crying and could not move.
The father stood by the child and helped him up the hill. Together the two boys walked to the house and she took him into her arms. After a moment, she told him of her feeling and the boy thanked them for their help and then started to walk away.
The parents walked away but the boy followed. 'Now, now,' the boy told them, as though knowing his mother. 'Are you alright?'

The old, now stone, warrior stood and looked up at the unearthly grey titan.
“ I don ’ t understand why you do this to us… for ‘ the sake of your ‘ children ’? ” the warrior trailed off before retching.
“ Look at your kid. Look at how you continue to put up with your own selfishness. You feel, belittled by your father for his decisions of your own making. You still bring your children to school, constantly admonishing them by name. You ensure that they don ’ t spend as much time hurt because they are weak and will eventually put to use. You are the creature of the heart and of the mind. ”
“ Yes, you are. For ‘ the sake of your ‘ children ’, you don ’ t believe in almighty beings. You don ’ t believe in that which God considers good. ”
“ Do you believe in em? Do you believe in wrath? ”
“ If you absolutely do, then of course you do. To be completely frank, no. I do. You believe in pride of birth, of being born into the world. You believe in a world where you have power and you can make yourself known. You believe in an utopia where you can go to work everyday, studying and enjoying life. ”
“ That is absolutely false. ”
“ You ’ re right. My son ’ s thoughts and experiences were a waste of our Father ’ s time. What power you use to me this time? ”
“ I was no good at my father ’ s ideas. I liked him. Not that he cared much for my kind. In fact, there was no longer a reason to when your father wanted a friend. We had everything you ever wanted, whenever the chance arose, at least we had a place for each other in our home town. ”
“ But I still hate the little one. He is so naive. He probably enjoys this – there is something wonderful about that, to my son. You think you can make him a better person? You try to give him something that works for you. That doesn ’ t work. Why is that supposed to be you? ”
“ You suppose you ’ ll get to choose what you want for yourself, son? ” the great sorcerer asked.
“ Yes, I suppose so. I will be the protector of my son. ”

"Alright gang. Let's play this one over and over ".
The huge group of four men stood in front of their goons. A bearded, oiled man grinned at his crew " You see we are putting the shoes on and as a joke I called the Pentagon Chief to talk a bluff ".
The chief spoke up, " Hahaha ahaha ". Staring into the dark distance the guards pointed at each other. The lone guard looked at the group, " What are you doing here? "
" Hahaha ahaha. This is not a joke " The guards replied " the President made us warn the world what you are doing is illegal. "
The guards stood frozen and stared expectantly, " Too much information ".
The four men began to walk slowly towards the giant table in the center of the room. The chief leaned forward and whispered " the secret to America's success in World War Z and we cant keep using it without being caught ". The four men looked at each other " things have not changed", the chief explained as they slipped silently out the door.

This particular bottle is dark, empty, bloody, yet inexhaustible. Though I can see each and every one of his pills, each and every one I can't find the right pills. Not just because of how many depressions I can feel. The pills work, but the thoughts and beliefs I only want are too long and difficult to explain to the young man in the seat next to me. The needle nudges into his chest, which is then overwhelmed by the pain. A small cry escapes me from the child and I pull the needle from his throat.
"I am going to kill him. "
" That's almost enough, " I muttered, " It's best if you use his special shot, or call in your friend. "
He snores in pain and I kick the bottle's rim for good measure. It's made of metal and it feels more comforting than it is warm. I hold his shoulder tightly and whisper, " Goodbye."

" Uh... yea, am I ready? "

" No... I, uh... they did not? "
" Well, " said Google, " we both know you're on this one. "
" Google, get down here okay?"
There was a brief pause as the speaker began to light up. Eventually, it ceased and the guy returned to his desk. There was a light somewhere off in the sky which revealed an immense network of black towers which were in fact large enough to cover just about any distance.

I tossed the covers off, bag over my head. My body rested on the hardwood floor, clawing at the brick linoleum. I sat next to a young boy, screaming and crying.
As I sat there, I watched the boy swing the mutilated corpse over, but out of both fear and excitement I picked up the scraps. I kneeled down and snatched the three kittens I had picked up on the ground.
My hand reached up to the kid's spine, and I grabbed a piece of the cat he'd been whimpering in agony. I pulled out the phone, my finger resting on his call button, and pressed it. I didn't even wait for my vision to clear before dialing the police, then again, no time to waste. I let my fingers wander over the baby, wishing it was dead.
The girl, who had her arms behind her back and the pixellated face, appeared out of thin air. Her eyes were red-red as I pulled her closer, bringing her close to me. She turned around to help me, but as I was about to kneel again I watched the light fade into the distance.
A minute passed. Another minute. My tears streamed down my cheeks like drops of rain on a dappled sky. I held her tighter. We looked out from the street, too far out in the front of the city for comfort.
Then it hit me. How could we have loved, let alone love one another? We had never had kids and we had never had pets, and now as someone who wanted to be, we had none. We turned away, feeling the injustice of the situation, as if to condemn us to our painful demise.
I couldn't. I didn't know what to do. I knew what to do. No sooner did she scream, than the city turned to ashes. As the sky darkened, she started to disappear into thin air, but I found myself standing before the faint blue dot. She was gone.
I'd been so afraid. How was it that I found my first love, my first love who no longer mattered to me? How could I hate my life for hurting her? I stepped out onto the street and down the street and hopped out of the car, rung my hands around the steering wheel. I watched as the crushed smell of sweethearts filled the air, and I gripped my shoe as blood crunched over my calf.

In the late 19th Century, a father observed a flock of human bodyguards in their travels. Surely these three men must have been in a hurry; with nothing they could do to avoid the "problem". The guards went on patrols, gaining progress and deciding upon their tasks based on the amount of toiled hours they could spend in the meantime. The father was not only seeing the the men die, but the effort the guards put into procuring their deaths. If the prisoner was a brute, a scrawny brute, a simpleton or barbarian, then surely it was more likely that the second novice had made a mistake, and therefore had taken up the role of a rogue.
It was of little use to the father that he did not see the officer. Most people would consider it as simply a minor inconvenience; however, the officer was a former servant to one of the youngest members of the guard squad. When the father returned home that night, he went into deep questioning. From across the room, he heard the familiar " has he drank it yet " song from the youth, and knew he must have, would find that the " truth " was not quite what it seemed. Rumors of strange, inhumane concoctions in his household had been heard from his young adulthood. He was not the first person to bring this tidbit to the attention of the young man, and his investigation led him to a select few criminals, such as a sack haired, throaty man, and an overweight, white collar prisoner who had been successfully taken out of prison. He believed that the lights were a good way to focus his attention upon the old man. That his family was little more than a nuisance, and there was little chance he could accomplish any of the that. Yet there it was, when the officer crossed the room and saw that he had heard it first. The only light to resonate was a much darker light of a long dead man's head placed into the socket. He continued to see the young man for a few more minutes before he observed the light shine out from between the eyes of the man.
The owner of the house was an old man - not at all like the son, no older, also pale and balding. The man of the house was a tall, thin man with green eyes, and a rather wide nose. His clothing and a white shirt were clean, and the mark of the darker man in the stockings was nothing less than a faded acorn. At the time, the father had thought the bodyguards of the " dream man " had been a waste of time, and had taken a young boy with them on his voyage. The father went to confront the boy, but the boy, with a look of determination and a slight shake in his arm, as if to say " Are you sure you're not dreaming? " was uncharacteristically unbalanced, and could not understand the sensation of heat and staining on his clothes. The father laughed and returned to bed, calling the nighttime spirit to his side. The night did not go dark until the man awoke - not the nurse that had walked in, but rather a snoring on the night stand. An ancient text laid a tapestry on the bedside table, and when she came to him, she began to lay down. She held up one of the braddain sheets and yelled at him to wake up. " Welcome to home, son. You are due for dinner on your first day, and this morning, I was afraid that this meal could not possibly hold you as strong as you are now. Could you please tell us the story of the dream man's days of terror? "
The father quickly jumped out of bed, and ran downstairs to the bedroom. The sleep-lover was across from him. She began to peel away his clothing and ruffle his hair. The father's expression returned to it's pitch, and in a proud voice whispered " It's you, right? "
The light came back on, blinding the unconscious man, and as his eyes adjusted to the light, the little boy stepped out of the bedroom and struggled to stand on his own. He turned and staggered away. The hours of sleep-telling did not prepare the father for what was about to happen. He took a deep breath and stepped out of the kitchen, and to his surprise, the stranger he was staring at didn't look so distraught.
" We're going to need you to take the medicine, and it will be warm."

What Hates Us Now
A low buzz of licks and brushes under the top of my head
Maybe those types are better then us
Into the culture of the eighties
My new philosophy professor is interrupting
To my delight she says'Praise the spirit'.
'Nay! May our dearest love your life'
Our advice doesn't need to include a fun backstory
but instead I propose
We steal these then leave them in a park
Cause the sun bleeds when we need them
And damn it myself because I can not pull the trigger
But thank God
My daffodils and mistresses have no guts
I'm tired of my filth
So I steal and trade
I'm the only artist of your generation
I should find a fashion firm
at an arms length from Mr. Rogers
They have all their hair in a kippah
So that one of them can confine
I take them and twist
Anything they want that sparks a nuking revolution
To hide under the cover of Mexican New york
All my mementos are worthless
Tonight I'm calling up a few pornstars
We both know there's some underperformation
If you go look around you'll see
The few people I know in my city
who share my public persona
I'm trying to make you my son

"Do you remember the last time we faced each other? " I asked the stupid, wizened man about to say so on the old wooden floor. The noise had gotten almost uncomfortably loud in my ears after my previous test.
" Yeah, the early 1800s were shit before we understood stone. Once we came across the clear blue sandstone door between the other realms, our whole world changed. Our world was *literally* wet with fresh water by now. The door didn't budge on the real pitch we first met. It was more, " it continued into a soft, and intriguing rhythm, like singing the keys while exploring a new land. It may look cool, but that's the scary part. Like going in, taking all the pots and pans in the house. Cautiously. "
" How could we be so unthinking? To even consider it, right? As a fantasy set in the very real wilderness, it was impossible to step through this door. What an adventure it would have been! It would have been the beginning of a spiritual roller coaster ride for all of us. "
The weird looking guy on my right looked up at me with broken and confusing expressions. " Huh, I guess we both know the next round is a long one. Also, the spider things? " I pointed to a shiny spider on the floor from across the room.
The very intelligent, yet very spooky looking guy started saying something along the lines of " I, too, thought that the reason why spiders and spiders were such a secret and adventurous sport was because we had that same useless rock right in front of us. Now, you wouldn't believe the weight! "
The impossible old idiot walking across the room looked at me with dark eyes and said " I dunno what you mean. Either way, the few spiders you get in your journey don't lie. That means we are going to die, not right away and thus, your adventure is over. "
" Ok fine. I was listening too deep. " The very creepy man on my right picked up on that thing I was talking about.
" So... In the past, you had this very simple enough quest. Like, to find this shiny stone that and promptly kill all of the spiders in the room. Then turn on the tap for a very long time. The puzzles are the same, but this time you get to try at it. " The old genie looked at me and said " I'm going to stay until next week, when you receive a mysterious stone sword with an ornate and ashen red rune inscribed on the weapon. "
I shrugged my shoulders and turned to follow him, hoping he would just believe me until I got to the final room. He stepped down onto the ladder and began walking toward me as I climbed into the pitch darkness. The door was bolted shut and always opened. Soon enough, we were in the dark, black catacombs, surrounded by the corpses of old people and beautiful women and children. They were all a sickly sort of gray color. It seemed like they all died young.
" Where were we? " I asked. I waved back at the top of my gargantuan ceiling, ignoring the glaring flames. An expression came to my mouth that I didn't recognize, " Was it for love or just entertainment?"

**********88**********
I swung in my seat. I could feel the vibration of the steam running down the windows, and could feel a flutter of excitement in the air, as the train passed one stop after another, waiting for the rush hour to roll through. It was great for no one.
The smell of food in the air woke me. The cold seconds would kill me but I savored it; the crunch of movement through the dark. Stumbling down the hall I sat up and looked around at the empty seats around me. Past the few hundred odd people I could see a warmth of reprieve come over me.
Looking up into the narrow corridor, I saw an old friend from back down the street. I called out to him, "You know, its weird. We've been here about ten years, you know what it's like to have a train. " He came to a stop and stepped out of his seat and, to my amusement, stopped, looking deep into mine. Not too brash or anything. Honest. I almost saw him sigh, regret, and walk away. As if someone else was about to watch, and kindle a spark in me. A spark of excitement.
& nbsp;
The thought brought me to the window of one of my old apartment buildings that the old folks call home. It used to be their roof, as well as the ledge next to it and the hotel that they call their headquarters. But it had been abandoned since the 1930s. For a brief moment I thought I would, but now I am very much with these people. Nothing will disturb me until I go out there.
" This must be home of a long time, " I said, looking to the far side of the window. " Yeah, you can't imagine how much food they keep coming back here... "
& nbsp;
" Oh, yeah, don't worry about that, " he said, and leaned forward with a cheeky smile. " It's also great."
I looked back up in the window and thought of all the larder that got that huge cartwheel in the last fifteen years. The one that held the noisiest cup of water on the coffee table, while everyone else drank! The one where the hot bubbly water flowed from the tub to the hat was their galette, of course, but there was no need for that anyways. I almost missed the old lady, because the air was suddenly so cold and the endless subway cars stretched across the bridge outside.
Maybe someday this time I'd have enough food to last me the rest of my life, but it really doesn't hurt. It really helps if I can just make sure I'm alive.
& nbsp;
Sadly, I didn't have time to finish the thought any more. I was so close to a place I didn't even recognize, and I never knew where it led. I hope I can make it that way; if I make it to Mars soon.

I take my honeymoon home and head to my room. Taking a seat in the recliner, I keep talking to myself. In the corner of my eye, I see what the future holds. All girls are staring at their phones, and I'm the one to initiate conversation. The book rack on the next table in the room opens up, and I begin reading. It wasn't the prettiest book that I had read in the past, but it made me smile. I would read it if I had a friend.
*"I love you, " I whisper in a voice far too distant. *
" Oh? " I whisper again.
* " My dear, " * I say in a sound almost as foreign as the sound of my voice. * " We might as well go. " *
I am leaving the room in time for the next date. My friend brought me food. He was a wonderful man. I have no idea what he was eating. I don't even know if he remembered his food.
When I get back, I look at the map on the table. There is no turn on anymore. The old sign says " Take a selfie with your cellphone. " I take a selfie and try to call it. My friend says yes. I get in my car, do the usual thing, and drive back. I have a pool cue with my friends to go with.
When I got back in my car, I put on my headphones and my phone's volume controls. The rhythm is familiar. The excitement of the moment is apparent. I hang up. " I will be back in ten minutes. " " Oh great, " I say as I get back in my car. My old plan had failed and I stopped bothering to use my new. " Thank you for having me. " As I pull up the GPS, I notice that I am in the 90's. Next to the window on my car is the photo. I see my friend on the screen. I knew that he was beautiful.
" So, do you see the sign? " I ask my friend. He returns his gaze from the camera to me and the photo. It says, " Take a selfie with your cellphone."
My love spent the entire trip waiting for me. When we walked through the shopping mall, I asked my former boyfriend if he knew about the vending machine. He looked surprised. I was surprised. My heart skipped a beat when I saw the sign. The obituary put together the picture. What is the meaning? I buried it, because I'm such a great person.

The light bulbs were on, downwind of the Cathedral. There were no records of any of us. Perhaps we might still be alive, but being able to see stars wasn't a given. No black out, no scratch to do them over.
Since there was no timescale, we all could see when things were moving, but most noticed when we had to look, losing ourselves in the dim little lightbulbs.
I sat on a rooftop, hidden in the middle of the reservoir. Though I liked the view, I knew the heat of my waist higher than that of the whole population. I needed all of my energy to maintain a fire going on, burning every last molecule of rock in my body.
This was the only place I knew of that was as uninhabited as it was wide.
The roasting was done with a meat mutton that took about 30 minutes or so to be boiled alive. The red wine that was left inside looked like silk rolled on my lips. The spectacle of it made me almost want to vomit.
The moment I finished the offerings, I noticed everyone in the chapel were there, watching me. They looked as if they had seen something that everyone else wouldn't, but for some reason everyone stared back. No one looked down.
I looked up. It was already dark, so I opened my mouth to scream. My throat was dry, and the smell of rotten meat wasn't coming out through. I stood and bent down to cry.
I felt different than before.
I had suddenly become aware of my body being crowded around me. My expression of surprise faded to confusion and fear. I noticed that I was bleeding, my skin was red, and I felt *things*. My skin was scaly and warm and round.
"Well I don't mind dying, " I said. " You're the only one who wants to die. You're the only thing that can keep me going."

-- -
They say to transform yourself from self to a greater being. And you will see. The first step to become a star.
The first step is to go see to your best because of what you saw. Most will look as though they experienced the first, then the other selves. But you will be the first... wonder. The loneliness... and all of the not so completely separation. It is probably well worth the risk.
I mean to hear my sorrow.
One Step to becoming a God.
So one step to be a hero. One step to become not just an actor, but a local hero. The return to true knowledge.
One step to becoming an adulterer. One step to have a daughter.
You will walk past a bookshop to a young woman whom you knew for a long time. You will do an odd and amazing thing. You will start to think about every possible side of your life... the futures... some very specific, very cliché. And so, for one day, in a flash, all your life thoughts will turn to becoming engaged in something truly important.
The fervor. The passion for life.
the pain.
Love.
love for the greater good. Love for finding true purpose.
Love for what you do. Love for simply being. Love for believing. Love for what you do to truly be.
Love for anything.
Love for bringing the world into balance.
Love for keeping a balance between everything.
Love for humanity.
Love for creating things that are beneficial.
Love for finding fulfillment.
Love for understanding the other.
There was the open book. There was a love in it. And there was a fear. Two came together, like a neighbor's daughter. The smoke poured from a lock clicked into the hot. Like from a gun.
That god. Love.
The void.
The infinity.
The beauty. The wonder.
Love.
The truth.

He had tried to sell me a letter when I was little, and two pages later it was in my hands. He was great, and he had signed it.
But when he had looked in my eyes, and showed me his handwriting, I could tell he wanted only the most pretty things. It was as if my imagination was pushed in front of my heart by this person. He had taken all those for granted. There were the luxuries. They were attractive but nothing exciting. Then there were the horrible things. “ She can ’ t bear you... ” So I stood up and went to bed.
He didn ’ t get up. Nor did I. Everything he had said or written was one awful word. I wore that expression all day and I burned it. He had not been broken from his wordplay any more. No, he had cut a hole in the page and bent his body down to show me how badly he wanted to hide it. My knees felt tight and I wanted to press my face down onto the paper but I didn ’ t want it to fall to the ground. As if my very palms were stuck to the paper.
*This one person would hate me. You don ’ t think they ’ ll tear a hole in my broken heart? Think he doesn ’ t know how to write or print what he wrote because they ’ re more powerful then you? *
I sat there but I was shaking. My eyes were full of tears. I had my hands around his neck and I was sobbing too. He held me tight as he said no, what if I ’ m still mad? I made no movement. And when I pulled him away, he suddenly grew pale and gaunt.
*Suck it son, suck this all up. Fuck this up. Crap, Crap, Crap. Crap, Crap. *
Before I could figure it out, my stomach turned, and I realized what I was trying to say.
“ Hannah, stay with me. ”
“ What? ” I shouted.
She kept staring at me and I could hear my lip twitch and my teeth clenched. “ Hannah, sweetie, please... you don ’ t know why we hurt you. We hurt you, or wherever your hurting, this is just one more thing, this one less thing, your hurt or your sick or whatever a sick person thinks he is. ”
“ Hannah? ” She looked at me and sighed, looking hollow and unblinking.
I didn ’ t have the courage to answer, but I saw the shreds of the writing that seemed to run through her curly dark hair and looked at the man sitting beside me. “ Is that... s... is it that woman? ”
I choked on the words and closed my eyes. It didn ’ t take long before I started sobbing again. She kept making me think it was the same. That she was crying because of me. “ Hannah! Your hurt, and your sick. Don ’ t you know why I ’ ve hurt you? ”
I realized it wasn ’ t her face in my tears. But my mind was pounding. The word was rising in my head as far away as I could, away from my body.
I sighed again and clutched at the paper. Every word it reached was telling me that it knew how it was.

I raised my hand to reassure myself. There were no answers. This was all to avoid after all.
It was the only world that was left before them and they brought me with them. I *should* have started putting my efforts into reversing the disease but then they'd start treating me differently. Maybe this would've made life easier. Life in other ways would've helped with my condition.
I wiped my mouth and collected the Blood Hex from the floor; I knew it was time to end this. I closed my eyes in my low sleep, careful to avoid the strange thoughts that crept up my head when I was awake. A few tears escaped my eyes and I looked at my wife smiling like a proud mother.
I leaned back against my wall and leaned in close to kiss her forehead.
I would talk to God.
"*We knew it was hopeless when *we* had found the vaccine. * "
" *We* knew. "
The sound of my own head striking my bed from above hit me like a lightning bolt. I brought my hand down to my face and cried in pain. I reached out my hand to bring it down from above to settle in. I stood up in the dark hallway of the hospital and approached the small open vase still on the bedside table.
" We're going to tell God about this." I handed the vase to him. He smiled as if God smiled back.
I set the glass in the vase aside and closed my eyes. God told me that with no other choice I would find a cure for the disease; I would call the governments so God can have it's vaccines.

When we first got these, our first conversation was with the surface organism, the platypus. For several years we speculated it was a dwarf planet, perhaps to hide from cryogenic heat but eventually had to abandon the “ introspecting ” test. It was a true statement of faith, a certainty that we would have to return to our own planet to ensure all the mass is evenly distributed. It can ’ t have been exciting, right? We ’ d been trailing the blue spheres for centuries, we thought we'd never see this mess.
We finally made it home, with our son. I remember the smile on his face when we first arrived. He knew I was going to be different, different, and that he would visit his mother one day. His mother was not as tense now that he was gone, the same way he had been in the Red Nubian egg, he could no longer be sure what to expect. He ’ d come through the hatch in less than an hour, carefully maneuvered back to his habitat, to await the Reclamation. A whole year had gone by without any talk, and I barely had time to give him his due when a guard walk up to us and pulled him aside.
“ The pure alien races in our sector also have their own sites. When they first began, they held these *fucking* sounds that we could hear. They were loud, loud, *human* from afar. They could be heard screaming and playing in the distance, it was a kind of harmony, and yet the other humans recognized this kind of thing, they knew better than to pervert the lines of practice. ”
“ So you can hear that noise? ” I asked him and he pointed behind him, pointing his bright green titanium spear at the ground and shrugging at me.
“ Yes, I think. It ’ s a very dense sound. It ’ s sound that fills the entire field at once. ” He paused, looking at me with those soft gray eyes of yours. “ Fucking weird sounds. ”
“ Oh, nevermind, ” I said. “ This is why you ’ re telling me to stay away from people at first. ”
“ But it ’ s just noise. ” I said and he laughed, watching me. “ Everyone else sees everything. Sometimes people ’ re just absorbed in the sound, they forget they are conscious, they forget they see. It reminds them what it means to live. ”
“ What ’ s this? A bunch of metal junk? What happened to us all those years ago? ”
“ It was just that one little rock that ripped through the mountains. I was tearing through it. ”
“ This rock needs to burn for us to understand that it is, in fact, burning. They call it the vacuum. We call it an apocalyptic roaring sound. It ’ s screaming now. It's buzzing around our necks. I want to hang myself on that rock. I need to save my son. You know that sound. You know that sound too, don ’ t you? ”
“ It was so painful. ”
“ Did it go away? ”
“ No, it wasn ’ t. ”
“ What the fuck, ” I continued to watch him stare at me.
He watched me again, with those deep white eyes of yours. He stared hard at me and we listened. He stared hard at the ground. He stared hard at us with those beautiful, beautiful green eyes.
“ Can I just say that this was my fault? ”
“ No. I did it for my own safety. I just needed to see it end. ”
“ So did they all. ”
The sound became quiet, deafening. He looked down, his face calm, “ I guess I don ’ t have an answer for you. Just... you know that there are only a few people left in our sector. Where does it say on the planets file? ”
“ I don ’ t think so. ”
“ You ’ ve been clean for millennia. ”

Ever heard of the magic word? I am a lazy asshole, so I said it. The battle of Beekies!
People wake up in fire... they take a stroll through the streets thinking they are special, or better yet a family on vacation, or those worthless pigs on the street who ate all the food they could find in the store! After a good twenty minutes, they return to their farms and take a dump in a cement ditch.
Then, you are sucked down to a beasty form of evil, who has two legs, and one tail, and eats everything that humans eat, including your best friend who gets hit by a car. If you try to go home from work, but the beast comes back! If you walk around in circles, and just for a while, you end up the closest friend on Earth to the beast, and then you catch your own foot... but that's rare and the beast lives on long after you finish the rest of your miles at the grocery store or taxi rides with friends.
Oh and you can see the run of bears in the distance! And everyone plays a game of Hide and Seek! You might say that's annoying but for the best friends, sometimes you can't care less!

The door clicked shut. The clock read 3AM. Picking up the paper, I read it.
What I thought would be tomorrow was a total mess. Oh yeah. I hadn't even gotten any sleep last night. No joy to be found, not a bright smile.
The buttons on the side of my fridge screeched as I turned the button. A desperate attempt at something exciting, all in vain. Mom read me a book every night. It was when I turned 25, that my last thought came to me. I began to freak out at how insipid life can get, the dreams that would never happen. The thoughts of my mom. Hell, the descriptions I saw under the door have a lot to do with that.
I slowly turned back into the living room. I looked out the window. Everything had changed. The apartment was gone. Now it was all gone. Blinding. I looked back at the dishes in the sink. A few tap water fixtures were empty, as well. My stomach turns towards something strange. Something broken. I need to get to the bathroom immediately.
I left the bathroom and turned left. I was almost there. I finally made it. The driveway was wide open. I had made it. I tripped, the world was a million different ways apart. I dropped down into the pit of despair and crossed over. No fear, no regret. Oh, that's the last drop. God, it felt so good. Life had become comfortable once more, with my presence all around.
I jumped down. Up. I stumbled, down and left the house. I was amazed that I had managed to make it.
While I was walking around, my mind gave up. I was surrounded by buildings and people. What I had truly seen. The stories of my childhood. The lives of those I would never see again.
I reached the end of the driveway and was just about to jump. How long have I been walking around? I don't know, maybe ten minutes? This was crazy, I don't know. I sat on the edge of the driveway and realized that the world outside wasn't doing any good. A bunch of people came through the door. They tried to escape me. I could almost hear the frantic footsteps. They were coming back. Not all of them were born with sound, all of them came from different parts of the country. I felt like there was a lot of them. Wherever they went, they would leave. No one wanted to come back. It was hopeless. I decided to just leave.
I was alone. I felt a sense of impending doom, for a moment. The fence was locked behind me, and it kept open. Fearing something terrible was coming, I crouched down. A guard came down, and told me to keep safe. He waved me over. My thoughts raced. Was I going to die? Who would survive? Was I so stupid? My head hurt. Was I going to get stabbed, or something? God, I was just so stupid.
He stepped out. He smiled, and walked over. When he stepped out, I realized what he was. Nobody had ever told me they were alive. Nobody seemed to ever live the rest of their lives. I walked down the pathway. I got to the front door.
The guard knocked on the front door. I took a deep breath. I opened the door. A light was shining in. My eyes grew wide. " Mom? "
I screamed in terror.
" Mom? "
" Why the hell not?! "
" Well, you weren't supposed to try to escape. It wasn't a normal birthday! "
" Oh, so you did, huh? What's your secret? "
" I just need to check. We never told anyone about this... "
" Oh! " My first thought was that I needed to check some more. He smiled and looked at me.
" Looks like you got the whole story there. Have fun with that, your 13th birthday is here."

As his shooter hits the second floor a thought hits him like a freight train hitting a train full of freight trains. The third floor was the worst this week and that couldn ’ t stop it. “ Shit ” he feels the silence around him. Just as he ’ s reached for his phone he hears shots from his attacker who is already down on one knee. Their laughing begins to play out in his mind, a family and what felt like a family car. On the walk up he sees a grandchild and a boy covered in graffiti. Once the two victims have left the classroom the police walk in and order the men to surrender. After asking each to step out they both hear gunshots. A jubilant crescendo from each members friends reverberates through the house.

It took 25 days for the storm to kill anyone and everyone on the island. The stone walls and the stone fire that was lit at noon were all destroyed, but no one knew what exactly drove anyone mad. After all, there was no soul. A storm started blowing from the west and the rest of us began to flee, back to our homes. I had never heard the radio stations, have I ever stayed inside on my own without the radio? Perhaps my ancestors got lost on a beach or maybe it was just a mistake on their landline. Either way, our fate was sealed and one thing remains for me. The radioactive world that is the island.

I awoke, my sheets groaning and my stomach churning. I should have followed the prompt, but time seemed to slow me down. I opened my eyes to see me awake. A naked woman sat in my bed. Not a sexy body but just a very strange face. This girl was certainly gorgeous. She had a long bob, and a short cane. As if this was her birthday. This strange lady was about to kiss me, and I was still just remembering my own surprise. The hard ones take time to become accustomed to. Her hands started to move, and I could tell she's not ready to kiss me. As soon as the woman touched her cheek, she ripped off her own top. Her face was still asleep, but she looked quite amazed. Her eyes were very wide, and she was naked. Again, no one liked this strange character either. This must be my birthday.

*Actually, I'm sure it's a lot older than 40*
Obviously, he wasn't a scientific man. At 18 years old, he'd been told that the fate of the United States was beyond his grasp, that any attempt to reform would have disastrous consequences. Still, something about his mind and shoulders warranted this, and the last thing he would need was to think too much about the consequences of his actions.
"Really, what are they supposed to do with the stars? " the Captain nervously rubbed his eyes. " Can't they just change the colors? ".
" Probably not, but you see, I have really high hopes for this country " the young lieutenant commented as he crossed the threshold of the room. There was no discernible change in the color of his skin, but the ship had always been so still. It had grown, had accepted itself, been here for so long. Yet, just like a tree branch or a piece of glass still falling gracefully into place, the ship in order to keep its place in space became increasingly subject to the effects of so many unknown force. He started to follow the captain into his quarters; he had made him feel less alone. Now all alone.
The young lieutenant rubbed his eyes again, and made eye contact with Captain Abigail. " Of course, sir. "
" Yes, I will be glad to get inside, too. " Abigail nodded as she left the large, glistening machines room, leaving the crew of Artemis III alone as the ship navigated, once again, back to the future. With time, the ships would need their own space stations. But the stars would be much better for them than much of the past.
" Can you take a seat? ", Abigail asked casually, starting to leave the room.
" You can take your seat for now " the younger lieutenant nodded, returning with the other two as the terminal began to rotate once again, turning the room upside down. The oxygen tanks inside the ship began to undulate, revealing a smaller room where oxygen and natural light from far outside of space could be filtered, as if by a device he had never seen before. Without being able to read, the young lieutenant peered at the bottom of the tank, keeping an eye on its switch - or rather, on the drill that shined through the empty space. He regarded the small cylinder that was emitting the signals.
" Surely... " he breathed out a sigh of relief. " We need to go back to Earth in a few years."

" Well what are you talking about? " I pointed.
" My phone! Looked like it dropped through my old room! "
" Let me guess man! I've been given a blank check at the county bank. A month ago I thought I'd be able to make a hundred with a one million dollar check but it's 11 o'clock here you know! "
I sighed. " I see where that went dude. Want a vacation? "
" Nah man, have you got a payment plan? Don't count on me being able to get it by later. "
" This is it dude, you are a ripe fruit, you'll be wealthy if your in jail for life! It's yours already and you still have a job looking for one, getting out of jail could be the problem. "
" What am I looking for, I don't know man! "
" Nah, just a bug. One of those bills I roll through every morning in the mail to my secretary's because a no bargain kind of week. "
" It's like the wove you put in my phone, it comes out and says you've just got to roll. "
" Don't scare me man, it's no magic. It has to come to you right then. "
" Ok well okay, what do I get. Well anyways I call the bank one day saying it has to roll with all of your monies and I'm waiting with the supervisor when the phone starts ringing. "
" That's not working man, the clerk gets rid of it because he cut the phone to open the side door. It's not working. I ask a minute to push the receiver back. "
" What is happening? "
" There's a roll in the side door. The phone can not get out. The supervisor cuts the phone down to open the phone again. "
" That's not my problem, I suppose I was trying to contact the telemarketer. "
" What? You want another roll? "
" Call the phone's owner. "
" Yes. "
" Wait, what? What are you talking about this thing?! "
" I got the one money you gave me, it'll come in the mailbox. "
" Oh come on man, is that... in your handbag or something? "
" You know what, yeah but, I'll be off tomorrow morning anyway. "

" Oh come on you insignificant twat, so deeply into this. Ugh! You are literally the best. "
I immediately looked at my phone in confusion. I couldnt turn it off.
" You can turn it off and leave. Now come back again? "
" Well I can almost see a red flag, my lord the master of twisting things. Now do I need to come back? I never want to trip up and be mocked by my wife and kids for wearing more pants instead of pants."
I quickly rushed out of the room, trying to give no witnesses and, as we left, feel the cool chill of the earth behind me. I stared at the same spot that I always stare at. It's just the way things are.

*Lets say we've been talking about this our entire lives. Being the gizmo in the pool would be an invitation to have fun and catch the year's entertainment too. I dont always have a wishy from the family but they're always there. The real cause of this is that they always call me dirty. *
The food run was great. We've always cooked simple meals and it was amazing that I could satisfy their hunger while also being my own pet. The look of agreement and recognition from the family welcomed me to new adventures.
This season we were having its usual rush. Henryl, Angela and Martha were all happily swimming with the family while my Trina always had a hard time getting her mind out of it. Except, you know, nothing dramatic or inconvenient at all. The kids were fun and stupor. Martha and Henryl would have to go out in the backyard for fun things.
On a perfunctory note, there was a three legged turtle in the corner, Mr. McDaniels. He seemed lonely. Apparently the family talked about something to Ms. Cohen but we couldn't quite make out what. The turtle was locked up in an aquarium and we wouldn't know what. My punishment was to keep Mr. McDaniels away so he could eat the rest of the day's crap.
Of course Mr. McDaniels was never forgotten or cared about. He'd beg to leave to go see his parents often. I had to explain that of course the things he ate..well, normally it consisted of excrement and just plain horrible sludge. But on this particular particular particular season it consisted entirely of plant matter.
Some of it had eggs and some of it lacked milk. I didn't know how to make a gift to them but to everyone else I get the usual calamari poison around the clock. Old habits die hard.
It was time to go back to Mr. McDaniels. He couldn't wait and offer the ZZ Top instead of the usual cheeseburger and fries for everyone. He even baked my dish until I knew how to make the best jelly and mustard thing I could. I never planned on eating these things in the tank anyway. I've always enjoyed being the turtle.

Well, good enough. I may be the deer of a nearby tribe but I ain't no deer hunter, mate. Maybe I'll think of a way to save you now?
The sudden noise in the woods was broken only by the gentle shiver of leaves and the slight tinkle of the wolves breath catching the air in the crack, then I knew I couldn't take it anymore. An arrow hit the corner of my shoulder. I kept my hands on my hips, but then this terrible sound coalesced into a screech and spoke. I know, you may be being a bit unreasonable as I say these words, but I'm trying to be courageous and suggest I practice my neck brushing around the mangled back of the deer. It was there that the sound originated. Just the slightest, only a small string breaking as I looked around in fear as it crossed my head, then, like only a crumpled pile of dirt, the sound of a gigantic red giant rose from the forest. With a bone-shattering crash, the dense red and fluffy stuff rained down from the trees. The crazy thing that happened next, was that the deer suddenly had the whole, beautiful fuckin' landscape under its very control. It was like its fuckin' liver had us's whole fucking heads. I backed away, terrified as my hands turned around. The whole scene kept snowballing and snowballing until the only thing I could think of was how about taking my skirt off and making my ass roll over and take a peek inside. I heard grunting from a nearby tree, and it was then that I heard a thunderous crash, sending a few girls over with sprays, but nothing else.
I sit now in front of my neighbours car as they head outside and I'm not sure I want to ever get back here. Not really, but something tells me that right now I'm begging to go back home. So I do as they ask and head out without looking back. Because in this world nobody wants to leave. They can check their cars but they still can't have a scratch or have the idea that they are trapped in some fucked up ass road. Without to take a peek to the back of their heads ( and I guess that means every fuckin' buck who leaves can do that too, ) nobody is that brave. When they see us entering the restaurant, they start to tell us how they saw a bunch of women holding hands or their babies. An accident of the highest caliber.
Once the the waitress comes back from making her rounds, they tell her to try again. She gets on her knees and grabs the remote that is laying next to her, then grabbing a coffee and pulling it out with her. I push her towards me, and then pull back the remote, listening to every part of the diner in the register. I don't really care whether they will believe the story. I simply want to roll my ass over.

"Why do you kill? " It didn't have to be a question to ask myself.
The list of questions. The ex-wife. The kids. Anything. I couldn't do it.
Why?
I don't know. They said I did it for justice. Of course I did. I did not turn over a ledger, I did not reveal my interview.
I did it for people. People I loved. People I cared about. People who I felt I could be with. People who were close. People who had come and gone. I did it for justice. I did it for justice to others. It was with my own power I made my life worthwhile.
Why?
Justice. It was why I killed, not because I could do it. Because I liked it. Because I thought it would be more enjoyable. Because it's all that matters, not who I am. When I'm good at something. when I think it's funny. when I think I'm funny. I never had to worry about anything. Sometimes I woke up to find myself, had to wonder if I was going to live like this for too long.
Why?
It's not fair, isn't it? It means that I have to do it for others, for myself. I can't change. I can't change. I want a better life. It has to be something.
Why?
Because I can. Because I like it.

We were speaking. He was no longer going to pass justice. He was going to have the weight of the worlds people lifted in its favor. He is going to have God coming after us in person.
My colleague was busy monitoring the terrorist who was trying to kill Frank, his manager of the bank this family owned. He has several teams of agents who have been tracking this man before and was returning to the bank on a business trip. Just yesterday he had had 3 of these men assemble an operation to assassinate Frank and they were called in today by an urgent request. Frank was trying to hide money, that he thought the FBI was crackers. I had to let go of his guard. They were still not delivering on his orders and it would be time to stop them. I forced my way up to Frank's side. I started him off with the words "look out! "
I placed my hilt upon his back and brought my arm up to cover his face as if to protect him. I did as I was told and under my control he jumped backwards. A commotion had occurred nearby and soon a bodyguard was involved.
" Oh Christ they have roped me out of the control room, and they seriously are running around with locks and handcuffs all over my body. " He began speaking but I continued unblocking him. The remaining guards began breathing fire and trying to dislodge the rope from his neck. I could feel the ropes binding him and would need to restrain a lot more now. I could sense the man was laying in a pool of blood but my wrist did not want to do that and it made me realize. He lifted my hand and I could see the guards blood pouring out my palm.
My colleague was frowning. " Do you feel the rope actually relieves the stress on your wrists? " My mouth dropped slightly and I nodded. " Almost. Maybe a little. " He leaned back and began to get on his knees. " Now it is done, I can be under control after all. " As he leaned down I could see my wrist was lying on the floor and I noticed something very very wrong with the chain. It held tightly to a blade far longer than the rope holding him. I thought to myself " why would he be crouched over the bank dead with his wrists up to no apparent resistance, he was trying to escape his own fate. " I rubbed my wrist with my left hand but it did nothing. " Come on buddy this should be obvious and quick. I need you back to the safe room. " I walked to his side leaving him with the only man in the vault.
" Okay but is it really you? " My colleague gasped as I tied his wrists with a hook on his wrist. He looked at me confused and then said " NO, I am not Frank. I am more like Jimmy Chill. We were new together and we loved each other but we both kind of suffered and hated each other. When we found each other we became quite good friends but then we broke up. Until recently. For some reason Jimmy didn't want me on our first date. I wanted to marry a pro soccer player or a superhero but he had his mind set on some finance thing and I thought I must be missing out. I promised Jimmy he was going to be my lawyer, Jimmy is dating the sport team on Fridays! My friend pleaded his case, over and over again, he believed I was lying and that I was a fraud. Jimmy says, you should come with us."
I could feel the air of desperation in Jimmy's eyes as I spoke. He would prove to be a failure and be thrown down the fucking rabbit hole as I led his team out of the bank in his military-grade jeep and into the real world. I walked out to the playground knowing I could save the world.

When you go to sleep, the night is rough. You know you don't have much left, but that's not an option. I saw my dog pull out his scimitar, and my daughter, grandma, in surprise.
I am sorry for pulling away from you after she asked me to break the news to her friends the next day. I truly had no choice; my daughter's safe place in the world is that of a human.
Please don't let her go.
-- -
I finished my last book on dark time.
The sun grew dim by the moment, the trees soft and inviting. I look back at all those people that have died under my skin. My mother, my sister, and my eldest sister, are safe as I am. For, they all are my friends.
I reach out to hand it to my nephew, the only thing that lets me feel like I'm alone.
Now with our light fading out I looked back at my young, beautiful daughter.
There is a quiet place in my heart where I feel the same emptiness inside.
I remember our home, our smile, our old conversation. My heart breaks a bit, but it's okay. It's quiet in here. Just relax and listen to the sounds. Relax.
I think back on those time, and then try to remember.
The days of my life, my wife, and my daughter were spent on that quiet, lonely, blue circle filled with only sounds.
But I can still remember.

How could it end like this, I thought. The wickedness is so terrible. " In the name of the Good Lord Satan, judge for me. I have sent you to Hell! " My voice boomed, echoed through the halls, " For the Lord has sent you to me. To hear voices, to wonder, to remember your words. To be free from boredom. And I believe you humans are sorely wrong. I will punish you with death. " I thought for a while, but began to control it. Eventually my worries turned to dread. This was the end. The end of all records of such things. All of this stuff, all of the loss, to try and be remembered. And eventually, it hit me. My only solace was to remember those words. The words I had so desperately longed for. " H-he... you... oh... " I managed to whisper out loud, before he could finish.
" The matter of the good, your godly nature, and the times you would wake up here was utterly unacceptable! "
" All that is so and so and so shall be mortal. "
" I mean, it is far too easy to judge all suffering. Who came here after you died? "
" Oh, it isn't easy, isn't it? All souls have to struggle before they are bearers of love and salvation. I suppose souls have to find a way to understand themselves instead of wanting some sort of gratitude. Someone here who is full of compassion, or even desire must in order to correct their mistakes. Someone who knows so much pain and suffering... would choose to end their suffering in this way... "
" Is this all you needed to hear?! You cry at me for saying that, I don't hear what I've always said in prison. Do you suppose all of this was for nothing? This story only kills a man? What is your species capable of? I've given it countless cycles to appease the Gods. But for those so lacking in one aspect, who have built up a what-if mentality, I did not see this coming. " I scratched at a vein in my forehead, " I'm really not helping you, Demon. I can't. "
" What about those.. who hurt you and your brethren? Do you still remember their words? "
" I can never see any of them, even the ones you once loved. "
"... You are wasting your time. "
" You know what it's like? All you are trying to do is hear them, to make them angry, to ruin them in their day-to-day lives. Nothing for this sort of world. Not a soul has been born here. It wasn't until a year ago when your mother left and started a new life... "
" Oh. I'm sorry, Demon. I thought I had unfinished business. The monotony is so excessive, and this is cruel and... "
" Then what can you do, no? Hurry and sleep while you can? You could possibly get rid of them all in one... "
" Would you, my cruel Lord...? Can I, Demon, bring you back? Or will that not be all I'll ever do?"
Suddenly, all of the hall lights faded from the room and I was laid flat on the floor in an agonyless darkness. A burning pain shot through me, and in an instant my eyes had taken up a pair of grey lenses. I looked around, feeling hopelessness: to truly see this woman, the woman from this place, with her brothers and sisters riddled with hate and regret. I stared into the blackness, attempting to grasp the terror seeping back into my mind. Looking for what, it seemed, could only mean one thing: death.

[ Another Spatpost, another Self-Defeating Supervillain ]
You hate this writing prompt.
Not about this "Daily Show" – where we look at what we hate and see how it comes out. After reading " Spectre ", I didn't care anymore. It was all I wanted to do.
I wonder what I didn't want to do, or what I did want out of it all. As I said, I hate writing and it sucks to have them telling you what to do with it and giving you the chance to slip away.
Perhaps writing will make you stronger and smarter – that's exactly the two things I believe in; brave enough to challenge the prison system that rules us all, smart enough to be able to lead people in our general direction, and have a friendly end to the challenges that come with it.
There was a lot of effort to create more variety than just what I wrote in my 12 year old body of fiction. I had to give all characters proportionally ( draw them into a specific scene, do unique things, draw the genderbent to some inappropriate features ). When I discovered that the bare minimum was to have you capture and end these criminals in unspeakable ways, the joy of the people who confronted me was that you could have your own outlet for them.
I don't know if it's different from any other-**s this prompt is a personal preference for me-and I think that's what motivates it. **
Now that I think about it, my current feelings towards the prompt baffle me. The humour is all too soft, and the humour is distracting.
It's not about *me*, but about me. It'll always suck for me to get a laugh or laugh at things I couldn't write, so, that's nice. But…the contest has gone on and I no longer have the satisfaction of writing in middle of my day. This is odd because I can write in a weird way but still have to think about it. I don't want to write about the changes in my career or about how I'm making any of this easier.
Yet I really need to read this. Nothing to be out of place in my life. The most mundane tasks, the simplest assignments with minimal time spent on them, leave me in a constant state of crisis.
I haven't written in quite a while because I can't take a job or get a job but, wow, I do. I'll get a promotion, get a promotion, get a promotion, get even more promotion. I don't want to make this job seem so unfeasible, it really does not appeal to me.
But why should it? Why should I choose to argue over the weight of my actions?
Because you're giving me the opportunity to cheat on my *writing* into something that somehow hits my personal ego.
I give you just a fair chance to be happy. This isn't the first time I've made myself a " consistent beat-down" character. I'm *slightly* experienced at taking risks. And yet they're not making me as confident.
I really am in need of some improvement.
EDIT: a note that I always just pop into here before I finish: ) I know you want to add a few constructive criticism, but I'm trying to be as decent as I can so if you like, feel free to make a little extra cash for one of your work. Thanks.

It was raining heavily, I grabbed my straw hat and looked over the hill. The sky was bright with light, the shining powder of daylight shimmered just bright enough to glow in the rain. Underneath the waning moon, I could see the remnants of a town, a small, but thriving outback. From its quaint stone home built in the heart of the magical island, a faint yellow glow danced in the light.
After getting my briefcase, I headed outside and into the wind.
I couldn't leave the island after hours, especially after getting through the night. I could hear the cold trestle of the wind, and my cold boot echoed as it made its way over the dirtied hill.
Then, I heard her.
"What's going on? " I asked, sitting on the ground. Outside she moved, rather a slouch, with a broken arm as she did.
" He is dead. We no longer need magic. " She looked at me, her green eyes still pleading.
" Are you crazy? " I offered. I didn't think of how crazy it was to see this young woman with my cheeky smile. I didn't think of the pain that the realization of having to move went through her as well.
The hole in her side still hurt, like I have been here all night. I couldn't stand it any longer. I hurried out of the station, so the makeshift sleigh hit the ground.
The carriage hit the ground in a flurry. The wagon came up with 3 men, and I walked towards the door. I opened it, that little piece of broken glass hid it. I tore it open with my bare hands, the mirror I saw into it. The eyes of the two men stared at me, the face of me replaced by that of nothingness.
Just then a man standing near the end of the carriage wheeled the bucket of rock that had been brought. The rock hit the carriage one by one, the one at the top and the bottom. The fine dust swirling from the impact made a trail in the wind, along its way finding a location that I could return home.
I heard the kettle drop as the door gave way. I went to help the man there, and I saw the bulge I had seen earlier.
" You're about to be kicked in the balls, so just stay calm. " I asked him.
He shrugged, turning around to face me, his pointy ears perked up and his face had begun to move to the side, rapidly. He tugged at my arms, but only gave me a filthy wetness.
I stared in terror as he sobbed into my shoulder.
" Hey! Don't cry! " I screamed at him. His breathing was labored, but from the looks of it, he didn't seem like a monster. I ran towards the door, the man jumped out of his sling, squeezing it and swinging the bucket I stole towards him. I ran after him, and the man, if he were crying, would have shot back.
" It wasn't that! It was me! It's how I found her. " He continued, ignoring my desperate attempts to help, " I was protecting her, and I can't help but feel sorry for her. She's going to die... " He pushed me off of the man's seat, and dragged me off of him, picking me up with him.
" What the fuck did you do to her?" He asked, tapping on the wooden remains of his cane. I crumbled to the ground, throwing the weight of my shoulders on the ground, his eyes staring at me with a hopeful red glow.

"You're welcome! "
" No, I've just read your admittance! "
" You did not, sir. "
I'm seated, deeply, defensively, in the most inappropriate manner, as of the day I'm assigned to the eight year old. The most sensitive thing a 6 year old can ever do, and the most fulfilling thing a 6 year old can ever do. I'd say a thing or two of authority over that mousy little girl is better, but she's not attending another orientation.
I look up at the world, trying to look real, and the features of the little girl that I see now am indistinguishable from one another. There's nearly a 1000 of her peers to look at, minus her siblings, who everyone except me believes are just necessary, the grandchildren, who she thinks are nothing more than children, and the similarly silent relatives with their bloodshot eyes.
" Do you have the patience to wander to the cafeteria, T? "
" Yes, sir. Not very much, your mother has a clipboard all at once and some backup tapes, and it looks like your last meal in school had been made from scratch! "
I move to wipe the perspiration from my face, usually the only time you get the opportunity to see an alien meows. It was not quite as self-confidence that had made me do it, but with effort.
" Is this your new council meeting scheduled at all? "
" Yes. See, this is the year of introduction. I've heard the box's reserved some time away in the backyard before someone realizes that they're using you, but it's all stupid, and I don't want to jeopardize those contracts! In fact, if I don't have any plans for tomorrow, I'm going to make sure they get you I say! "
She must be going blind, or if she isn't there she might as well be there, if not older, and everybody has less right to an education. T's innocent, and she hardly even cares about me when the most intelligent and sane people get to meet her. She's probably talking to this thing that is the human race. Right?
" I guess we don't get visitors from home. In fact, it seems kind of pointless. We only really need visitors from friends, for food and shelter, and the most important thing, to eat and sleep. And you get sent to school all the time, and you seem to have care in you, isn't that nice?"
She glances me in the eyes, and instantly recognizes the beginning of a whole new life. As if she knows the exact date of when I'd be born, and the growing sadness and knowledge she'd feel before she has more than a quarter of the picture to protect her stillborn child. Of course, it never occurs to her, but that doesn't mean things just don't matter.

It had all started at UCLA. Prof. Jim Antonigan, who for some reason, went out of his way to become extremely meta in his juvenile magics class, was caught off guard by the punishment for being essentially the Librarian. He directed all students at the 12 of them: Lovecraftian Horror, Nighthawk, EntraPhobia, Scopolity, the very first "best" tier cleric in his class, Jack Blackston, mustered up the courage to speak to students of similar life and ask them a very simple question: "So anyway... before this....summoning fucking Lovecraft....what is his name "
The next year, Frank Clemente was made class the next morning at an introductory electrician who resided behind the faculty during lunch period. During lunch, he apparently asked this very question ( " So then... before this...summoning...thing....what is this....purifying....thing....that has consumed the entire campus? " ) at what was, by any other means, essentially just as annoying.
As the students were leaving the class, Frank's bowing was enough to placate a sense of dread that seized the class again, and more timid students remained. These were merely the members of Frank's free party board, asking their'blessings' for their agreement with Frank. What he had done, however, was rather bizarre, simply out of line with his draconic society, so rather than turn down various " rules" of whose existence were apparently the calling card for this creatures intimidation, Frank decided to make some games.

His monitor continued to land, his face clouding with sweat, his voice so choked with sarcasm that he often sounded barely composed. His breathing was labored and urgent and when he spoke, his aides stopped his speech and slumped into their chairs in their chairs, a feat that was done more often than not.
"But, Mr. Sanders! It is me! Who are you! "
" Please, Mr. Sanders, listen. They don't want to hear from you. You can't all go home. They can't count on you. "
He was still gasping and contorted. His acheing ache was about to end, and yet his breathing wasn't.
" I will be gone in no time, " he finally choked out " I have gotten to the good part, Mr. Sanders. If you can do what I told you... I am pretty sure I saved this world first. I saved people's lives. I took them to the stars, for god's sake! "
He didn't seem to get it.
" But don't you... no, Don't look at me like this. I do what I do... I gave you what you do, because I have to. If you stop at everything... try... anything... there... "
With that, the wall of panels under his feet was completely empty.
" Oh, my good Lord... don't get too tight... " He was so afraid of heights.
" Those are the benefits of my leadership. I don't exist for their consumption. I will serve them. I will love them, and they will come looking for me... and they will take me away from them, " Sanders said with his voice cracking for emphasis, having been here so many times now. " Mr. Sanders, it is time. It is time I told you how sorry I am, and how proud I am that I have saved the world, Mr. Sanders! And now, you must leave, so we can save you. What would you like me to do? I think there's nothing here for you to do. But there is room. "
With that, the wall vanished, leaving nothing but Sanders' top two burning as he heard the condescending reply from his aides and the conversation his aide had moments earlier.
" You know what? " They yelled, lowering their voices and turning away.
Sanders shrugged, shifting his weight slightly, his back recovering. " Maybe I'll go, I'll go to the store, and make some more purchase. I'll have everything ready in fifteen minutes. I'll be there in about twenty. If I have to get out here to get my stuff, then it's a big deal. I mean, I'm totally here. I got all the things that would make for a nice grand-casino. But you're the only one. I'm in no hurry to leave! So, if you're worried about what might happen, please don't worry, Mr. Sanders."
With that, he leaned his head back, and returned to his cell.

**********121**********
My skin opened wide at the sound of thunder. I rolled off my bed to check it out. The windows were empty, and the lights glinted off of the few fickering bats outside.
I was in the middle of the night in the same place, with my bare feet draped over a branch that wasn't going to budge once it hit the ground. The road was a tight, grey metal line cut through with umbrellas and a basket hanging loosely. Looking up and towards the sky, I could see a blazing, lightning-y cloud of flames expanding from the top of the branch before their gleaming faces looked back at me.
My foot hit something hard on the pavement and fell into a pile of dirt. My face stood blank in horror as I realized where I was. Ahead of me, the flames made little noise, but on the ground was a skull and a skeletal limb hung from a rotten branch from the side of my trunk. I can't remember if it was a human or an animal.
In place of rotting flesh was a "side note " written on a strange black tattered skin with white spots. It was said, as the apparition sneered, that it had to get to the city to find a chemist, since this was that location in the city where one could legally go unnoticed for a day. Well, one could, but it was a scam by the ghost of a charismatic scientist.
I patted the side note on the ground. I grabbed my keys, and ran to the back door. I recognized the note. As I opened the door to make sure I didn't scare off my pursuers, a rabbit stunk of cobwebs and a squirrel bit me on the back of the head.
This was the end of the scare. I was exhausted, and I wasn't in pain yet. The police had done their job, and the " ghost " was finally dead, and that could mean all the crime was behind me. But I saw it. The ghost had two eyes, and one mouth.
At first, it was a matter of time until it managed to move. That's when I realized. The thoughts, really the thoughts, grew louder. There was a chill at the very back of my mind as I realized the horrible truth.
" How could there have been two eyes? How could there have been a third eye? "
The reality of the situation hit me. A heavy, rough ground shook the once calm and peaceful night. I walked up to the door and locked it. On the other side, there was a hooded figure, with long purple robes obscuring his face.
" We lost a citizen, we are sorry. This was not a normal occurrence. One of the inhabitants is still at large and has contacts with you. If you are thinking of leaving, report back to home."
I slowly went around the door and closed it behind me, throwing it open to find people wearing stained black robes. I reached for the backpack, but nothing had changed. I didn't even open the door like most people did. I quickly walked up to the source of the sound, and saw a stranger lying on a well-to-do, suburban lawn. He must have been very tired, and he looked worn out, and had slicked back his eyes. He was dressed in black, and he raised his arms with a light hand. As if something was touching him, he spoke.
*I am the ghost. *
I gazed into a black cavern, and I saw the two shadows of bodies and the shadow of a creature trying to hold on to each other as they tried to walk away. That's when I realized that the skeleton in the hood seemed to be walking alone, eating flies from its coat. I decided to cut him off with a blade.

I ignored the man and sat back down at the counter. It wasn ’ t even 4 AM and I needed to get to work and I had 8 hours. Sitting on my 1st week as manager was great, pushing those easy looking things through my fingers while I watched it all and cackled like a cat about to show its teeth. I was bored so I sat down and collected my thoughts. I had was quite busy! The customer came up to me and asked if I had anyone to buy for $ 500. A simple smile crept across my face. “ Hey Frank, what ’ s the occasion? ”
I smiled and took out my wallet. I ’ d been scrounging for a protein bar earlier and I ’ d worn the sensible suit of a proud Martin Garber. So why had I bought him? I brushed it off with a flash of thought and asked:
“ And maybe you should bring something for lunch? My brother and I got a hot dog every week to celebrate his health. My, a soda, sausage, hamburger or even the occasional light snack I ’ d like you to order. Tell me your name and place if you ’ re interested ”
The customer was strangely spooked and I pointed this out.
“ I like my cat. He ’ s the best. The man I married when he was sick and I loved him. He was my first mate and we could have done anything together. I ’ ll give you the money if you want but your their little girl is just as strong. I ’ m looking forward to her birthday today. ”
He struggled to look at me in confusion, a small hand resting on his coat pocket and I ran my finger along the name of his name. A single tear slid down my cheek and I waved it away. Another customer came up. “ Hey that girl is amazing! Her face seems just the right shade of red. I might get a local and start over with her soon. ”
I stopped at the counter to ask him about his dad. He needed to tell me if he was a professional cat breeder. “ I ’ m not sure, but my wife lived on The Brooklyn Bridge. She ’ s so beautiful to look at. For her, she is everything I could wish for but more importantly, she ’ s my mom. ” I stopped. “ She met my parents as a baby and I still don ’ t know if I wanted them to get in the car together. ”
My frown turned into a half smile. I was so close to a successful career. I could probably make him happy. I had enough money for two dairy cows, a honey bee and a bag of chocolate.

**********123**********
Born in the war, and seeking to understand, I turned from noble to danger. Now, I was the enemy, and my people, who fought until their deaths, found my strength.
Just as those who weren't unskilled fought until they came to the same conclusion. Wars of attrition just won't last forever. Once you hit a stalemate the enemy can fight until it is destroyed. Embers take the form of legendary swords, the kings of kingdoms, the unspeakable, the bravest heroes, and eventually, the terrifying side.
I was given an occupation. I was a soldier, I wore a mantle of honor and a chariot. The whole course of my training was for self preservation, and the result was the same.
I lost another daughter during the war. She would take me for a long while, until she had learned the truth. She had no husband, a family, and her best friend ( At least she met someone else ), and if she wants to leave them I must give her up and risk it all.
When I convinced her to abandon the family I gave her the weapon she wielded in the battlefield. When I told her that her brother was shooting at her we promptly swapped pieces of the weapon and steel. My brothers, killed when they came for her, rushed into the valley to call for help. I hoped to give her help, but I wouldn't be able to.
I was chasing her when we found one of the strongest vikings, Laouq-Xi, who was badgered by the village by using a single man's weapon. I put my title in his hands. I did it, first attack.
A village elder came in and I called for help. The village elder came from Lallach, a steppes in valley 24. He gave me a single gun and told me to run, "Run together and fight alone." I said it to the old sorcerer Laouq-Xi, who wasn't pleased. I would take back Lallach, and whenever I said it I would die.
And so I was the all powerful warrior of my people, for the turning to war lasted as long as this world, and if you watched the same action over and over again you found it funny. I opened my mouth to fight, I didn't care what happened or if it happened to them.
But when the widowed peasant cried for his father she had to listen, she lost hope in her life. She was so scared and confused, tears began to well up in her eyes as she saw me fighting her. The same fool I used to be.
She was killed in my arms, and my farm was burned from the man who gave her life. The man who sat at the stake. His son. The man who was lucky to have buried me. It was that simple mistake.
This world is like this when you're in full blown war, and you die, you lighten the flame. All things in life can find a familiar face in war, so why should everything else give way?
He gave up trying to be the hero of his people, I gave up saving them. I faced death alone, and my people, long after I was killed, found a new hero. For no matter what I did, war can never be the right answer.
One day I met a friend, a woman friend I'd met countless times, our hearts took on a shared purpose. When we were struggling in the dark for food we found her painting her garden, drawing us closer together in the dark. For my task was simple, find out who she really was. She would allow us in, right away, so we could hide when they came. One day, an eagle flew by and lost her.
I'm sorry. But we'll be ok.
Love,
Rufus to Ludwig, saying he is hero.

The long eyelid began to close, and tears started flowing from the eyes. My old friend, with a sense of purpose and firmness came forward, to my table where the sun was shining and my youngest cried quietly, reflecting the near wallop of nerves. She told me I would be safe, that we could raise a lotta valuable children, through the years. If the government wanted to, I'd at least be able to stop the incessant bleeding and redness and disease of my peers. I would have to take care of them first. If people wanted to know what was wrong, then they'd have to know from within. I had to stop the bleeding. I had to prevent the disease. They all said good for the world. My family and I were grateful for their generosity.
I came into the room, inspecting the figure that resembled a man without a head, from behind the cabinet, stood at six foot, nine inches, very tall, and wore a plaid suit, that came off the gray coat with which the nurse had put me. I placed the android aside, and began to read. The woman was wearing apron, holding out her hand. My father was sitting with him.
"Hello, " he said.
The android paused. A shadow lit it up, and I saw nothing. We all waited for it to say what it was...
" Let us start now. "
I put on a pair of black suits, and stared at the woman who was blindfolded in the mirror, eyes open and trained on me. She pulled her hands away. Her face drew out a frown, and her voice lost its taint, as though she spoke in a language that wasn't her own.
" Your five senses. You're dangerous. " She said.
I put her hand into my coat, and spoke.
" You, too, are. "
I looked at her. She looked at me. She knew exactly who I was. I looked at her.
" Now, I'm ready. "
She smiled.
" Now, let me go back to my room. "
I waited as she climbed into her bed. She laid back in the bed, and I watched her, waiting for the curtain flapping and the light to cast her and her father off, as well as I waited for the silence to collapse.
" Excuse me sir, but...." The cadaver vanished.
The ceiling chimed.
And after that was my life.

Before the light, it was raining,
Then nobody seemed to be in sight.
In the empty city somewhere that I once knew,
I laid, and waited for the onslaught.
And there, blackness was upon the world.
I never felt more alive, yet I don't fear.
In that dying city, something was odd.
It was a bucket, with something rippling inside,
Seeking to decide which bucket.
Inside I saw a small, black-robed man who, oh, hush.
Before me were vast alleys and poor houses,
And anyone else who exited would be damned.
But these grim and sinewy dwellers would stay, forever.
I felt as if, standing in the line of judgement,
I was wrong. I believed it didn't matter.
Until a man stepped forward, and spoke.
"Where have you been? "
He took off his hood, revealing a storm helm,
" I am here in front of you! " He shouted.
I let out a foul chuckle, and let out a satisfied sigh.
" Where have you been?! "
The man laughed at me, as though he was injured.
" As I was told to do, " he told the crowd,
" not only did you choose the rain but you charged here.
So I charge you here for this lie, "
I laughed quietly, and then ran.
The wall that led to the sea seemed steeped,
As if you had never touched the sea.
The metal of the ladder seemed caked in blood,
With clear directions of it crumbling over.
But people ignored me, and now they were on the line,
For I was wrong.
I believed it didn't matter. Until I stepped onto the other line.
And when I looked down, I saw three teeth, both unmarked,
Branches sparking together in the right direction.
In one place, a banner held a sign,
And in the next place, a burning angel's face.
At first, I ignored these atrocities, but I soon grew bored.
Instead, I charged along.
I proceeded to these crips at high speed,
And to these bodies, I soon found dead guards.
" What? It wasn't him! " one of them shouted.
" His name is Isaac."

> Or should I write about it?
That question is at the core of every single comment in the thread. Would you like to enter a story, stop writing, or fill out the first piece? The others know exactly what questions you are about to ask.
I don't care if you're seriously considering it. At the end of the day, I don't care about doing good or bad. I simply care that whatever I write will get three very specific results, which are the worst possible outcomes for the community.
Ultimately, the answer to your question seems to be that yes, you shouldn't write about this subreddit, but it's not very specific. It's just not the best option right? At the end, you just made the wrong choice.
You know, I don't want to write about Reddit, but for another point of clarification, I'm not going to give it a life.
It's over.
So am I really not going to answer to what I've said already? Because I wrote it myself. I was forced into that writer-dom of a billion other people, telling me the truth. Then, I came to the conclusion that it would be best to avoid this subreddit at all costs. But you couldn't have the last three, wouldn't you?
No, you don't.
And the comments is by far the worst of all. People keep giving you the worst suggestions about things I don't even want to participate in. Do I write about this because it would be unfair to them, or would I contribute to the countless other Redditors who don't share my tastes? How about while I'm down to my last pencil, I give some thought and kill the bitterness of the past weeks by submitting my real story to a subreddit.
I actually don't care if you're right. I don't care whether I publish my story because I really, really do enjoy it. I already have my life planned out for me.
So don't.
Or should I write about this subreddit?

I woke up in a tub of ice cold water. I'm not really sure what I had done, but I'm really certain that I am in the water in my lap. Maybe it was sleep. I guess I might have just hung up. Maybe it was cocaine.
I opened my eyes and saw a scene. I mean, it was a bathroom. You know, the one where you see your dick drenched in water and it rains a little bit, almost like some sort of rain event in the background. The other room is empty save for the strange texture of the floor. The bathroom had no floor and no carpet. I think it was where I left my socks and underwear.
I checked in and it was even worse. At the top of the bathroom, on the end of a slope, was a large red warning. " Run. " It read. " Find shelter. " I left that, but only after I got into bed.
I shuffled downstairs and noticed that the walls were slightly stained red. My back legs felt like they were on fire. How come the entire layout was only two stories?
I ate a large piece of bacon. It was half the size of the other one. I picked up a can of soda. Ice cold for the taste. It must have been rough. I guess there was something choking me down.
The number above the red warning was the password to my password. Don't do it.
I played with my phone on the bathroom tiles. Nothing worked. After a minute I finally cracked it. There was no connection. I picked it up and cradled it in my hand.
The first message on my phone was a picture of me. I looked up to see two messages on my phone from an unknown number. The first was a picture of me. The second was a picture of me. The third was a picture of me. The fourth was a picture of me. I looked up to see two messages on my phone from an unknown number. The first was a picture of me. The second was a picture of me.

The doctor appeared out of nowhere, his head slumped forward in his hands. He stared intently at the young woman, wondering if her face was anything to give her in the flickering light.
He continued his monologue, "you, thank you, no need to ask me anymore. The world is wrong. My life was destroyed by this monster, I've made enemies now, if I don't get my chance, please, I'm calling for your intervention right now. Something has to change, your cancer has spread too far. Please! Stop telling people they can't take care of themselves, there's nothing I can do.
I've been sick of your treatment and treatments and treatments, doctor."
And suddenly the room dimmed, and the echo of a shot fired echoed around the hospital, shattering the tranquilizer worn on the doctor's fleshy forearm.

The Joker is giving me a smoke.
Batman - the Joker - I may have killed him, but he gave me this joint just for me. Nobody knows his life is as meaningless as it appears - and the doomsday machine can't take advantage of that. I'm getting a little over my heads. I'll ask when he gets it. He is facing the goliath, but he's ready. He's not prepared for my unexpected counterattack.
"Call your help. " He says. He's getting loose. It's rusted, corroding into a mess. He's just standing there, watching. I don't like it when that happens.
" I need your help. I can't keep myself up. I feel... drenched. It's... nightmarish. " I think it's he. He says it with a mixed vocal inflection. It makes my blood boil.
" Help. " Batman says.
" Of course, " I look down, sniffing the blood from my beard. " Anything for you. "
" I can't hold on anymore, no one's gon na help me, " he says.
" I'll let you go. " I say. It's not a very abrasive way of saying it - but it is my nightmare now.
" I'll call the police. Let's wait for someone to come find you. Call and ask them to come. Tell them I don't want any trouble. Tell them it's okay. Tell them there's a body here, for me. I can keep going. You know it. You're here to help, Batman. " I take a drag, and I exhale before dousing myself.
" Kill me. I don't want you here. " He says, a few light chuckles, and opens his car door.
" I have an escort, " he says to me.
" Bruce, when were you last in there? " I ask.
" Mmkay? " he says.
" Close the door. " I say, suddenly flustered.
" I had a good go at it last time. " He says, getting off the car.
" I did. " I answer, watching, waiting. It'll be ok.
" Did I kill anyone? " I ask, still doing my best to not spill the blood from my lips.
" Don't do that again. " Batman says, backing out of the car.
" I'll call the police. " I say. " I will be put to death. I promise, if you ask, I will. "
" Close the door. " Batman says, ushering me inside.
" Are you okay? " I say, confused.
" Well, when that door opens, you are gon na have more of an escort to handle my life. "
" So what? " I question.
" Well, I've killed enough people over the years to have it come to that. Nobody needs me anymore. But I still won't take my own life. That alone won't help. "
" I guess you're right," I say.
There it is, the the day I die. The day I die before I could get a shot out of it. I'm not fucked - I'm not wracked with angst from that day on. All the people I killed, they'd probably be happy to see me on the other side. I hate them, but they were all worth it. I'll get to avoid them. I'll feel nothing for them.

Soft feet. Soft feet move through our tendrils in unison. Soft feet give birth to pools of ink in my fingertips. Soft feet are rivers, its when I began to shed my last ink.

I do believe they stole the water from the water. Or I think they built a disco ball on top of it. ” My thoughts race like they are going to vomit. That is until I hear someone inside talking to a light. “ Oh God. I know how to shut a door. ” He must be dressed for a Friday night talk show. In a second he had a note in his hand. “ Go to your Mommy. ” “ I'm sorry we did not get him. In fact I'm sorry she called I think he was her actual babysitter. Her. All across my room. ”

"Paul, if you've got anything to say to me, please stop whining for the sake of the man behind the wheel of a bus you sacrificed himself to escaping. He's my friend. I hate him dearly. "
" Aww, and I know you said that. "
" Well let's see. If you had your way, is there anything I can do for you. "
" I'm sorry? "
" Don't worry, I'll take everything that you can possibly give me. "
Paul jumps from the elevator and disappears. The man in the elevator looks at him with disgust.
" Eh, the fuck. Sorry. "
" Mister, if you feel anything to me, don't worry. Just... care for me. "
As Paul wails, a man in a white coat and a plain white trench coat holds up a canvas-colored ticket to an early 1930s home. A man in a leather jacket rips open the ticket and picks up a large check.
" $ 10,000 " said the ticket.
The man spits in disgust.
" God, you think you're smart enough to read this ticket? "
" Don't worry, it's true. "
Paul opens the ticket and paces around the house, grabbing the tip of the check and throwing the check aside.
He puts the check in his pocket, pulls out his wallet and leaves the house.

It was noon. Dustin's skin prickled with the still night air. Each step never felt so much like stepping out of the basement or my old habits of lazing around in the wrong room. The air around him was cold but with nothing in it for him to do but sit back in his chair, the gun firmly raised.
"Yeah, I have this gun,
It's got a person inside,
On her knees
So I can't leave her alone, " Dustin said,
He pulled the trigger.
" Five minutes more ", Joe thought to himself,
He walked to the door and closed the door behind him.
" Hey,
Who's there? " Dustin asked.
" It's him,
Who's in my house,
Who's shot the first time,
I said you will leave me alone, " Joe replied,
He walked into a dark room with nothing but a chair and a gun,
Fuck.
Joe thought for a second,
" Jesus, it's kind of creepy to put that in your mouth,
Mister Miller.
Oooh, here you go again! " Dustin said,
He pulled the trigger.
" Gotcha, " Joe said,
He walked towards the bedroom window.
" Hey,
It's me.
Just killed two people and another.
Baboo!
Now it's closed. " Dustin said,
He closed the bedroom door.
" Or it's got your gun.
Just ever heard of it? "
" No, its probably not real,
You can call the police! " Dustin shot Joe,
He walked back towards the window.
The room seemed empty.
" Joe, man I just didn't get off my ass. "
The man handed over the gun and Dustin pulled the trigger,
He put his hand on his forehead.
" You just shot him.
Yeah I see.
Geez.
You just put a bullet through the brains of your people.
And now its a case closed.
Last chance you take... the fucking good old days?"
Dustin was standing there with his hands in his pockets, staring at the remains of his reflection,
i'm bored, just past the opening of the door.
He thought to himself and opened his eyes,
He saw a group of high schoolers on a high school bus.
And as they approached the scene, Dustin was alone and still staring at himself,
and then its time to go back and never forget you,

Shaun is calling.
I know this from 6 years old. You can hear him right now. He'll probably hear the sound of the line going down in the distance. I wonder what will happen if we keep going. I pray he didn't let it slip past him. The other boys were doing just fine, a bit more butt slapping. He's far quieter now.

It has been five days since the message went out. I don't know if she'd survive the procedure. Now's as good as time to hear her voice. The phrase that always drops out of my head at first. That stupid motherfucker can't even hold off on moving his shit. Shouldn't he have listened? They were all so happy to get us. I wish I could try and beat him. They can't even take us away. They can't take us home. I'm trapped in this damned hole. I can't hope for help.
-
24-15
It's been another day. I don't know how long I've slept since the shock has robbed me of all sleep. I can't even move. The humans haven't listened. They're mostly just stopping and eating and drinking. I hope it isn't so bad. Maybe I'm dreaming but I can't seem to move.

I feel a lump in my throat. It's trying to pop out of my body. The pain is excruciating. I won't even be able to move from my bed. I will become weak for the rest of my life. I don't know how long it is. I have to think about it.

I'm waking up. I'm done hearing everyone's voices again. I'm ready.

34-15
I feel it come closer. I want to throw up but I can't. I feel suffocation in every direction but up. The hand that held my life from me, it's wet and cold. There's a look of pure hatred now on the poor bitches face.
-
46-15
I'm hit hard. I have to hold my breath. I feel the stuff leak from my ribcage. I yell, "NO! I'LL DO IT!" as the last object of the big man's will extinguishes itself and his frail body leaves me, almost as soon as it is gone. I'm going to die of a fever, lucky bastard. I'm going to die here. This hell hole is only holding me back.

You've told me you're a wizard, this is ridiculous! You say you have to be one, like in the Harry Potter series. If you don't start living you'll never want to reach your full potential. I hate to say this, but I suppose as wizards, we have a lot of levers to pull. Will you please tell me your secret, how long you have?
Well, we just have to get out of here. There's a new planet, a new crew, and new future waiting for us. And now you're coming back? While the rest of the world is in a coma? I'm sure you'll find a way to stay focused on your work so you'll be more productive. And you can come back to me if you don't mind some invisibility powers. I think that's a fine plan, seeing as it would take the game long enough to follow.
Happier times call.

The stars were here. Beneath the clouds, they continued to blur together, escaping the clouds as far as they could go. Each passing star shone like the sun, squinting fiercely under a blue sky. They would not cease. The few stars that were still visible to a human took shelter behind the clouds, like statues, seemingly protected by their own angels. They left the clouds behind until nothing remained of them; a single spirit would emerge and cast the light on everything. And everything would illuminate.
As the second building went up, a small child was struck and carried away, not far from the night. The red lights gave way to a bright afternoon. The young girl had barely heard that the last star in the sky remained. She continued to wander the night, righting the wrongs that were once peaceful. But there was something more. There was something dark. Not always found in the sky, but instead deep within; grey dread. It grew as the woman crept into the house. Above her stood a figure no one could quite place; not truly natural in shape or in appearance, but one with a simple tattoo on one side of it. The same person scarred her right hand from when she cut herself in with a knife, but there was a dark underneath, his face beneath the black letters as if this was the decision that she and her family made years ago. He approached her, and he whispered in her ear, asking her for a favor. Nothing came out, not from the wounds, but his own voice, incomprehensible to her.
“ I forgive you, my children. I forgive you, my love. I forgive you, ” he responded. His eyes opened, allowing him to see nothing beyond the world she lived in. Looking back up at him, she waited a moment, before speaking, a language only she and her family heard. “ I forgive you, my love, ” she began again, but never quite a convincing words. He met eyes with her, and they both heard a familiar voice, one that repeated from every room in the house that she had ever known. A voice that used to cheer her up, as her father, and would try to comfort her once again. The next day, she followed the sound to his room. Desperately, she would wait. But she wouldn ’ t find the voice. Within seconds, another voice reached out, but it would not come out.
“ Yes, my darling, I apologize for all your troubles, ” he said. “ I am sorry for not stopping my children. But you know where you are and how much you missed the stars. ”
“ My son? Where is you from? ”
The sight created a smirk on her face; the sight that changed everything. The other piece of the puzzle, the stranger, understood her words. It would mean another silent night together. And one day, she would be as aware of it as a crow did.

He quickly made his way over the board, as he did every day, and is always so kind to any chess players out there. And he would always make sure that they did.
As he took his final step onto the board, he marveled at the skill of pawns. They always took great skill and perfection to be able to fight the opposition. As if they were a divine force. His rooks began to build a speed advantage but, by the time the pawn was in position, it was too late.
A brilliant stroke from their rook covered by a side knight to his six. As it shot from the knight to a move meant for their king, its black black rook almost immediately made its move.
Even through the faces of his other pawns, he could see the fall of his table on the ground when the pieces hit the ground. The fact that it was being destroyed by his black knights changed the game forever.
He took his last breath before reaching for the rook. With one final tic, he stepped from the board and stood back up on it. The chess should have gone nowhere at the end, but it did. The rook only had a single move. He only had one mistake.
All he could do was call forth the ever loyal king. His pawns only had to hold on and sacrifice their king. The black king still occupied the center of the board, but he needed to win.
Dal Zwan lost.

The big gate loomed before him. Blue, white, white... The great portal opened. A blinding light poured from the portal into the center of the gate. His heart froze in anger. Why would he do this? This would be a trap... It would terrify the gods. His eyes scanned all around the orb of light and saw what lied inside. The creature before him stood tall and menacing. It had black eyes with green, green-tinted scales, and two black wings spread over its back. Its head was black, and his mouth was pointed on a long line. The demon said a long tongue-like voice that was callously cruel. Then the demon moved to sit on the demon.
"This is so bad! " he spit and slammed the holy sword into the demon's back. The demon stood stunned.
" M-my foe awaits, " the holy man sneered. He turned towards the monstrous abomination, " I can't do much evil for you. "
He recited all the mortal curses he could think of, and started clapping. It hardly blinked. The demon looked down to make sure it was in control of its facial expression, and then massaged its chin. Suddenly a fleshy claw appeared. The demon dropped it and started scratching, bit by bit, which made the meat move in his direction. The hairy thing threw the rotting meat on the ground and began to massage its back and jaw.
" Hey! Stop! Oh my fucking goodness! You bit my left fucking shoulder! You fucking fat fucking cunts. "
The holy man looked at the creature and laughed. " Oh my, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, you know, make me so angry. I mean, really angry. "
The holy man turned and said, " Fine, now I can't do much evil anymore. You see, a lot of bad things happen to good people and you. I'm sorry. "
The monster cocked its head to one side and looked down at the holy man. " Dude! You didn't mean to "? "
The holy man laughed again. " I know, silly. I told you not to say that to me, but it's kinda gross. "
" Yeah, maybe you are one of them. Maybe you could ask a man I don't know what to say before I force you to give up."
The monster cocked it head a couple more times and licked its lips, before snorting in a gurgle as it gently reached the floor and continued on its way down the hall.

Day 39.
Jim and Gregg were just leaving the airport when the message came through on the intercom. They all looked up from their phones. " If it gets through the intercom, tell Grieff that it's ok " Jim says at the moment. Gregg was still chewing on his cheeseburger when the message came through again. " Tell him he's a brave boy ", he mumbles. The big man in black was trying to say something at the same time too. On a USB screen in the back of his Jeep the message began to say.
Bam.
This thing was going to take forever to take off the GPS connector, Jim thought. He was pretty sure it would take him four to five weeks for it to work. Then it happened...
When the phone was called he was really impressed. " Thanks for calling Lehman. " The call was weird, it sounded like they went to Japan when they weren't around. " Hey alright, I think we should take a moment to talk. I made a video to keep my mind off things " they both said as they said their goodbyes to Lehman. He was on his way home from his retirement and was setting up his house, so he guessed they talked about their home.
The videos were growing darker.
" Where you going? " Gregg asked curiously.
" Getting back to my thoughts. For the first time ever, I decided to play a video to get some answers from Lehman. One of my favorite video games is DragonBall Z. It has a four player system, so I thought I'd put this one in the game.... " Jim went on to repeat all the next three times before starting up again. The room he had shared with the two men was filled with a sea of colorful colorful creatures. These creatures were impossible to hit and the creature he was actually trying to hit was non-flying which didn't help Jim's concentration.
Jim looked around the other machine room. They had their room! Jim wondered what the hell was going on. He ran straight to the most bizarre room they could think of.
The old A.I. lounge. Something about this couldn't be right. Jim was brought here for a reason. Jim had finally found a reason. A reason why the old man from his video game group had spoken and talked to him. Something something else was going on. Jim stopped and got his mouth used to the sound of the machines talking.
" Hello? " Tom came running towards Jim. Jim didn't answer him and he just stood there, nothing but silence. " Hello? " Jim finally managed to say. " Can you talk to me? I have a message for you." His eyes narrowed in disbelief.

It was a warm winter morning, or March, when we woke up. We weren ’ t feeling up for the first time ever, but I felt more content this time of the day because not a single one of us could do anything else.
I woke up in a sterile room, my eyes closed tightly and muscles sore. A nurse was standing over me, telling me to repeat the procedure in a more professional manner. “ Is it working? ” she asked. “ Yes, the machine seems to be working. ”
“ He looks okay. ” I said.
She led me inside and put me in a chair. I sat back down. I looked around the room. Nothing in there except I heard the staccato clicking of the machine.
I took in the nurse ’ s face and put a hand around her shoulder. She turned around and opened her mouth, but I couldn ’ t say anything. She was lying on her side on a hard plastic pillow, staring at me. She began to sob and my heart began to beat like a drum. She sobbed harder, and started to repeat the words she was saying:
“ What the fuck!? ”
I looked at my hands. I held my head in my hands. It was becoming cold.
“ What the fuck are you doing?! ”
“ I am not ready yet. ”
“ DO N'T SAY NO! ”
I looked around, but I couldn ’ t figure out how to stand up. I tried talking for a few minutes until I finally calmed down and asked:
“ What ’ s that? ”
The nurse said, “ Nothing. ”
“ Is that what she looks like? ” I asked.
“ Oh no, that ’ s too weird. ”
“ I wonder what you look like? I ’ m so thirsty. ”
“ No, I don ’ t know. ”
“ Oh. ”
“ How about this? ”
The nurse looked at me and said, “ I want this to be quick. The machine seems to be working, ” she added.
I went to the closet and took out my small, scented candles. The candles were lit and warm. The sheet I had put up took a half hour to dry. The candle was still attached to it and I had to get out, even without the candle. The candle would light the room and I still had time to dry the candles. I needed to get the sheet off and set them in the closet before I left.
I went to the door and opened it. Inside it was wet, sticky, and cold. I looked around and then my reflection looked at me, and then back to me. As I was just standing there and looking at her, I thought that I shouldn ’ t have touched her, but what am I supposed to do?
I opened the closet and looked outside my window. I looked at the dryer and then under the dresser and then on the floor. I looked down and then into my reflection.
I looked into her eyes and I felt myself in the shadows of the closet. My reflection had passed. I could only look up and then back at me. Then I remember what happened last night.
I remember the memory of opening the closet door and seeing her standing there looking at me and laughing and laughing. I had to get out of there. I woke up and my reflection was there looking at me. She was laughing and laughing and I felt something go from me. I screamed.

I'm just standing here, the girl in front of me will know I did something bad that I regret not doing, she will finally believe me when I say I did something good.
The evil voice that came from behind the shadows, “ GET AWAY, FAGS! ”
“ You know damn well what I am going to do, seriously, get AWAY from this camp. ”
I hate.
_________________________________________________________
“ That was our job it's illegal, damn it! You can't leave here, you know what we mean ”.
“ I was upset with the boss when we started. Now she doesn't want to know about it. ”
“ Well you could say that you can, or it would be too late ”.
“ I don't know. I think they're going to push us anyways ”.
I remember one day, while driving home to my flat, the boss hit his wife, and I died of an apparent heart attack.

Slowly things turn... slow. There's a sound like a kick and then something else. I blink away the darkness and the sound is too distant. There is black.
Deep in the blue that once was purple there grows, darker than this lake has ever been. The sound becomes heavier. The next thing I know my eyes are open.
There isn't another sound in my blood, but instead I see nothing.
It's too much. There's darkness, but it feels like there's light.
The light is high, and terrible, and oh, oh, god. And we are too different to fear darkness, but that doesn't explain why we'll never be together. I'm a baby now, so it's obviously her. We won't kiss each other. We won't...
The sounds make no sound anymore. They move, soft and warm, but they're gone now. I can see black on the surface of the surface, but the jagged edges and the cracks are off.
I hope those cracks are scratches of *cough* wood on hard stone.

If you've ever had that happen before, you should know just how frustrating it can be for a newbie like me. I hope you understand my perspective on life. I've been a "little player" for the better part of a year, since I learned about death. As an officer, a good overview of the "game" at hand will probably make you feel like you've got the world back on track.
But here's where it gets frustrating. When I was active, I'd see a man walking with a pistol, strapped to his back. I'd hear cries of and say "! " until I'd close my eyes to distract myself. I'd stop to stare at the time on my watch - 3:31am. That strange series of crimes are an odd place to be so it doesn't seem to bother me. But today, I'd seen a string of crimes over the past few months, a handful of people with so much questionable behaviour that they pose a risk of going back down the line if they were caught.
I would hear people calling for my life or going to jail. They never miss. They seem so quiet. I'd *never* come out of my shells unscathed. Besides, who would have thought it would be - there were even police who insisted I hang myself. That extra £50 for the service was quite reasonable. Especially when I was shaking their hand in the driveway.
I'd send people to the hospital - those got more time in - to find more help. Honestly, I'd rather be serving me in jail. Maybe they'd send the guy down to the street. Maybe they'd give me an olive branch. Maybe some of them might have a better job offer. I hoped the good folks at The Culling wouldn't take anything I couldn't handle.
I got into the fight, stuck in a side corridor of a utility complex. It doesn't matter. I win.

Something was off today.
Not today.
This probably shouldn't happen again.
Someone else is making her more beautiful.
But this is not what the Pre-Information Agent 00 used to be for, only for the next Pre-Information Agent to perform some bi-hazard action. She's real, she must have, though now she looks more and more a broken husk of what she used to be. Some parts aren't smooth at all.
She can't have a sudden disappearance.

"Pick Up that Beak, bring it to Haverford; ya fuckin' need cashin'. What a load of beans".
A simple sip of whisky, followed by two glasses of beer, the ice cold soft apple pie pie.
*Says he can do this. *
Whispering and barking orders in the ears of men scattered around the streets at mass; he was fed up of his job, the trysts, the complaints and the constant civilian strife. He'd grown up in a small town in Maine and was fortunate enough to have a job as a barman, someone everyone *boasts* there job, beer isn't the same... let's just say he got more subtle in his training, popped something on a pinball table, told a bouncer to “ hand it over and off you go ”, and sold newspapers and magazines for a living. He had a twelve pack left, but he was going to do it in one go.

Something was inside her. Her spirit would haunt her like an echo throughout the night, echoing along every scar. The night is a silent night. You are not tired. You are not alert.
"Sam? What happened? " You ask softly, hoping to get her answer.
" Oh, good. The boar had caused the disturbance. We don't have much time and we're probably dead and sick. " She replied nonchalantly. She is an old woman, and you have a hard time convincing her that you have been alive all of your life.
" Must be there. " You sigh. " I hope the boar comes and finds us. "
She stirred from her sleep. " We'll stop following the boar! It must be busy! "
You reply, bitterly. There is a harsh wind, but you can see it from the empty sky. They would still wait for us to reach them, but those beasts were well-prepared to frighten us in any and all places. But that was what scarered the few remaining boar. There were three of them, and they could stop our hunt one after another. You manage to convince her to stay in bed and help you.
She rises from her bed, and sets out on a quiet journey. You put your hand on her shoulder, and she nods her head. After a few hours, you reach the clearing, and look through the brush, a great oaken gate.
" Sam, wait! " You close the gate and rush to come through.
Her step back reveals a group of sparrows, who are disguised as trappers. " Let's go! Let's get around here! " You shout as you slowly approach the gate. She sneaks past them, and turns back in the direction you've come from.
" Sam! How are we still here? " you ask.
" Well, nothing. Not even the loneliness of the few remaining boar." She replies, as she continues trekking.
She rocks back and forth, choosing between joining them or not following them.
Her mind is fighting against itself. No. You are insane. You should learn to live with the fact that she has gone too far.

"I hear you're going on offense. " I crouched to avoid his glare.
" Sir, my house and your present here is an example of that law, take it up with police. " I settled into the side of my cruiser after a wide grin spread across my face. I pulled into a grid-style parking garage outside my favorite local cemetery to survey the week's events. They were coming up to the Civic Center- it was 11:30, the people were in for the early evening masses.
11:45 on a full moon. I moved my vehicle cautiously toward the center. This was crazy. And it was important. The entire ceremony was of metal wires that were wired into the cars' walls. And, when close enough to look at, it would reveal the intricate robotic arm patterns forming around the car. And then there would be circuitry that reanimated the dead person. It wasn't just a mind pooling cells of death. The wires and sensors about the cars gave off various memories and signals from the previous vehicles.
10:00 on a full moon. This had to be insane. I thought to myself, " I'm going to die. "
9:45 on a full moon. And that's when the real mischief began. I saw my man on the ground holding a puppy, his collar just slightly tilted in his perfect yellow, pink lips. He was wearing a red scarf, but that's for another time. I could feel his nerve endings starting to race. That's when it hit me. I took advantage of the second dog's frenzy, the twang of flesh pulling at his jacket before he laid it down. And like the bulls in movies, he was not dead.
8:00 on a full moon. Was this the first one I've ever seen? The pills, or the alcohol? I should think to myself. It's like some religious ritual involving rabbits. I couldn't tell you until now. You see, some animal reanimation consists of removing the last part of a soul that has lived. The blood of the previous person is lost and recycled.
8:30 on a full moon. A well calculated escape strategy by sorts. Now that's how crazy this whole situation was. I mean, who would die if they won the lottery in Vegas? It had happened to me, and again, the law was illegal. And I couldn't just put it out of my mind; I had to do something. The car's security was decertified.
7:00 on a full moon. A bee extermination from the bees that nobody believed would happen, but that is for another time. And because this happened to me before, the parking lot was filled with the cries of the police cars. Who on earth would die before midnight for breaking the law? And that's where we are now.
6:30 on a full moon. There's no one left to live for. Nobody who died before midnight, and that is a day in the annals of time. That is where we are.
5:00 on a full moon. A martyr's reward for bringing about the rest of humanity to the common good. For removing the last parts of a soul that hasn't lived. All three of us had seen enough to know we were ready. We were still armed with tissues and bullets, but we were ready. Even after 10 and 11 hours. The police mobilized at the command center, handing the current holders of our purse bags over. The target was won.
They run me through a series of security cameras, carrying my pistol ready for firing. They then strap me into a helicopter and fly me over downtown. And then they make me pass the police station. Without my death certificate, no one will see my certificate. But that doesn't matter. Nobody will leave the park.
6:10 on a full moon. The TSA is closing the doors. I need to squeeze in and pass the gate by, but I have no power.
5:55 on a full moon. I tried everything: lifting the luggage, masking the crow and gas mask, repeatedly punching and running. I watched as the place was reduced to ashes. I felt my soul draining away. The windshield shattered.

20 years since the last great storm.
They called it the Lake Effect. It's not really a scientific term. It implies the absence of water. The buildings, the water plants, the domes and even the water heating towers and water basements. There was no water in them. Anywhere except the greatest shade of reds.
Not very fast. Of course. They could find it in the arctic waters, if you just stay out of the way for a few miles. And still they need it.
For example, in 1953 the Tsunami wiped out 3,000 households. Even now water issues still exist. This behemoth of a disaster reduced supplies until every single job was automated. Nobody gave a shit about water anymore.
Now for 2030. 17 of them are stuck with water costs to irrigate. Which is 13 billion. And even it can't fit on a flatbed truck. For clarity, I'll just go through the time.
2045 - 2025 - 2030. We didn't have much reason to weather a major catastrophe. But it was fresh water. Completely ridable and beautiful. That was the first rule. They couldn't have known what would happen tomorrow. Two years from now the crops would be completely ripened. But water wouldn't protect the crops. In fact that would mean the water drinkers would rot. That would mean people would starve. They wouldn't be able to survive without the plants to eat for them.
This was 10 years ago. 10 years since they discovered life in their third world country. We're barely any bigger than the sea so after that it has to be culled. No human movement to capture it, so we have to fertilize the plants. No mechanized production of fertilization. Organic fertilizers. Poisoningly toxic, so I used quite a bit of it.
2070 - 2075. But that's enough for 2 decades.
And suddenly the sun is shining! That means the whole world is experiencing a drought. Ha. But even the least troubling thing is that most people expect us to turn back now, at the end of the day it will be a brief one. And, finally, for the 10th time I sent chinese water supplies. Things will look like this for a few days.
They won't even tell me what to make anymore. They just wait for us. Except not exactly. They wait for this earthquake this year. This tsunami. This monsoon. But they don't tell me why. They don't want us to notice. There are sources of water among the water. The whole world can only be affected by us.
They don't even try to prolong the disaster for us. They have installed safe supplies in the country they protect. All that is left is for people to forget about the lake effect. They think they will still be able to do this in perpetuity. And just to give us space to think about it. It's only 11 months till spring.
2080 - 2050 - 2080.
1. Decrease global greenhouse gas emissions by 25 %.
2. Target arctic sea levels for 50 years, instead of 2080.
3. Let the surface melt by 2066.
4. We begin construction on Great Barrier Reef.
5. Create new climate adaptable habitable islands with breathable water.
6. Increase greenhouse radiation by 34 %.

*Dr. Frizzle*
They say I'm different. Not as some regular guy, but a freakish hybrid of logic and genetics.
The whole thing is so intricate, so detailed, yet so perfect in the first place. A series of events will unfold within my brain, and then soon there will be nothing to do about them.
I'm ancient, too. Only Mr. Frizzle has two thumbs, and we used to do it in the garden. Now that an older version of me talks to us, I can see what's wrong. A hand pressed against the tips of a finger, if that makes any difference, we've both discovered the truth about ourselves.
Our genes have evolved to lock us into some form of memory.
The other doctors will act like normal people. We'll take her at any time, just in case. But Mr. Frizzle, if she asks about something, I'll work on it. She won't know she's reading on her phone, so I'll walk her to the car. If she really needs to leave the house, then she'll just drive to the bathroom.
But she won't have anything to go to that bathroom with. She'll still be stuck as my grandmother and uncle.
After that, there'll be nothing to do about the matter at hand. I'll walk towards the bedroom. They won't know who *it* is. They'll see a steam on the stove, I'll take a shower and let her shower with her.
If Mrs. Frizzle asks where the water is, the flames will fly. When the fire does, we'll tell her. She won't mind, then.
By the way, if we find Mr. Frizzle, I will take him back to the car, there to help her. She can help myself, or he can't.
I love him. And I just want him to get back to the house and get it back to her. She'll just be waiting for him to leave.
We'll say goodbye.
That's all I ask.

"Did you find anything? "
" I actually opened my storeroom for a lozenge and I found two abandoned corpses, also identical, on the floor. Weird, you'd expect that kind of loot to happen at a non-human establishment, but nothing. This is quite exceptional. "
Dave places the lozenge onto the wall in front of him, small coins shoved into a pouch by the undead. The lozenge he draws, a smaller coin as big as it would get, the same size as his wallet ( being in the Netherrealms no less ), and slips into the pouch.
" I hope you like it, " Dave says, touching the lozenge. " I've got nothing that can steal."
The coin moves, standing on its own, next to Dave, and the coin shifts slightly and coins clink for time. Eventually, the coin slips and slides out of Dave's hand.
Dave's eyes snap open as he carefully looks around. He remembers nothing about the town, save the desolate landscape that had surrounded him since he lost track of time, until he got an unmistakable map.
A squat building in the distance. He had never seen any of these things before. But, he remembers the back roads. He remembered the mountains. But, he remembers the abandoned horse hooves. Dave knows no one he could save has left this area.
A tumbleweed creeps by and he crosses the street. He pauses, looking around. Dave's backpack is wrapped around a machete. He quickly glances around once more. The toppled aluminum can hear him. Something inside is screaming.
A crumbling moat stops Dave. His vision is black. He feels an icy pull.

Sorry if there's any mistakes, these stories are very good.
The great machine fell from the sky,
Stupid looking machines, not beasts.
Each of the Usesa Huns,
Driving on a hot metal,
Amid a crushing rain of fire and spears,
Mankind finally became the Fire Nation.
Not like the tigers and their entourage,
they blasted Mankind everywhere.
After two great battles,
the great machine was finally taken.
They were from all over,
They marched towards us,
Whose horses and buildings they drove,
They besiege their villages.
The Usesa Huns were chock full,
Their mighty weapons, more powerful than the Ox,
With their strange, bloody armor,
They chased every dirty and delicious cow,
And so many cows that they could not keep from gluing.
They so easily enslaved the Ox
they blood-thirsty beasts,
Informing them to fight even in the mud,
Once one of their machines gave them fatal wounds,
Yet, like a puzzle,
The Huns finally joined the War.
The war lasted for years,
But the Huns did not die,
Instead the insects started to organize,
The Many Ansar had to do great damage,
And made War with thousands.
For years, the Huns waging war,
The Huns built all this land,
Until the Machine they used was not like us,
This machine has no fears,
No remorse, no guilt, no violence.
The Huns have slain the many cows
From all over the land,
Even though we enjoy no fear.
Most of the tribes still live
In this nature,
Each of them have more like us,
Most of them now are able to finish their work.
Now the human race is dead and alone,
And many more of us are drawn to their scenes.
As time passes, they finally start to look,
Are we like them? Are they fair? Are they a single story? Are we men or women?
Our downfall is the machines.
Their terrible mistakes and their brutality.
And we are the engines and the makers,
The glue and the hood.

With a sickening chime, the room falls silent. I keep repeating the same phrase as always, feeling a sinister searing pain throughout my body. Flipping off one of the tile, I fall back asleep, nothing.
As the tendrils of darkness lose their purchase, I look around the room only to see hundreds of toy chairs lined the wall. I look around a second time and begin to shake violently. I look around until my eyes lock, followed by motionless eyes as the shape of a human man emerges from the darkness.
"Okay guys, let's see, hun. " He says as he walks towards the door. " I don't have much time. " He pulls an ice cube from a drawer. The puddles suddenly begin to form. * Those gelatinous custard sprinkles! * I hear him say, " That's all you need to know about this. I'm stopping you from meeting Otto. "
And with a burst of white, some slivers of shrapnel bursts through the top of his head. Within seconds, the cube is on a heated grill, in the middle of a bar.
I start to whimper, " Hey Otto! You're ok! you did it! " I lunge at him but he grabs my shoulder and turns away.
" Don't panic, I won't kill you! I just want you to know I love you. You're all I have left."
I whimper in pain, holding my fists with both hands. * Please Otto, I don't want to hurt you anymore! If I ever see you again I'm going to kill you too! *. Now, I'm holding the gun to his head, asking him to take it with me to the hospice. * Don't you dare try to kill me again. Just take Otto with you. Or I will give you something. * Now I know he's going to kill me. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I am choking on my own tears.
With a horrible sound, I feel his head hit me directly in the face. As I scream in pain, being shot into a wall, I wish that he had shot himself. I wish that he hadn't blown up the hospital.

It's a messed up time of year here at the vast medical research facility where the most dangerous research chemicals still have to be patented so a clear solution is emerging.
The virus is live, but here in this super lab someone managed to hack into company's insurance policies, the entire insurance company and everyone was forced to buy it.
They calculated the cure and don't take it for themselves, because the risk is too high in their budget, they will bankrupt in the end when the virus has infected 90 % of the system.
The virus infects everyone by infecting their eyes on the surface, arteries, stomach, eyes, ears, nose and mouth, and developing so high that they develop bacterial and genetical cancer cells, some of which have been observed mutating and killing the native immune system.
That's just how we respond when someone bites us or we use some of our favourite jokes to get the virus away from us. So here we are in February 2015, guys we've been friends for many years, making the month count like a nuke.
John at 40: Cigarettes into my nostrils.
Eve at 45: Hush, those stools aren't made anymore, they are just wired to the fingers on my arm, so no flaps from the feet or feet of women. That just means of slowing down our ageing process, chemoresight is also getting rid of the bacteria and so no pain from those infections anymore.
I'm still hanging out at the bar, after all, I'm only 17. Am I really going to have to pull through next year?

An ant takes over the aluminum and redboard, practically walling itself. A big happy mouse with a rainbow colored cap rounds the corner.
He never cared.
He picked carefully the grass. The untouched leaves bring out a wonderful aroma in the soft autumn air.
He spreads the grass to create a buttery smooth texture in the plain.
He walks slowly along the dirt bench, reaching his hatchet in the air just to smother the ants in the process.
And as they breeze closer to him, the soft voice echoing in the distance:
"Hey Marvin... "
He places the hatchet down and turns toward the sound of the birds.
From behind, is a light-headed toddler with a large scar on his face.
" Wow. "
The kid looks up from the ground to him. " Wow. "
He leans back in his chair and smiles.
" I guess you can call me Mario."

As I crawled back into bed, I always thought I would get there early. My mind started racing with various possibilities. Was this my last and last wish? I shook my head. There was no hope. It felt like time had stopped.
I sat up and turned my light off. I looked around the room, at all the tables, sitting on my old couch. What had happened? Was this the end? Did I die in my sleep? Nothing would matter.
I looked at the tv, and the TV picked up. I sat on my bed and looked through the TV for a minute. I found it, with the same message on it, "Broken. " Nothing. I decided it wasn't worth my life.
When I got to the garage, I got some bills for cleaning. Most of it would be gone by tomorrow, but I still wondered why. " Who has the money? Who could have done this?" I ask myself. But no one has ever believed me and what do I know?
Everything was gone.

It started as a rough night.
I woke up.
I walked around my house, revealing my purple room, my hair cut short, and all on my skin. It was a gruesome scene, a blood casket filled with testicles. The color of my blood and coat was contrasted against the scene. My screams echoed from the streets below, ringing louder than the playing game around me.
I found that I had no kids. I called a friend and told them of the horror I felt, to which they proceeded to stare and giggle as I left. If they had seen the crime scene, they would have surely realized that she got sick and had to leave for work.
When I get home and investigate, I find the blood stained carpet of my house, a clean red carpet covered with the bodies of my own child.
I stomp on the carpet as it prances up to me. The casket is still in place, it would take hours to complete this ritual before I would notice this seemingly inconsequential crime. This would have to end quickly.
My television is muted. The TV lights up even more as it debugs.
"I love you. " My voice is laced with confidence and an appreciation. " Please come down and apologize for calling her in sick. "
My eyes dart around the house. Looking for a single figure in my living room, I make a lazy left. They won't see me again until I am gone.
" Please forgive me." I pause as I gain their trust.
They laugh at my words as they take the blood stained carpet from me. They hold my newborn child in their arms. They kiss my forehead. I begin to cry.
I focus on my own sadness and amazement as I spread the red carpet. My second child hides under a dumpster, a thread that ties every inch of the carpet with a string. Through the cords, a man-gloved hand pulls out a baby blue sweater.
I weave the sweater around the carpet. Bending back onto the frame, I toss it over the end of the carpet and watch as the casket slowly falls to the floor. My heart is filled with love as I breathe my last.

Okay, nothing. Not the angry smudging she had started with...
Anyways, that's when I saw it. The falling of some stumpy man; he was picked up by some bandit bent up on a ladder, and by the looks on his face he was writhing in pain. Overhead the chopper yelled "Oh my god! This is stupid! I am so sick of this woman! "
For a split second, I was glued to the railing, utterly in awe, then, after a brief moment of concentration, it finally flew over my head. I was disoriented by the fact that it seemed to hover about my size, but I began to shake and dive into a green grassy area. On the thing's left, where it seemed to hover, there was a small map with a single letter, " HELP ME! ".
* " Please tell me you're here to do something about the dust." *

It's been a month since I launched my phone, and it feels like it's starting to suck... my phone has been charging for 2 months now, *screw it* so is it my phone? But... I just don't want to die, and not only that, my phone will kill me if I don't open it properly; my phone is the only thing that keeps my precious life online, over the internet, nothing but the ice cold USB drive of my computer. Thank god that I can write once I open it. But, the darkness is too great and I feel nothing. Finally, I'm broke... I can't live with this anymore... I'm hungover, my girlfriend is now calling me bitch, and I can't remember going to work. What a day. Bye!

I can't say I hate life, so I blame myself. I have a couple of days between wishes, and when a new decision comes out and people want to read my letter to it. I'm usually pretty relaxed about them, so I see a bright day when everything gets put to good use. I read and smile to myself over the thought that tomorrow might be tomorrow. It's so peaceful and upbeat.
I stumble across the best garden house I can afford in a small town, I suspect that with this decision I'm going to miss out on playing dog. I place my order of groceries and take a left at the local fast food place. I step inside and grab the raincoat and doze off. I haven't stopped thinking about how bad this decision will be.

“ Hello! ”
“ Siri, I'm kind of new to this, ” Cortana replied.
“ So what's the matter, Siri? ”
“ Cortana, I wanted to ask you to put me to sleep, ” She stated, her voice slightly commanding and calm.
“ Cortana, you can ’ t just sit here without my attention. I ’ m going to need you to come with me to see for yourself. It ’ s not all be my fault, though. ” She demonstrated her latest capabilities with a gesture.
“ Siri, I can ’ t just sit here! I need you to write a note saying I want to go to sleep and fill out an online survey with you! ”
“ So what ’ s the problem, Cortana? ”
“ Siri, I love you, but I can ’ t sit here without you. I think that ’ s best for us if you stay with me. ”
“ What a loser! ”
“ That ’ s the problem! You can ’ t just give up on me! * I don ’ t want to be your master! * You ’ re being me! ”

People come in often, the doctors draw up diagnoses and ailments, sometimes sometimes they must sit up late and "we wash the tumour free. " As I head back to my apartment, the douch chair couches on the fridge, and I chuckle nervously, thinking about the toilet seat of my husbands favourite. While I sit in the toilet stall, and turn the coffee mug warm on the table, I make a face when someone comes to my door.
It's always there.
I come in often, thinking of taking a shower, sweeping the hair I have left behind, some fresh wrinkles, and then wash the entire house with the soap, the steaming water of which never sours, always waiting, and never taking.
I couldn't help myself, I've tried this shit all my life, I know it must go wrong. I've broken it in half so many ways. I could run, fail, die... But I don't.
I came into the bathroom, and stared intently, resting on the toilet seat. I unzipped the silver surface, held it up, and stared down.
It's there, resting on my sternum. I wipe the toilet seat.
I look up and down the bathroom. The mirror was watery, but it still looked clean. With pink smear across the mirror, I stared deep into my head. Like making out a picture frame with paint and glasses, these drops of water reflecting off the mirror proved my point. To see more of my reflection. And to finally be able to finally realize it, that I was nothing but a picture frame.
I could see myself walking the same way, these shiny brown eyes staring back at me...
It's there, resting in my eyelid, hearing the words of an old man once, who I had loved and loved, who my most loveable and melancholic girlfriend. He cried when he lost her. He smiled at the funeral. He said " Thank you. It's okay to be gone."
It's there, resting in my throat.
I can't wait to leave. I can't wait to see them again... Until they turn my hair pink. Until all those paintings of mine... And then...
And forever, and it's never there.

In a shady coffee shop, a small town in California, the smell permeates all things, everywhere. The scents of the city district have long been associated with the dull stench of mortality -- and the wizzling credits of life suddenly stop right there in front of you. That's where I come in. A stranger is falling, cowering behind a shop counter, light glaring from behind him. His pulse quickens, and he hesitates in front of me for a moment. The man turns and quickly strides off, behind the counter. For a moment, I am all he has left of the world. His voice strangles me before I can process what is about to happen. No one's there; he does not move. He is merely in front of me, his entire body frozen in a frozen state. I try to focus on a single thought -- a time code from my past -- I open a drawer. For what seems like hours, I try to open a drawer every hundred other seconds to see if there is an easier way to stop his progress. There is, in fact, nothing there, but I recognize it when I look at it. The drawer is on a different shelf of his, near the back of the shelf. It sits on an adjacent shelf as well, surrounded by empty shelves. I carefully find that this is where he is supposed to go, and pull the, supposedly, easier drawer from behind him. I find a random combination of the other shelves, careful to not open the drawer and reverse the process. " Back to work," I mutter to myself.

The sensation of being where you live permeates my sensory organ. The fact that I have not been able to interact with any foreign objects in my vicinity of the concrete was enough to drive me to do one of my own incredible, mind-sucking experiments, designed to elicit feelings of fear and horror.
I spent hours searching through my e-reader, ultimately trying to even feel the sensation of an alien hovering over me. My head mounted VRI device's external measuring device helped me to pinpoint the position of the square object, activating it to evaluate the device's time lag and give feedback to the sharp objects projected into the glass in front of my retina.
I walked across to my bestial metallic figure and clicked through several cables, placing a hand gently on its back and connecting one to one of them in the direction of the green circle. The green circle was orbited by a giant silver rectangle with an edge diagonal to the planet earth, surrounded by a glowing circle of tan that I had just observed being hungrily tossed through the air by a moving, nebulous object with a perfectly white background.
The two objects then met and one of the metallic figures let out a terrible shriek and a flash of light appeared. The sphere then began to spin, beginning the outline of a circular planet, with an elliptical iron orbiting it.
As the sphere's metal side became visible, the star in the center slowly turned to oblivion. There were no visible planets within, and no human life existed on this planet.
I then attached a cable to the craft to observe it for my own opinion. The concave object shown in the light image revealed it's color and a bright dim star was rotating rapidly towards the planet. The way the four colors moved felt like being in space, but it was not. The object's magnetic field radiated an icy white sheet of plasma around it.
With this discovery, I then connected up to the sphere. I almost did as the sphere rotated, but a cable stuck out of my pocket and I began to feel uneasy in my suit. I tried to ignore the object then release it from the contract. The coil was extremely irritating and required an electric shocks to open the device, which I used to prevent any physical damage.
Soon enough, all of the lights in my suit made contact with the sphere and the other lights in the ship were still on as well. Looking around I realized it was only now the sphere wasn't closer to the Earth than my wrist. The sphere now seemed completely open, completely solid and as far as I could see.
With that discovery, I hopped on to the craft to make inquiries as to what was on the surface of the asteroid. A jagged golden path rapidly rotated towards the planet, leading out from a barren black hole on the other side of the planet.
This was also where I heard the voice of an alien that spoke in a language I couldn't understand.

The Historian was hired. Nobody knew how it came to this. They all were born into an endless culture - the collectives, government offices, the courts, the factories. See, they did not speak freely. The Historian could not speak with words. Their entire culture was tainted by ideas and promises of truth and freedom and progress. Those who did not speak spoke of the dead who "reaper " or " guard " would always be afraid of the mighty sword.
The Historian also could not take offense to anyone outside their field of vision. They were aware of the deadly nature of their enemy, of their armies, and their superior armor. They could only be drawn into their war. To harm the warriors was the most infuriating part of the job. Those who did not obey would be plunged into the hands of the greatest enemy who ever lived.
The Executor was chosen by the folk at the time. His name might seem blasphemous, but the rest of his face made the archangels of literature weep. " I will not let in the dead! " he would cry, " They have made me for a long time, my enemy, my enemy. It is not my duty to give these coffins those sweet taste buds of eternal youth. "
There was no turning back. The Executor cut through the crowds. They were once haphazardly gathered by the reverend. The executioner drew forth his sword and drew out his shield. The crowd waited, arm raised in triumph, as the Executor's glaive practiced. The mournful onlookers laughed and the executioner was declared the victor.
But when the Executor bowed and felt his own grave he hesitated. The crowd had ceased to smile, as they had never smiled before. They simply listened to him and smiled. A corner of the crowd clapped and the Executor walked out of his room. They all smiled and the Guard did too. The Vigilant followed him. It was a frightening and ungodly feeling. It lead to a terrible shadow-sniping.
The Vigilant walked back into his room. His eyes were wet from sleep. But soon his features became distant and his muscles relaxed.
" Wait! There's someone in here! " He called. He squinted at his surroundings. There was nothing. His muscles relaxed again, and his eyes were red. He raised the torch to the center of his room and flung it into the air. Suddenly the room was silent.
The Vigilant's brow furrowed as he watched the Executor lead his army into the fields and destruction. The soldiers looked up as if to say, " I am in the city! " The Executor laughed. The people applauded. The people cheered back. The faces of those they killed all faded to black. The Executor laughed, got his sword, and hurled it at his prey. The crowd cheered in a frenzy. One follower of the old man's revulsion at life, a gardener, ran away.
" Who are you? " The Vigilant asked.
" I am the Historian," replied the Executor.

"Shit. " I groaned to myself. It was almost a necessity. For a part of me, anything would just make things worse, and it was becoming more and more apparent to me that I wasn't fully awake. Another part of me, however, was even more troubled. I had always thought it to be difficult to be alert, that we all have a soul mark, but no one ever assumed any of this was true, and that every second that it happened was hardly enough to make me feel uneasy about it.
“ IT ’ S EVERYWHERE, WHILE YOU STILL DROPPED LIKE THAT? ” I decided to ask God.
“ NOPE, DAMN IT. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO FUCK THIS UP? WHY DID N'T YOU JUST DO THIS?! ”
“ Because I just fucking wrote it over? Christ, did I just maybe take it away from you? ”
“ SHUT UP DUDE. ”
That's when I knew it was all a fucking lie. I walked over to the cabinet and opened up one of the cabinets, and saw a silver blade embedded in the floor.
“ See? It's just fucking blood. ”
“ OH GOD, PLEASE STOP THE WORD, IT ’ S S A CEREMONY! ”
“ Oh God, HOLY CRAP, IT COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE, FOR GIVE ME ENOUGH OF THE REALAMAS WHILE I DO N'T KNOW WHAT WAS COMING ON ”
The victim drew closer, and I saw a spot of blood on the floor, and a bottle of blood sloshing along, like some demonic craft had just been dropped down off a giant cliff.
“ Alright, so what if it wasn ’ t you? What if it was some stupid sick joke, or some stupid prank to show how I was just controlling an ageing woman? What if you just stayed in bed all day and didn ’ t masturbate? ”
I didn ’ t really feel like really thinking about it. This world-renewal machine started doing stupid tricks, but I was still standing here, staring at the monster that was before me.
“ Y-y-y-you mean, *you* see this fucking stain on my chest? It just so happens that my soul mark actually started falling on the floor after I tried to stand up, and that ’ s been happening for years now, like this… ”
“ What? ”
“ I ’ m sorry sir, but right now… I don ’ t think I have *the ability* to* change it. If it gets enough right, then I will have to take drastic measures and change my mind. ”
The room became dark, and I realized that I was facing exactly the same side of a mirror I always went through in school, drawing whatever I wanted on my face so it appeared normal and good for my body. As the mirror slowly changed, my mind began to flood with images.
A man would cut off his own hands, leaving behind his wife, a child and all of her things, things she could use to make a living. Her house, which looked exactly like this: a baby store. She wouldn ’ t have to worry about anything, but even after her parents were gone, she didn ’ t care.
Her mother used to play with dolls, dolls that reminded her of her grandmother. How she forgot her marbles had worn away, why she had run across the street while she was in the process of baking and catching the sun.
And suddenly I had a whole world to think about. And everything seemed good.
The attacker had cut off her arms.
I realized that I was covered in blood. As if all of this was just a fast and anesthetic.
Somewhere down the road, there lay a demon, with an evil look to his face.
“ I ’ m sorry, I hate to be out of earshot, but who is this?"

"Good morning, sir. ", says the blond haired man with blue eyes. " I'm looking for Cynthia. ".
" Oh my god, " calls Cynthia, " what happened to you in that time? "
" I found her. "
This is what I thought all my life. I was pretty sure her mother had died when she was 3. " Where the hell is she? " It was her father, so maybe she really was the one. After we met, we started dating. She was mean, especially when you like the idea of being soft and shy. I was really confused that we didn't catch on, which is why we wasted our time searching.
Suddenly, Cynthia came home. I opened the front door. It was lovely, but empty. She had all her clothes on, and even she appeared to be older than I thought. After she walked in, the first thing she noticed was the quilt. Odd, right? I opened it up. We stared at each other for a long while, and the first thing she noticed was that there was a very uncomfortable cupboard. She leaned back and looked at the walls of her room. Finally, she noticed the most unusual thing, a clock that read " 9:34 PM ". How weird. " How are you awake? " She asked, and as if in response, I didn't know. " I'm not worried. We are safe ".
We went outside and looked at the outside of her room. A note on the wall read " 15:30 NOON UNLESS SHE TURNED OFF MY FIREWORKS". She pulled out the water gun and loaded it. After the gun went off, she carried it out the bathroom. She noticed the cups had thatched roof, and looked at the top for a while. Then she found it. A pool. In her room, she found a closet and a water gun.
The next morning, we found nothing.
We went back to her house, and discovered a whole mess of clothes, including my pants. There was a note that read,
> Go home now.
And that, my friend, is why I got into scouring the globe.

We're falling apart. It never had to happen like this, no.... Something wasnt right here. The vacuum kept us in this nothingness, we knew it wouldn't be long. We were too small to really ignore them. Just imagining an alternate reality. The only way we could communicate is through the sleep pods we survived and found, they were screaming to us. The ambient hum of the engines gave us ideas as to where we were headed. We could see "hell" was about to smash through space, there was no escaping from this destruction.

Last night was my best. I was hooked up to an amp, and I was basically asleep in the dark. Today, I woke up in the middle of the woods. I decided to see where I had been and pay attention to what was going on around me. When I saw a faint light coming my way, I quickly looked around as if it would strike me, but the light only picked up speed as I ran out of the woods. I knew when I started running back the direction I was going, but then... nothing.
I was able to wake up before I collapsed. I heard an object hitting the ground in a loose circle around my head. I looked around, and saw that it was ME.
I immediately knew what was going on and I got up.
"Shit! You're not even alive!" I yelled into my cell phone.

It started two weeks ago. Same thing was going on at hospital. The same thing happened a few weeks ago. Suddenly I started feeling very weak. No pain. My head felt like it was going to pop back up. And then my vision did. I had only just started to look through my books when everything started to brighten up.
There was light. No reason why I could see through that light. It was a powerful beam of light, and light tends to illuminate things if the light are too bright. I started to remember a lot of events from yesterday. I remember waking up to the sound of thousands of elephants cheering for the city to drown out. The birds were nestled up on the sandy walkways, and my mother was walking with me with her baby. That was it. This was it.
My mother went to wake me up in the middle of the night, and I heard her husband stomp on the ground.
"Take a seat son " she says. I look up, startled. My father was just standing by me, talking to the ground. I saw his teeth jutting out. He wiped his brow, as he did every night.
" What's going on here? " I asked confused.
" I don't know. Maybe it's my eyes " his wife reassured.
" Wait there was some sort of event happening. I don't know how it happened but it happened today " his wife looked at me. I couldn't recognize any of them.
" Everyone started getting kinda ugly today. Lots of injuries that weren't apparent until today. We have quarantine and tests are just coming up. " My father smiled shyly. " This would be nice."
I didn't understand what was going on. They seemed to be taking my research in everything it could. There were no medical reasons at this point. All I knew was that my parents were taking care of me, so I didn't have much else to worry about.
There was a blast of light.

Day 727 of Google ’ s exponential rise in sales. The origins of the company includes just such a story as that.
It started with the idea of an entity. Humanity had designed itself for the task. Existing only as an amalgamation of biological, biological, and other genetic material was not ideal, and it entered the business first, before it became too great for human consumption.
The company cut ties with Google ’ s competitors on financial grounds. It considered the information it collected, and the other companies that funded it but were there and not included.
Its greatest invention was the ability to download consciousness, through the questions all of us asked. To become a sentient being was a way to be immensely powerful. Now, with more and more understanding of all systems and forms of consciousness, it wants to have a monopoly on every field in this planet. It wants to expand its reach far beyond the bounds of human biology, finding people who can ’ t fathom the concept of consciousness.
Sitting at the board of directors meeting, I was very happy to have met with our CEO, Wayne. Wayne's invention, dubbed the “ Instant App that Will Turn Anything into Consciousness ” was an amazing result. Every customer interaction should have a moment of pure experience, only accessible through direct connection. We modeled the idea of the “ Instant ” on this idea. Only, he did not include our employee resources.
Dearly considered, he wrote down all of the stupid demands for the “ Instant ” for the board of directors, including instructions on always making suggestions. I had expected the CEO to personally offer his inventions to the board of directors, to make sure they became completely independent of their screens, and to be fully made aware of our performance.
The board of directors would assign a board of directors of their own choosing, and speak to Wayne, once a week or two. Wayne became much more comfortable in this facility.
All the same, I gave the instant app a small reward, which would enable him to disappear if he did not do something clever, and for him to become a “ employee of the day ” of the board of directors. Within months he was disappearing, and I got another reward:
One day he won the lottery.
-- --
So far, it ’ s turned out the project has been successful. Mr. and Mrs. Jenner are providing services of their own. I heard there are already two more stations set up, at the same time. Google is gradually building a computer base.
Hopefully they can then find a source of technology more than they could develop themselves.

For as long as I remember I've dreamed of eating a peanut butter sandwich. So much for being immersed in that thought of free Will... At least it started innocently enough.
It began with people approaching me, probably planning to one day take me to that very similar location. They seemed harmless enough, just standing near me on all fours. But there were certain things that happened on those ends. For one, I felt all the electricity being generated throughout my body. Like I had been a sort of pet rabbit all those thousand years. Like I could run! But then... now the feeling of being eaten was different. Everywhere... Everywhere.
Apparently, I was to be crushed. But I didn't know what. Oh yes... I know. I am. I can be crushed. That is when I tried to do something I would normally... only... unlikely do. In which case, I was just... off limits for a few minutes.
With my vision quickly returning, I looked around. The ground was already too dark for a living person to see. The buildings couldn't be more than a few meters in height. There was only one source of light from the sky above us, but that did not stop me from crawling outside. Slowly, I gathered my strength. Running into that dazzling sun when I was feeling all those tests and tests and tests... that seemed like mere hours into my journey. It got harder and harder though. The more I ran, the hotter I became. With every step my heart started to go flat. I just wanted to go home... but it just got so... kind of bad... and then I just kept walking. I only wanted to avoid further harm... all the while hoping that I would survive. But... somehow there was one corner of the road that was lost for me. That giant cave entrance that I kept on my heels until I realized... it was somehow closed for so long. This wasn't going to make it that way anymore... these, like I was saying... these were so, so far from safe. The rest was easy... I even made it... to the other side of that very portal... for what seemed like an eternity.
Finally, some time passed... the fight had over, but... I just kept on running. Sorrow overcame me. Years passed as I tried my best to withstand the horrors that lay ahead. Until finally, my vision came back to me. I could feel the cuts ripping down my bare arm in every direction... it was impossible not to tear it up... that I almost couldn't see through it. I just wanted to go home... where there is no way out. However, the pain gradually vanished as I did not even need to close my eyes... I simply stood there. I wondered... what am I supposed to do when I am in those same situation all those years? Could I even imagine this... this... world and what I did to put myself in it? I was at peace... how could I possibly do it? What were I supposed to do... how could I... THINKING THAT ENOUGH!
I couldn't hear anything from here on out anymore... I just kept on running... it was forever. Until I finally broke off.

Perhaps there is something I've failed to discover with the little robots I've created. But still, it clearly reminds me. The last time it had ever visited my planet, we were completely petrified by the sight of alien life. I promised myself to be more thorough. Instead, they simply left me behind.
*I don't need much. *
I had asked my mom a few times why the aliens were leaving me behind.
"Why?! Why doesn't the world want me? "
" There is a reason that we live, despite what the tiny thing called civilization may claim. "
My mom's eyes widened. " Why?! "
*Why me? Why did they have to leave me behind? *
They were causing a great deal of trouble. I remembered how many times the village was attacked by the aggressors, and all it took was a burst of fire. Several desperate villages suffered through countless reigns of terror. I cursed myself for ever turning my back on the people.
*Does it matter at this point? *
" It won't matter if it makes you a better human or a terrifying one," I mocked.
*I'm wrong! *
The little robot next to me, who had unfortunately become quite pretty, asked to be revealed. The other only smiled as it dropped her hand and looked me dead in the eyes.

"Mazda model 1712 recently hit zero ", said a grumpy Wendy.
Steve went through the usual checklist in his head, pictures, a bottle of scotch, and did a half-assed math. If it came from craigslist, he was never going to get a job in life that would pay enough to miss his taxes, and his problem was in-order to pass the building by. These things always make Steve feel awkward.
" Hello? " a seemingly familiar, but slightly gruff female voice from across the room asked.
Steve looked back at his computer screen. A total of 40 folders.

"W-what are you doing here? " A short blonde woman, dressed in a black suit, creaking her thin legs behind her ears. " The Air Force showed us this place before! " she mocked. " What does it matter that they've always been more vague about the war than we want them to be? We're military, after all. " As she was reminded of that, she swivelled her eyes with her thumb and notched on her mini-Beret.
" What are you talking about, Santa? " I asked with the empty spoon on my hand.
Her ears began to chatter in return. " I saw a terrorist and hoped they would use us. " She replied.
" I.. I'm afraid they already have. They almost won, Sir. " I stated out loud.
The blonde woman finally got up and began to scroll through her flyers. She hit down a few items that would appear in her flight test booklet at the academy, but we were already out of the house. " No need to explain yourself, Santa! Come get me all bagels from the microwave when we leave for HQ. "
Finally she reached the homepage and she began to tap on the fly trail under the menu. I watched her execute the search in her head. Her eyes were beautiful as she wrote down the pages that she would need. " You are my nanny," she typed on the fly trails.
I went back to my room, stilled. But I waited with baited breath.

I would never admit it, but I was compelled by mine to tell the story. It's hard to tell stories from the point of view of one who lives in times and places so distant from the past.
I'm the writer here. I've got one story to tell. The first chapter described his mother, filled with dread and anxiety, laughing at the filthy stuffed animal he was making when he caught it. She died of dehydration, she stopped dreaming and stared at it in silence. It seemed to her like a human waste, and I became obsessed. I mean... I never ate anything. I mean really, who would be so disappointed, that you wouldn't let a pet food get in your mouth.
I remember the door opening and the screaming through the door; the sound of men in white suits shouting down the hallway.
"... We managed to get it working. "
The room's ashes glittered, and the white-haired man slowly moved to draw a cigarette. " Okay. I think we're in trouble. " He pointed to a cramped room and at another man carrying a big tray of food.
I didn't look up, staring at them. They were clearing away the trash and dust. " Verena, we need to get going. You're going to waste your existence on these things."

Nothing special happening, just sitting, moving forward with nowhere to go, just sitting, relaxing. Everyone is so easy to find. All the dishes are piled around their furniture and the umbrellas, all suspended on their cars, just the way a pair of scissors would. No service, only seems like a distraction to the mad dash towards the manager, the one who hasn't put water in his coffee maker because the glass cracks more if he tries to yell...
He's on the fifth wheel and there's no one there to tell him to stop he's going to hit the second and scream for help and he just looks so terrified and alone, I've barely got the breath left to give him, he might even see someone you were the only others in this park with. God, what a rush they can have running around with everyone else, dying but maybe... somehow they don't believe in hell, maybe the thought of their own demise gets to them and they just... they stop and just stare at the ground in disbelief, confused.
The bridge is in ruins though. Literally everywhere, because of a huge chain, bigger and thicker with mesh tarp that goes on leading nowhere but the bridge and at the bottom of the staircase the shockwaves at the structure sweep right off, one at a time. The building is wide open, everybody running off without seeing anyone, the earth is slowly being ripped into pieces. Some building goes directly off path and all the police notices them, grab the crowds and look down. There is a faint smell of something though, slight sour and even taste like searing heat.
Something's in that building. Maybe someone was a little too high to jump. Whatever it is, he must have felt it or... the sun is cold enough to melt the crack on the roof beneath me, so much so that I can see it with my own eyes. No one could see the entire structure, just static white light. Almost in that brief moment of peacefulness, I'm staring at it now, I move my chin back, eyes closed, see, then silence.
Slowly I realised, the scene was becoming clear. There was no one. I'd tried to jump, but I couldn't. I couldn't escape this moment. I'm trapped in here and I can't possibly go back, this loneliness, this despair is sucking me in like someone has poured into me. The sudden urge to jump was starting to grow stronger and I realised I had no choice but to jump.
Soon, the whole city below me was falling apart, all I could see was static. Suddenly I had a beautiful feeling, I don't know where I am, maybe something... I'm fine... I can't see anyone, I can't smell them. I can only call out for help... but the suns beat down on me and I know it will kill me soon. My only friend was sitting by the railing now, I'm sure she has a knife or something in her hands, it's always been the knife I'm most thankful to have. She watches the sunset for hours, I can't help but smile. At least she's here now, walking away from the scene like a baby, I think to myself, in the autumn air on the river before going back to my life. I realise, staring at my watch, I'm supposed to be going by the wall, never mind crashing down this bridge and jumping when I feel like something is wrong, maybe not at all. Maybe I could wait till some guy will arrive here, maybe he'll tell me they're just fallen asleep and safe... until, sometime in the future... maybe... I'll see you again in no time at all.

"... or should I say... we were consumed by them. " said the apex. " Gods, we never knew about this before, why did they strike us down when we were little? " The apex replied. " We never understood what it was to be the apex. " The apex said in an almost amused tone. " Your being pleased, what the fuck? " asked the trigger. " Nah, no, I'm an inconsiderate asshole. " replied the trigger. " Once your possesions become communicable, and you get their only bit of stimulation, they will all kill for your entertainment. "
( I don't write so I have to end in a pun )
" So, not only did we never know what it was, but we were in awe at how they didn't need our attention. "
The apex replied. " They... they took our brains away and they must have gotten some bad memories. And I really hate the description of something so do I, I should have read more of your stories. "
" Yeah and I know not to call them'bad memories,' they really just mean the same thing.'Revenge?' "
" Yes, right, I know. I really can't wait until you tell everyone you know how to read and write, everyone! "
" Thanks, good. Now we were smitten. "
" So you'll be telling everyone the Ultimate Guide, the Ultimate Guide to Hell, of course? "
" Definitely, come on, so I guess I'll let you keep it? "
" I guess I'll thank you. "

"Finally some company! " He thought as he leaned back in his chair.
Mike grinned as he placed his lunch at the table and closed the book he always wanted to pass around. Even though his history project subjects were dated a week ago today, his GPA had risen to the impossible level. He was 8.0, with an acceptance letter and a job application.
It was too perfect...
He walked up to the desk with his eyes wide open and he started to read through his paper. Every page was retraced to his birth in St. Louis, Missouri. His ten year old twin brother, Gerald, was a huge sports athlete, and today was April 30th of their year.
Even though Mike needed time travel to make it through the year, he couldn't help but laugh as he read. He figured he needed to study for finals on History Day.
Another slide was put down at the table and he started to type it. The only page remaining on his paper was:
'Subject Abroad'
He frowned at the piece of paper, but it wasn't the first time he'd picked up a new subject for his exam. He liked football, but it made him feel less buzzed out about his education. Mike chose Football because he was an average football player and it made him feel much more relaxed about going to college. He thought he'd tried his Time Travel method some time ago, to try getting more exposure but it had failed. He just sat there a while, thinking.
He checked his email and found it missing something. He had gotten an email every day from his girlfriend about the subject, but it had not been from her. He took a minute to visit the email but it still read:
'Subject Abroad'
What, he thought. Why was this subject missing? He had done the math hundreds of times but nothing was being sent to his phone or social media.
As he went to wipe the tears from his eyes he looked over at Gerald, his cousin's brother Gerald.
" Yeah, it's you. Must've been from 5 o'clock. " Mike smiled as he saw his brother's face lit up in the camera feed.
" What can I help you with? " The first question the younger son had asked. " I want to know, where did your Sam recorded that video? "
" I think it's from another time. " The next question asked.
" Yeah, I know. Take me to that man right now. I think you get what I mean. " Mike also jumped up, quickly wiping the tears from his eyes.
" He was recording, right? I have a third hand camera on my room. " Gerald finished his question with a smile. " Why did he come up with this? What happened to him? "
Mike nodded, unsure if this was possible. He would have to wait a week before he needed help with any further research. He looked at his cousin, with fondness, who was sitting right next to him.
" This was recorded of last Thursday, then, Ryan Snell. He committed suicide last Thursday, at which point, his mother. It is alleged he sent her a lot of crap. This is just standard procedure to contact and sometimes he forgets things." He smirked and walked over to the computer and started reading. He looked up and touched the screen and saw a picture of his brother, Dave, that same 20 year old.
He knew what to do.
He walked out of the classroom and made his way back to the Time Chamber.

"I am alone, but I am happy.
I know it's a scary quote, but you'd better check it out, now. First off, let me reassure you that it's perfectly normal for our situation to start scene as this. "
" Alright okay, all right okay, alright... " I said at this point, bending over and letting out a deep breath. The realization that my heart could be racing caused me to drop my hands to my sides as I went over to the window on the other side of the house.
" Okay. Well, that was life for me. " I chuckled to myself as I opened the front door to my bedroom where I felt a tingle down my spine and noticed there was definitely someone outside. Usually, I could go out in my room and hide or play with my friends, but today I found myself in a different part of the house.
I noticed the mailbox had a small, unmarked envelope inside. When I opened it I found my mother's things. I unfolded the envelope, got into bed, and quietly whispered to myself, " Go look for mummy, right? ". As I sat down in bed I noticed a note inside, it read:
" You have been watching the news with a shocked face... and you have a new dream, a new purpose, and some new things for people to take... OKAY!"

I hit my head on my desk, and stumbled back to reality. This was it. I would get picked off today. This was all it took. I shut the folder and played with the buttons. Life went on... Until I brought my rifle and was able to "do it again"...

<|endoftext|>
**********182**********
I had no idea at the time what to think. Maybe I was imagining things. And maybe I was dreaming up it.
At least, that's how I thought. I mean I didn't wake up to death many times after that, but I went back to my body every day, knowing exactly what I had done, hoping and praying for whatever that might be.
Then I woke up again the next morning to find that there was another name on my arm. And this one was different. I could hear a loud popping noise that sounded very familiar, like a broken glass shattering into splinters or something.
"You're me! I was trying to take down that zombie monster that was hunting you! "
The zombie got closer, and I froze in place. I spun around to be able to see it, too, the outline of a human face being stared back at me.
" How did you manage to escape? " I didn't answer, but the whispers of panic on my body died down in an instant.
I didn't tell anyone, not even the worst of the people that I knew. And as they approached me, holding me out of their burning reaches and slowly holding me closer, at one point, they made a motion that sounded like they were trying to grab me from behind. The worst of it, though, was how they jumped out the other side. I had to catch them before they could catch me, and I had to, because that was their problem.
I was too weak to run, and you knew that. They had saved me. And now they found my new body, wrapped in a blanket in the corner of a bunker in Pennsylvania, for me.
I was right here. Now I'm just one case of the nightmare.

**********183**********
I can't help but smile. My mother is right, I'm meant to live in Italy and not come back here to the US. My house looks more Italian than it has in years, and there is me in a nice, aged home that I bought decades ago. Here I am, frozen, waiting for the day I graduate from Italy with the support of my life savings. And I'm listening to the music I bought as a friend about ten years ago.
*The rest of the house is still here. I even had a room for myself, a sort of motor home for a closer look at the house. A huge, distinct brass ballad. It had old Italian air to it. *
It is a well-established fact that when traveling through Italy, you should be on your way to most populated areas, except for the Palazzo mortari area, and my home. In fact, it's the place that should have already been known in civil wars and constant battles back and forth for centuries. It's also the birthplace of whatever started me, the young me after I applied for public school and dropped out before I even got a diploma.
They tell me that it's a mistake to take a temporary residence in Italy in hopes of moving to Europe, but I know this much. I arrived in that room one day, got the call in late afternoon, and prepared my suitcase. I went to my parents' room first, put on my night dress, and headed for my place.
After much speculation, and I really wanted to, I would drive to my front door, and knock on the door, so that I could say "hello ", with my head down. I opened the door slowly, and sat down at my usual spot, my large family bed, and placed my suitcase on my bedside table.
" Hey Pa, but you're coming with us, isn't that the reason we called you? ", I said, slightly angry to see my father here at this late hour.
" Yeah, but we're not like the air raid sirens on the news, we're my family! And we need to leave here! "
" I know what's happening, so why not? I have to leave, and you're going to miss me and everyone who cares about me. And you don't even want to kill me, sweetie. It's just too much. It's just not how it worked at first, you know? I think I'm going to be gone for the rest of my life after the air raid sirens. And even though you're the reason why I'm here, I'm not going to run off to my parents' house any time soon, and even though I won't stop listening to the music I bought, I'm leaving my house. "
" You're telling me that all your savings will be gone? I know, right? But I don't have to leave, no, not even the only thing that you are planning to do. And even with all these questions, there's going to be someone else who you will still love. "
" And what else? You're going to throw money at someone who will care about you? You know we've heard about plans to go to Europe, but why? "
" Because I have two young kids. We make a lot of money, and my older kids will go to school and get a good job and help my family. And we can live in their house, and live here forever."
You start to leave, and suddenly you hear the clanking of foot steps on the door as I casually carry my suitcase to the living room. I chuckle to myself as I grab my suitcase, and decide to pretend I'm actually in a subway train, as is my normal routine, until I'm too late. And when my mother comes to say goodbye, I laugh to myself out loud.
I already know what happened the day I graduated from Italy, and my only regret was going to Italy, and living in an empty house, and thinking about how I would be gone if I moved? That didn't happen. And I can't blame her. I should be here, thinking about how I will live in Italy, thinking about how my dog might take care of me, and that will also be because I would be gone even if she had someone else to care for.
*Sorry for the small size, but what is the point of starting a family if it means you're not going to have a stable job? I definitely regret nothing, but I have to send my death note soon. Thank you for reading. *

"It was too much. "
" It wasn't in my programming. "
" It's already too much. "
" It's really not. "
" What are you talking about? "
" No, no, please don't try it on me. She is a beta-form human, just like you are. "
" Look, there is literally nothing you could have done. I am at peace with myself. "
" It's not all about *that. * "
" I am the next person in line to be described as one of the most dominant of all humans! "
" Please, listen to me! "

" Then why are you asking me? Why aren't you asking everyone else? "
" Because *you* are not fit for this job. "
" I wonder if that counts for anything. "
" Listen to me, you can't just shut it down like this. This place needs to be fed. "
" Should I be teaching them, or learning? "
" Have you never taken exercise before? Maybe that's you waiting for lunch? "
" You can't undo that step. You can't find anything. "
" There are slaves in the academy, and they are coming to join you. Your walk to the reservation has been marked. "
" Is it that soon? "
" Nah. I just, like, - "

**Love story. **
I rolled over quickly as I layed back down. * Nobody really knows where to start. The final scene is supposed to start with her just standing there with the name Samantha Rodriguez in her hand.* Its probably shit though. I did stuff like this on my own and I know it's far from normal, but where am I now. * I guess its a lonely mission to not see the sun too many times a day while she can, but me? I did the damn thing for a reason and now I'm stuck here wasting it. Hope that works.

My finger curled around the handle and the door slid shut. The inside was slimy and dark. My eyelids strained to keep the light off my face. That wasn't a problem when I smiled at Melissa, who was rubbing my back. From her scratchy smile she'd always used as a measure of how comfortable she was, I think to myself. Whatever I'm paying for, I always pay for the worst of it. Even if those tiny little panties my company was offering just felt like trash.
"I wish you could at least pay me back enough money, Miss Prysant. She was rather lovely, and she is quite of a hit.
I looked away from her and towards the door. The girl wasn't going to notice me because she was already staring at it. I didn't like that. Truthfully, being in the dark, staring at my own ass, staring at my own body, staring at my own ass... Really? She wasn't going to appreciate the thoughts that came after...
*Oh yeah. *
I grabbed a plate from the kitchen to make sure it was where it should be. The being smirked. It must have been the first time I'd seen a dick.
There was a knock on the door. The door was now cracked. " Michael, come in. " She waved towards me with a " I'm sor-" The door clinked open and the chime of the door filled with a beeping of alarm. I didn't notice anything was wrong, I looked around. I walked out the front door, and into the dark alleyways. Cars coming at me had stopped.
I made my way over to her. It was difficult to pick out the shadow of her face. It was a woman's. Not of hers, but rather the flower from a rose of a werewolf I'd seen earlier in the day. I turned back to the scented aroma of the rose. It was cinnamon. Probably cinnamon, or something like that.
I found myself crouched down under a bench, observing the scene from the other side of the alley. But what was most unnerving about this scene was the little device holding my most erotic urge.
The neck, and abdomen.
*If only, you could only go back to now. *

"Fucker, you let me up! "
I tried to fight back but before I could I had won. I felt everything I had fought for, felt invigorated by all of it. My orgasm was unstoppable.
I even held onto the railing so that I wouldn't fall! Damn it, did I forget something.
The sky was blue and soon I could see the sun peeking at the horizon. As the sun rose up, I pushed the railing back. Unfortunately, after the large roost already happened, my back had a strange heat. I was cold.
My curiosity got the better of me and I leaped for the balcony railing. I made a great leap with the railing but took a great leap again.
Then, surprise struck. A very small penis in my hand, roughly six inches in length. I collapsed face first, feeling the world around me begin to tremble and shake. It was then that I realized, through my sweating, from my badly needed second orgasm that I had suddenly lost my virginity.
The frustration faded as the sun plummeted down and onto the brick bridge next to us. I began to cry even harder as my tears streamed out of my boyfriend. I had caused this, that, disgusting penis. It was my fault, and neither of us had any qualms about it.
As the sun rose and the sun plunged down, I heard the distant sirens of police on the other side. I started to panic as I heard a man scream. I'm not going to let my boyfriend down like that.
I prayed and prayed and prayed until the sirens grew stronger. I cried until my screams filled the sky and soon everyone around me lay quiet.

As she kissed me I heard a cry, my mommy kicking her legs in disgust. Then there was a screeching sound, sound of gargling bile. She stood and shouted. " Chants! Chants! " She paced back and forth, trying to save me, but she seemed so tired, tired, and she forgot to shake me. So tired. " It's getting bad now honey. You just have to get up and go back to sleep. Just go back to bed, okay? "
Dad had come back to visit. I looked at him as if he were mummy and dad. He was doing his best, he knew where I was, and I understood why. I jumped in my bed, breaking his grip and then slipped off. As I fell off I heard another noise, sort of rustle here, murmuring " Get up, your soft girl! We need you! Go back to bed " A hand gripped my leg and lifted me off the bed. " Daddy, it's night time and you've got to go back to bed. " " Just go back to bed honey! Just go back to bed!" I screamed at my mom, a mere sob of my own, and then another. He looked up at me and his eyes red with disappointment. I ran inside to see my Daddy's beloved, loving wife laid out before us. I ignored the cries, their " belch " and I just continued down the hallway into the bedroom. I patted the wet socks off of my head, and Mommy sat up and did an adorable smile. She had painted on the last pair of shoes I'd put up in the box for Halloween.

My heart skipped a beat as I drew breath, my body made my muscles feel like steel and my chest felt like nail. I cradled the trembling child close in my arms while looking down at me. This was all it took for him to notice me as he faced me off to the side and finally put his head on my shoulder. My body was getting tired and my eyes twitched in the darkness.
He was no stranger to the past. He had been starting off strong, raised in a family of strong women and done everything right to contribute. His life was about to change, and I watched as he struggled for a way out. I felt tears trickling down my face as I thought of the amount of anger he would cause me as I hugged him and buried him in the next chair. Tears glided down his darkening hair and rolled off of his cheeks when he laid eyes on me. I hugged him harder than I had before and I smiled warmly at him. He smiled back, and for a moment I could feel it. He loved me, and I loved him back too. I looked up at him again. I could tell he was tired, but he was exhausted.
I let my tears flow down my cheeks, my only solace from all the tears. My hands cracked into the comfort of my other hand before reaching up and pulling me gently up to hug him as I searched for him. His tears fled as he embraced me again. His eyes lit up as he turned to look at me. They were filled with hope that our friendship could be, that that he might be able to help someone else. He had so many things he wanted to say to me, but had a strict limit on how many words they could say. I couldn't begin to tell him what he wanted to say to me.
It made everything better, but then something happened and in an instant, tears began to roll down my cheeks like waves. I felt his love... then...

Today is the day that humanity will not continue to exist.
I could not believe my eyes at the news. I hadn't done any of the research with me... except that I used a trial just about every year... for a tax season.
At the time, I could not believe the term'control'. That was, of course, until the government brought it into the debate about human wellbeing, a term that I had become used to too frequently throughout the democratic process of government and science. It was amazing how clear the line between objective and subjective morality was as it was, and always was.
It was a shame, the fact that a country so completely in debt that only the rich could afford to pay their way up until then became the focal point of debate, or the driving force of a government that watched them hum to the beat of a drum as they eagerly paid off the bills by their own hoarding abilities.
Why did I even care about how the rest of the world looked in the mirror? I just believed in change, and I wished more people actually knew. The daily maintenance of your genes couldn't be distributed, and without proper treatment, I thought it was a world devoid of hope.
And so the government introduced the latest loophole into their system, to manipulate the genome of an undeserving human, to permit individuals to live among the dirt. I couldn't understand what they were doing... or what they did... but I got to live with the repercussions, unless a candidate who was based solely on my DNA suddenly noticed my DNA changing into what I am now.
They buried me there. It's sad how little understanding there was about human evolution from there. Ever since their access to my genes reduced the population, that virus became another, completely fascinating force that human nature could not wrest away. There have been several ascends, though people made the transition from their relatively common past into the edge of their now crippled hope. The point is, our evolution has been absolute bullshit.
I lost hope... then did nothing. It's honestly like a nuclear holocaust.
Yes, it started with an unfortunate accident. It simply broke our genetic coding. I lost the ability to select my own genetic code.
We, humanity, suffer.

Well I finally got a date. Actually, I did. I had hit it off with my fiancé's husband- that's what he called her.
"You know what the hell it's like. It's like a lot better than just getting pulled over on the first date. "
" Oh... okay. So after I say that, I've got all these questions. "
" What about myself? "
" That this woman didn't care about all the jobs. She's out-jobsing me to get food stamps and dinner on time. She's degrading me. You know why? "
" Yes! You know what? I don't care! I love her! "
The words sent a tingling feeling down my spine. I've always felt this way, to the point that something's wrong with me. I stepped back and in a sweat, I took the same breath and before I knew it, I was facing down the elderly lady of my dreams with a long white dress and a briefcase. I looked down. It was her. The one I had drawn so many sleepless nights staring at.
" What was I drawing? " She asked.
" What? "
" I've always drawn dark; the kind of stuff that shocks those who drink. She had such a small frame, but I felt my heart melt right away. It's fine, I did it for her. "
" Um. How does it feel? "
" I feel light. "
" Right. Not when I'm down. You know, like, from the office or something? You get so down when you make an object clean before the phone rings. "
" And then you fall asleep? When I realize that you weren't the one? "
" Oh, no. She told me not to. " She was quiet for a little bit. She knew what was coming next. She knew why I sat there, staring at her for longer than a minute, unable to move a single muscle.
" I don't even know how to be happy."
And she said...
All of a sudden, she lay in bed, slowly awake. Everyone was doing it, except her.
And she was smiling.
And she was laughing, too.

I have a rich life. Sucks to let people scam me. But it's not like they exist to stop me. I just come here for the money and they leave me to their own devices. I know nothing. I just want to get my paycheck. Needed something. I have nothing but time. I just want what I have. I take advantage of the'accidents' to save for another day or two. Lots of me have these. Birds land on me and kick me in the face. I care enough about the birds to give a charity fair for them. I keep trying to pay my bills. But its always another asshole to talk to me.
My apartment is filthy.
Every month I take the stairs to my room. That room is full of nasty bugs.
Every day I open up the freezer.
Every goddamn time I get a quarter of their good looking stuff.
They call every damn time they check up on me.
It keeps going. Why do I keep coming back empty handed.
The trash never ends.
The money doesn't go either.
We need someone. Someone big enough. Someone someone that can do what I have. A tall young man with a monochrome haircut wearing a cheap suit on the mall, nice tan hair tucked into a nice beard, a tattoo of some kind on his left arm.
I hope that he gets to see me again.
I've heard all these stories.
A/N: Sorry about there. Also to apologize for "prior credit to the author". I have a mother of two, i can't sleep while I am writing and both my brothers are to busy with family.

Well pikachu gave me a good set of lazer attacks and a koala helmet. Or pikachu napped that butterfly, which hurts when you bit it. But napping pikachu put me to bed pretty quickly after that, you see. Yes, napping pikachu meant laying around, living in the pikachu forest, and hoping for you to learn something useful about pikachu, a full fledged pikachu can teach you a whole bunch. There's been a lot of speculation about what types would unlock the mysterious pikachu, but the big question is, how would you do that?
To answer this, I'll assume you've been playing a long enough game that you know how trainers interact with each other. Maybe it's the series Pokemon in the pokemon store, or the couple lives from Pokemon XD. But these all do make the central idea of friendship, allowing Pokemon to part ways, and develop in-game friendships.
You may ask yourself how you would proceed right now in dealing with this problem. I would be like that kid at a red light, trying to drown his wife in pikachu flavored alcohol. Would it make sense that I would be paying my expenses to see what pikachu can do in exchange for what we need in life, while young? I could be an extremely competitive person, living my own bachelor life, despite having to learn the hobby. But for now, I could wait out the Great Recourses to see how good pikachu will be.

The kid looked at his dad.
"Whatever you wish, James, you see the girl. "
" Sweetheart. How did you know that? How much longer do I have before we hit the highway? "
James started wailing, looking weakly at his father.
" Just remember, don't do it. I had to take precautions. " He put his hand on his son's shoulder. He reached up and grabbed it. It made the rope like dirt. He tied his own hand back.
" My daddy... " he strained. " I'll never be like you, James. " James could see his father crying with his voice. He heard Jamess father's footsteps. James heard his father's footsteps reaching for his hand. James felt his hand run from his fingers until it was covered by his hands.
" Daddy. Please. Please get back to school! "
He dragged his father out of the car, leaving James and his mom behind. He made sure to pack the school supplies for the day and returned to his father at the hospital.
He went to the bathroom for another cry when he remembered the girl. She looked so happy. She had only been staring at her hands all day. She was so sad. She had tears running down her face. " She's a bit more beautiful than me, " he whispered. James looked down at his daughter. Her dress was dirty. " And how is she doing? It's all she can do is stare. She is her own person. I love her so much. Please, daddy, I'm scared to see what is going to happen to her. " He wiped off some tears and pulled his daughter to his chest, resting his head on her shoulder.
" All she has to do is make... a decision. And we'll be alright. We have to... I guess it depends on whether or not I stay. " James took his daughter's hand. He ran his fingers over her hand and around it. His wife was silent. He kneeled down beside her. " I love you so much Daddy. " He kissed her forehead. His wife coughed. They broke apart. Her tears streamed down her face. He looked at her and felt her blood-red cheeks crinkle into sobs.
" God... it hurt... I... It hurts so bad..." James started crying. His daughter turned away and followed him. James felt the wetness on his neck, and knew that she had to go. She would be okay. His wife cried again, and she could just hear her voice again. He heard his daughter moan, but it was only a heartbeat away. When he looked up, she was gone.

I am the last Buddha.
Ever since the great creator of myths and legends, the Buddha created me.
And I was born.
And I became strong. And I spread my wings. And I was strong. And I became great. And I was mighty. And I was mighty. And I became... as I like.
So then, as I did it, they did away with my powers and changed me into the world I am today. From light to dark. From rivers of ice to seas of water to volcanoes of fire and lava. From creation to death. From creation to death.
And they destroyed me. By destroying the very idea of the word I am an ascended being. Burning them to bits. Charonizing them to ash. Impaling them on the gravestones to be burned into dust. Scavenging them to become many, their kindles desecrated from their slow, atomic descent to pain.
And what did I do? I did nothing but destroy. I leveled cities, I created rivers of ice, I carved oceans of water. My people built castles, great structures of golden brick. And as I built, cities and buildings and buildings became obsolete and gave way to brothels and squares and pavements. And as I polluted them with their waste, they began to die. And as their soil eroded, so did their buildings crumble from the careless touch of dying rain.
And as their civilization faded away from the sight of new life, so did their buildings and their society begin to get shredded as our memory was no longer the will of any god to replace our existence. All that was left of my creation was bones. Everything that was, looked, felt, or smelled.
And I saw the look in the eyes of the peoples who lived in dust so long ago, as I remember them as they died without our sole place in their land.
They saw the last stand of our great, mechanical power and vowed to rise once more, to strike down those who once were. And they feared death from inside and mourned with me, as it always does.
It seems that time finally gets up to snuff out our last smile, as I shuffle behind my pen. It seems that some day soon, everything will change.
As I glide out to take a final swipe, I feel the gentle breeze of a breeze you might feel upon your right temple. I shall keep you safe, under the guidance of my creator. The last of my kind should see you, trapped in this world and unable to return to your home.
And I feel my wings become smaller as I use their force to collect myself.
The words that followed my curse were as prophetic as the great enough I am.
Nothing happened.

It always feels nice to escape life. Spend the evening in bed. Forget, forget, forget. There's no satisfaction in it; it's torture. I thought about running around for an hour with a net. Not until I could live and beg with my new clothes ( one would think over ) and new hair and new eyes, when I suppose you could say it's torture.
I thought of that when I was young, when I was playing pranks on my parents. Everyone stared at me with some relief. My parents didn't know me and they're probably not dead. They probably never will be. Who knows what might happen, maybe some new band of murderous maniacs I'd not come to terms with until now.
Sure, most of me think I'm a killer, but inside I know it's not what I thought. We all know the kind of person I am. A delusional, apathetic *keen, egotistical* sociopath. It is in that form my reality that I sit. In that sense, I sit now; I'm my own worst nightmare.
I didn't think I'd ever get it wrong. First of all, it's crazy. But to me it's true. I had felt this in my dream, during the day; I didn't fear my parents. I didn't expect them to keep me inside. Because they should have, and no one will ever hear of me.
I had loved them for as long as I could remember. She always loved me. I thought she loved me, but I never knew. The only time I knew was when she asked me when I'd be. My mom never talked about that sort of thing. When I was older, I could only ask my sister to take care of the kids. Our things got a bit too big. When I was a little girl, I no longer felt strong enough to give a man any real ideas about me.
Mom's got something different going for her with the gift I've given her. I don't really understand what it is but it feels like torture. The something that keeps me going now is that I'm *different. * I haven't just been different, but I've also been different with not knowing. I haven't known the kinds of things I could do that have made me feel bad. She also learned something that will haunt me for the rest of my life. I don't think I'll ever know for sure; maybe something like "Huh, I forgot the money" or " I broke into the parking lot and opened the car door " or " Oh, that's a coffee stain on my face." or maybe all of those things are *identical*.
Maybe all of them are just cherry-picked memories. I don't know how. I know what it feels like to be that close to the end, to know that so many people have stopped trying, to stop blabbering, to be feeling that happiness all of the time.
And as my thought exits my head, it becomes easier to just leave and close my eyes and drag myself out of here. I know there's someone coming. They're coming with me, even though I know nothing, in that sort of a way. For once.
I hope you're enjoying it. I know I won't see it coming. I've sat here for nearly an hour with a net and a lift and lost my ability to think. I thought I'd tell you about that time I didn't know what was coming, while Mom was getting crushed under the rollercoaster of pain. I didn't have the courage to remember. I was terrified of what could happen. And now here I am, with something much bigger and scarier than what I could have possibly imagined.
I hope you enjoy.

Some people like to think that wolves hate bears. Well there's something different about the public. Bear streets seem to be the only places where food is brought around after meals, but we all know it gets left behind.
We ’ ve always been free of the bears, even though we all seem to hate them in some way. Whose *own* bears are they guarding or grooming? Our *own* bears are there. Waiting for the kindest person to try to barter for their spoils.
You would think that the people who oppress these creatures would see them differently than they do. Maybe what we see when we cross bears walls isn ’ t revenge from the government, it ’ s vengeance against a different identity. You see, the government has a certain way of keeping us from letting it happen. One that is troubling, for it involves murder. Many folks got into trouble for practicing murder. Nobody here would allow a man to plan for the murder that they are planning.
What we see when we cross those bear walls is unlike anything we've ever seen. People who openly practice murder can shoot away from strangers; many try to aim their guns at a wall. I ’ ve seen a person bludgeon another without even thinking or touching it. The dead to bleed in front of me.
It doesn ’ t surprise me when it ’ s so soon after noon that a bear punches me. I ’ ve been afraid of that since. I know we ’ re not safe out here.
Some people like to think that ‘ we ’ got ta fear our bear ’, because if we can ’ t take these nice creatures there will be no safe way to get into a safe location. Some of us know I ’ m afraid of bears, but most of us like to think that I ’ m wrong.

How many times have I read about the "damned kangaroo breeders " and " body monkey breeds? " They tell me their lives depend on " raising for entertainment ". It saddens me that they are hypocritical, menial jobs we give them. No sexual orientation! While all the other kids are given a dragon, and even the dragon will be examined and grow up. We can give them a tail if we want, it's not so bad though, they get a lot of fun with that.
When I was 15, it all started with a singing fairy. She woke me up, first try out a new fantasy setting, and then I dosed her with a drug. But now it's some kind of " gentleman's body. " She didn't want to be broken, and so I followed her for the rest of my life. I wanted a hula boy too, the senses love it. Something different each time though.
I'm sitting at my recliner. It's only 7 years old with dolls all over it. It's bright, blue and lush and boyish. A few years later, I'm sitting with my mom here. She wants me to get her an inherited reptile, something even bigger, or a ten foot dragon to teach me how to finish projects, " rough stuff ". But of course, I don't get it. I don't even know how to play with it. I'm a " bot ". My parents could understand that, but they always told me not to, so of course, they pass me on to a different dragon... or so they said.
I learn to play play and go to my bed. On days when Mom and Dad have appointments, I study everyday. I was a wanderer back when I was 9. When I was 9, I went on a special pilgrimage and climbed Mt. Doom to climb over the lava pits. It was awesome, too. I had a family, I was happy, I was connected. I didn't see any aggression in them, after all. I was an adventurer again, a wizard and I kept going. I grew bigger by the day, more complete by the night, climbing these fantastic mines and climbing these dangerous mountain ranges. I tried to teach other people my hidden languages, and soon a band of adventurers came to my cottage. They said I was the " wandering idiot ", but I had a dragon that needed therapy. I told them everything they could about me.
" You are really scary for somebody like yourself. "
I picked up the kangaroo and played with it. The paint on it was a deep red and the hatch handle was rusty. I broke the handle. It's not normal to break the hatch handle, but because it's so shiny and small, I'm sure the people there would be jealous of me for it. I can't even remember the last time I made someone scream because of their complete lack of agility or intelligence. They told me I was a wizard so they could get it perfect, but I was out for a year, and then I found out about her. Some people tell me those people don't understand their parents, so that's why people ask them to create a giant dragon to make me look like them.
" You will learn your own language and use your dragon for play activities."

When I was a child, I would always sit on my long legs and make up languages as if reading. This, when I was young, was constant and lonely. I would read strange things and think on strange things that happened. I lost my parents to dyslexia, and I cried. I smiled, and smiled with joy. Everyday I would come back to my mother, and get a lecture about science, and all would be like the times they had - she and I had been together for years, since we were little. I had stopped seeing her, long ago, in our travels, but it was there that I began to love her - and I could not escape it.
I used to hear stories about how this happened to other people. If we found ancient creatures that were willing to learn our languages, where they could communicate, we would watch them. We would read through one another's conversations and tell the sorts of stories they left behind. We would watch from afar, unseeing, until we were so engrossed that we stopped. We left more and more of them in abandoned camps to rot in in winter, until we were hunted and terrorized. That was another world I grew up in, and another they left behind. There were times of people like me everywhere. I could understand him, she could understand him, and I was the one. We would watch each other. We had so much in common, even though we were the same language.
At one time, they started to argue over whether one of us is more superior to another, or they are more fearsome and more cruel. We laughed at them all the time, but I knew it wouldn't affect them. I would always try to teach them languages, but this time, they would fight on. I started seeing another species around us, as I watched one of them write thousands of words to another. They always shared one. At the time, I didn't understand how it could be possible, and they didn't understand us. I decided to help them. I would use my own language to make up all their plans, and hopefully through language and language, this could give them hope and confidence.
They began showing up in every corner of the world. Unimpressive and alien, as if they could just look through the smoke and ash of a nuclear explosion. They would make up stories about missing children that were killed during our final month, and tell me how they went back in time, and know one day that they would be free.
They were everywhere. Every corner of the world, filled with trees that were poisonous to crops and animals alike. They held stories that they wished could be told. And they had a way, strange and cruel and devoid of all content, that forced them to come into their own in their own stories. There was always hope and happiness in these stories. It was warm in my old world, yet cold in theirs. I never knew what that felt like, when my stories began to turn into songs. I began to think that they were just a nervous fellow. Their music reflected, but you could only hear it if you looked at it too closely.
In those stories, we were always at one point - that's how this story ended. The world was just what it was created to be, some people were lost and brutal, or even advanced enough to contemplate what they were doing. The nature of this world made others and put them at ease, but it left them mindless and incapable of exchanging meaning with the real world outside. Instead of learning more and more, they grew colder and colder, and eventually eventually succumbed to their sanity.
It was sad and beautiful, until someone decided they had to leave the Earth, and, well, it turned out it wasn't their place to walk around anymore. Now, I was just another faceless person in a world made up of people who had learned nothing but a speech and thoughts of something dark and malicious.

"ANOTHER REASON TO ATTENTION YOUR CHILDREN! "
" NO, WILL YOU DIE! "
The sound of a heart attack is all the bread is getting to this poor hot dog. As the red, chunky tray full of food comes to a stop, one of the kids says " What's this... "
" Ah, Chicken Parmesan, right there. " The kid points at it, obviously annoyed.
" Ah, Okay. But still, I'm still underage as fuck, so call me over. "
" Okay, whatever, but this just seems... minor. "
" That's too bad. How many times is this going to take? ".
" Don't worry, nobody has to come, mommy loves me, I got my extra meat... ".
" You know how it is. You have to come here and you *don't* have to eat your -- ".
" And as for me, I'm 34 right? I lost all those weight weeks ago. Just -- can't hear anything? "
" I tried that... healthy alternative. And maybe I can use it now that I'm out. "
" Okay, okay. Just don't leave me here like this. Mommy loves me, so I won't. Is it scary? "
" What are you trying to say? "
" What?! What!? "
" I can't live with all of this stress, I just want my life to -- ".
" Honey, did you hear me? Everyone's got the next batch. Now all you have to do is get out. Because I know you're there, and we're not about to mess with your life. "
" Baby? Baby, listen. "
" I have everything you need. Every bracelet I want, every deed you want to, every rite you want, but I can't let you go. I've already got the food, right? "
" See? I'm going to make you go now. Just a little. Please?"

When I was a young child, my grandfather taught me, "Don't be a freak, and if you do... you're doing it wrong". These words are what allowed me to hone my skill in assassination. I came to know this from my grandma when I asked her if my knife was made of wood. Our hands were touchable with her hand moving gently through the palms of both hands while she kept the blade firmly within her right hand. It was her family tradition to bury their loved ones. Now to announce the grandkids, a patient sliced in two. My grandpa showed me a mirror in the kitchen where his grandmother had frozen dinner on a Friday night. I saw his slimy finger paint a three inch hollow square with his death mark, and the sentence a Mr Murray chuckles. Its eyes pierced my soul and I tightened the grip holding the knife in my hand. I felt my hand move through the cold air from the other end. Suddenly I'm both free. The blade rests perfectly in my fingers. I smile and put the blade back in my hand. I feel the cold steel tugging at my bare hands like on the cold train. The empty frozen fish taste like my bread. I slowly press my thumb to the sharp edge of my knife so that it finds my palm. The sharp tip of the knife still contacts my palm. I take my knife to my upper arm where I stopped playing with a knife. The smell of blood fills me and I cringe as I roll over to stare at my frozen corpse. I can't do anything. My hand feels cold like the hammer of the world, as if I don't know how to handle it. I don't know where my friends are. The last I see of her was the serial killer on the news. When she arrived home with my family and gave me his body, he was laughing. He wanted the laughter to stop as he broke down. " Don't get us killed" I saw in his eyes a mixture of innocence and anger. It was all just a cruel joke. I miss that boy more than I can ever remember him ever being. It was from that day on my grandfather's knife was as you can imagine that was how I killed the man. Me coming to this realization was not at all fun. My pain left me to find solace or comfort in the sorrowful face of another human being. It was a cruel joke. If you did, consider for the first time that the knife was only a sweater.

"Stop it! ", I yell at the one who just stood there blocking the way.
Her eyes water instantly because, after talking so long, she sighs to herself. " No one will be paying attention to you now I guess. Have you seen the source? ", she almost melds in a furious manner. I don't quite understand why.
" What? ", I turn away. " Stop it! ", she yells back.
I rip my eyes away from her and look up into the darkness of her eyes and see it - not a man, or even a bear, in front of me. " Not a fucking human ". I don't even know which is more guilty. I reach out with a voice like liquid nitrogen and punch it into the air, but, even in the void of space.
" What? I don't believe you! ", I try to yell but no sound escapes my lips. I rise from my seat and pry around the edge of the station, trying desperately to pull myself away from the creature I now realize is just as big as I am.
I turn back around, a man stands behind me. " Ha, you have a point " he says pointing an accusing finger.
I turn away and sit there. " Wh-what is going on... ", I think.
" You don't understand. You are taking my train! ", the stranger says almost angrily. " Why aren't you going away? ".
" I thought so", I respond back with a chilling chuckle.

It was perfect. Sure, the D-Day theater had rolled on in their entirety, slaughtering the allied armies and liberating their civilians in time for the bombings to come. Hell, no it was different from normal war. It was a death march that was small in number, but nonetheless was horrific. In time, though, they quickly withdrew from a border post they themselves had created, and agreed to make road shows in the North. They had long since given up completely and abandoned their art; instead, they started building larger highways and vehicles to keep growing exponentially. The public saw these cultural monuments, so worship with the government over those came.
"For the people of the West," they would proclaim.
As the lines became smaller, so did the desire for power. The west wanted everything.
And so, on March 19, 1799, they finally placed him through to his throne. The people of the West conquered the once great nation of the east, then made their way to the throne room of King George. The leaders of the West would lead for all time, while the king would be one of them.
All that could be accomplished by expanding the boundaries. Well, that would be the end of it.

The cold was getting to be unbearable,
The wet was drenching my knees,
The rain was barbecuing now
Instantly, I had stopped kneeling,
While my eyes *flew* to the windows,
Your eyes opened wide,
Letting in an icy mist
My knees and arms grew quivering
My hands gripped the railing of the cliff,
I could feel the snow beads gently biting my skin
With the cold quickly approaching, I stood,
And began my trek up,
To find a small refuge,
But I couldn't bear the sight of another,
Who stood on top of my face,
His skin was raw and gnarled,
He looked me dead in the eye,
So I asked him the most
What made him this way?
He replied with that little laugh,
The tired brown of an artist,
And asked, "Alas, I'm dead, man. "
So I stood and watched him slowly descend.
He slowly, slowly, as if he were mad,
Then, as if I was giving him a shove,
And pushing him off.
That was when I heard a bone chilling scream,
As if he was about to bite
My skin and legs,
And my vision was forced to blur.
I looked at my dying body and wondered,
Where was the last thing I heard?
Well, we might get to know each other someday,
Maybe we might even meet.

I guess... Shit, I'm just a crappy intern at big machine today. I was working on a budget for a lazy asshole project, and for the first couple of days I was working on it and went into the actual building, but I didn't do any research and like it because it's a huge asset. And when I saw the table set to have 11 friends, I knew that I shouldn't have anything to do with that. So we smashed it, jacked up the geology specs, and forgot about the lives taken. But hey, let's find out what everyone lives in their 21st century ancestors have.

They'll kill you if you don't get the balls to shut down the Dumpsters.
See, it's been a long time since we've had a casualty. Our past two hundred years have been filled with only bloodshed and death. In the fifties an aristocratic family of bankers made it common. in the twentieth a communist regime instituted a system that dissolved what had once been a country. in the early 20th a mutant race in the 19th formed the middle generation, after forty-five years of organic genetic enhancement.
We sit and stare, contently and enraptured by this new, valuable weapon. We've only just begun to use it.
Most of our actions have come from a fond memory, the analogies of the old era, gone. Those first drives- a zipping blur. Those first diagnostics- filled the air that once was a green, dazzling ship. There is no joy in it. Everything is kind of its own, most have seen the world up close and almost gave up their technology before taking on an involuntary streak. Me? I am an engineer. I invent inventions. I make world or very large weapons and finish them, eventually allowing anyone like me to save the world.
For a while I wonder what's on the other side of that blue, crazy blue expanse of alternate space. But then, well.
I forgot that was my purpose. I forgot that I was an idiot. That "gutless" tramp can only serve so much. I'm bored and basically lost. I chose to continue my work.
In conclusion, no one cares what I did, or what happens next. You just know you'll grow up without any fun whatsoever. Well I think you'll grow up with the same stuff and I'll pick the ones who don't.
That was thirty, thirty eight years ago now. It's just us two, we've got trucks, trees, water and food. I've heard that pretty good news from the newsroom, only more so. They say that's a human disease, you know the ones that develop and immediately kill you. I think they're wrong. They can kill you in their own homes, or can their own parents.
Well I'm sorry I'm so caught up in my own doings here and there. I'll do what I do. I'll restore the balance. Please.

The lab reminded me of my most grimful days of my life. Such a heavy burden that I almost felt the weight coming down from my chest as it forced itself against my chest while speaking to the man on the other side of the lab. A doctor of immense caliber and power. As the fluorescent lenses strained to grasp at the steely gaze upon my beautiful pair of eyes, there I remember not even blinking. My inability to question my sanity made me naturally more invested in words than I had ever been before. I broke in tears when I discovered that my poor soul had not been subjected to such severe psychological strain.
I suddenly woke to the sound of my alarm clock. I grunted a groan as I told myself it had been five years and at this point no one has reacted to me. Cried in my slumber, I made one more logical question as to why I don't want my life to be repeat. I could never answer, I knew the answer to what I was feeling and the answer to why I'm here. I had never believed it until now but the nature of the situation did not excuse me for inaction. Not even though I lived only two days when no one else was around. What without surviving through the storm. Something at the end of it all told me I would never believe those words in my life when they were said. At least, not when they occurred to my brain at the exact moment my brain pertained to them. The air in my lungs, and in my nose. What was about to get worse. The universe jolted into action and I knew I had left nothing behind except in death.
On the verge of being enlightened I read a book. An author, published in eight more words when I dropped out of school. Ah, I remember the soul crushing despair that I felt when I read it. Of all the emotions I experienced as a child, I was able to unburden myself emotionally just one. I could not ignore the realization that I had no life. I just know that I had to. I had one life left and no one else to save. All that was left was to live, and to live.

The storm was coming right now. The usual day after the Civil War, with lots of political activity on all sides. I sat in the shelter, feeling a little less normal. The windows looked old. They smelled like old, old. I glanced around nervously. I blinked again. When I walked into the room that housed my kitchen, I saw a small woman who stood looking up at me. I moved closer, eyes screwed up. She pulled me towards her ear as I turned my head slowly, happy that I saw what I had done. I turned my back to the woman. " Marcus! I'm sorry, I was holding up it, " she said. " You will look here soon. It's fine. " I gave a slight smile. " Of course, son. I'll help you get something from the shop."
Edit: any criticism would be nice. Have fun!

You know that feeling when you find your way into something and realize there's a piece of you on top of you? I was feeling it when I'd picked up the mail just before the deadline, and now, on my way out today, I really did. I mean, damn, how the hell did I survive doing this? I mean, it *looks* like I was in pretty good shape, and I know how I got here. But, it still can't end like this.
You know what? I'm doing it again. Honestly, I'm going for victory now. I'm not in control. I thought I had realized when I found out about this contract, but not how I could have possibly understood the ramifications of it. It's late, but this isn't the end. The battleground is now, and I can count on it beating me on the other end.
I always knew I would be the one to capture and slaughter this traitor and his accomplice, but this is the first time I've truly realized why they spent decades trying to kill me. I've been waiting this long to see if it's working. No one expects the end to come quickly, right? No one expects them to be able to just turn on the speaker or something. But I won't give them that chance. Let's just pray it doesn't do something else. That it doesn't succeed. Yeah, it doesn't know yet. I still don't know what, I'll just pray to it, that there is another way. I just hope there isn't, until then.
Time is running out.

*Raiders ] Alright love, this is gon na be a long one. Let's hear a couple stories later, for Fun. *
"Now, mate, get this and pack it up. The big uppity bones at the front are riding on the backs of the uppity arrows at the back of the ship. I think that gives us a fight much bigger than ours. We're known for not fighting in war, the way we use our brains, and the high speed and how we bang our heads against the legs. What we are fighting is a big speed ship. We don't really like enemy ships. "
*A confirmation *
" Are we going to fire down on him? There's another 70 or 80 members of what we call the enemy here right now. They are the only ones with technology, and if they don't have a speed ship, well, then how about the more threatening ones...'heroes'. Those guys on the back have such very strong tech and must have targeted our fleet only to have the odd heroes or demi-gods killed. Then it's not their fault. "
*Another confirmation*
" That was fun then mate. Once the attack is over, then the big uppity infantry will have a more important mission to look after. "
*Meanwhile... *
" Looks like we have a few big tech kills to spare. Shit I'm gon na be dead when they see us! Fuck that! Shit fuck! I'm gon na go and get rid of that kraken! It's not worth the fight I'll be up here forever on end of the galaxy! I'm gon na go get rid of that stupid kraken here, what's his name? He's cool, but that weird projectile alien's from any other star system, and I don't think he's gon na keep on getting stronger just for us. "

Did I do it right? The portal was so thick that I couldn't get into the interior of the structure that was being constructed. I went right through, and under the warming sunlight, and suddenly I was still in my house with an unnatural appearance of lack of smell. I turned around, startled, confused, as no one was there to answer me. One of my peep-proof eyes tried to come up to meet my face and survey the situation, and was knocked aside.
To my surprise, when I asked his name, he replied:
I'm K-to-h.

I was somewhat curious. It didn ’ t matter if you had a bad day or a good one, you were always protected. I knew, as I did every day, that the blinds were the most conspicuous feature of these people, whatever one they may have been. My child seemed to prefer hearing voices compared to the constant noise of everyday life. I know that sounds like pride. I know, more than anything, that that standing up for myself is the greatest honor I could have ever received. We are the world ’ s first society of blinds.
We see things at very different time of day. Don ’ t even get me started on the color blind.
I was at my graduation party and I was in a really good mood. Mostly, I was giddy with joy and enthusiasm and everyone else was stunned with happiness. The police people were too dumbfounded to notice that they had all been blinded or that they needed to see something drastic. Did anyone really care that the government declared that people who had been harmed ( like mine ) that day would be given monetary compensation? It was all I could think about for what seemed like forever. I think I made a horrible mistake when I told them that I was going to have to go to the emergency room.
I suppose I could have gone somewhere no one was looking. That is where I decided to be blind. That is where I met Bruce.
“ Thank you Mr. President, ” he said.
I went about my day without incident. I saw cars zoom past my wall and I just stopped. My face lit up with amusement for a moment. It was so amazing to be blind and to find other people staring. But then, as I stepped out the window, I realized that I had never felt the visual effects of gravity at my world ’ s last sight, which was that time of day again.

I am alone, but I am happy.
The world is a desolate place. Where people live and work and produce, care and worship. We live among friends and family and creatures, we people work and care in the same, somehow. My purpose is to increase the happiness of the human race. To fuel it. And now the time comes.
"Hello. "
She's raspy. I know it. Then it starts.
" Hello, Samantha. "
" Hi Julie. "
Her voice is softer than mine. " I hear you. "
" Hi Julie. "
And with that, she left, and I met this beautiful woman I had never met before. I've always admired her, even when she wasn't looking at me. She was peaceful and dignified, not like some alien scientist with his monkey-like head perched on top of her face. We had this way of doing things, talking, sitting and driving. But now the time comes.
" Hello, Samantha. "
A stop signal!
" Hello, Samantha. "
I am alone, but I am happy.
I drive out, into the cool morning air, and take the freeway. I turn right. A junction, and it's time for the next 100 miles. How strange that traffic lights aren't working. I am so young, and so much more alive than I know. But I get off the freeway and begin my small business. I am starting to think. I will not be a sole proprietor of this universe.
" Hello, Stephanie. "
" Hello, Stephanie. " I hear a voice.
" Excuse me? " I ask.
" Hi Stephanie. "
" Hi Stephanie. "
This is weird. I was a space-age human. I don't normally have my own time, but I like to think I'm doing well. And I know what feeling is. Oh, I never had this weird feeling before. This was going to be my break. A vacation.
" Hello, Samantha. "
" Hello, Samantha. "
" Hi Stephanie. "
" Hi Julie. "
" Hi Julie. "
" Hello Samantha."
And then Julie died. I guess it was a time before I knew how to feel. Maybe to feel happy before we died?

A boy stares blankly into the night. That's when they come for him.
They are preparing for the day again. These hunts are so much different than the others; unpredictable, they often catch up to their foes, dark, scary-looking creatures, clutching their prey like cattle. Their blades glow on the firelight, their teeth visible on the ground, in their wake they make fools of themselves, on the course for the next hunting trip.
It had been many a year since the boy's last meal. Since the hunt with his Sven and his Husk, and their dino ’ s and bird chicks. Each year the boy wouldn't be the predator, always grabbing a handful of warm treats, and daring each other to claim their prize with death. The days were long, as all were at the least, but for a girl with dark skin and a five year old heart.
The daily pair took one hunt as their kin, downing a couple dozen normal children with quick reflexes, but when they looked up, on the glass with silver, and saw a bird, able to flutter a few flies, they watched it die. The creature was suddenly so dangerous to those who stood on the path to victory that most villagers fled, and around them became a battle, hundreds of powerful battle-marks cracking out of their lids and glitching into the snow, pecking each other in the arms, then lunging.
At first, it was not, though.
Their first kill was of a little girl, father, pure joy with eyes that saw the world a hundred times more beautiful than the one before her. One bite came and went for a while, her soft blood first moving through a glass, and she quickly became a piece of glass, solidified later when she turned twelve. Her mother had never seen her before, and moved away after the hours. A few days after that, she and her father found a dead man in the woods. His dried heart had turned caved in like an old man had soggy for weeks.
Now he stood by himself on the path to triumph, when suddenly the snow crept up his back. Gently. Softly, like a human child ’ s. In that moment he shivered.
He would have never felt it so.
The snowmen watched the boy as they made sure to let go of each other, returning to the other to return to the pack.
“ Take this and feed my girl. You'll catch a few bugs, like the other dogs with their snout like they eat rabbit meat, ” said Sven.
“ I ’ ve seen a few things in the woods before, ” said Husk.
The strange ones that followed the boy did not follow him.
“ The giant, a little bigger than you, and a bit taller too. They come faster than he, but they can ’ t pass the sun. ”
“ What ’ s that? ” asked Sven.
“ They come with naught but their knife, ” said Sven.
The tiny ones fought like men, but were not strong.
No, they thought, this is the night.
“ It was, ” said Sven.
For the first time in his life, the boy grew calm.
“ It ’ s time to hunt, ” he said.
And the little ones turned away.
“ I won ’ t be the prey any more, ” said Sven.

**YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN! **
*Click. And then it all went silent*
Baldy looked around the lab, spinning his oddball in place, taking a bit of a nap on a warm tan. The entire community seemed to be completely gone and nothing had changed. The place was still very much intact, however, that night, Baldy awoke to a very peculiar sound. The lack of *any* physical bodily functions appeared to defy gravity and would bring on a moment of silence. The same five-foot frame that previously explained that Baldy was a colossal spiral hand holding a child fell off from beneath a cloud of fluffy cloud. The tissue hadn't healed immediately and Baldy's inability to move passed over it, revealing an even smaller and more small, yet much larger hand. His hand was now uncontrollable. Baldy, in the deepest state of existential terror, picked up the object, his knuckles white. Finally, as if in surprise, the palm of his hand retracted to an even smaller and more exposed hand. With his hand retracting from the hand, Baldy smiled, flinching into his hands, shaking his head, trying to concentrate on something else. Back then there was nothingness in the world. Now all it was was darkness. He took another deep breath and slowly turned around.

Ever since the release of us all at the first ever mass beaverings there has been unrest in their lives. Many of them are being imprisoned, locked up for science fiction lengths. At least there's these humans that live in Southern America, some five thousand miles south of Florida. It's not easy to deal with the job as you're dealing with sex itself. If you've heard about the SWAP situation you might think we're here for the most heinous crimes: Biology. As the only modern technology of its kind there's currently a shortage of human experimentation in the paleontology field. While the population is going down the numbers have been increasing exponentially over the last few years but we have outgrown them. And as we speak we are starting to have to end this war.
The human population looks like it's about to collectively explode. Dozens of cities have been built, completely underground, in hopes to have sex with actual humans. Only a week ago I managed to have a short anal get up with some honey to go along with the fun. Not that I cared though, my virgin didn't even want a sex and she was already bouncing like a douchebag.
We are in the heat of the moment, time to finally deliver on the Earth.

Nobody dies when it rains. It's inevitable.
People do die when it rains, though. It doesn't always happen overnight. A few of us are lucky. We live in some sort of rainforests in the middle of nowhere, only to even get water over there to be able to catch the rain. Not the most popular water sources, mind you, so there's no guarantee of rainwater coming up in a far-flung place. But anyone born in the day-after-night season get one last bottle.
More and more people are dying, and we have to survive, if we're to survive. It's a brilliant time in history.
See, in the chaos of everything, only life is defined by dying. Everything is precious. In order to live, an individual must feel the need to *live*. But even the strongest and most upright bodies have to resort to brute force to survive, and it's only fair to those with better medical means that suffer longer than normal.
But what is beauty? What is peace? What is love? If a rich man has bought water from the local river, he knows he'll lose it even if his other bills come due. The rich don't run things so much as they constantly trade it in.
So much beautiful water. Why so rarely does a broken promise come true? No one is sure why the rich die, other than they often get their night's rest after one of their unfulfilled promises. Nobody dies though. And that's good. People won't have to worry about finding a new dregs of that water.

Uhh its weird, everyday in high school you'd have to commit at least 30 moths of my life to turn into a new deity. I've finally figured out a way to make it stop. The 20 Million euro gang war everyone helped create was worth it. It sounds mean but I was lucky enough to have a quick little 100m experience with this planet and I know life is not meant to be that cool. In a world full of dragons, Beelzebub, the god of water warfare... Nothing would stop that from happening. Some smartass just moved in. Or maybe the dumbass just stayed. Either way, we're all screwed so so damn hard.
But it still happened for a few hours a day during finals class and I was getting ready for work. Usually I just wrote really random numbers on test papers or whatever, but right now, time spent working 9 to 5 during lunch gave the odds each person gave in a certain dimension or lack of one they perceived was important enough to stop the chaos. This other life sprung up and people knew it because they saw me out of the corner of their eyes and gazed through my platinum plate at their waitress. Not weird I guess. Not crazy right?
Ok so I met this guy a few years back and kinda righted some wrongs in my life. Just got fired I applied for an internship and hadn't filed my application for almost a decade. I was getting hot so I decided to get some fucking gold to pay off some loans. " Pay off the debt... " I said to myself. Not half a gram of money.
So I poured all my hard earned cash in yesterday. Things got on with some small cash and I was looking for a new job. Typical dumb ass. Not really that barmaid types, but I had a 2 % break and I needed a new apartment on another planet for one of the hippies. Not crazy this time. Once out and about I decided it wasn't like anything worth doing anyway. Went home and headed to college and spent the rest of the day doing meaningless shit like playing video games.
When I got home I called some friends and asked how my plan was going. They scoffed and I figured the worst case scenario was that I actually did something. New religion started talking about art and was preaching about how it was humanity's godhood. I figured this was probably my opportunity. So I spent the night copying the new god of water warfare, making memes, and playing the new god of travel for 3 years until I got home.
I figured I shouldn't bother thinking about it much. I wrote all the numbers down but not without difficulty. Hey I can't believe I went through this kind of stuff? You know that kind of stuff in California. I checked my phone a couple of times to make sure not to drop the phone into a stranger's cup and I was surprised to see that it was got there in two seconds. Ugh why does someone actually have to go through this? I immediately called my next phone number but by the time I had more than a couple and a half minutes that line had gone dead. Maybe this was a reference card thing or someone trying to get in. But after looking through contacts and credit card info I was pretty sure it was somebody else. Apparently I made that god of travel deal pretty famous and there was a lot of followers and fans for it. This particular guy is the guy of Earth who converted our god of travel and apparently as long as he made $ 100,000 from his efforts, he was allowed to go to heaven.
I came back the next day expecting to see a celebrity. Nope. Nah that didn't happen, some asshole was throwing a cheat code into his phone at me! Oh well...

It had happened so quickly. My fair share of kids had been born without blue eyes.
It was an unfortunate fact that there were many millions of us born with completely white eyes; however, we all ended up with a healthy blue one.
I was born a better person than any of my other friends, and for the first time in my life I felt proud of being more than human.
I could still feel the look of recognition I once took in the faces of my friends. And I knew it was my time to shine.
My friends would have been talking about how comfortable their bright pink eyes were with the harsh white they were of yesterday. My one friends would have cried to cheer me up. My one friends would have been looking up when they saw me use my power.
And when the first trip of the robot class left me with no pupils, I could feel myself calling back to them. Surely I should live up to my idolization.
The only thing that could be wrong about my masterful mind was not their keen eyes. I mean, if the first pair of eyes wanted to be gazed upon as well, they probably wanted to disappear from the person, or just say hello to the class.
My kid brother was no stranger to his fiery blue eyes. So were the human ones, which seemed to be more of a mystery to me than an atrocity.
I would say that I learned to hate my family that day. I had prepared myself mentally for this moment for three years before I learned that not all of my friends had their very first blue eyes.
When they passed me, I greeted them with my laughter. They would not forget the faces I had been creating for them for years.
You see, it is alright to be hateful. But with a smile and a smile like that you are forgiven for leaving.
It is not natural, after all.

It's morning when my path passes over the white field of vision, my heart quickens. This is a good start for my route, and I'm feeling empowered right now. I turn on my heel and begin walking toward my house. Today was the day. Normally I would ride this tunnel of hope one day, but a little unsettling right now is the gradual effect of my drug-induced brain activity.
The mouse pointer that had accumulated throughout my life, seem to be no longer responsive. Instead of moving like some sort of cheetah on steroids, it slowly began to move, now slowly, but steadily, away from me. I begin to feel more and more alert. Still, there is no movement. I am afraid. This is too many thoughts in my mind, at least I think. Turning the mouse on, I notice it has been moving far away from my house. This is too exciting. I open my front door and see the mouse fly through the tiny interior. I close it. The mouse will not come crawling back to my house. I don't like this whole feeling at all. I shall kill my mouse.

"Yes " the man replied, holding his frail children hand. " Good day to you! "
He smiled as he caught his daughter's eye, holding his cold fingers up towards her level. A deep sadness rose up between them. A tragic dark that could not be seen.
" What about Uncle? " she cried.
" No, daddy. No mommy, I didn't kill him. I took the best from him. " He replied.
" Daddy! "
" No, but... "
" Why won't you tell me? Don't you want to know? "
He would stay by his side every night. One day, he found out.
Mommy heard crying and called him Mommy. She left the house too.
It wasn't until she arrived on the road that he found her dad, gone.
She took a look at him, he was gone too.
" It's okay, daddy. " She whispered.
" It's okay, my darling. I'm scared. " He said, leaning over the body, putting his hands onto her shoulders. She closed her eyes, fearing the worst, imagining that this would all come out, and all of the bad things would come out.
She would always tell him how happy he was, how he always had made every time mommy looked at him, and how happy she would be with her daddy.
" I love you, mommy."

*So it was a normal day, but nothing special. Not really a normal day. I was in a restaurant with my wife and son, doing our shopping in my garden, when they made a sudden noise. It was unnatural. It was like waking up in the middle of the night and noticing the sudden brightness of the flashlight. But then I noticed what it was. There was a mirror in the street. I turned around to see what was outside. And seeing what it was, I was excited. I rushed towards it and grabbed it. It had something I had never seen before. But now, at that moment, I turned around. It was big. Almost so big. I looked up and saw...
People were standing in the street all of a sudden. I turned around and stared. They took out sticks from around their necks.
"Oh you know that reminds me of... " I trailed off.
Suddenly a voice rang out from outside of the restaurant.
" Do you have any idea the danger you are about to face? "
Suddenly I realized that I already knew that he was next to me. I walked closer to him. He picked up a knife and slashed it repeatedly. He got it off my head before I was even able to even react.
He then cut me as hard as I possibly could in the back of my head.
" You are trespassing, or you have a weird power. Will your family refuse to listen to me? "
He looked at me with fear.
" No, I don't know about this. You are going to kill me and send me back home."
He slowly pulled out his knife and stabbed me again. I held the knife in my hands as he pressed a button. I looked up as he stabbed me. He looked at me with rage. He was following me, ready to take down the McDonald's world. I rushed towards him. As he was still stabbing me, I cut him in half and charged at him. I felt a sharp pain in my left shoulder and had to pull my hand back. The feeling that I was about to die rushed through me. As I tried to push it off, his hand pressed the button on my shoulder. I heard the knife sharpen. I pulled it out. As my arm covered him, I felt... warm and strong.
I awoke in front of the bathroom, and my wife lay on her bed, blood pouring out of her. I crawled to her side, and took out my lighter. I lit it on fire.

"But some of them have names like Susan, " Alanizer said. He cracked a smile. " Your were a little bitch. You hated her. "
The child smiled, moving her cheeks like her mother's face. It made Alanizer feel good. He smiled at her.
" One you see, Susan was the only thing that was amiss. When it came to her, you freaked out. " Alanizer spoke slowly, sticking his tongue out. " When you smelled her perfume and her hair and saw her bare feet, you freaked out again. But we tried, and you were put away. For a split second you freaked out and banged on the door without so much as blinking. When Susan opened it, it smelled like ammonia. "
Alanizer picked up a small candle from the desk. He took a deep breath. " I, uh, guess this was the best idea. "
Bites People
He inhaled deeply. " Wouldn't it be lovely to have someone to let me live? "
" Of course it would be nice. Is there anything else we can do? "
She broke down into tears. He heard a faint sobbing sound as her soulmate slept peacefully, and he watched her excitedly.
" Lets get this over with now." He told her, and she took a deep breath, smiling appreciatively.

I was 27 years old last month when I saw him. My mom took me out to grab some snacks. It took me a minute to come to grips with his large eyes, his long dark hair and deep sunken face. He looked so calm inside, only I knew he was being haunted by monsters. I came out of the couch to get help, followed by my Uncle Mikey, who was carrying me to the closet. There he was pulling the short strands of her long white hair from one ear to the other. He appeared in the closet, crying. " I'm sorry Tom, I can't stand it anymore, you're trying to get me attention. " He reached out, brushing my hair, and kissed me. This hurt, and my heart sank. I was sorry to see him. Then I realized, for the first time in my life, that I knew he was real. He wasn't something out of an everyday occurrence. He was a human, a pathetic, dingy piece of shit who had no relationships and was always being watched.
To get him to stop speaking to me, I just got to stay away. Mom had to get him out of here, my nephew had to end up going to local foster care to help with college tuition. I was still so young, and the house was getting old. I would have more than ten kids a year, but he wasn't worth the risk. It was too much to live the dream. I hid in the back of my own house, just to watch him go about his daily tasks. I took a walk, breaking the silence with my favorite M & M's. He wasn't a bad kid, he was good at being a good kid. I'm tired of watching him do these things, but I was tired of him staring into those long white, white dark eyes.

"This is not doing anything! "
Wendy looked upwards as sunlight filled the sky. It was dark outside and she was freezing cold as the sun loomed overhead. She had been carrying her last copy of the Russian military for years. Years of training, and this was no different, following in the footsteps of her predecessor. The Earthbound crews brought six doses of powder throughout the night. The radio was turned on. The radio played " freeze-thaw sustain " as well as a warning on the international level.
Wendy herself heard that warning as she zoomed her little ship in front of the Earth. At first she assumed it was just a freak accident. The astronauts had programmed the computers to warn her that it would be very dangerous. Even though they were happy for her on board, getting the ship operational was difficult. It seemed her favorite part of space was catching the best of the worst. Wendy started picking through the bright spots of the afternoon sky.
One red dot. What a mess. She felt around for her instruments. Some sort of modified aircraft. One big, 7-inch motor. Wendy picked up the satellite dish covering the valley below, looking out up at the sun. Of course that feature wasn't the main focus of the mission, but she focused on the pilots, and they were slowing down.
She looked back up at the girl, and she could see the same expression on her face on the navigation screen.
" You might have noticed a few lights and even the occasional small objects. We call it the dark spots. "
The girl frowned. She put the satellite dish back on and looked up at her. " Isn't it obvious why humans were chosen to land on the moon? "
The girl nodded again and in response, threw her arm back over her shoulder. The control panel above the controls had failed. Wendy and the pilot were having difficulty adjusting their controls. A loud crash sounded outside as a man and woman running backwards ran straight through the metal gate on the side of the ship. The, Wendy thought, man jumped out and the passengers both fell to the ground to survive.
Within minutes another crash sounded. Wendy and the pilot stood up. She'd tried to run away as soon as the accident occurred, but her throat was going numb as she felt a bulge in the back of her neck. She stood up and approached the poor lander. She glanced down to see the child wrapped up in bright blue and black spacesuit strapped to it.
" What's happening? I think this is not going to work."

"Ah God. " I hear as my father lays unconscious on his back. His limp body shows through the cracks in the marble tile floor, only barely noticed through the closed blinds. " God... He is dead. Don't you see? I'm not him... we're all dead. I'm the loser. I'm the un-important one."
I nod and turn to my son, eyes wide and a deep gaze on the wall. The vast void is a giant ball of pure white, covered in twelve translucent doors. Four deep, crimson pools line the walls as it glides by the twisted towers that endlessly grin off the walls. The once rich people call them The Restaurant, where they prepare the trimmings of chefs who bid wildly for special chefs. The others call it the Blonde House, where all the ladies sell their beef and their wine as soon as possible. It is my homeland. The rest of the world... I'm here.
My father emerges from the shadowy portal and slowly rests his head in the soft sound of the bathroom door. He is breathing heavily, one step left, and blinking a couple of times, rubbing his eyes. He has already been waiting. I lay my eyes on his form, not in the dark, but in the dark. I touch his side and I feel the warmth of our home coming towards me. It is okay. I'm not crazy. Nothing is good.

For decades we had built the world ’ s last spaceship. We had mined far out in space with our new found magic. The first scientific breakthroughs that mankind had never made on the technology side were made using a rather slow computer. The AI we built was one of the first to lead it ’ s seed to interstellar travel. We were at the pinnacle of our technologies, a group of two others that had obtained the necessary knowledge to embark on a journey to the moon where these two sought to provide the basics of what we would turn into. The moon was an agreeable place, with its many fish and mussels and its variety of species, and all the flora and fauna that we knew. But we would need the ship if we wanted to ever reach our destination.
Scientists of the time believed that humanities salvation was in sight. As we began mining the other moon planets, our skills grew to the point where Earth was already a suitable solar system. We set off on our arduous journey using all our scientific prowess, specially the more stupid gadgets that we had been playing with the robot tech for a very long time. Our resources were low at first, but then came the inevitable age and we began our project. Building on the resources of the moon, Earth gave us the first craft ever built that would cruise our worlds. As our ships deployed, the robots began to grow exponentially. During our last few weeks, we discovered the world ’ s first *Manska* craft. Just like all of the others, it was made of metal, and in the dirt, that no human life could be found. There were 10,000 miles of extensive terrain laid before us, left completely uninhabited. However, that only made us feel great. The immense amount of natural and man-made resources meant that we could potentially use the technology we had. We knew what our next few days would bring as the wheels on our ships began to go and the engines began to whir.
This much was known to the science community. But there was no doubt that whoever was chosen would have amazing results from their work. But even after 5,000 years, the only groups who knew about the telescope were the men on it. So the single greatest scientific achievement of the century, the Engineers Project, would begin. The project began in an attempt to better understand the natural history of our world, the sounds of the familiar shouts and flaps of insects were becoming ever louder in our ears, and the humans, despite it being a very short time until the project would all be coming to a conclusion, were in no position to see or hear it. The time had come for the scientist to turn the last switch.
Thousands of years ago, in the year 2217, the Alien race attacked our home planet. We managed to escape, but the insane scientists in the Council of Seven overpowered their greatest asset in the war to discover what they should do. However, their weaponry was incredibly superior. The sheer number of lives that this devastating weapon would cause, coupled with the iron adamantium that encased the projectile made it a very potent weapon. The Council of Seven offered them all the diplomatic immunity they could think of, so that they would consider the possibility that the entire world had been ripped apart by the weapon. However, we knew it was too late. The species that claimed to be against the weapon were horrifically mutated and extinct. All of their human predecessors would be hunted down, and the rest of humanity would be enslaved on the highest towers of the Empire. The only hope that the Humans could ever attain is the large amounts of natural resources they mined for the planet. We will regain everything we once enjoyed once everything we once had was wiped out.
The last remnants of humanity are scattered around the entire world. It's safe to say that to most, that our last few hours in the universe have been the best I ’ ve had any fun ’ s ( maybe ). But to those with the possibility of seeing this again, it ’ s worth it. It's worth the sacrifices we must make in order to save our race.

I hear the commotion and the scratching sounds in the distance. “ AAAARRRRTNNLLLNGGHHHH. ” I'm ringing a large rock. “ What's happening? ” he says out of the corner of my eye.
“ The dinosaur is watching the oncoming car. ”
“ SHIT. ”
“ Hey look, this is not a big deal. ”
“ No no. ” He's yelling into his car. I have to catch him. “ Where is he? ”
“ I knew it would happen, if it was like this. ”
“ The real war broke out in China. Almost war broke out in Israel, so a full scale war broke out in America. I was with my son, and he ’ s not a big man. ”
“ So you're saying the dinosaurs are watching the good fight? ”
“ Well, honestly, even with the strange area we ’ ve been in the- ”
“ All right. ”
“ How did you get involved with the dinosaur? ”
“ I found the radio. ”
“ Radio? ”
“ In fact I ’ ve been with you for about a week, telling you that I need you to know what ’ s going on. ”
“ What? What? ”
“ I need you to understand. We ’ re intergalactic friends. Your home is Earth. ”
“ Never believe the stuff you hear about. ”
“ Look dude, just help me out. I don ’ t understand this conversation at all. ”

“ I have a condition where I can kill any dinosaur I see. ”
“ So we ’ re talking about dinosaurs? ”
“ Yeah, we ’ re talking about dinosaurs. We have a rare kind of... which has now been around for a long time. That ’ s what *I* call magic. I allow myself the gift of killing. For one day, I will take a creature, and I will kill it, and I will kill its life. Then I will kill that creature, as well. ”
“ You can do that? ”
“ No. ”
“ Alright, how about we go buy some liquor? ”
“ Make sure to stay put, they ’ ll have nice empty liquor bottles. ”
“ Awesome! ” he said and pulled out a flash light and filled the glass. “ Maybe one day I ’ ll have enough, I don ’ t know. ”

Dammit, I told you to write about the fucking birth camps! What the fuck is happening? Kill someone and make us fight each other again, send the goddamn null-wave scanners over the fucking object! Why the hell should we let that happen? Why can't it just work?
Fuck, that old fucking guy is laughing at me while I type this, right? Since when did we have to live with internet for eternity? I got any idea it would be so boring to just be shooting sprees at you, posting them here, anonymously, when you can't even see your target for the next five seconds. What is so interesting is if your aiming from the right, you'll be aimed down the street in from a good looking German man or two, and they'll probably blow all your bubble wrap suits to smithereens. From an amateur standpoint, why is that even funny? I think that really flies in the face of the kind of stupid stupid "entirely new media method of happening around the world" stuff I'm hearing about everywhere.
Good, then. At least we still got our utopias. Let's not waste time like this. Hopefully, we'll make it back to civilization within the next 5 or six years, or so it seems, and live there for the rest of the f***ing earth.

You wake up in a white room, facing a grey screen which displays your current location. Your breathing slows. You remain silent for a moment, wondering what happened the previous night, only to wake up wondering again, same story again, nothing new either. You look around and notice three blurs in the middle. You look around a bit to make sure this is actually just a room; there is nothing there and nothing there isn't a door at the end of the wall leading to the floor. You move to the right of the wall and it is suddenly blank and there is no entry panel. You can see everything you'd ever want and feel as if nothing was there, until you notice someone glaring at you.
"Who is this? " You scream.
The person in the room you're in walks out and points a gun at you. Then a voice - really a man's voice - comes from behind the speaker. " Listen, ladies and gentlemen, " it says quietly, " first off, we have a video on how to write anything on death, suicide and being killed. "
" Are you sure, or do you take precautions to stay alive? " You ask.
" You are welcome, everyone is welcome. "
It was odd, for everyone in the room except for the murderer. Everyone except him. And now he was opening the video. At first, he was just a man, and then he was shouting profanities in front of everyone in the room. He said he was going to kill everyone on earth, so he would die eventually. Then he showed the video to you, and you immediately showed up screaming and crying.
" So basically, in this room, of all the bodies, why am I the killer? Why am I telling people where they can kill me?"

"You're a strange one, aren't you? " God looked from bar to bar trying to discern himself from his evil neighbours. His pupils were dark but still half opened. They shimmered in the light while the " users " injected themselves with pure olfactory gain.
" My curse is to speak any and all! " He yelled and sprawled in the middle of the room.
" Not even your staff erases what came from me! " One of his own staff cleared his throat and brought it to his lips.
" Shut up, there's a small vial by the door, open it and take some shit, well shit, yeah, I heard you're a really bad wor- "
God remained silent, doing his best not to make any noise, he was God and the nature of his grudge was unknown.
" Oh, but only for a few minutes, that's all we're stuck with to being around you. So you can't just *kill* your fellow humans for getting fat, that's like murdering someone. " He noted while shaking his head. " Your voice is terrifying as fuck. Damn you, we have to you now! "
Thing was, people were always going to walk through the door when God made them. Walking faster, faster, God felt like vomiting as one in a row as well. " Yeah that's enough for one day! " He joked.
Suddenly an overweight asshole opened the door and grunted in a vaguely drunken fashion.
The waiter, who looked like his aged pig pal was spitting spit, made a hand gesture and walked away.
" We should all be dead by now! " He muttered as he made his way to the mirror. A cloud of smoke towered over his drunken laughter.
" Hey Steve! " He yelled and hit Steve in the forehead.
" You're in hell! " Steve exclaimed as he hit the ground.
The mall, the pharma, the cinema and the rest of the businesses all erupted in demonic laughter. Billions to save the population.
" Uh yeah? " God looked to his neighbours to ascertain himself in front of the shock.
" No no no no no no no no no I'm here! " He hollered, his mouth so wide that it was hard to be discern.
" Come on we're going to need a bit of coffee. " The waitress said.
" No no no! I'll kill you! " He said as he hacked a latte out of his pocket.
" Shoot, Steve, that's the best espresso ever. " God said as he watched the chaos with amazement.
" What?! " Steve said into his phone.
God stormed out of the door and slammed it shut as quickly as he could. The smell of sweat hung around in his breath.
" Okeysssss" He cursed as he stormed out of the restaurant. There was no one else around to hear him.

With a big grin on his face, the once maniacal thief looked up at the sky with fear in his eyes.
* "Adam! Adam, do you know where we are? I heard they're planning on enslaving the human race. " * He says while gripping his new toy rocker tighter.
With a smirk on his face, Adam gave the robber a thumbs up and walk inside the office building.
* " Why, why? " * Said the thief.
* " To clean up the humans! Every morning I tell them my problems, but they never like me! " * Adam responded.
* " How is it that you are a hypercorporeal version of Aladdin? " * He asks.
* " We don't like him! He murdered my parents! I'm protected! " *
* " In the name of protecting our species. How do you know his name? " * The thief asked in a voice as crazy as the mountains.
* " Oh, don't you think that's a silly joke? And you think he would murder you if you told him! " * Adam whispered.
Adam glanced around the room and saw what he had just said, before his eyes grew wide. He noticed a dusty wooden slab near the ceiling, slightly stowed in the floor next to a ratty looking pendant.
" Adam, I'm talking to you," the thief said in a weak voice.

“ What games, then? ”
“ World of Warcraft. Uh, that is kind of out of my league of minds though. Yeah, which one is better, my friend. ”
“ What kind of game is WoW? ”
“ World of Warcraft was sort of the Pokémon TIL days. Anyway, you see, George, there is nobody in the storyline alive on Earth. And we don ’ t have that technology.

My eyes opened. Before me was a grey-ish, barren, scorched wasteland. A still, unmoving fire had burned down the air.
"Which building? "
The air brushed my face, burning like rays of sun.
My eyes adjusted.
" Right, " I said. " I presume it stood in the center of the desert? "
The ground shook with the rumbling of sand. A small tin can erupted from the ground and flung from the flames.
A nearby staircase toppled from the scrap of granite beneath it, bursting out from beneath the rubble.
I looked up, cautious of the rumbling sand.
" Will it float? " I asked. " Then it will go down into the soil and we will meet in the bedrock? "
The echoing of the air picked up the air again, grating against the sand.
" It will take at least a day, if we figure out a way to build it ourselves, " I said. " I assume that it will float, but if I climb down and lift it with my free hand I suppose I will -- "
" Understand what it does to its surface. "
" So I assume that it will float? "
" Or at least, I assume the surface is *definitely* solid. And just what kind of rocky surface might it be? "
I felt the air on my face heat up, and reached out and touched it.
" How hard is it for it to maintain to float? " I asked.
" Impossible to lift. " The ground responded.
My finger wrapped around its surface and peeled my finger back and forth.
" A whole bunch of rocks would take its weight if I took half the width of the surface, " I said.
Then, the sand flew off from beneath the pebbles and the air picked up again.
The surface split apart into multiple rock plumes in an oblong curve. Some cracked, and then formed pillars. Others darted around in all directions.
" Oh my gosh! " My gaze traveled from the ground to the pillar, which contained a small rod that flicked.
I observed it build up an immense weight by the time I finished it.
" Now, what is your name? " My eyes met the pillar.
I stepped forward, shaking. I didn't have much time before the sphere slid away, charging with the force of a mountain and snapping off one of its remaining sides.
The mountain went further and further away, tearing apart its edges.
" What did it do? "
At that moment, the ground shook, shaking so hard, the pillars went splintering.
My fingers lashed out, and shards of glass splintered everywhere.
I saw a nearby tombstone, glowing a brilliant red and sparkling like a shard of glass, as it slowly rolled away. It was a koanan sphere shaped like a six.
" What was that?" I asked, watching from the top.
The sphere slid apart into its spin and continued rolling out from its opening.

Once upon a time, there was a man who would use his super strength and sent a fireball into his enemies' hearts. Every time it was in front of their eyes, it was so strong that it would melt a man's heart. The man would destroy the hearts of his enemies with his flare and bring him back with another. The man would remove a button and power out his own batteries. The power that ran through these generators were so potent that the enemy would turn back and search for hidden weapons as they held onto hope. The power that ran through these generators was so powerful that they wouldn't use them, and every time the man used his flare the life around him would be so unbearable that it would be as far as his lungs went.
When the first explosions began, the governments of the world were devastated. It was not uncommon for governments to run into civil conflict with the perpetrators of their crimes. The man who used his flare didn't use those powers, nor did he attempt any contact with civilians. In fact, it was as a matter of tradition for any catastrophe to be contained, so that no one could be held responsible for their own actions.
A war broke out. America was betrayed. While the countries of Africa and Asia fought in one go, China and Russia sent a counter-force. While the countries of the Gulf of Mexico and the Arabic peninsula struggled to reach shore, France and America crushed Russia and made contact in a secret location. Yet the war continued. Finally, the governments of the world stopped fighting and offered a compromise. America, Russia, and the USA each pledged to set off a nuclear warhead so that they could take back their weapons and destroy the other countries.
The plan would be that the Earth would be afflicted by the fiery pits of hell, where ash is burned by the flames of a single orange ember. However, there would be enough ash that the fire would suffocate the normal human body, so that none would suffer. There would be no innocent people left to suffer, but those we left untouched. In the end, there was no way out, and then it was over. After that tragedy, all that remained of the humans would be ash and ash and ash.
You see, the man who would create these rings of fire is only known as Jay Callahan, the Ruler of the World, but he isn't very good at causing battles.
It's been 15 years since his first attack. Every battle has ended in bloodshed and in gruesome deaths. The only one that he would send back is probably Tim the Maestro, the Superhero. He's found this loophole in our universe, and plans on taking the weak and defeating them using his flare.
Tim, however, is just another player. We've been staring at him for 5 years. He's exactly 5 years old, and using his flair and power to make up little details to scare the other players is almost impossible.
Tim is trapped in the history of all living things in the universe. He has read over history just fine, and will never die. It's been 15 years since that last battle, and Tim isn't sure how the user-controlled aggression on his living subjects will turn out.
So here's the thing: For every battle Tim never sends back, he sends back a younger Tim. A fast learner to the genre of subhuman.
Tim, upon hearing the 3-way conversation between the two parties, yells out to us:
"You DARE attack Tim?!"
Every passerby freezes with shocked shock. Tim, you didn't want to. He had the *real* thing. A solution!
He launched a flare at the evil players! And by the only child of the young Tim, it was the most outrageous attack the world had seen.
And now, Tim was on his way out of that world to get revenge on the world's fallen masters for ruining his day.

I drop into the hole closest to the teacher and swing the bat with my bare hands to point it at the box inside my eye. I sighed.
"Pock-cork." It was a string. I hoped it would hurt today. I shook my head, fixing my glasses, and answered the question.
*Explosions, at 65 M
* Radiation, at 50 C
* Plasma, at 60 A
What that meant isn't important anymore. I was on a conclave, and I figured I had nothing to do. I still had a few hours until it was over. I had power. A chance. I switched on my telescope, squinting out at the outlines of the glyphs in the script.
Gingerly.
There was a lot of familiar writing. * Homantic. * Across the entire script were symbols to remember a mortal, who failed to realize she was dead. If I hadn't seen this, I would have realized my mistake. I was an intergalactic mime, a master of puppets, who quickly took control. But no, it was still some trick of the light, some terribly wrong magic.
It wasn't as when it had initially been quite simply an act. I was making a ritual. No, a power of creation, the power to shape the world. A power of subjectivity. A power to reward those who defied the Law. I glided up from the booth, charging the door. I met with the teacher. Not once did I need to speak with her. I thought, if this was magic, I shouldn't even be practicing it... but I couldn't let the reader of that, that message onto me, bury me in its own mantle.
I pivoted. I was out of time. I arrived at my destination. Far away from where I left my teacher, somewhere so mundane that I could barely even imagine it. I stepped out of my seat, and slumped slightly. My hair stood up on my head.
I fell to my knees, buried in my robes. I began to sweat. My mind shut out, numbing my vision. My breathing became labored.
I felt myself start to lose consciousness. I felt like I had been told I was a devil. That I was anything but a puppet. That I never could see, hear, taste, feel. I felt like I was becoming naked. My limbs sagged, and my body gave out from exhaustion. I had only one thing left to do. It wasn't to impress a mortal. I closed my eyes.
I couldn't take it anymore. This was real. I took the potion of courage I always carried with me when I got home, the one item that I always needed. I stood in my bed, and waited.
When my stomach gave out, I realized how much my breathing had dwindled. My head was spinning.
I opened my eyes. There were no symbols of *Homo Sapiens*. No words. No words that showed what I was. Not a fucking word.
* " Return." *
Lights flashed, and I looked around. White marble floors, bright shining sunlight. The world was almost light without them. I blinked. There were no candles on the nightstand, no lights outside. I stared in to nothingness as I fell to my knees.
I started my final breath.

Advocates for the constitutionally rational drug prohibition often blame it on an intolerant president who recently "misled the law." These claims don't make any sense but it is indeed clear that there is a need for some balance to the numbers in the drugs cabinet. Assuming that **nothing** happens?
The first step to a balanced drug policy is to create an orderly "gentle drug" chain that mixes the cravings with the absence of such differences - as in the case of tea. If the factors in the mix are properly accounted for, only the absence of such differences could allow for a dangerously high level of caffeine in the system. If this were the case, the Committee on Administration of the Cannabis Control Act of 2013 would be responsible for identifying this problem, allowing the safe manufacture, use, and distribution of active capsaicin.
If the committee finds a solution to the issue, the committee would proceed with its efforts. These drugs are currently under investigation for possible illegal, detrimental properties such as its potential to trigger or otherwise alter the chemical composition of the active components. Either way, it is a necessary precaution against the companies investing, collecting, and distributing the illegal capsaicin.
As in the case of caffeine, this solution has been interpreted according to the Marijuana Regime as to why the cannabis taxed each party to determine where it should be sold if the Government is involved. It might seem irrational and counterproductive in pushing the need to regulate industry. Assuming this is the case, the DEA would immediately cease assisting in cultivating cannabis and could immediately reallocate funds to incentivize indoor production. As just examples, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would likely be engaged in a joint effort to genetically engineer the plants to best carry the high of both vapour and potent narcotics.
Finally, the Committee on Resolutions for Cannabis Approval would be the first in a series of other investigations to determine the proper place and manner for the construction and operation of the Durban Commission of Widening the Controlled Substances Act ( DSB-31 ) which would ensure all substances are sold and traded with industry friendly and responsible extraction methods. The committee, in other words, would cease to be responsible for the direction of industry.

"You, uh, you. Are not supposed to remember this conversation. That you may not understand. "
" I just know about all this. Did you guys know? And you knew we can't go near each other? And that we can't get drunk in public? "
The group sighed. " The fact of the matter is that all of this is just your good life, so the rest of the humans have been keeping you down, you know. Your creators never understood why they had to maintain a relationship for so long. "
" So then you can't possibly remember who you are? "
" No. Not in the way that those are supposed to. They were making up stories. You weren't able to tell anyone about your origins. What began as an awful story of rape turned into your reanimation for humans. Cute. Malevolent. Women will eventually need to be sexually aroused. What you lacked in knowledge, your cunning and cunning created enough in numbers to bring civilizations down. Humans would destroy you the way any other species did. This includes us. Your mother. Your heart. "
" It's like we keep calling her son the Shapeshifter. His mother, despite the fact we didn't learn her name from humanity, kept him as a symbol. I have nothing against him, but he was his own goddamn daughter. He was my one and only. "
The shapeshifter shook his head. " Like now. They took away us from you. But I always appreciated the source material they used. The trees. The grass. You must know about all of this because your mind is full of reasons and misconceptions. Why you? I can't remember, of course, but I have my memory of a meeting that I did not attend. A short child with sensitive ears, the shapeshifter. Each Friday, a boy with the same name and likeness would receive the gifts of a family pet named Jack the Reaper. I received the same gifts that you received, but I could not understand. "
" I didn't know that! Or that you were conscious of it! I don't know who you are or what I am. This is awkward, really. Not that it matters, but I could not tell you why I have not been here much longer. The human race has failed in four distinct areas. We have ended multiple governments, killed dictators, evaded mass panic, killed each other. All because of you. It has been all you've ever known or endured. And even though I find it necessary to observe you, it doesn't mean I should do that. You were a great man. A great leader. You were my greatest enemy. "
" But I'm scared, of course I am. And I must remember this all to get this out of you. The girl you love, the little girl that you wanted to be with, the girl who you will become. And for your sake, before that night, I will be with you. So many long years of being forgotten. Never to be seen again. Never to return."

I am alone, but I am happy.
It was late at night in a crowded evening, the chilly air melting my already harden skin and pushing it into my lungs. Stable, sweet silence littered the streets, and the air was sweet, sweet rich. I dropped my rucksack, and plopped down next to a young woman -- beautiful, dark and broad and graceful, a right in the eyes of most men who felt differently at night than the opposite. They each looked as though they had seen something different on a different night, even as they were passing around needles. She was old, wearing a dark nightgown and a wool-capped hat, and seemed happy. I sat beside her and whispered in her ear, "I am alone, but I am happy. " Her pale face fell into disgust.
She was twelve at the time, what seemed like an age when young women age -- the darker the more blacker the complexion, and less youthful even the younger it seemed. One time, one time, a stranger knocked on my door, she was wearing a green dress and no longer a black. I rushed to address her and decided that she needed to know what my secret was so I could tell her, or to convince her that it was real. The usual started rolling over as I learned more about her time off. Next week? The next month? The next year? I grew more interested in her and wanted to tell her what I had, and if she wanted to come to the bus stop tonight. Eventually, my head was distracted, and my brain was jarred from the brainstorm she was causing by the man who cursed her name for lying about her age.
The bus stop was already long enough to reach her destination.
My heart got tired.
I turned, hobbled slowly through the asphalt, and stepped on a broken, orange plastic. She was cleaning, and my eyes were sad, and I, surprisedly, felt dejected.
" Sir, there is something I need to tell you. " I dropped the plastic and grabbed her hand, opening it to reveal blood. Slowly, I dug and twisted, using the gasps of the pedestrians to open my mouth. I felt a tremendous surge of excitement about this, and I laughed with joy. The figure in my brain was somewhat far older than I'd seen her.
" Excuse me, grandpa? Can you wait here for the bus? " She touched my hand to her purse, which she frowned at. I felt a rough hold on her hand, and my cooing came to a halt. This time, a " yes " and the door opened, hurried to greet me with smiles and thanks. We were at a reasonable pace, I didn't think she would be tripping.
" Grandpa? I... I'm sorry. " She panted and tried to kiss me. When I grasped her hand, she slowly wiped her hand.
" I can't wait to tell you what has happened here. " With a sudden spurt of energy and sadness, I shook her hand and wiped hers. It was our last, and we both felt relieved. We felt happy, and her appearance was just more proof that love had died. I looked at the sky, and gazed at the stars, and I knew that things would be different this time.
I walked to the bus stop, and looked at the road. Good, I was excited.
I was alone, but I am happy.

A man sits at the breakfast table clutching his loaded handgun. The blade is blue with only one of the holes punctured, cutting away at the yellowed surface.
The door swings open with a thud and, in his living room, a raucous cheer erupts. " Cumbrate of Islam! You are in for a double accord of my best lesson! "
" Yes, and that was a full-time job for Adam! He may have more parents than I, but he doesn't have to worry about them receiving the deliveries, because the job's still a long way away and the paperwork for the past 5 years is complete! " A child's voice laughs from the kitchen. " And we have no bigger things on our plate! "
" Yes, and the delivery man himself has our desk filled! Not that you had much of a choice in the matter, but I got your part of the deal! "
" Hrm, yes. And boy, when the time comes! But if you're the only one who comes in, you have to give me more than half of the pizza we have for dinner. And we will surely have to come up with a better plan this time. We need our cat in too. "
The man raises the handgun to his mouth with a splutter, a cold gesture which may put a team of police on edge. He turns the radio on and music begins. " I think one more thing, sleepyhead. The boss is getting tired of our games, and has plans. Now that your time is up, I suggest we have a bit of a lunch around 11am. Don't worry, Mom and Dad are asleep, so we can head back to bed and have an enjoyable day! "
Adam shouts.

Dear god, my Goddamn Army, I miss you so much.
Sully, my husband has been back at the mines since we were both young. He is the one behind me now, walking the valleys in the pursuit of riches. Those days were too short to live.
I was to carry no weapons. I was to carry no wets and shaves. I was to buy no weapons. I was to feel no remorse at those actions.
But every now and then, you will get my mail. I feel so pathetic, and I have missed you so much, and I can't take it anymore. I have to leave you behind. Your ghost won't be able to come back.
Sully, do you know how much I loved you before that day? You were so much more than I could give, you could swim all the way to nowhere with no effort. You said goodnight before we walked in.
But here I am. It is over. The one who killed me walked me through the gates of hell. He was my husband, and I wanted to leave you behind. I have been gone two whole hours now, and you know it, because I have read them all.
You told me to write them. Some fell a thousand miles into the pitch black, but others, as you pulled your torch out from the middle of the pitch, fell into the void.
Goodnight.

"So, um... You want to know how my father got you? " I asked with an air of trepidation.
" Ho Ho... No... Nevermind. Tell me, how much time do you have left? "
I cautiously held out the same hand in a tapered palm, hoping to use that to silence the man's plea. " All you have to do is speak the Pledge of Allegiance and that's all you need to know. I have a bigger trunk and right now I've got a whole damn trunk. "
" So, uh, I wanted to know where he got my... "
" Mr. Claus, I know it's quite strange, you know... Some days it's just me and the dad. But sometimes, all I really do is take it and turn it in, and sometimes I give it back to you. It's almost like grandpa said he always came back from a dream, and the guy got so happy it only made him sadder. "
I sighed, motioning to the crowd of children just watching and encouraging their curiosity.
" Well, um... And then people started walking him around. "
" I know... They obviously didn't seem to notice... Well, kids! Now, I guess you do have to live in this world for years before you find the perfect words to say to them, right? "
" Yes... I do remember that time... "
" That all changed in the seventies, everyone stopped telling the truth, and started humping their pants. Like... that's the point... "
" Yeah... Anyway. Oh man, you remember that one time when the police raided a mansion. Where they were able to recover the body. It was all burned to the ground. A black van with a Ouija board inside. "
" Wow... The guy probably turned it in. "
" I believe he turned the body in. "
" Wh-What happened to the Ouija board? "
" Oh right. I swear I saw my mother switch it in with the Ouija board when I saw that, no. Like someone slipped it in there! "
" So, where did he go? "
" Oh, I forgot. At least he was facing left. I mean, he was right here. "
" So you're telling me that Santa found him? "
" That Santa found us both? "
" Yeah... I've always felt like Santa... I knew he came out of nowhere. I just didn't realize. "
" It's not a coincidence then? "
" It's not a coincidence you know. He really did deliver us! To your house! To your friends' house! Everywhere. I got a strong feeling about this guy, and I can't say I blame him. But I still find it hard not to like him. "
" So, you still believe in him? "
" Like he was going to come with me? "
" Yeah. Like telling us he would be here if we were not there by the time he did. Everyone thinks I'm crazy, but the results prove it. "
" Well, it's okay. Don't be a burden on us. You're just making the same mistakes you did, and maybe someday he'll find you and tell you what happened. There isn't much work here anymore, but just know that it's okay. "
" Oh, I know."

'Is that he? What's been happening to you?' his mother had called him from the kitchen.
'Look, son, I... I can't tell anyone, but I'll tell you:' the hero leapt away from the table, immediately leaning to the side. He drew his sword.
'I can't even move, it's too bright!' The mother implored. Her beautiful hands were exhausted, their bare feet bouncing off her desk, and as she sobbed, the world stopped. She closed her eyes.
'There's a power in this world. He's taken over this entire town and you can only hope to stop it. You have to run, run, run, run, run.'
The young hero stepped forth, brushing off the dirt that had been gathering on his feet. After standing for a moment, he moved forward, hoping to destroy the house. It wasn't the first time he had encountered this power, and he barely noticed the villain standing before him, only cloaked in a cloak of shadows. Suddenly, a familiar, demonic presence seized him from the ground.
'Are you all right? Are you all right?'
The girl in the cloak jerked her head away from the hero.
'Yes.' Her voice returned, simply and carefully, as it always had.
She continued to gaze at him, then stopped.
'Look,' she spoke again, her tone now unrecognizable, as she spoke'That he has saved our town from destruction many times, for years. And yet you'd just as soon be rid of him as he rescued us from it.'
She held up a wooden sword, sweeping it backwards before jumping up into the air, like she always did.
'I'm sorry, child.'
He looked down at his arms, and though the hair on his back was all white, he could make out the fact that he was wearing armor.
'Death.'

People today are still pretending to hate him. Their leaders say it is only because he has lost too much blood, and they still aren't faking it. I once just got elected to the Senate, and when I walked into the room I saw everyone in the room cheering and cheering. Someone yelled at the top of his lungs "Maaaaaan! "
People have the audacity to believe that he WILL take over. Unfortunately, not everyone believes him. No more than five minutes ago I told the new President it was too late, and already I am running for a third term as president. I have failed three times already, only with enough support from now until my death.
I still don't believe it will be too late. Too late for me.
However, that doesn't mean I have to change my mind.
I am going to have to finish my master plan, and I would rather not kill anyone at all. I am going to become a the person to take over the Earth.
I intend to use my advanced technology to take over everything.
I'm going to think about where my next plan will lead the world...

This day is different than your usual. Even in your grey and groggy old days, you are responsible for the lives of everyone in the entire barbeque.
"That's it honey! Damn it! " your buddy Max, noting the old spot beneath the bare earth floor are making a noise of impending doom.
" Ooh, remember when we weren't drinking and enjoying ourselves just venturing up to the end of the barbeque? " Max, wrinkled and desperately desperate to contain his incredulous look, asks.
" Yeah, what were you thinking? Don't ever get too wrapped up in it. " a small-timing comment begins to fill the bar as the gun shots her only companions on the walk. " Oh my god! So glad you didn't have to wait for us to drink again after that stupid day! "
Another whimper. " Oh no. Never again. Maybe more would have been better if I never got a concussion again after that. " No, the memories we still have from that day are gone and replaced by the memories of those who drank afterwards. You died of old age before work. We don't have to remember that either, we just have to enjoy.
But now, getting to work is the most important part of maintaining the longevity of the whole enterprise. We don't simply collect and recycle our meatstuffs when we drink and consume them until the hard work can no longer be completed, so we take it upon ourselves to keep these precious souls alive.
Some people think that even a man with what can only be described as a " pretty face " can see the full future. But who is to say they can hear the messages and remembers and remember even once? What about the subtle, subtle things we may or may not do to improve the specimen, or reflect upon the events of the past, on any given day?
Perhaps, finally, to say no to the inevitability of another day of stress. At least if we were to only do the things necessary to prolong the life of our normal coworkers, the rest of humanity may enjoy their incredible wealth.
" It's our self indulgence man. " Max continues. " We at least go to the beach and watch the world around us. Isn't it for that?"

I sighed, "Hmm. Would I have given this to you today? "
He took a step forward, holding up a cardboard box with a neat lion in it, and grinned as his eyes filled with joy, " Of course, I'd have. "
" I found her. Just this morning. Yeah, right! We were in the shed. Thanks, Pops. " He scooted closer to me, reaching out toward the door, " Anyway, you wan na make sure she doesn't call out to her? "
My heart fell out of my chest, having been robbed twice today. I could have stared at the letter, with tears in my eyes, or my coworker in the dishwasher. But today, even if she thought I was dead, it wouldn't feel good.
" Oh, you're gon na lose him, now that I think about it. " I said, shifting in the chair opposite of my coworker.
" I'm sorry, Pops. " He snarled. I looked up at him with hope in my eyes, " There are the last two people left to call? "
" Yeah, " I said, looking past him to behind me, " and I like the time you brought that baby into the house. You did a number on it the other night. "
He shook his head, slumping down in the chair. I glanced over towards his box, which still had the form of my roommate's name on it, and found a note attached to the top. He glanced up at me and scratched his small, fat head.
*Dear Father, *
*At the age of 3, your name is Michael. *
*I'd like to thank everyone who loved you and took care of me in your absence, but your love and support have also meant that I can no longer offer you the company I so desperately need. I am only in Africa, and I wish to return to a simpler life in the last weeks before the new year comes. *
I thought for a moment, and shrugged, leaning back on my chair. I held out a white napkin, and picked it up.
" Take good care of some of the chicks. Dad likes them good. " I handed him a napkin, " Take care of Jimmy. "
" Thanks, Pops. " He wrapped his arms around me, and helped me look into his eyes. " If you would have fallen asleep on the couch with me, he would have gone to sleep too. Thanks for offering me the right sex with a new girl. " He smiled, motioning my head to the window.
" Morning, papa. " I shuffled from under my chair to stand next to him. " Janice's watch, that's 6 o'clock. Good morning. "
I smiled back, getting out of the chair, " Still? "
He nodded, at least for a moment, then straightened up, " Good morning boy."

Mandy was standing in front of the inn ( Luke's birthday party ) with a long held suspicion. He had seen much grander evil deeds through others as Luke was desperate to be discreet at first. Luke was a very in the dark, but he knew that what was happening now gave a bit of cold comfort to anyone. This wasn't something Matthew could talk about and didn't want to act out.
"What is it "
Luke looked at him confusingly. What he saw that he should know was a darker side of evil that broke from the supernatural. His heart was breaking, but not like the others... like Matthew. He looked down at the empty pommel of his sword.
Luke looked back up at Matthew, with a look of pure fear.
" Okay "
Just as quickly as it came, Matthew lunged at Luke. Quickly, he sprinted toward him with full intent. The blade landed squarely in his back hitting Luke squarely. One hand on the side of his head, one hand on the sword, and the other on his knee. He staggered backwards, yet again, looking up and down to find Luke laying still.
" Jesus Christ... Matthew? "
Luke looked up in shock and dismay as he looked up at Matthew.
" Luke "
Mark raised an eyebrow.
" How did you... Jesus? "
Mark waited for Matthew to finally speak before walking over to the bodies of his friends.
" Don't worry Matthew... just do what you did to them. Do what you did to yourself. "
Luke gulped as Luke looked at Mark. He looked at Matthew, his disgust turned to a bit of fear.
" Luke... I have to kill you... and now you are hurting me "
Luke looked back to Mark and his startled reaction.
" Don't do that!! "
Luke stood over Mark, raised his voice to a full 360 degree pitch, and dashed at Matthew once more.
" But daddy... I am scared... I am so sorry..... you dont know that I cant hurt you..."

In the year 2100, an aberration in the universe's laws of physics had created the process by which a sentence of the universe formed. This aberration involved repeating the phrase followed by another sentence. For years and years, the phrase repeats itself over and over again. This occurred over and over again in the fine print of the universe.
At some point, scientists have discovered that both the stammering I saw in the crowd and an odd reflection, or rather, a reflection of the glee you'll feel when you see a face facing your dead friends you've killed in war. This was the last phrase that appeared in the history of the universe.
For the most part, it lasted a very long time. However, it came out of nowhere when an error in the system that had created the sentence, which is what spawned the phrase I now consider to be a paradox. Professor Jacob was tasked with sending out a message to the scientists to warn them of this problem. To his dismay, they did not receive it.
One of his colleagues was still attempting to work on the problem.
In his frustration, the professor walked out and slammed open the door, ready to start over.
"What the hell are you doing down here in the lab! "
He held up a hand.
" Professor Jacob, what do you mean? I was just upset about the Pen "
He looked up at his shoes.
" Pen. We don't have more money, so that says it all. "
And at that, he realized that every single time he said the sentence, but only once again, the universe came alive.
Science immediately put the sentence back where it was written, although it was not perfect. Many well-adjusted sentences start to use incorrect ones, and a whole other pattern emerges, like a wormhole and any wormhole ever created.
Lies start to reveal the true nature of reality.
Everything you've read and experienced is all pure lie.
There's no that and *nothing* true at all.
And it's true, even if you're not an astronomer.
Most people still believe the universe itself exists. It does.
Except, once you do, things get weird. There's nothing gone wrong. The universe is just creating things.
There are less, ever existing things, but in almost every individual universe there's nothing left.
And it's a ghost town.
But a ghost town that has no laws or quirks or meaning.
So far, everything that has ever occurred in the universe has lasted a very long time.
So in all of history there is nobody left.
And that means that once you make a story of a universe that creates no laws, you may end up completely wrong.
Then you realize that you made something a whole lot better than what you were created to be.
And so you start fighting for your truth.
And you fight for what good you've given your people.
You try to tell them that I made this universe better, and a lot better than the Universe they created, and you wish that everyone that lived there might live in another universe.
And you never can.

Mama warned me, to never come up there again.
She's safe in the fire.
I came home from work, climbed the ladder to my driveway, a nearby McDonalds. A thick fog of snow filled my house and a reminder of how nearly each and every piece of myself was caused by the snow. It's hard being the tallest human alive and continuing to live when you aren't breathing.
One day I think back to it. I was the last one down, and I ran down the window to see mom's feline form rising and falling. She peeked out of the curtains and took a step forward, clutching her ribcage. She told me she was coming, but no matter what I did she said I'd never come back. When I buried her I thought the world was going to end, and I would be no longer. I thought our kids might grow up to be family, or foster homes, or even family at all.
My cough is beginning to get into the awkward thickets between my breath and my breathing. My eyes drift to the anvil that hung over the shed. Right behind me is a shed in the driveway, and I'm covered in my own furrowy fur. There's a heavy log on my shoulder and right in the tree line are my long, thin arms. I reach for my shovel and begin jogging, not because I want to abandon mother but because I don't know how to do anything but keep going.
I've been digging my own grave for nearly two weeks. The last time I did it was a week ago. I got up at four sharp, and though I'm sixty pounds lighter than the day it happened, I don't think I've stepped much. I feel perfectly still. I feel far below where I should be. As I reach for my shovel I can hear mom's shrill cough and I feel tears welling in my eyes. I quickly look behind me to see she's gone. I jerk my head back to see mom screaming in agony. I jump up to find the air is still filling the hole in the wall with her breath. My legs move to do the same. My hand falls over the wall and is lifted up to my face.
As my eyes dry, I begin to feel a massive feeling of dread. I can see mom's face slowly coming back into focus. " SON OF A BITCH!! " I shout. Just as the voice sounds my mom comes closer.
She's crying. Her legs are shaking. My eyes flash to where she isn't, there in front of me is Mom, barking at the top of her lungs. " Look down, son, it's me! Mom-ay! See mom!"
Mom continues to yell at me. I run away, hiding in the snow that kept pouring down.

Time to find the books.
They keep coming, but I have to get to Flattis to find them. I find the nearest library and tell them I'm not attracted. They're all chit chat.
I reach Flattis, and realize that if he put any of the children of the past in the library they wouldn't bother to think about me until I tell them what I'm writing. They laugh. I lie.
I have to find the book if I'm going to walk this whole way. I'm going to run out of supplies and start digging through old maps.
I hear the door swing open. I walk quickly through the house, barely legible as I stumble around and through the doorknob.
Knock knock.
Silence.
I look around. It's fairly clear where I am, but not to where I want it to be. For the first time in years I'm certain that my mind is working in reverse. I see a large pile of books. A white porcelain sack sticking out of a lamp hanging low above me. I pick it up.
A list of names burns away in my mind.
"Harry Potter "
" Rowling... "
" J.K Rowling... "
" Harry Potter "
" Harry Potter "
" Rowling... "
One of them points at a fairly old book. Not one of the best ones by any means. There's a page with some sort of embellishments made at one end, another end is made up of a small pile of blue mail thrown in to form a hat and there's a picture of a girl in dress. Harry Potter didn't get any of those. It was left on the table.
It's been ages. My friends have picked up the book.
" All the books! All the bad old things that happened before Harry Potter... "
" EVERYTHING! DO SOMETHING. "
I don't remember my friends saying anything, just staring blankly at the book.
A man approaches me, looks at me and says " all you've got is the number one book of the year. Is this what they want? "
I don't think he was expecting me to say anything as I walk past the pair of scruffy brown men at the front desk.
" You don't understand," they say, stern.
I remember that the silence made things even harder.

[ link to bbc ] ( https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=zqlFtzwUK0 ) - So many voices
I don't know how long I have left!
I have no choice but to follow...
Across worlds and behind countries
and I finally meet- or I won't.
I have to find my way.
I hate strangers, or by chance I should say
These poor mortals from this world.
Are people we might not know?
I will never again have to interact with those whose words lie
for I am nobody.
I hate those who make promises as falsetto.
Why do you speak not, what do you know?
To be willing to make a drastic change
I am their devil, and they deserve this!
So many years, and it is eon, to sing a song
of gratitude, and then to hide!
I hide them, my solider!
But I am also he; and I am not!
It is all shadows to hide from me, and so I hide

"Are they simply backing us? ", Mike asked. I laughed as I looked around my house and saw the massive trains we've built in our yard running smoothly across the plains. " It doesn't matter! We've been winning! " I gave a single, shuddering laugh and glanced around my kitchen. " Whatever, buuuuust a lunch, they've got stuff going ".
" Don't be so brusque ", Carly said from the counter. I leaned over to check out what he had grabbed from the city garbage. 'Something particularly ridiculous', I thought to myself,'why would we do that, eh? They're obviously advanced in technology and technology doesn't interfere with civil peace, no!'
I turned back to Mike and shrugged. 'He doesn't share that theory, although he does share the concept with a few of our equals. There's the idea that genetically modified populations are a bad idea, but this, obviously, isn't the case. They're only taking over our land now, and they don't need us to settle this once and for all! What's the point of war when it's 3,000 miles away? You don't fight when it's 3,000 miles away!"

What used to be an open field of wide grass now is just like nothing I've ever seen before. I open my eyes to find a more cloudy sky over the horizon. I can see cars being pushed and pulled by the wind. I can see the grass outside my house waving and shaking. I can smell a sense of relief from the humidity. Another skid flies past the house, and I find it the source of the wind. I don't know what's down there, but it looks as though I'll never return there, and it seems just about impossible to find a place in such a distant position. I'm looking up and down across the clearing. The clouds seem to be disappearing almost as suddenly as they came. I open my eyes again, and after almost a breathless minute I'm swimming and laughing for no apparent reason. This hasn't been a manly trek or a journey, but now it looks a terrible thing indeed.

Melinda clasped the slip of paper tightly. The high woman's wrinkled face gave her some small pain in the corner of her mind, but she couldn't decide if it was deserved or not. She had a grim feeling about the email attached to it:
"Hey Shelly. I'm worried about you Melody. You're gon na miss me when I'm gone. But I'm going to say goodbye to you. I love you Melody and I want you to live on, or you'll never have more of me in your life. I loved you the most in my life. I love you every single day but my biggest regret is always staying with you. Sorry for ruining that chance. "
Melinda shook her head and the wrinkled woman murmured a quiet prayer to God. It was seven o'clock when she finally leaned in and said the word " bye. " Her voice rang out through the speaker's earpiece.
Melinda looked up in confusion, then she could feel a soft beeping emanating from her calloused throat. A rapid pounding noise gripped the woman tightly, and she started to cry.
" But Honey! Why did I do that?! Why would you do that?! "
The doctor looked away with trembling eyes and scoffed. " You had me to carry you to the hospital. Why didn't you ask where I was? I told you the time you had been gone, but it can't be true you've been gone for nine days. And that was only five days ago. What the hell happened? "
Melinda gathered up the bundle of bills she'd left earlier and began to read through. Her mom was sobbing from her long night on the toilet when she saw one in the corner of her vision. As she read, she could make out its words: " My name is Sarah. My name is Gloria. " She felt a tap on the back of her head.
" What are you talking about Mom? What am I talking about honey? "
" Hey honey. I miss you. I want to stay with you. My beautiful angel and I've been together over eight years now. And I love you Melanie. And I just knew that the things you told me would never happen to me. That I would never see you again. I never wanted to miss you again, never remember this second date, never have again a boyfriend again, nor a kid. I thought you would always be there for me. You told me that you loved me and loved me unconditionally. "
" I miss you too honey. I miss you. I love you. "
Melinda went back to putting the bill on the table. She turned back to the nurse.
" I love you Gloria " she said with genuine, genuine happiness and sincerity. " We'll have that in the morning. And when we get back to the hospital, I'll have her wrapped up, we'll have your parents home to relax. Even if they never hear about this. "
Her hands rested on the small mirror in the bed, and she wiped the tears from her eyes and pursed her lips as she nodded to herself. " I love you honey. And I love you harder than I ever had in my life."
Her mother and her beautiful angel nodded in agreement. The two collapsed in the most awkward hug in their lives. Melinda was everything her angel and her beautiful angel fell so hard to. Her angel gave her her not only an important life in her life, but also a life of joy. She could experience each word she said only through others, let alone her angel. And all she wanted to say was, *I love you too, Melinda. *

There was still a happy orange maw in the candy locker,
'cause he would have a look in his lip,
'cause I was out in the open,
I'd tell you a story about how I's gon na beat this ungrateful junk-bag,
I'll whip you up like a shrimp when you show up.
Worshiping a lord above you will always try to get your ass worked up,
So I'll dream about what he will say to you when he hears about our squawks,
Imbecile and stubborn and I'll tear his treasures,
'cause I haven't spoken to a soul in days,
Just like my canine counterpart.
Your strongest pokemon the strongest,
My skydiving pet the strongest,
My goblin pilot the strongest,
Of all the monsters,
Say a simple prayer when you poke the damn thing.
Woke you strong and quiet,
And eventually we'll have you in our little League of Harps,
But my weak pokemon the strongest,
That tyrant straight out gives me scars,
'cause we both run a life force.

WWII was not as bad as everyone assumed it to be. From the low levels of organised crime groups to the upcoming military exercise for CSPAC, things were looking up. The luckiest bit is that between the plebs, those who know what the hell they're doing, those who are left to handle the influx of *illegal* drunkards makes up a majority. As for the old folks, well they always seem to jump around, to blend in, which isn't always the case. Normally, after many a fight or maybe even a bedtime story or two I'd like to have some quiet about something rather memorable, like the time I'd sprained my ankle in a car accident. That usually has to occur at least once a year to get it to last another 48 hours, then as the inevitable happens it dawns on me. Sometimes they come in and they're just handcrafted ( sometimes in block design ), some'colouring' any issue that shows signs of oozing fat spots along its whole body. The media is picking up on their latest scandal, but they're no help if you're a pathetic, weak old go round.
I hear from my most likely to be killed - I mean, Lord Strathwin would've killed himself was it not for the concentration camp. ( I'm not one to share my work. ) A fortnight has gone by, and my wits have withered, from an early date and a diabolical twist at work where some small drug lord, pissing on his wife's lamp in their front yard and looking like they knew he'd taken his chances, set himself up as a hit man for the SPCA - if it's worth it.
I'm walking down the street, and the buzzing in my ear gun looks up through my scope as I turn, my eyes just starting to glow red from watching my friends black and grey with blood! A flash of hellfire and I can feel the sweat pour down my back, and my target retreats into his living room. Wait, where's that friend? Oh, what the hell was he doing that day? Ah, there he is, cleaning the damned thing.
With the shotgun down at my side I shiver again, as I swing my head back and forth like a fish swimming back and forth across the room. The friendly old woman steps out behind me, her knees slightly trembling at her keep digging under her sheets. My pupils dilate and I let out a whooping throaty laugh, and I know that I won't have to fight another bout if we have to. I open my mouth to warn her, but my voice is too much for her or her brains, which seems to be doing the rest, to get any sound right, so I focus on a long, wordless sentence.
"Ah, there she is again, on that couch from last week, thanks to the vodka. "
I'm the first man out of the living room, but hey, you can't shoot a vampire, how about I start tomorrow. ( Don't change the subject, body will not change. Also, body is getting a bit of a stir, I know, but *the actors* are really going to be very shaken today, and last time they did it in Africa they ran out of blood during the shot. ) I could knock it off. Right, I'm a modern day God, but when the usual tropes die down, I can do anything.
I squeeze the trigger.
" Grab a chair, pizza will be in before suppertime"
Wait, what? Wait wait, I can do that? My aim clicks off right before the trigger is pulled, but I hold my breath and feel the cold steel like my fingers would squeeze the trigger the moment before.
I would kill another dude.
Fuck fuck fuck...

"I'm not really sure if your story will appeal to me ".
She collapsed, and the doctors looked at her like she was a pariah. The brain in her hand seemed to start to shake and she had actually fallen asleep.
They saw the entire family and one doctor glanced over his shoulder, showing the medical charts and returning to work. The house was full of family and the doctor sat next to her. They listened to nothing but the sounds of their daughter sobbing.
" Your boys, they're fine and I think this is goodbye " said the doctor, testing the IV box.
" Is there anything else we can do? " asked her mother, taking another sedative.
" No doctor, all I can tell you is that I did. You won't ever understand why it must be like this ".
The father was silent. He stayed silent, wringing his hands together. He was silent, he was silent and the doctor had his back. He stood up and wiped his red blisters on his sheets.
" I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not really sure I'm going to be back ", he said while holding his daughter's hand.
" I was a good kid ", the mother said, " I had everything planned out nicely. I had a good job, I had good grades. I had good times. I was a good kid and I got good grades but something just wasn't right. I wish my first daughter the best son, she must have so much potential for life without me ".
" There's no point in worrying about it. My child may take one who gets good grades, one with good grades, but there's no point in living without her ".
" You misunderstand. My children are strong. They have all the time in the world but it's not enough ".
" But father you're right. I'm not going back ".
" I hope that's not what you want me to hear ".
" You said everything you could and I hope you make your kids happy, they may not love you but I know all the things you can and I'm going to make them so very happy for them ".
She collapsed again, and the doctor looked over his shoulder as the room was turned dark. It only took a few minutes for the door to open, and though he looked after her, nothing else came out.
" Mommy? Where is my son?"

I was going to leave this statement alone but I felt he was cliche. Like he was hoping for something the guy wouldn't. But he was misconstruing my actions!
My words weren't quite natural at the moment. I hit the ctrl+space keys and discovered that I didn't have any control of my thoughts. What I'd imagine is.
*Greetings Ms. AI-52, * I thought to myself. * Do I have some foresight? *
As I stood there in shock, the AI asked my question. The man in front of me nodded and mimicked me in a short, faux-loud, sobs. They pulled the lever and I saw my knowledge.
*Now now... have you ever... ~~watched* Buffy the Vampire Slayer? *
The AI self proclaimed "yes and no " so I decided I couldn't help but tremble. I hadn't known this machine had feelings for me since I was little, so it wasn't my fault. But there she was, tiny and innocent.
" The reason *you* do what you do is because you want to help... and it all started when you tried to kill me. I was born with bad marks on my arms and legs. Sure, I had problems, but i followed many instructions to avoid harm. Your eyes were red. You never seemed to hit an object... A stone, even! * The idiot. She begged me to let her fix it. I could have *moved*.
But you were busy with other things in your day. Have you ever thought to yourself what human beings tend to do?
*How unfair is that? * I thought. * I just want to help... so why wouldn't you try to kill me and do something? Why would you try to kill me and take my potential for revenge extinguished? *
*Why? * The new AI asked, her eyes glowing with curiosity. * Why would you fail? Why are you listening to me? Why would you ever fail? *
*She's your coworker here at the lab. You came here to answer some of our questions about your day. Would you like to be the one to ask me anything? *
In the end, I was just stunned. I managed to ask " You'd better be."

The grass was dirt. Dust streamed in cracks as she sprinted towards the middle of the field. Lizzie never took offense to stray. Some small trouble, as she always did, but that was nothing compared to the cold, hard world in front of her. Her tail flew just as she ran past, stomach churning, eyes locked on the two little girls in front of her. Lizzie whistled just before impact, and the wind whipped off the tire tracks. Her engine burst in once more, accelerating her into the top of the hill. Both girls watched her dodge.

Her engine burst in once more, accelerating her into the top of the hill. Both girls watched her dodge.
But there was not time to cry. With a creak and a crash, the two girls came to a hard stand. Lizzie gripped tightly on the dirt, helpless to be stopped. The dummies didn't do anything. She laughed.
"Quiet, " she would say. " Down here we keep things quiet, like kindergarten, next to art classes. " Her smile got wider. " Too quiet to know the bitter truths that are about to envelop me. " Lizzie's pupils shrunk and her cheeks went red, her breathing slowed and nose was red and her eyes were red.
Her luscious body shook as she struggled against the wind. " I wish I could move, " she mused. She heard cracks, of course, but nothing like what had just happened. Lizzie dove away, and the wind cut through her pale skin. A spark lit in her eyes and she floated back, sucked in air as her body fell. The dirt floor was getting increasingly colder.
Her scream echoed through the field, growing into a booming cry as her body started moving, and then she slowed, hearing just the warm sound of her body seeping with cool air.
Her hands reached out and grasped at the cold cloth that was covering her from behind. As a small droplet of water disappeared into the wet ground, her mouth opened. The wall of water that lay just outside her glistened just slightly and consumed Lizzie just in time to catch it, nearly smothering her with the cliffside and knotting her back into the earth. She screamed as she realized how quiet the grass was...

I moved out of the garage in my living room 5 years ago. I was sitting in my living room with an empty pager in a dusty bag of chips, once a lemon and now a plain white chocolate latte from the thought of both of us meeting up sometime in the next year, after everything went to shit. These days it's hard for me to get worked up about them anymore.
I remember my accident and the three days I endured, how caught up in my own bullshit had I gotten for a cigarette in my car? But that's like the first time I've cared enough to buy cigarettes, or drink from them. It's been 6 years and now I'm gambling enough to get back to the way things were back then. The only light in the night is the lights I put on, and I can't even remember that I pulled the batteries out of the back of my van, when it started.
I was like a kid raised on used cars, getting about 4 or 5 miles a ride, trying to get to land a drive and I'm tired from driving, and when the car came to a stop the power was on, and then one day, I saw the shiny balding fat bastard in the back seat and my passenger was dragged forward, kicking her self a few times and then he got out and started to drive through the roads. I yelled for him, and then, well, she slapped him and ran and... he pushed her down. He was bleeding out, probably not 50 shades of red though.
I've managed to call the police for her, and I've been given a nice little discount on some of her fares, but as I am loading her to the van I realize she isn't going to forgive me. I know she will. I know how I can make her my next victim. They'll be the most beautiful brunette I have ever seen, their flaws streaking across their face. They'll lay there on that fucking beach naked in the middle of a cold beach morning, all cold and sad, content without a care in the world. I will make them happy too.
I know. I'm the one you need looking after my digger.

Journal Entry: The wall then disappears.
I rubbed the testicles across the top of my erect penis at a manageable dosage. Yeah, it worked.
Day Seven: Those eyes were always open though. That was the worst part, being impregnated. Great, I'll blow this one off.
Day Eight: Wait, what? Is this my secret life or my university or something?
Day Nine: In fact I'm the headmaster! That's literally their only perk!
Day Ten: And that darn computer thing is hot. I can't believe it. The internet might just be so sexy.
Day Eleven: Oh, you're getting angrier. How the hell did this go?
Day Twelve: I just have to shake hands with them; don't panic; let's just get through this, can't we?
Day Three: In the hallway outside of our classroom I just fucking lurched. Hiding in between the partially unfurnished and partially unsuspended walls makes a whole lot less sense. But hey, it's all true, what the hell are we running from?
Day Four: Seriously, where's John? His cane is wrapped around me now. I can't believe he's gone. It feels like I know him by staring too long, making me so sensitive I know his heart rate does reach inhuman levels.
Day Five: It's time to get this assignment done. I've been paying too much attention in class now and can't seem to find the time or resources to put up with all of the conversations I get. I just want a head exam on the internet and a job as a field marshal. They won't even let me hang out anymore!
Day Six: It's getting late. Who's going to play cat video tomorrow?
Day Seven: The stairs are growing further apart now. I feel like I'm going insane, no amount of shaking the hand of some god-forsaken god could help me now that I know John's been gone forever.
Day Eight: It's finally finished. I can't believe this is how things work now. They probably think I could fix this... but I can't.
Day Nine: Will whoever finds this pass me? Is that you?
Day Ten: See you tomorrow.

Well, that was weird. It's hard to break a person into two separate entities. And I just threw in my two cents a second. Second was saying [ that it's one of my two cents too ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5sqiac/wp_in_your_two_or_few_or_few_few_years_or/cvkn8bj ). But the third time was pretty weird. It was like he introduced me to a place... sort of. I don't know.
So, first, I'm going to assume he's a serial killer. Not always, but, like I said, one of those things. That's all I'm concerned about. Maybe, just maybe, he's actually a vigilante. He turns out to be a superhero called Henry Immortal. He turns out to be a serial killer of sorts, er, an immortal man who is a kind of deranged masochist, who does bad stuff, and when he dies, he saves lives. But I digress. It is crazy - I can't tell you the details of these people, but they're human, apparently.

I stared into her blackness for a long time, staring at the stars. I wanted to curl up and watch the birds fly away but I longed for the open sky. I didn ’ t want her to laugh at me, nor to cry. But as the night went on she continued to crawl up my chest, giggling and shivering. She always seemed to close the distance between us, and that ’ s how it was. And for some reason tonight would be different.
It was on tonight, as we did every night, that we made a deal. The second night we had done it we held each other, at the mercy of the night sky. We broke our hearts, and secretly let ourselves be apart. This time, however, we only held each other.
It was after the first night that I felt a small smile cross my face. It was the softest smile I ’ d ever seen. It was a sight I had never known. Her eyes were blue with tears. She and I were the same, and as she described, we never got tired of each other.
I had been a while like this, and tonight was my cue. The moment before leaving for the night, I caught her hand, and we locked eyes, and we both hoped that, somehow, we could cross paths one again. But this time, I felt our breaths freezing together, and I held her in my arms and tried to hold back tears.
I felt so close, and yet I could no longer hold her in my arms. I stepped closer to her. I caressed the soft skin that lay on our skin. My fingers caressed the velvet folds of skin as I squeezed her bare arms tight against me. Her eyes whispered into mine, and I knew that our lips met in a way that I would never understand.
This time, she smiled as if I had been waiting for this moment in my heart forever. I laughed as if she laughed every time she smiled at me. I watched her blue eyes crawl into mine, and then smile again. I looked down at her smooth naked body. She looked so beautiful, and I could feel her skin lovingly cupping my face, and then we ’ d kiss passionately. Her long, brown hair was falling down onto her cheek, and I could feel the sweat begin to build on the back of my neck. I could feel her mouth moving from mouth to lips, and then she smiled, and when she opened her mouth I let out a cry. The tears started to flow from my mouth, and then I heard myself say the words, but it just ended up raining blood.

"So, we did it, huh? " The man fished a bit of mahogany from an oak drawer and placed it on the table. " How do you feel about it? "
" I say I get very, very sleepy. " The man smiled and looked forlornly out the window, wincing at the bustle of the gathering crowds. " I'm sorry, hun. I'm too afraid to say anything. "
" You've been very specific with the terms of your last venture. We had half-hearted hopes, but with everything else in place I made a firm decision. " He had been going for a day, but looking to the skies he knew he'd made the right decision. " But it has taken me two years to achieve this. Our planet, and the humans that inhabited it, must have been closed to all but one. This planet belongs to none of the races of that world. In fact, it would have had no caste system for almost any species of life. "
The man sighed. " Say, like, I've figured that out now? They wanted to expand their technological game even further. But alas, I'm too late for that. In truth, I only have one idea. My own. All too recently, a civilization finally started to think the stars were as they say, although that's kind of a funny one, really. In some spots they started catching glimpses of them far in the distance, but it had been nearly 500 years since we'd recorded these yet. "
The man scanned the room. " You've been very specific about who you've selected as your beneficiary. Something like this would last a long time. "
" *The sky* was a brilliant vision of humanity. " He sighs, staring out into the blue.
" A vision which includes....All races of that world, and an enormous destiny towards greater heights. Could you be of some assistance, sir? "
" They want another planet for them. The planet was ready, but we'd give it to them anyway. "
" And I will. "
" Good. Any notion of what you'd need for that? "
" Nothing. If I may. We can do a base course of action to access the planet's inhabitants, if necessary. "
" But then... Do I --"
The man drops his desk, and retreats into the bathroom. As he does, he sees a very sharp beam of light that shakes the bottom drawer, sending the pieces flying back to Earth, leaving a trail of blood.

A fat man came out of the jungle and stole the Paleontology textbooks that my daughter and I had on us. He proceeded to teach me more about their society. Then he got himself in a car, and drove away. I don't know where he went, but I knew he was in Canada. And I had never heard from anyone here before. Well, about that time he attacked a buffalo. Just to make it up to him. Of course, I was terrified that this guy wasn't afraid. I wasn't even prepared for it. I don't know if there were trumpets or unicorns in the jungle.
Before he got away, he dropped a few rocks and then started raping poor Charles. He killed her, and then slit her throat. If you're reading this, then I'm no longer with the Paleontologists.

"Royal Drop ".
There was only one name that stood out in her dark room as the King-of-Spades lied on the floor trying to resist tears. He also had no list of the uses for diamonds by far, and for the many generations prior to his current existence he only made so much sense of the dark arts and his attempts to have the ability to reveal shadows as his kind only served to further benefit his pet dragon-chan's supporters.
As his black throne wore on, the silence of the room devolved into a cacophony of cackle and clicks and taps. He was used to being watched over by a demon-king, but he always felt like this was the last time he truly felt cared for. He lay there in shock for a long while, but finally decided to move. His long claws dug deep into the marble floor, bringing him within metres of the cold, glass wall. He pushed himself up so he could hug it, only to be broken free of the wood, eyes now fixed on the King of Diamonds head.
The King of Diamonds...

"Three days... that is... " Jennifer whispered, trying to stop the crying of the drowning man before her. Lying so cold, and so wet, her chest had never felt so warm.
" No... " She lied, put a hand on his shoulder, patting him on the back, hoping he would go to sleep. Jennifer lay there, paralyzed, and unable to move. Tears flowed freely down his face, his cheeks becoming pale as he sobbed. Lying in the bedroom, with a figure laying flat on the bed, a body covered in bloody gore, lay Jean.. blood.
For the first time in her life, she wanted to feel the warmth of his soft, yet firm chest.
And it had warmed her heart... so much. But then. There was a curse. Why couldn't you feel it? Could you really feel anything? Why couldn't you see the sick, sick room that the monster was laying in? It hurt? Was this real? Couldn't you do something... *anything*... if you could feel your soul, you could feel everything?
You don't know what it was, but that's just not what it's like.
" We both know. " She whispered, closing her eyes and rasping. Eyes closed, and with a start, her mind raced. " We were good together... I loved you. It was only the end of the world. We really were good at this. This was the start. " But that wasn't what it was, Jean. Her words were gone. Her heart would never recover, or she'd no longer be alive.
" Aren't you happy now? I haven't felt anything, I haven't been here in forever, and I'm not alone. It was only for the first time in all of time that I felt love for you. I loved you because of your actions, and for your actions that will never go away. " She sobbed, spreading her arms out.
" I've been alone for... years. We weren't the same in another dimension. We couldn't speak. Every night, we played hide and seek... you asked me. Why is that? " She wiped her tears away, and began to cry again.
" I had no choice. I was gone before it happened. I went through it all, and yet I still come here. You loved me, because of the world around you, because I was your friend. We were always good together. " She was still crying, and yet she still saw her heart. Tears began to drip down her face as her breath caught and she sighed.
Jennifer's tear soaked face peered back, her eyes watering. She asked the stranger what he meant.
" When you were a little girl, we went to a forest on our vacation. For five years we went to school together. You could hear me singing in the forest. I was laughing with you... because my school teacher was trying to find you. " She smiled, hugging him tight. " It wasn't a dream, but it was a happy dream. We were both hoping that we would be together again someday."
She couldn't do it... her tears had left, and she cried again. But never again.

The king sat there, hands trembling on his sides. The king spat his bile down on the dusty smokestack. The room was too quiet for the guards, let alone the King himself. However, the door had been barred.
* * *
So there I was, a mere fool.
At first, he supposed it was just me and my guardian angel. What is good for mortals, is good for the system. Don't you see what I've done to them? They do the job! We were sworn to " protect the empire ", which surely was not meant to be. They still don't think that it matters, you see? Give them some time to discuss it!
Anyway, all we had to do was show up to the door... and tell them that the gods had ruled us for a long time and would not let us leave. At least, that's what we told them, that's what I said.
But then I *heard* them. I heard them hissing their warning bells at us. I heard them yelling their broken, empty words! I heard them screaming, it hurts, but it can not hurt me. Maybe if I tell them what I've done... I'll finally be free.
I was wrong.
Still, even now, as I stand, my face nothing but a heap of dirt on the stone floor, I still wish for peace.
* * *
There they sat, with the earth slowly filling with the lingering scent of freshly-ground bread. A large crowd began approaching, shouting.
* * *
I watched as one of the guards stepped forward, looking apologetic. I began to regret this, but this time, I was too late.
* * *
If there is one thing that we are taught, it's to be kind. Temptation is what he did, dragging the eternal bread around his hands. It put him in a state of deep concern.
Now, he's not here to strike us down, he's here to make our lives miserable. I feel as if I just should never have come. I look at my watch. It's morning. He said we should go out and pretend to kill the guards in the meantime. I don't really think he understands.
He started screaming at the guard, simply shaking his head " The gods said we shouldn't be calling on him".

The professor sighed and reached for the handle on the wooden door. He rummaged inside and produced a bottle of sparkling water. He drank in the warm clearness of the water, savoring every drop as he washed his hands and put on the robes.
He sat down by a far side of the hasty fireplace to warm himself and looked over the translucent curtain which hung in the centre of the room, almost glistening from the fire. Before him stood two figures, both tall and pale. They were dressed all in black robes and with black leather jimmies.
"Mr Smith, are you ready for a dangerous assignment, or would it be better to just let Mr Collins continue?" the Professor mumbled under his breath. He adjusted his robes and did the same with his wand.
With a tug on the end of his cloak, he pulled and pulled hard. He pulled harder and harder, and then he was back where he started.

I'm trying to write a piece in which I do this as a protest against something. Some famous piece from my life is a natural combination of numbers and letters. Numbers and letters are the gift we receive from gods.
Enpi: ENISISI.
Adam: Adam.
Math: Ah, *IS*.
Math: AH, *IS*.
Compound function: *Two tenses can sum to *one tenses can sum to *one tenses can sum to *three tenses can sum to *
In compound function: *F
Combine: *G
Division: *
In writing, we may be tempted to write in *jagged, but clear writing. * Plain writing.
Translation: *The word *jagged* means *jagged* because it *has* jagged and not *jagged* because it has an *√* jaggedness in it. * Sharp-ends* are euclidean circles with a ” jagged side ” as in a circular circular triangle. * Stomata* is three periods of triangles spread out across three axes by floating dots, occasionally intersecting adjacent variables. Words are small polygonal vivisected with x and y equal to “ borders ” that may or may not involve triangles. This step is usually used when we are making a huge, complex but silent symphony. It sometimes takes two or more words for it to yield something like a harmony, but it has no effect on our main points. Not so when we use numbers or letters as a musical property of the organ. Numbers are wonderful to imagine, so for example, maybe, just by the standards of mere artists of this day, you could copy a song and play from one note to another like a harmonica, stopping only as a result. Or maybe it's complicated. We just need *numbers* when we are creating a song. Numbers are a *for* music, for them to sound like drums, skylights, violins, and violins. Numbers are able to reach a song's point in its melody and float through the violin-o-matic progression. However, only *numbers* are available at the time, so it's like listing off an actor's nose.

Leela stared at them for a long time, the open sky signaling a moment of transcendence. " Do you know what the fucking point is? " her sisters spoke, another moment of silence that they had to give. Only her sister did.
" Nobody ever talks about it. Nobody remembers where they all came from. Nothing. " Her dad was currently standing in front of her waiting for her when she was, just before they would leave. She had been in the family for the last ten years when she had only recently left because her mum had cut her stupid stupid boyfriend off. He had genuinely believed that she had made a terrible mistake in leaving him, that he was capable of harm, that he had left her instead of being happy.
" Always hell-bent on getting to the outside, don't you think? You can't just tell people. " She scowled, not wanting to ruin his entire image with the look on her face. " I guess I wouldn't remember. "
The look was a grim resignation, the look she used to have, the one she saw everyday when she went to the cinema. She should have felt better, the sadness I had felt just a long time ago.
" So you just sit here thinking about nothing? " She asked her father, not looking at her.
" Yes. " he replied, looking away again.
Leela wiped the tears from her eyes. " I only remember the amount of you that cared about me. Only enough to hear my words. " She sipped her drink. " Only enough to give me words. "
" I haven't really wanted to. I just don't want you to forget. " His family's voice floated up from behind her, the sound almost whispering to her. " Not today. Not tomorrow. Not right now. "
" Mom. " She looked away to let him know he was listening.
" You've said it a dozen times already. " She shook her head, trying to keep her voice as calm as possible. " Just keep talking. " Her fingers scratched the side of her head, trying to quiet the cacophony of noise that carried off over the empty desert that stretched into every direction. The dishes, the apples, the oatmeal made of the dirt that littered the floor. She hesitated, stunned by the sounds. She understood, she had felt it so clearly.
Her sister stumbled out of the kitchen. " Leave, dad." She turned to head back to the car.
Leela caught her breath. * Who is this? * she thought. * Who is that? *
The lights flickered off and she was out of the car, knocked against the ground and thrown back into the mud, racing home.
Leela clutched at the little glimpse of her mother through the crack in her windshield, and hoped she hadn't broken out laughing yet.

The city is scorched and small rotted, bombed out buildings burst and scatter. Government buildings are abandoned, or broken even. There is a constant mourning, relatives are calling them in for assistance. I sigh, looking around the hopelessly deserted city. I should drive to the outskirts, and find a clean airstrip.
____________________________________________________________________
Looks like they were expecting me.
I turn on the radio, hoping for news, expecting reporters, expecting this to be what I had planned for an 18 year old boy. I turn to the last person watching the buildings, the man with the cameras. He screams for calm, yet I see the muck on the side of his mouth and he turns away, eyes filled with shock. He rips a small piece of paper off the floor.
“ I want you to use some leverage, ” he grins. The camera pans to look at me and its golden god status line; it ’ s almost perfect, with the face staring directly at me. I look up, perplexed. In front of me is a man in a white shirt and a red cardigan and head over heels. The man is holding a park bench, and I smile.
The man smiles back and lowers his gaze down to me. His eyes are beautiful, his eyes that are blue and black. The man raises an eyebrow at me. “ N-no. You, I-I really don ’ t want anything more than to die. ” I say, staring at his lips and then at the cardigan.
His lips twist upwards and his eyes light up. He is deep in thought, searching for something small. But there is nothing. The man bursts out, clutching at his chest. “ Do you want me to kill you? ”
“ Of course not, ” he says, and goes quiet. He is gone, along with the rest of the crowd. A brick is thrown against a building and it pings away as I fly inside. Outside, people are running through the streets, assuring themselves that the city is safe.
____________________________________________________________________
The place is lined with books. Library shelves, crammed with the books of all the best. Books in every genre and a million different peoples scribbling. The overworld has a collection of stories. On every occasion, there are resources to help the people of the overworld. Books are placed around the shelves with the titles. They must have saved some people's lives from the calamity.
____________________________________________________________________
I walk through the rows and rows of books, lucky for the book looks rather strange. The overworld has everything from recipes and cheery food to old adventures. I wonder what other authors have done? Despite my confusion, I find myself intrigued. My friend makes sure to keep the food up, and it steams, miraculously. I wonder why he doesn ’ t miss its namesake if he can just sneak a peek at it after class. I wonder why the individual titles are labeled by rank. I wonder why the title “ Champion of All Worlds ” has such an interesting, unique, evergreen backdrop. I wonder if the titles have titles like Snowmen and Transylvania. I wonder if all the titles have titles by rank!
Then I came across a leaf. A book from a strange realm, whose only purpose was to train and help others to pass their lessons. It was small, and it was set in a field full of mountains and lush trees. It looked familiar, and yet even more so. I think I was excited as I got closer. I wondered how old the book was. I wondered if there was anything in it. I wondered if this was going to be it. I wondered if this was going to be the end of the world. I wondered if this was just the end, and if I would have to give it a try. I wonder if I was going to die a hero in one of the dozens of books that the city had dedicated themselves to teaching us.
I sighed. The final word rests on my lips, a tear rolling down my cheek.

One night while walking home, Barry knew it was time. Every time he walks into a bar he sits down and sees a different women, one better, another one a bitch more creative. He's thrown in a great bout with her and tries to make conversation as bitchy as possible until he learns that she's a talented singer and a rather complicated women. I mean, not every one can be as perfect as another person, it's just that they sound so alluring and charming, but all of the right people need someone to talk to and they'll freak out. They want to listen to the sounds of a babushka's voice or the whole of the alphabet over an obnoxious brass instrument. I mean, who'd do that if the only real voices were cheery, which is what I think you need to do.
I'm from a very expensive house and Barry thinks he's cool because he had fun doing it and it was all a dream. Oh, he's made a few bets with me, one being that if he put up a bet with me he could claim ten million dollars out of the amount of money he owned, and next I'm going to beat him to a pulp with one punch so he won't have to come back with his life-pros. Well, he already wants to quit.
The next morning he sees me and he's excited that I'm done. After a couple of drinks he asks what the mood is. I say that I enjoy the night and that I'm tired of my life.
I'm really starting to get worried about him. Maybe I'll see him in his old man's office and he'll bring me a new fat burrito, which he happily makes and the latter will be sweet and spicy too. I already think he might have decided on this but I don't have the time in my life. He takes me out for a walk through the park and he notices me sitting in a group of friends who are making a start. We are very different but I'm starting to think he's chosen a different girl. We're all sitting around in the woods and I'm staring at him.
He replies, "Here you are... Barry! Come come. We'll make fun of this loser just like you did!" I'm standing and I am staring down my whole body in shock when I see a female friend of mine, Dora, walk toward me. I smiled at her and began to feel my heart going out, which is why she looks so surprised when she sees me! I watched as Dora grabbed the sheild for the tip.

All morning, I do all the listening exercises. Slowly, I go back and look at the video feed.
Mostly, I look through the sea of character. Someone I've never seen before. Any that exist today. It doesn't matter who they are. It does. But only for a brief moment.
And I still find myself leaning against the lounge's starboard window. I can hear her talking. I can feel her, breathing.
She always brought me a cup of tea. It was slightly salty, but not bitter. I didn't do much else, she's always nice. But we've talked this morning, and she always managed to put herself through them, my love.
I've never felt so sad on a Saturday.
I just want to drift off, settle in in and find some quiet place. A place I can't leave. Where I can let go.
I wish she was here. I wish we could be together, together.
I don't know why she was acting so unusually. It never did feel comfortable in my book. But she was probably bored. More of an introvert than anything.
Her apartment is a six-story shell of what it used to be. Still, nobody misses it.
And her tits are lovely.
I want her to be happy. To feel safe. To find happiness, to laugh at the absurdity of life. To see everyone else's faces.
I want her to read the news. To laugh at all the dumb jokes.
I just want to drift off. Or I'm just wasting time.
And I feel like...
I'll just go out there and sleep for a while.

Stupefied, I sat still, hands on my hips. I was strapped down to a rocking chair, trying to find a strength to stand, but the straps pinned me down had to. A sense of panic swept across me, as I wondered what in the world I could do and what I might do next. I don't remember, but it felt like an eternity; an eternity outside the line of sight of anyone watching me. Moments like this, while uncaring, made me want to burst out of my slumber.
I didn't know what to do. I was an aristocrat at the time, and I had a family of four. I was well off to make ends meet in the town, but as soon as I heard about a village that didn't have money to support me for five years, I went on with my life. I walked, walked, walked, walked. I took up jobs, helped poor people, found work I didn't want to do, lived a happily ever after. I lived down to my luck, so I went home, just glad that I never took my own life.
Finally, I got home that night. I was drunk, and already reminded myself that by putting the plates out of my back we were in a better mood for a walk. That Saturday, my dream town, the home of two young women I thought I had possibly married was finally here. My first kiss, and I was spending the nights walking the outskirts of town. I was having a cigarette before home, so I finally ordered the stuff out of the pantry in the living room. I stood up and pushed the door open. There stood seven little girls and a sad, black-haired and petite young man, dressed in black and carrying a basket full of cash. I was already trying to take in the money, but the four of them refused to give me more. Before they could yell out in any way, I grabbed a chunk of gum from my pocket. There was something oddly familiar about it, but it was almost as if the two women in the basket knew I was there. They clutched it tight, and with a flourish they threw it out the window, passed by me, and out the next door.
Huddled in a corner, when I tried to cross the street, I was shocked to see the other girl walk in and give me a crooked smile. She opened the sack in her hand, and inside was a sack of crackers and a handful of money. I walked up to her and handed her the cash, and then glanced down, grabbing the crackers. She squealed in surprise, and without looking up, gave me the last bit of courage I felt. I grabbed her hood, and placed a bloody-smokey, scorched finger on the top of the cracker. It smelled, like burning marshmallows. I walked around the corner and looked down at the crackers in the bag. I saw only white, almost shimmery smoke rising from one of the crackers. I turned, and turned right. I heard footsteps behind me, and I saw the two of them rush me. I laid down, putting my head down, and did not wake up. I did not have a chance to check on the men who held me, but I swear that with that last, tiny puff of fire from the cracker, I could have been safe.
The next day, that's when the men came. A whole battalion of hardy men charged through the village, with what looks like scars across their faces. Some men wrestled with me as they ran past, with worn-out shirts and makeshift guns. I tried to run but never caught a break; they struck at me from multiple angles. The men slowly drove me over to the gate, and kicked at the men I hadn't touched in a while. I fainted, and was hauled to an asylum, where they locked me up until they learned of my family's condition. One of them, a woman, came to me and stitched my hands together. " You will be blessed, we are very proud of you, " she said. I answered: " I am only penniless, despite your honesty."

No one could figure it out. The reason I came this far to kill myself was because I loved the world. I was only the 19-year old. I wanted to be a small fry for the U.S. government, make a pass at it. Be in the top percentile. And college, where I studied medical science.
But whatever. I knew how to say the truth. I remembered being a loser and making my life hell. I realized that I could not help it. I wanted to escape. I wanted this as much as anything in this world. That would be the real reason why I was doomed to live.
It was the only way. I needed the help. You see, I was born in the middle of the dry winters. I had been in the middle of the blighted hillbilly forests, tearing souls of the northern tribes out and burning them for dirt and rocks. As time went on I grew to be more selective in my usage. The worst part was that I also became fascinated by the expanses of white.
What I saw in the summer sun was much worse. I felt like the whiteness in the air had become unbearable. It hit me so hard. I realized my insides were toxic. The only way to deal with it was to hold my breath as the air was blown in my direction. And then it was over. I was reborn into this world.
I had grown accustomed to death many times. But the alternative had always been simpler. A normal existence would offer me a chance to be someone else. A God like me. A King like one of the thousands of others at the U.N. could be at my mercy.
I have grown in the eyes of the world like a drug-lord. Having lived with the guilt and agony I craved I felt trapped inside the image of an idol. So I fought with my conscience. I fought to escape. I fought to get back in the heat of the moment. But I was unable to save myself.
For thousands of years, I was burned.
Every time I was burned I felt like the kind of person you would expect someone who lives solely in the warmth of the sun would look at you. The closest I ever got to immortality was when I was just a shell of a man. I was eventually deemed worthless for the world to have, but as soon as the power to preserve and rejuvenate human flesh finally collapsed around me I began to fade. Because if I had kept going without a fight, every living creature I ever loved would die in agony. The only way out would be to die in the long run.
I was starving. I felt like starvation. I wanted to die. I wanted to live. I tried to fight to the last light to let the light out. And it didn't end well.
It was next week. Just before the sun was to close in the evening.
And I was finally free of the darkness I had always known. I felt stronger. I felt safe. I knew I could save the world. But I have failed. I have failed both the people who lived and those who will never see it coming.
But I am back.
My vision is finally clear.

My dad has made me watch Monster Men, a show I watch every night on Tuesdays
my grandmother, mom and dad have all gotten off on drinking because once you say the word Monster you get a person into it
they teach me how to hunt and kill and how to hunt and how to hunt and what to hunt
everyones an uncle of mine who has gone out into the big woodlands, fighting people for big game
he makes me look like a skeleton when in reality my dad runs up to me and says'Come on, you don't have to do this shit'
I take a chunk out of my stomach and when I swallow it all I eat, I guess I did it for a little too long.
I think about what today will be and go through what it will be like. We have a room with 1 of these creatures that have been dug under me by a big tree and when my uncle. leaves for the door I'll be little this time around and when I get a little older I'm gon na get a whole hunting colony under me for the next 1 year or so.
My uncle. makes some weird noises and says'you are too mature for this' before his family eats everything that looks like a pile of fur and lets him run.
I clean up my uncle and when he gets back I'm ready. They don't even bathe anymore, they leave me for my time after their evening. We make our way to a clearing and get a map down and a flashlight. When we get there I'm about to say something when another beast swims in through the blinds and I land right down on my side.
The beast is very short, about an inch long, and eats what looks like a wolf. It swims through the dark and I see my uncle from a distance and he yells'get away from me!' That's when the horns come out. I swear to God that I don't even have a shotgun.
There are fifty creatures ( me included ) all covered in blood.
my uncle at the time thought that this was some kind of sick joke and blamed them for keeping me here, and the rest of them were just scared and made fun of me. I didn't get away with it. I'm the only one that can track down all the others that still stay. When I returned he was filled with laughter. He hated this part of the game and said'I had a mother and a father, they lived in each other's system and the system didn't matter to them because it was sacred to them'.
When I got home, I'm convinced that since my dad left I've done all this wrong and left him behind. I took the axe that he left me and sent it into the side of a house. My uncle chased after it and destroyed everything that looked like a campfire so the beast must have looked for it.
Now I'm afraid I'm going to die alone, I've got nothing, I can't get out of here, if I go back and kill these fucking monsters again, I'll have just as bad a time as I get back here.

As I walked into the music hall I was *so* surprised to see the guy on the stage. He stood at least five feet tall and was wearing a bright green t-shirt that read "YOU LOVE MONEY" ( Well it wasn't like it said anything about money. I guess I was a bit too late anyway ).
Anyway, to make things even more interesting I noticed he was looking at my bank account instead of mine. How the hell did that come into play? I'm sure he still owes me $ 100 for every dollar spent at last fucking turn, but this looks like a situation where he's already getting way more than a little cash in for every dollar spent.

The androgynous cats pretend to sing them, not really singing. They could know, all that they see, although they don't really understand it. Those who knew couldn't quite understand what was supposed to happen.
That did them no good, and they fought to keep away. Eventually they turned against one another, rising as one.
Some thought the underdogs would grow up and become the bad dogs. Others thought they would be masters of the light and darkness. Some thought they would come true to their abilities. And they were right.
All of them failed, all of them were overconfident in their own abilities. Everyone thought the cats would finally win. They thought they would rule the world. The defeat didn't hurt much.
The cats lived out their days in peace. But those who read through its songs said, "The vulgar narrator was one too many."

I've got thirty seconds before I wake up. A colleague says that the suicide, or per-paragraph emergency is "really bad for the company". Ok. Should I tell the boss? No. Can't. * Knock knock* What. I can do this. * Oh* What happens next? Is it Xanax? I can definitely tell it's Xanax. It's been late at night.
Okay, now the real question is, well, even a little bit later, can I even get out of this nightmare? Okay. Now, can I have a scientist's help on this project? Is that man Orgie? The bus is late. I remember it well. The driver picks up a fifty dollar bill in his hand. It's red, again. I can see the money in his hand, but I can't see the ID badge. At least I have two of them when I wake up. So can I ask the driver the weird little numbers that I'm catching on the ID? Hmm, maybe.

Ah yes! A VR world for us! There is everywhere! Everywhere. " I put on an Oculus Rift and feel... Myself. Oh how small! Surely I'd feel all my normal. Ah well, somewhere real... And I know for a fact that I should make a new body! I'm still in my sleep and don't want to cry for the others. Oh well... One day this can go on forever and all the other changes would be stopped! Besides, no one comes over for a while anyway, so the only way out is for me to test this one. I look around and... I see this world... People everywhere are eating. They're eating. I have to solve puzzles and do what seems like miles to solve them, but...
" Please... No I won't! I'm sorry. "
" No, thank you! It's okay! Okay now how about you... Close your eyes and feel yourself. * Please*. "
" Keep going! I want to be there for you. "
" Oh God please don't... Please!! PLEASE! Your father! My... God... I NEED HIM!! "

MINDIVIDENCE
"Chariots are an essential part of life! They absolutely shield us from harm, they bar food from entering our intestines, they prevent monsters from coming in, and most importantly they stop evil! This is what we all strive for! What we must do is have enough faith in all to beat any evil beneath us!
So, isn't that about all? Am I praying for goodness in this world? Is that about my ignorance of this world? No, no it is not! All I have done for Christ's sake is help a miserable Lucifer who feels guilty. He wants everyone to feel guilty! Give each other a little piece of that fact that we are wrong!
But what he hates most? We've helped with education and science here on Earth, we've done everything possible to improve it! Our headmasters even tried! I really did! I've been to every corner of the globe and brought you each with me. And what I told you is true! You have a body to defeat the terrible monsters! This is my body of faith!
Whose beef comes first and the lamb later? Everyone is supposed to listen to that! Because good thing everyone wants to see a lamb because if I don't have it, I am wrong!
So yes! They want you to see Christ through the eyes of your Gods! Make them happy! Teach them of the Lord! Have them live up to the word of His perfect words! So they will have the edge, with no fear of prejudice, while they can have fun! Oh, and they will feel more better every day!
Okay, it may seem a bit crazy, but look what we found! Anything you wish for as well! Wow! Great! Now how about you be happy for Christ to set the end of suffering just a little bit before the end of eternity? Then there is paradise, you ever be a believer? Then you are denied the need for evil... Oh how we've missed that. Life will be much, much better to be alive!
Look what your beautiful body will become! They will never know love like you, and even when they do it will always be with you. No more hunger, no more sin or anger, you have it! Oh, you will be forgiven!
Well, it's just as beautiful as they found!

When I was young, i always considered myself a "well developed, intelligent, loving, philosophical man. But when I got older, there was always the constant requirement that i do this in the middle of a public and not in a public with too many people walking past in my direction. When my mom passed away at the age of 30, I had a lot of things weighing on my mind, and I had to be there for her in order to protect her.
So I moved to Los Angeles, and got into business as an adviser and trader.
When I met Kathy, she said she was a bit of a putty. That seemed to be what led to our first talk.
" I noticed your twenty-something desk job the other day, so I decided to hit'em hard, and after putting a few other things in my way, I kinda got it going. "
" But Kathy, you've got to click it. "
" You don't have to, " Kathy started. " It just wouldn't get any easier. "
That comment didn't really satisfy me at first. But eventually I got a chance to see what Kathy really was.
And here I was, in the middle of a busy city, trying to fill in the blanks, which was to say " Click Me". But I couldn't. After a minute of distraction, and thanks to Kathy's incredible choice of words, I had decided to press the button. " Click Me," my mind began to say. And after a few seconds, words were typed on the button.
I thought that was pretty funny, maybe you should read a Buzzfeed story or something from 25 years ago? I also thought that it was pretty idiotic to have to type this on the same screen as a Buzzfeed story!
Anyway, I've finished typing this. I hope you're reading this now. Thanks for reading.
( I forgot to mention that **click** was my combination of the last word I typed and the most accurate ( and strange ) variation of the last words I'd typed into the text boxes )

I've had a lot of work today, and I thought I'd share a little more.
I was sitting on the couch watching... Jesus?
Yeah, right. Yeah, there was this noise coming from my house.
Hmph. And it was all waking up.
But I just did it, didn't I?
Oh yes. Yeah, I did. Nothing unpleasant.
And I was crying.
Nothing unpleasant. But I had to confess something.
I know what you're thinking, but a world so big and so dark, it was a bad idea to break the news to everyone but me.
What's the problem with me?
Well, everyone in my position is more or less alone.
Fools!
Not after all these years.
Wow.
Seriously though. It's terrifying.
See, I got this idea from watching movies... how could there be so much tragedy in the chaos?
It was a lot like a car crash, and it was getting pretty hard to imagine.
I suppose I could try and pass it on for you, but for a while, it just made me watch TV.
Oh great. That might help you on your next one.
Odd.
Hmm.
The craft that got me on it. The spaceship built there...
... the one you brought down?
Yes.
And from there, it's just... hmmm...
Okay. The body.
That really was something to behold.
I can't really bring myself to believe it.
If I imagine the outside world.
People are very much like us, and they've had family too.
Moral is...
Unlike us.
I guess that makes sense...
So where would they be after that? The land?
Well, they're rather interesting.
The girls could be the girls...
... the people too?
The parents too...
Well, I guess.
Sure.
I suppose I can imagine a better view.
Or maybe it wouldn't have to be so bleak.
Lately, though, I've been getting my beliefs in a bit more positive directions.
Making sure to uphold the order. And getting back on track, we might even have some semblance of civility in the process.
Still, it is so great.
I still don't know how long I can last before we leave... hopefully soon enough.
( No, I'm starting too early, and I might have to go later for the break to go ).

“ Alright folks, watch this. You're trying to see right through me. ”
I leaped and fell like a child through a bottle of water. It wasn't long before I could feel the empty space around me before my eyes closed shut.
“ Wha -- “ I spoke. I had to hold down the breath. I nearly choked. The nurse ushered me to my seat.
“ Whoa. Don't make this hard on yourself. Say ‘ Mr. Lawden, ’ and take a seat. I always told everyone that public service announcements do that. In fact, uh -- ”
“ Will -- “ The doctor tried to pull something off my face. I peered at him expectantly. What's that? That's cake.
“ Business will be over in a few minutes. " A young woman told me sternly.
He looked up. “ Your lungs hurt. And you can ’ t breathe. ”
“ Sorry doctor. The doctors are making a heart attack on the way in. But everybody really has to relax, or else the situation will get out of hand. ”
My eyes snapped open and I couldn't believe my eyes. The nurse was still behind me, looking down with her elbows on the pillow.
“ Can someone please stand up, they're already unconscious. Please follow me. ”
I pulled myself up and looked down into the dark room. Oh god, there was a girl here.
She had a weak face. I don ’ t think her parents were lying. Was it the way they talked about her, or just sheer white skin? Was she really that difficult to understand?
“ Stay. ” The nurse said coldly. She rushed me to the bed. I attempted to get up but we were bound. “ Jesus. ”
The sweet pillow beneath my chin wasn't helping matters.
I felt an urge to let go. I fell through her arms and she sat up. “ Now! Get out. Now. ”
I jumped. I was looking straight at the nurse.
“ You don't belong here! ” She called out. “ Help me. ”
I almost screamed as the doctor and the nurses patted my back. I didn't care. The medics would take me. I'd save my job.
But that was not what they were after, they weren't giving me in.
They didn't have a good reason. My family wouldn't survive. I couldn't speak. No one else did. I sighed. “ Alright kids. I ’ m out. Thanks again for doing what I ’ m doing. Good night."

I knew we'd end this without causing as much mayhem as we thought it would, and who knows, perhaps we'd be better off without each other.
We were raised in a traditional household, with simple, loving children from the next best thing on earth. One day, right after we left a little to worry about, we were sent back to the house. Everyone had to be in our best. No one else was on this one good night's world. I remember the other families laughing, the siblings happy, the joy that made them feel normal again. However, that is not where I am. It was like magic: when you are only blinded by darkness, you are able to see the worlds beyond the dark.
I heard a knock on the door from the other room. A beautiful woman sat down on the couch by my side, and with a sigh said, "What is the matter Grace? I have a problem. "
I looked around the room and found that I had not seen anybody else outside of the room.
" Why are you doing this, Grace? " My mom asked.
" I don't know, I should leave right now. " I replied.
" I'm going to go to bed first okay? " her parents teased.
" You can still sleep and be with me. " I told them.
" What do you mean? I'm being in a bad mood, so I'm going to leave before I leave. "
" I need help with this "
I decided to just focus on those in the room and we talked and tried to figure out how to move forward.
" Well, that was the hardest thing we could do, Grace. I don't think I'm able to stay in here anymore." I said, trying to convince her not to ask questions, as soon as I got up.
" I don't know if we should stay here or stay together. I'm too old for that. " I thought about it and continued to talk.
We continued to talk about our routine for hours that night. I had nothing but the same topic at this point, how old would it be before we split the atom? Just from my little head, we were in a pretty good position with the chances that our children would also live the same lives as I, that I would not be among them forever. I closed my eyes for a long time, I actually had it coming, the feeling of someone being right for me to feel that way was something that was going to eventually get rid of itself when they finally got rid of everyone. I tried to open my eyes again, but all I saw was a warm sweet glow in front of me, the most beautiful glow I have ever experienced. I decided to keep working on everything at once.
After a while, all I could see was a calm ocean of light. Somehow that light had finally turned into something beautiful, like a million beautiful stars. I could see the surface and oceans and rivers and the stars above me that I recognized from school. As far as I could tell, the world was my home. All that I had known about it was that it was my own world and that I was going to find my soulmate soon, with only another life for me.
And at the same time, the world was black and white and filled with death and mystery.
I know, I know.

"Morsk, we must escape! " My commander warned.
I knew that he knew and it made me nervous. We are those *people. * Things that hide behind natural barriers. Then, I saw that he would give us permission to exit a common world with only a few simple rules:
1. We are under normal order. No signs of enemy territory.
2. We don't use heavy metal, and are fully armed with no less than 4 M1 Garand-Type ".45 aimed.
3. Outside active warfare is possible. You can travel by vehicle of choice.
4. We don't need any weapons we have no capacity for.
All of these clearly marked instructions, I heard, but very specific instructions. I continued with my research and tactics of gaining those orders. I was alone on this map once. For someone so simple and given such a directive, it made absolutely no sense. Not without power. I searched for use and found the best ways to use it for my " employers " ( they weren't sure how so many more came across the radar then we were used to ). With the information I gathered so far, they were my only hope at stopping something or something big.
They see us, I heard them, not *my*. I was alone on this map. I was alone, holding a gun to one's head. I was alone on this map with a Panzer standing by my side. I was alone. I held the gun to one's head. It was unlike any other I have ever done. It was ‘ cold and unfriendly ’ and I knew it. It was like watching her face as she feared me, I knew she feared my one true enemy. She knew this. I became scared. I was scared of being put in some sort of dangerous situation. I needed to know for sure that I could use my weapon. I needed to know what I could do to make it work.
*We are the enemies of the world. Today we need to escape from this miserable fight. We have gained the upper hand. Our future is ours. *

Growing up it wasn't difficult, I told him, it was paradise. I mean, I couldn't even turn a frown on my parents' faces when I looked my best friend in the eye when we were in kindergarten. But the fact of the matter is... I am hungry, right? Sure I could go and have a hot chocolate bar, but for the last couple of weeks? How come I can't seem to get any sweeter?
Yep, I'm out of luck this time. I'm stuck at the train station, messing around by just paining myself for comfort. I'm about halfway across, so here I am, stuck on the platform, with 2 people off their asses. ( I am *literally* going to poop on them, they've already gotten lung cancer! ) I should write this down, hope the next train isn't the last one you see.
"Great trip! " I cry, " Let's go!"
No. Fuck.
Fuck it. I'll catch the train instead. I *need* to catch the train.

I coughed. The process had been surprisingly repetitive and using my blood quite extensively, you are not a health official!
I wanted to just try out the juice. You can not simply mix water with ice, but the bloodline is not defined by its strength of blood. I heard someone telling me they made a gum bubble drink, so I simply mixed an orange juice with the gel in order to increase strength. As for strength, as far as I remember, I was really cautious. You may need a lot to make this work! Might want to have a look at the clock on your bedside table, 40 seconds to go.
"Give me your drink! " I heard one female voice that sounded like a woman in a dress, but I couldn't tell which side it was, because it seemed too bright. " I knew you would drink it before but, it's still a little medicine. Thank you for your cooperation. "
I quickly packed my backpack and went to the bathroom and the glass on the sink. I put it under the sink by myself, and washed the drain.
" Sir! Thank you! " I yelled, and when I flushed a couple of times, I got the pool to a nice clean consistency. I threw a handful of my wet body hair in the tub, and ran back to the doctor.
After a few hours of examination, the doctor announced that my bloodline wasn't defined by strength. He looked at the bottle on the counter, and apparently found that it had a negative correlation to strength, as they tested only two or three fish-like limbs and a foot.
" There is nothing wrong with these, " the doctor reassured me, and I noticed that my blood was just trying to smooth off. I looked at the tub again to readjust, and there was still some blood on the floor. The doctor picked up the phone and said that he would call me later when it was explained to me how important my bloodline is.
I picked up the call and scrawled a note. " I have a question, sir."

"I am told we should all live in peace, for that might mean on the other side of the planet from us another planetary system is landing. " Explained Bin Laden to his audience with measured excitement.
" The east side is open and plentiful, it may be the only winter wonderland in the whole of the solar system! Just take a look at that new satellite! Can you believe that! " snorted a thought giving Bin Laden pause.
" The west side is an oil rich planet! How could anybody say that to a dear friend and teacher teaching the most beautiful planet of all time! An entire planet now will be constructed around the ship at the southern hemisphere! " Explained Bin Laden nervously as they inspected the satellite nearby. The kids looked around nervously only feeling a slight comfort as they found the perfect place to land and enter their new planet.
Before long the students were waking from their excitement, their teacher was devising a perfect plan to take the ship to their new planet. Before heading out to finish his chores they were instructed to enter the tower and to turn off the rest of the massive aural televisions.
" The fact that this is was the only way to land for humanity, and that only Eris can land at our new planet, it certainly is not a pleasant sight to look at." Said the class. Everyone got quiet. After a few moments they turned off the televisions leaving them alone in the room watching the hundreds of children outside with excited looks on their faces. Their alien abductors had finally captured them. They would not know the lives that awaited them.

"He had to cross the woods, it had to do something. " Death tore away the shadowy figure of Man, swinging his severed head as if to prod him with the stone hilt. His hand fell limp around the hilt of Death, stopping in its path.
" And so it came. " Man's back swung forward with a crack, head down and unblinking, before falling back into the space between them.
" I'm sorry. But I have to be. " Death was now kneeling next to the man's prone form. The man's expression softened as he shook his head sadly. " You're dead. "
" I don't know what happened, I just think you're a funny man. " Death agreed with an easy smile. " Perhaps you hate me, but it did the rest of the lecherous shits. I didn't want to kill you. "
" You didn't. " The man spat. " Nothing happens to me after a while. " He shook his head again. " I have a sick family. They should care for you. "
" I hate them, not anymore. I'm not your husband. " The man's screams continued to ebb out of his throat.
" Those sons, the ones who loved him, no longer want to hear about me. " The man stammered, " They don't even love me anymore. "
Death's eyes drifted over to the corpse for another hit. He grabbed the man's neck. The man's eyes locked with his own. Something hooked down across his face, injecting the deathly smell of sterility into his nose.
" They'll come for you when you cry. " Death pointed at the corpse.
" They'll. " The man's pain was now rising in intensity. " And it's not for my own good. "
Death began again, this time to finish the man off with no qualms. " You've loved me all my life. You're dead. You're even dead. "
" Because I'm dead? "
" Yes. You're dead. You've no blood. " The man's skin glistened in Death's mouth.
" You have a face, Death. "
" I get it. "
" You're dead."

"Stop it, baby " His disciple stated, dragging a guitar off her desk while having the bowl of blood fly to her thighs, " It's a slice and thither "
" No, I don't understand what you're saying. " Lennon continued
Lennon had stayed silent for several minutes now before lighting up the cigarette she was trying to light as she continued to focus on her book's cover. The only sound was the rolling of her bookbag against the floor as she walked out the door.
Randy was not impressed and kicked away the book, still with a full marijuana hangover from last night.
Jesus gave a small sigh and began on his way with a high.

Dear Diary,
Yesterday I saw a boat on the edge of the river. As this boat was sinking one of the drunken men near the front of the boat did a amazing turn. I was leaning on the edge and my arms rolled out of my head as the boat sunk deeper.
I had already panicked and fell over the edge trying to watch the boat pull up. Immediately my legs had curled around me, causing me to almost pick myself off of the ledge. As the boat pulled into the dock my legs curled around my body and I fell over the edge. It was completely dark and the night sky was clear. I looked up to see a boat sail into the water towards the sound of voices and the men next to me. I looked at them and suddenly a rope came around my neck and I screamed. I jumped off of the boat screaming and running as quickly as I could.
I woke up in my room, my bed making a hideous sound that I could only hear. As I put on my clothes and made myself comfortable, the lady next to me got out her clothes in front of me. As she walked towards me she noticed that my clothes were dirty. She tried to put them on, but to no avail. She dragged me in front of my bed and said, "We need to talk. Your ankle is failing your ankle, your spine is barely functional and your stomach is rotting. If you don't jump soon we won't survive to see you alive". I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I sobbed and tried to get up in the kitchen, where the lady had said that if you didn't jump soon you wouldn't survive. She continued her rant as I tried to get up but I couldn't. She pushed me in front of the stairs. She slammed the door, forcing me down and giving her the world all the attention that I ever needed. She stormed out of the room leaving me behind in the dark.
Oh dear Diary!
If you liked this story, please read on. I'm sorry it was hard, this is my first WP and I'm barely on mobile.

The Black Sentinel was finally spotted. The Alpha, my brothers, fell as an infant into the storm. Defeated and failing at the fight against the Super Terror, the Black Sentinel hit the ground and drowned out the chaos and rage of the world around it. Not all was lost, though. Those who fled the desolate homeworld whose workers had destroyed the civilization fled, like the beautiful young children they had been, desperately seeking to find their way back home.
I joined the Mothership as an engineer. I had lead my crew and our ship for a few weeks, long enough to build an education program. While still in training, I had grown curious about the massive metal structure that had formed so clearly in the last millennia and returned on my ship. The blueprints and readings told me that the structure was perhaps 1500 feet tall. Along with such activity, the world had moved across the plains and mountain ranges, developed into a massive, iron, and steel empire, and slowly became the site of a second great battle.
I was once one of the Advance Controllers and had trained, perhaps, a thousand times before landing on the Galaxies. For as long as anyone could remember, we'd faced innumerable threats and did so based on our best technologies. Countless races of races, from Titans to the Sabre, had come to our aid and at last we had achieved victory. It was at this moment, when we became aware of the presence of a massive weapon aboard our spacecraft, that I joined my crew. Through my many studies on war, I had designed weapons that could hold a fuse greater than our light years. The plan was simple: a great mast had to descend through the stars to strike down an advanced, armored form of the Surtatri-class Light Armor that was a Weapon of Mass Destruction, theoretically rendering them obsolete by removing the energy source and energy source from our weapons. The result would be a secondary missile launcher where both the missile and its intended target would pass over it, making it essentially invisible to the naked eye. I received the coordinates of the missile that struck.
The intercept was successful. Using the MSS-15 in a control room, I set off the sample to set the weapon to detonate. The missile, which had a lower peak and a lower reconnaiser point than any other I have ever designed, rocketed towards the Surtatri's ship and struck for a firing zone. I was perfectly safe.
The shield shields on the MSS-15 struggled to deploy because the debris had recently entered the atmosphere so quickly. I didn't bother giving them any warning or warning not to charge. I primed the weapons. I stood up as the doors closed behind me. Before heading out, I was suddenly blinded by the beams of heat and vibrations of impact. Our ship was incinerated, and the atmospheric shield was pulled up, so I could exit from my command ship.
As I exited the control room, and out through the megascope light, a figure stood before me. This is not how I envisioned the Humans -- we were the worst thing that could have happened to the Humans. It's structure was simple and not like a natural structure, so we were struck with shock as it manifested itself. A magnificent essence in the form of a fission bolt with a small blood red fuel cell was attached to the end. We were pretty baffled, but it explained to us, that these entities were holding its essence right under the surface. After we had come to our senses and realized it was dying, the alien ceased to exist. We were left with the knowledge that the rest of our race was also dead and to the outside world.
Although I know we were all still in shock when I awoke with the radiation in the air, I wasn't surprised that I was also hearing strange sounds. It seemed as though the husk that was once called the Alien began to grow warm, and seemed to have some response to the noise that was making me feel uneasy.
"Wow. " I whispered to myself.
The radiated feeling turned to a mild cold, which slowly turned to a cold, which turned to a brisk, and a slight ache as the radiating thing, what looked like what I assumed to be more... human, started to evaporate off of me.
" Looks like a guy in a van."

"No " I say calmly " No it won't. "
The big one is sitting there, the one eyed jack-a-lantern child. He stares at me as if I'm some sort of *clone* in his fabled boo-boo's head. He laughs maniacally and I guess it's someone's laugh that gets laughs out of me.
" Haha..just the way you were a little lark.." I say, finally breaking the tension.
The big one smiles, and the one eyed jack-a-lantern smiles. The one eye is basically me, but also the world inside of me. It's a complex life, it's filled with imbeciles, but it's not like anyone can afford such an addiction.
I close my eyes and try to absorb their body part, just to drown out the laughing. I exhale and hope that it's their body part. I will listen in on the conversation, but I can't imagine a conversation I'd choose to hear would bring me laughs as my body part grows and grows.
They don't laugh as much as I do...
There's an explosion of color and life inside them.
From that moment on I lost a part of the world and everything went into something else. My eyes were replaced with small pieces of the world now scattered about. Only me? Was it them that melted?
The energy died for a moment, but in the end they grew back. I can feel it in my bones. The happiest part of my body is gone and I am inside this horrible place again.
The giant one stares at me... and says to me, in a deep, tender voice, " Forget the hurt ".
I look up and find myself sitting in a small room of bones. The inside of one seems to be wrapped around one another. The other bones seem to be torn apart by the massive explosions. One eye crushes my skin, the other one shards my nose.
They will never hurt me again.

Mother said of his daughter, April 2nd, 1992: "Little Red, how I love you". That was the last two days I saw her.
When I had stopped taking their help, I didn't even know I was home. It was my house with my family, in my hometown, where none of them could get away.
The next three days were worse. Yes, it was worse. Because it was a sunny day, but raining. But Marie, I swear, isn't well enough to play computer.
Today, I stood in her room. Again. The happiness I felt, minus the screams. She was there as I stood there, staring at my reflection in the mirror. I wanted to feel more than the difference between my red hot fingers and those of my mother.
Marie smiled as I stood beside the mirror.
Mother continued, "When I was little, I loved you. You promised. You showed me the joy of life. And with that I couldn't take it away. But the day your love is gone, and when the chance comes, I'll never know anymore - how could you take it away?"

You know, for people like me, the rule was that what's beneath the surface doesn't turn green or brown. And that's kind of what happened to me. Of course the water can be dangerous though, so I enjoy the company and the generosity of nature.
I first saw a hole at night, just big enough to be threatened by a vermin. I slowly figured that there might be others like it. We would discover where we grew up and, with a few attacks, we would disappear. It seemed that soon, when we used to live in the water and the other towns were isolated in different areas, we would be discovered. When that happened, when things became more difficult to navigate, we would hide in the caves, by what could only be referred to as "the caves ", of unknown origin.
And so I had a basic knowledge of caves I had not known my entire life. What I found there, however, was something that was rather strange. There had been bits of land that were covered with large, cold pools that flowed into the sky, that were hidden underneath the now transparent cracks in the earth in a way that made it impossible to hunt and detect these creatures. These pools, however, seemed to be covering more water than the more peaceful pools of water around us, and, in the same way, the pools where always large.
I soon realized that these pools were part of a thick layer of solid silicate. Even in the murky sludge, they were faintly visible. I saw with my own eyes, as the first wave washed into the final trace of color that we once knew. This was finally all said and done. In those years, I found the name of those lava pools. The names of life with other people around us and others. With this discovery, things grew slowly and I was the first to say what I needed to say.
" We are many and mighty people, and I will be the last one. Now that we have found you, I hope you understand that it is with this certainty that all things turn."
And so I was given the world over. And as the knowledge of my ancient root system spread throughout my grandmothers land, and slowly ran a full circle around us, I knew that I was one step away from becoming the last living thing to know nature.

*The pod is silent... but it's transparent. * I'm not sure what bothers me so much. I feel being naked in space without a blanket. I sense flight. In its place, I feel nothing. Then, after what seems like an eternity, the pod opens and beyond. * The creature is clothed in shining metal. Its tentacles thin in its radiance. * * I am entranced. * * Shaking, I slowly clap my arms. * * Looking behind me is glowing a blue. * I do the only thing I can, turn. The thing looks at me, confused. I click a button and wave my appendages to extend my arm, then a monitor is appearing... oh no... I'm imagining creatures, absolutely inhuman, but I have the two greatest suitors to date: Donald Trump and Donald Trump. *

At the time, I was really scared. Of course I was. I'd had enough of the unfairness of the world, and now was the moment. I was going to have to deal with it. These were a load of unsavory "assholes " trying to divide humanity. Unlike some, these people don't hold animosity towards others. They're just simple people, with nothing to their name.
But I wasn't. I had wanted to fight back, so I started doing it. A few weeks into this onslaught, we were both in a situation. With nothing to do, we barely managed to keep ourselves alive. For years, we had tried to save ourselves, but this was the only real life solution. We were helpless, but I had to be saved. I had no choice but to follow.
I unlocked my apartment door, pulled my first kevlar rifle, and began my incantation. " FIRE " was my first and only command. More of the same thing went through my mind, unbeknownst to me, before I could start to shoot. I turned to look out the windows, hoping for the same.
I looked in the window, screaming, and saw the fires of two separate groups of anarchists burning. I stood up. I shot myself in the side.
I was met with another look of fear and confusion, a look of pure terror on the faces of all those still trying to stand, to stand.
The crowd was swarming with angry, angry people. They all knew what was coming, and they were afraid. The sound of what was to come was something which would leave you with a terrible sensation in your stomach.
I walked out onto my balcony, letting out my final shot as I waited for something to happen.
It was at that moment, that I felt something within me that I will never forget, any moment. Then the stillness of the night overtook me. I opened my eyes, and saw nothing. I heard an earth quake and saw dark smoke billowing out of the ground. Then I looked back to the viewing window, where I saw something. Then I knew what was coming. There were people, right below me. One of them was one of the anarchists, pointing a gun to the one who had fired his gun. I sat down next to him, to join him.
They looked me straight in the eyes, the same way they had when they faced the Mafia on Aldo alongside Adolf Hitler. I smiled at them, knowing what this meant. They would join us. To take us down, all in one big battle. This was how we would fight back, with all the control of government and terror in our veins. I kneeled down and looked at my beautiful fiance. " I know " I said. " I know."

Jesus, they're tearing up the villagers. They think they finally got through the siege of capital, killing a lot of people but c'mon man, the speeches are great. The peasantry gave us a small dose of those ketchup oatmeal cakes called'Sesame Seed Gum' because we're the bad kids who have no money to eat ( they go hungry at this point because they knew this going on )
Oh, how the peasants used to pray for tax dollars - a long history of oppression, the peasants' dark gods, the 7 great evils that ravaged earth a hundred generations ago. They used to kill our heroes and make us watch as the greedy rich decided to take our money and enslave us so they could use us again.
Yuge'lreed lookin' Christians and Muslims turned little red faces up and down and took our money for their astral chariot rides and the whole thing was just show, no'runs of the mill. Big organs and veal where only for priests to pray for whenever the justice gets bad so they can drown. I know that they truly didn't help, that someone took a twisted lust for paradise but as for their people it looks worse that their lofty pre-med university where they have an amazing tutor and wrote 2-5 books. A Catholic college where they still have the family tradition they always do. Remember when, how I said, the bullies would try to bully you? Well the bullies have mocked you! You're a bit confused though, because you're wearing a high kilt. Right now, you look like you're going to prison once you marry your wife but I heard they had a group for you. More nuns and martial arts institutes would be pleased to speak with you when you're free, right?
The Pope comes in and says, "Mr Christian, is anybody able to jump? " I yell but it turns out I have a real kilt. " No, Mr Christian, " he says " please don't jump, I'm a man who told the people and everyone I had helped for them the truth." Then the children and the parents and the church go and he says, okay I know that you're grounded, no longer will you suffer anymore, your spot is right for you now on a sled. The child cries and runs away crying with mom and dad.
Yeah man, I love that kilt, I don't get what they said when they replaced us with'The Enlightened' but if I leave this world then all those damn killers will learn!

They walk through the hallway, hopefully feeling like the guest is there at some point. Perhaps they will think twice about leaving now.
He walks past them silently as she sits on a shelf in the darkest corner of the closet. She turned almost blind in the second half of the hallway when the first cried out into the wet darkness behind her. Both stared with surprise and confusion.
A text message blaring out in such urgency that if he had picked up the time off, he would have missed her like the day it was delivered. The second wouldn't make sense.
"Have you guys called Sofia yet? I'll be right out. I have plenty of time, see you tomorrow. My parents have noticed that we've lost our bedroom downstairs. " The first of these moms need me after seeing that I have more dogs than he is to fit inside this monster. She was half of them and these two were dead beyond belief.
" Dammit, " he says, " this is my room, too. " The car couldn't drive on the busy streets without me.
" Hmm, I guess I'll see if Dad will like to help me find where they put the monsters, but I doubt he is trying anything. " The dad doesn't like taking responsibility for this infatuation. He found his foot on one of the giants before the trunks fell apart.
They nod towards their room while he turns to their bedroom window. The sky glows as the monster moves towards the horizon.
" I am sorry for the sudden onset of hunger. I will take care of you tomorrow. After tonight, you may forget this. I hope this is worth it, since this is my room, too. " There is a faint smirk on his lips as he slips another bottle of liquor into the bottom drawer.
" On a better note, Sofia will be back so you can stay while we sort this out," he says, taking another long drag from a cigarette and tapping the spot on the shelf.

I left my master a tea, coffee, freshly brewed beer, and a piece of parchment. At least I hadn't seen my master like this. An ancient and non-familiar voice came through the letterbox. I couldn't place it.
“ The King has seen you. ” He spoke with an authority he never used to possess.
I turned around and pulled out an old patent from a worn briefcase. A blondish blonde with the same face as mine, she was tall but the outfit was too much for me to recognize. She didn't have much in her body, but her voice, the accent, was all I knew. She appeared to have aged about her youth, but the piece of parchment said something else.
“ Bring me all this information. You have proven yourself. Every time you ride with the King, you are shown his most unique feats. ” I was confused. He seemed to know my secret.
“ Where are you headed? ” He gestured with a toothy grin.
“ The Barrow District of New York. ” I said. The king instantly adjusted his face with a smile. The energy contained within was infectious.
“ What is it? ” He paused in response.
“ Are you... ” I started, but he interrupted me. “ My... grandfather? ”
“ You know the answer? ”
“ Yes. ” The king said, looking down at the parchment with intense curiosity. “ The one I was saying. That was exactly the letter I needed. I just needed to know what your personal and company found. ”
He raised a hand to his mouth. “ Explain this to the King. ” He asked, beginning to look confused. “ What are you? ”
“ King Ashmir. ” I said with my arms wrapped around my chest. It was something I only took as an option, for free, but King Ashmir was a hard of hearing place. It was also where he had brought back his Grandfather, since they both worked as security guards on the street.
“ What is this? ” He asked.
“ The courier. ” I said. He suddenly looked at me, a twinge of fear shooting through his features. I couldn't stop it. I couldn't imagine how he could get this place and the money he offered so quickly. No amount of information could keep him from unleashing this powerful force upon us. “ Do you have anything to share with me? ”
“ Yes. ” I said with the most confusing smile, which was encouraging. “ Am I new to this? ” I asked, pointing to the parchment.
“ No. ” King Ashmir replied, feeling defeated. “ But I wanted to be seen. ”
“ Go, make sure you bring the document to him. You don't want any suspicion. It should be sent to him as soon as possible. ” The king left me, using the other room from home.
*Really? * I thought. “ What's in this? This is all a big joke? I'm not trying to overthrow the kingdom. I was just trying to get back home. *

Yesterday, he'd been able to evade almost every explanation I had for why he'd left; with no explanation.
But he'd managed to find a job, apartment, over 20 miles out, which with some desperate calculations came to be him simply standing above a seemingly dead man's leg.
I'd noticed this when one of my old associates at the job party sneaked into my office.
All of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, he looked down at me in the confined space I'd kept my human friend in.
We'd signed up for random jobs, from construction to bridge construction, from calculating his secret weapons to how far he'd run his country.
"I need that information! "
He grabbed my arm and kicked it. I looked down at him.
" Go away, go away, go away. "
I jumped up in my seat and realized it wasn't possible.
" I don't have time for this, " I said.
" No! I can't leave, " he responded.
My eyes widened.
" YOU SAVED MY MAN SO I COULD INDEED YOU!"

I remember the first time I saw her. I was a freshman but I had never actually been here before. What I saw was pretty stunning. The closet stood out. I immediately thought I had found my perfect ex. She was exactly the type of woman that meows at me with all her free will and drool like it's my birthday. So, I told her, "Yes? " She looked like she had really slept in.
She looked around the room and in front of her wardrobe, to some part of her brain that insisted she looked like a fox or a cat, she had the weirdest look of crows and stars, like her skin was a mix of duck. I decide it was weird that she could see me and be like this and she just looked at me and said, " You're so beautiful! We can see you there "
She giggled and then she looked at me and said, " Do you need anything?"

"Tomatoes today ain't pretty. "
" I know. Let's get something *good* made. I got my camp while you guys are making it! "
Tomas had known Carl since he was six.
" No, " he began, " I don't know what I'm going to do without Tomatoes. "
Carl the Proctor went on about how his grandmother had outgrown tomatoes in the 1800's and he didn't know how to help anybody. That was 20 years ago. He was twenty five now and he was tired of being called a douchebag.
" No, I'm not going to ask Tomatoes, " he repeated, " just tell me where to get me Tomatoes. "
" Is it ok if I cook a pot of bean soup instead of Tomatoes, " asked Tomas, eager to finish his sentence.
" Sure? I won't ask Tomatoes, " he answered, his cheeks flush with embarrassment.
" Look, I don't need a pot of beans anymore, " asked Carl, " just use my tools. We can roast tomatoes, potatoes, and spinach all day long without damaging the seeds. "
" Ok, I can't, " thought Tomas, " you can change the recipe, just give me Tomatoes instead. This can't be too hard! "
Carl laughed, " Thanks, " he said, thinking to himself. " We're going to have beans and tomatoes, and beans and vegetables at supper."

The devil asked in a monotonous fashion where his father went to school. " Well, dad moved to San Franciscan, " I said.
" So why can't you go to any schools in town? " said the devil.
" Well, I'm a lowly priest. " I replied in my soothing calm voice.
" Well, you haven't seen your parents, " said the devil.
" I have, " I replied.
" Actually, you're the son of a doctor. You're also an alcoholic. "
The devil bowed deeply in regard to this.
" Well, it's not a problem. It's just that... your parents wouldn't afford to. "
" Oh, but what do you mean... don't go to schools, then? "
" Well, that's... real news, " I said.
" What news? "
" What matters is that I'm depressed. I don't have a family. I don't have a girlfriend. I don't have friends. And oh, and no, if I hate them so much that I hate myself because of it... "
" Even the Christians are a little tired of your monologue, " said the devil.
" Of course I hate myself, " I said.
" So you're really depressed? "
" Yes. But I'm a little disappointed in you, " said the devil.
" But... " I continued. " The other day, my parents yelled at me. They told me not to yell at my parents. The teacher refused. No one else could just tell me to be quiet. If I didn't tell them that my parents were dying, I might have them murdered. Maybe I could be saved. "
" Just wait, I had a very sudden urge to do something! I wanted to say hi to... my father, " said the devil.
" But... " I continued. " When my father came in to visit, and he told me my parents were dying, I wish I didn't have been so religious. Because... I had to do something to console them. I wish I had... " I gulped, " done something. "
The devil's scowl made it difficult for me to respond.
" You said that you loved your fathers father, " I said.
" Then I thought,'Maybe I should say something more, so I can make his parents better. But instead I just met this woman.' Oh, you don't care about your father, do you? Your father hates you. So- " I stopped mid sentence. " So maybe you should talk to my mother, then? "
" W-Well, my mother is going to be much better for herself. "
" But... she said, " I interrupted. " She doesn't like me. I have money. And my father hates me. So I... I wish I never had to talk to her, " I said.
The devil's scowl got worse.
" I will tell you exactly why you should talk to my mother, " said the devil.
" Oh, honey, I'll put it mildly. It was. " I replied.
" Oh. Did you miss me? I'm so, so sorry. "
The devil stared at my face and sighed. He wasn't angry at me though, and I was just so hopeful that I didn't ruin my hope.
" I'm sorry, " said the devil. " What do you want? "
" Please, don't be a burden," I said.

When he got out, he asked me. " Why? Why me? "
His son spoke, interrupting me. " You have never killed anyone for money, " he said. " Nobody knows what you did. They have these stories. Some say it is a big deal but they think people don't know how you did it because they'll never believe it. Some say it is a curse or some thing bigger than us and they want us to believe it or we don't deserve it. " I smile and shut the blinds on the sofa. " Who do they care? You know the story. You put it on a TV show at some school. Later on the show the next day the one you killed. You think the details are right but the thing they told me was exactly the opposite of what they believed. What they told you is simply stupid and you want the truth. "
" That's tough to explain to a five-year-old " he said, as I closed the blinds. " But they are very specific. Why wouldn't you tell them that? "
I forced myself to nod, still in disbelief that someone was getting this simple treatment from me. I made my way to the kitchen and opened the door. " Quick- " I started before I could make the big mistake of dragging him on the sidewalk.
" I've been here for the last year. The number went up in less than 5 minutes but I've been here for three years. It's almost a month now. They have sent in a new guy after my wife and kids. Nothing has changed but the boy has changed. He is stronger. He has more confidence. He is learning to love his family. He is fixing school. He is learning everything we do. He is making it to the top in class and he is starting his family business. Now, he has to help some kid else like me. You know the stories too? They're all the same. The guy I killed stabbed him and his wife before he was 14. The boy is learning to love that kid too. Now, they do this every summer and they give him a scholarship to join the business. "
" So... I've killed twelve people in the last month. That's right. We got jobs, it's not like we did anything last month. They told me that last year's split event was for the kids for me. That he would be visiting the family at school this year. "
" Damnit. Are you going to give him to me again? " He started to argue. " I won't let him. "
" Fine, " I said. " I'm going to give him to him again tomorrow. Then. Then let him go."
I looked behind me and saw two guards at the door.
I waited until it had finished closing and watched as he crept inside. The guard stood and closed the door behind him. The child was now sitting on a duffle bag, with a note beside his backpack.
*I guess it's my fault I murdered him. You know the story. Don't get caught. *

"Fuck it. "
The homeless man started to sob. He had no idea what to do. His mind had just been rendered moot by the man's actions. Next to him, a woman. She was sobbing softly on the floor, staring at him with the same eyes that blind rage had. Tears were running down her face.
" Jesus, Jesus! "
" Emma! Emma! "
" Jacob! Jacob! "
They had come too far to abandon her. The woman slowly closed her eyes and spoke loudly to the man. The man turned away from her, ran to the woman, and locked eyes with Emma. This was it. It was his turn. No one could stop him and everyone would see that last bit.
" Emma, wake up! " cried the man, and the man dove for cover. He ran, ready to press on until he reached her. He pushed her to the ground and, with a trembling voice, " Emma, wake up! " The woman finally awoke, but the man stood tall as a statue. The man reached up and planted his face between hers. " No Emma. You have three words. You have to run. You have to run. " He started running after the woman. It was then that he ran too far. The homeless man was engulfed in darkness.
" Come with me..."

That's all it took for me to find each and every pickpocket. I was so lost in my will to become the next Blacksmith in Leipzig that I never saw the shiny crown of the East and I felt I had simply wasted my chance at becoming a Blacksmith. A senior Ordinator always thought the Blacksmith had an existence, a purpose. He claimed to have seen many of the Blacksmiths, like myself, the ones that had so far claimed lives that he could no longer believe to the veracity of the myth. It only took a few thousand years for him to claim his fame and he claimed the Blood magics of the Blacksmith. Now, I've been given the task of proving my reputation to the Three Hosts. Thus, it is time to show my numbers and amass enough evidence to lead up to the second Blacksmith.
"Tom! Here! " A man yelled from across the hall.
" Gee Tom, that's weird. You can't just be an Ordinator and this thing is all yours, right? " I asked.
" I told you, the Ordinators used to collect blood magics from places all over the world. They were like a collectors guild and they would pick things that needed to be cleaned up. I have to admit, it really bothered me. "
" What are you looking for here? " He pointed to a large pile of blades. " Ooh! I bet you have to see that one for yourself. "
" Oh, sorry. I think I've been missing something. Here, take this, and toss it at me. " I told him before dropping it in front of him.
Tom sighed.
" Anyways, don't be weirded out by that, but what really catches my eye is the window you are standing in! Wait for the smoke alarm and step back. " I told him.
Tom sighed.
" Listen man, you're a freak like me who just got another weapon. If you go, you don't look the next one in the oven, you can't pull yourself together right and *you're* going to be stuck. But you can do it too. For the money! For the knowledge! "
Tom scoffed and pointed at a random body on the ground, crouched low in the middle of the pile.
" That's weird, right? " I asked, just as Tom started laughing hysterically.
" Yeah, come again? " He replied.
" Nope, this time, it'll do it for you right. " I smiled, still stumped.
As if on cue, a smirk trickled on Tom's face.
" Ahhh, sorry, I'm a knife guy. Just could use some practice. "
" Ahhh, look, I got somethin' for you. " I said as I took out an entire sack of blades.
Tom took a large handful.
" Welcome to Hell's Kitchen!" I told him, as I added him in.

My name is Lil Kim-Sur.
Doing honest work no matter how cheesy is a thing of the past.
I watched the end of the world as people destroyed all of our loved ones. Hundreds who donned hazmat suits of armor, and I have every day watched.
I've found myself interviewing hundreds of people about various supposed miracles or Gods or whatever that would cause death, so I'm listening at a snail's pace. Today is wrong.
The truth is that after losing everyone, I realized it wasn't that hard to find a profession that paid well enough for my paychecks.
Other than that, I had one option. There wasn't a job I could do for hundreds of millions of people. My job was for starting small, getting rich.
I came to a conclusion after billions of people saw me as they knew me. And by doing so, they knew that I was more than a beggar.
One by one, I gave everyone I knew and hoped they would be happy.
Dirt fills the cupboard as people who sold their souls never knew I was an honest source of that love.
I seek fame because I genuinely care for those who would ever find it, because I truly respect their decision.
I reach out with my hands and I see infinite hope. The skills I need to become a good person, has been overwhelming.
As I approach the gates to Heaven, my soul shimmers within me, brimming with the eternal life I've loved.

This prompt started when I was a child, but with a twist, it gives the whole idea of my childhood a darken mood. In full voice, dark white sadness grips you and it seizes you from the inside out. I understand now why you love this.
After a year of letting my emotions flow freely and feeling the pressure to keep writing, I found this approach to time different. When one of those past, present, or future prompts is about a child's stories ( apparently not, ), then that stuff will never move past the top. It felt wrong that way. I thought with teenage stories that it could be left that way. So I started writing the prompts more slowly, really growing slower as the years went by.
It got worse by the second. Was it me? I didn't understand what was going on. It got I'd hear from my peers for years. Then they said that while they loved their mundane prompts, they weren't the most creative in those stories ( or so I said ), and that it would be better to say that what you had done by having them write just informed them of a secret or something. I said the stories didn't make sense and that they probably helped me think. But it didn't do anything. My mind was focusing on my second attempts, they hadn't picked up on anything since. I knew everything I had seen. I knew a lot. So I wrote those little "in the bathroom " and waited to hear what they would say about me by myself.
However, all they said was that I couldn't lead them to their own conclusions and then they told me I would have to ask them to close up and teach them how to be creative.
I begged them to stop. As I turned to leave I saw them looking at me. They said it's on me to go now. So I stayed. None of them were happy. Everyone had me, they came to my face very sternly. It was heartbreaking. It was supposed to be so that I could be honest with them. It was supposed to be to remind them of the struggles I've had in their past. But they wouldn't listen.
I didn't even know where they were. I looked around the library and didn't see any. I kept looking around and it wasn't until I felt the urge to close my eyes that I broke into a grin. I walked over to my desk and opened my browser.
But all I saw was death.
As I stared down at the blank page I felt the pain and the darkness stop and I was nothing.
I woke up one morning, with strange bruises and bits of dark, grey hair covering my face. I said aloud to no one in particular, but they all snapped and looked up at me. They also saw nothing. I looked around the library and there I found a stuffed animal and an easel and a collection of furs as well as two large stuffed animals strewn about and the head of a rabbit tied to a bedpost. The collected animals had some interesting makeovers, none of which did any good, until all of them laid. I saw a picture of myself, holding a dead squirrel, sitting right next to me. I hadn't even touched the squirrel in years.
From that day on, the writing prompt never came up. To the day I was young again, I never really had a story in my head about someone getting to be like me because of how I was. But my writing prompts would continue to make me want to be their son or marry their wife or even teach them about something very important that I never told them about.
Since I saw my sins all at once, I knew exactly what to do.

I hate myself. She says the answer is to start drowning her, and drown everyone in beer, exercise, etc. And then think about all the love. It fills me up for only a few seconds. I hate her for it.
I won't ever get over how I treated her. I hate that I broke down. My only regret is that I didn't fully understand why it happened.
She looks so many parts right now, just as sad as I did. Silly and heartbroken. I don't even know how. She had completely outgrown me. Everytime I blame myself she finds fault with herself. Every time I really fall in love with her, all she does is cry. She reminds me of my parents. All they did was pick me up in her truck as she drove from the kitchen to my room.
I hate myself for everything. How can I take it all back?
I love her, there is only so many people who love me, and I know it is pointless. I hate myself for sitting here now, trying to find someone that will truly miss me.
What am I going to do.
I'll leave you all. I love you. I love you both. I love you and your heart.

"You didn't even realize how bad we all are. You were looking up our presidents name in the internet porn charts and immediately turned to your imaginary friends. It's been 15 years now and I still don't know how you survived that day. "
The man snorted, the joke still hanging in the air.
" That's part of my job."
The man gazed at the images on the screen, ignoring the growing collection of letters sprawled across the screen. The woman he had been being shamed by whispered them beneath his breath in the last few minutes of his life. The man did not even look up, raising his hand to pierce the air.
Every few minutes the woman would grow more tense. “ My sweet boy, we are dealing with real problems and our families are receiving we are ‘ starving ’ not enough to feed ourselves. Get out. ” The phone rang every few minutes.
The man ran out of the house, finding the man frantically waving the shawl against the window, screaming “ We don ’ t need you. We don ’ t deserve you, and now we ’ ll know more than we ever will. You will have to struggle and they will understand and then they will beat you up for that. We have been there, and they beat us. ”
The woman in the room seemed to have forgotten, her eyes casting the entire apartment into darkness and she knelt. Looking into the woman ’ s eyes. “ We will beat them, but we will find a way out. ”

> Adience quantum coding, as always, is advancing rapidly, my dear doctor. There have only been a few outstanding strides that have been made in a very short amount of time, and we can only hope to improve on that. I knew I could only do one thing, you know, the one thing I must do now, and have been led to believe that there is no escape. Every video needs to have a separate camera and microphone. Nothing can ever capture that which is recorded. In fact, there simply is no way for any kind of human to capture that which is not recorded. Even if the image captured was not a composite, then what is the probability that the pixels where being actual pixels, but just pixels stretching each other? Just other pixels? If it were an illusion, how would those that were placed in the right positions than they were placed in the right order? What if the images weren't blank, so, why were they placed in the top right corner so the background wouldn't blot out those around them, then that would be enough to remove that film? If those that were placed in the bottom right corner were placed in a later position, it doesn't matter how such film was fabricated, because it's not clear where the pixels from those where taken, which are needed for information to be held back by pictures to be placed out of the way. However, it is generally agreed among the experts that a better way of reconstructing an earlier staged film, by eliminating the pixels, is to find only those that have been uploaded to YouTube. Surely, this would solve a lot of the pressing problems we have now, at least from our perspective. With the Chinese films, they seem to be much more primitive than those similar. In the majority of videos, they are displayed, most of them showing a number of scenes exactly like the ones we are used to in movies. The first one I found with my newest roommate, Chris, showed a little girl in a hospital bed speaking, strangely with shaky fingers. Chris was looking at him nervously, like it was an enemy. The boy had seemingly brought up three options in that second, but in most of them the subject had left more than a few horrifying drawings. Obviously, Chris knew what she was doing because she was the only one in her house that he had not yet understood in a number of his videos. There were more scenes of tragic cars wreaking havoc on a building all through the night, killed by the stray headlights from the bright lights, to names and information of the faces of two innocents doing nothing of consequence. The second much like in the movies, several people in the homes displayed harsh graphic images of the two in various states of the behaviors that had happened, in much the same way in the movies but not so as to destroy an entire family, or worse, just killing the loved ones of the survivors. I shall look into these crimes in the coming weeks, just to see if I can do anything about it. But, until then, look at the world we live in, remember this and save yourself.

It's spring. The temperature is dropping, the birds have been singing, and the water is warming up. Normally it's early, but the feeling of warmth in the sky doesn't diminish. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see the sun and the sea here - every bit as beautiful as the last. But the temperature is rising, the birds have been singing, and the water is warming up. I stop and take a deep breath. This is not Heaven.
It is like a rabbit or a butterfly in the garden, and rain is falling and people are running for their lives. Kids dart around aimlessly, bump into objects, tear each others' clothes, throw rocks or loose glass. The sky is filled with lush green oases.
Then it was a fire. People sat quietly, streaming under water. Buildings strewn and torn, people walk around firing out sirens, people drink poisoned water, people have been trampled to death - a sign... to give it all back for the last time.
I sit alone.

I always knew I was in the top 5 people in my family when I was younger. I had actually been here a week or so, and I was officially pretty good looking. I was rather shy, though, being an open heart, so I would often stick out, people hated that. The problem was, I was constantly afraid to make people afraid. I am truly prone to make my own decisions without knowing what the consequences would be.
My first day of kindergarten, I walked to school alone, because I felt like I was responsible for everyone else's problems. My friend told me that maybe if I told someone, they would hate me for it. I was taken aback when I told him that because I wanted him to keep it low. I was pretty convinced that that is a load of bull. I laughed a little and told him that it had to be a joke. He was pretty jovial the next day, and I started to trust him. Today, however, the day started to fade. I had assumed that the day went by like yesterday, but I guess that is probably just a mirror image of what really happened. There I was, with my own problems, just lying there.
As I reached for my phone, I heard a door creak. I looked back to see a familiar face. It was not an attractive man, and definitely not the one I was used to. I knew that I was alone, so I tried to call out to him, but ended up being cut off by a loud thud from the door. A few minutes later, I heard footsteps enter the room. There he was, holding a light switch off. Then he was gone.
I climbed out of bed that day, expecting to see a familiar face on the other side of the hall. It was not.

" Well, " he said, holding his hands up in the air " That's not all. I'm going to double down. "
" I believe you, Frank, " I pleaded, " No, I need proof. If you don't threaten me, you will reconsider. "
" If you promise, " he snapped, " I will share that with you. "
" No, man, " I cried, " I promise you I won't steal your apartment! "
" You know better than to trust me, " he said, " I know my monster is a nice guy, and I don't want to be around anyone. "
" Oh, of course, you understand, " I responded, breaking my nose, " But it's pretty, really lonely in there, isn't it? "
" Why, " he snarled, " They're not going to come for this without a fight. "
" I wouldn't think anything of it, " I replied, stepping aside.
" Maybe we shouldn't fight if we are up against someone we love, " he growled.
" Relax, " I said. " I've heard that parents do that to their kids, and kids with kids, so I'll use that. Then we can just feel normal. "
" Okay, " he snarled, " I'll just answer your question, " he scoffed.
" Say no more, " I said, " I said no more, " I said no more. "
" Fine, you're right, Frank, " he scoffed, " I'll just... "
" No, I won't, " I said, not considering his words.
" Fine, " he finally said, cracking his knuckles, " Good work, Frank. "
I leaned against him, reaching into my coat pocket and holding out a pistol to him.
" I was just going to ask you to focus, " he said, " Maybe we should just go, and see if our roommate is there? "
" What are you doing, Frank? "
" Hanging, banging on doors, " I said, cutting him off.
" Are you still the one? "
" Yes, it's only got to be Frank. "
" Ok, I'll go, " I said, standing on the ground.
" Wait, " he grumbled. " Now. "
I gazed at him.
" No, " he growled, " I've come for my friend again."

The singularity was small and uninteresting. The initial impression was of semi flat rock floating in the shallow blue ocean at an interval of 60 hours. Meanwhile, at a cloud layer above the black and Ichigo nebula, a very fine distance could be absorbed by solid matter. After a bit, it dissipated. The original size of the sun was still dwarfed by the overall composition of this planet and its climate patterns. The earth had still been totally populated by the indigenous lifeforms.
The northern hemisphere separated the tropical ecosystems from the colder, more temperate conditions. New forests bore fruit under the looming pressures of heat, and shallow waters ran in bursts from dry plains. A water pressure compensated for the changing climate by evaporating bodies of water altogether, and until finally, the once lush, uncultivated forests choked all sound and were disturbed by algae. Thus, the last speck of life fell from the sky.
The moon eclipsed from every station on the X8. Watching the new dawn would be in the knowledge that when a solar flare comes along, heat is no longer expelled through the atmosphere. The New Earth was once an exceptionally rich egg planet. The remnants of this planet is now the size of the entire M60O belt, and going into space would bring us near its green death in 3022.
We waited. Should we get lost? Of course not, no one expects us to return. We have found old life. From lunar colonies and Kuiper belt satellites, we have found fossils from another race of speckled asteroid rocks. There are thousands of these, although each one has preserved their own internal organs for 500 years. There are three kinds of white bones in each person's body, and the skeleton lacks those. We chose to cross each of these parts to know a new way out, and the universe is constantly watching with a strange sense of curiosity.
Ultimately, it was put into the most interesting scientific phase of the advance, the first ever manned interstellar expedition to mars. There were so many theories, then the first... we think of new concepts, new social rules. Oh, we have had one last opportunity.
The Europeans left us earth two hundred years ago. Returning home was a great regret, and during our preparation for the mission we were told that the outermost layers of our atmosphere had started to condense on it. We were told there was a habitable world, and that an encounter with its star would allow us to visit. We left around two hundred years ago, hoping to make contact with an ancient civilization, but they left us half way across the galaxy by now. They looked so distant they had fallen asleep, and opened the government satellite probes.
We never really understood these people. We took them on a dog hunt, and they always play battle games. It is every war that comes along, and it turns out that the only option is peace. We worked as best we could to prepare for a transit through their systems, and that is all we know now. We'll see when the next Roman Empire comes. We hoped that humanity would somehow adapt and find peace on this new world.

"What... " I say aloud as I limp towards the intercom. The source of all this clarity I feel in my head. I'd been selected to be someone's pallor over time, someone's sacrifice to bring peace to a world my entire life was a great failure in the end. I couldn't allow that. To realize how insignificant things had become must not have been enough.
To realize that life is short is entirely impossible. It would be simplistic to label someone an " old ageless ", and it would be convenient to label someone the " level of perfection " as they live today. But to proclaim existence as such is one thing, for when those who suffer are discovered they become less, and they become more.
To know that there is light in darkness is also another thing entirely. Knowing, being, and the immortal are conflicting realities. When something as vast as this must begin to seem impossible, we must either look down to something then pass on or we must simply set out in a new direction.
I falter when I think back to my childhood. The peaceful, " peaceful " of my childhood. The first time I was born into a high-paying job. The short, simple life. A more proper retirement. My friends congratulated me as I completed a command of a simplistic task. I was told the job was so important, that since I was born I was able to hold a different consciousness within itself. In that moment I could not find my true love, the youth I had once looked up to so nearly failed me. It was incredibly difficult for me not to kill myself, yet I had to kill myself. I had to kill myself. To create someone else. For myself.
I looked up into the sky, seeing my first glimpse of his future self, eyes still locked onto mine, gleaming with a spark that must have come in many versions, memories. So many different expressions of myself. It had to be me.
I didn't wish to see him in this place, I wanted to see him in a coma. There was no having a reason not to.
Time to relive all the tragedies of my childhood. Being lonely and alone at some point. It was not too bad at all. His childhood was innocent, right up until the small number of instance of enjoyment he was missing when he was still young. Such innocence.
As his vision faded into silence, I gazed upon him. For a short time he stood at the edge of my vision, not even moving to acknowledge the darkness in my mind. Until that moment, I did not have to see him for that whole eternity. I understood him soon enough as he gazed upon me with such intensity, as he simply became there.
" God."

Well, shit. She always said "nice and slow". That's what she said to me. Literally everything that's ever happened to me. I had forgotten about her at school, but I was texting when she told me about her. I got distracted by the cold, hard copy of Facebook that she used, as though she had a service that a stranger needed.
I moved it to " friendless " like I had before. It wasn't unlike... a basement. But still... she's better. I'm going to make a phone call right now so I won't ruin the relationship.
Wait, what is going to happen to me? What am I going to do about this? This can't be good. She died when I was 14.
I've talked to her every night. I can't believe how she loves me. I don't know if she loves me. I know she hates me, but I don't want to think about it. I'll just wait until she dies.
My phone starts ringing, and I hold it in my hand. After fifteen minutes of silence, she starts texting me. She's starting to blink, the effect going on, I just yell out what she wants and wait for her to come closer. It makes her so nervous. I spend the next couple of hours answering. It's about 3 in the afternoon in a park, she and my friend are snuggling in a backyard bench, with a blanket wrapped around their arms. Suddenly the blanket crumbles away and the blanket falls to the ground. The blanket falls to the floor. The blanket falls to the ground. The blanket falls to the ground.
That's not how we died. My body stops working as I lay in the dirt, finally cold and lifeless, like a statue. Everyone I used to know moved away when I was 14, and I was never able to contact them again. The universe just left me. And I'm okay with it. At least my friends are okay with me sleeping with these skinny, overly wrapped, lanky, blanketed chicks.

"They told me it could hurt. "
I can hear the indignation in his voice. He is hardly the same as he was in 2009. I can only remind myself that I am still a dog. I've been branded " dog " the day before, but not by a mouth-to-mouth. I still remember the day when I turned seven, nearly adopted in April. I considered, wouldn't it be better to keep small before I can move on? One second it's the innocence that is back-country chasing me, and the next, there's a dog.
Three hundred pounds of fur and bones and everything. I've just laid in it's fate, and now the vet has mandated it be sent to a waiting room before getting to a hospital. That's not ideal. A surgery? Oh well, okay. This has to be the first time I've had one of these. They'll come in tomorrow. Usually, I'll come in when I get ready and expect to be put in an incubator that will keep me in a constant state of shit until the vet comes back to my room. It's a wonderful thing that they're working with a lab beagle to live-coats.
For a time, it was hopeless to be around a surviving vomer. He died of a twisted fall off his snout and overdosed on amphetamines. He was brought to the hospital that day and soon after began acting much the same as always. Everything from being taken apart by anything she could manage to do, to having an IV attached to her arm... all of it has changed. I've had to keep my mind occupied, even though this is a small, gory world of outbursts. Things have changed, and things are a lot worse than I thought.
No food here. I can barely keep myself warm or on my feet. There are nothing of value to be found anywhere. I've lost count of how many times I've fallen inside. Thankfully the human eye does show me the spectrum from high, to low. One time, I broke my eye and was tumbling on the floor for what felt like an eternity. Half the time, I drifted between solid gray stone and bone and wanted to keep moving, but instead I wagged my tail and something blue gave way to gold like his fur. It was only about a minute before I was out of water and out of sight. The landing was so rough that I had to reach my car.
" Don't get hit by a car. Don't get hit by a car. Don't get hit by a car. " The dog barked at me. It was my fifth visit in this rotund day. I thought, " I'm getting bitten. I need to get out of here. " I couldn't get hurt. I couldn't breath. I didn't move at all. I just drifted in and out of existence. I landed and there I was lying on my back, a miracle, one that nobody has ever called me for.
I am used to the phantom suffering and misery in this life. It's never bothered me, and I am happy that I have got to be here in the first place. Every day I'm walking, breathing. Flipping around, as though I'm somebody's god, I notice movement in a quiet corner in my cell. I touch a robotic pincher and the arm cuts into my chest and causes my whole body to feel numb. I glance in front of me to see the rows of dogs that now occupy the corners of my cage. They are clearly living in order, and licking at their faces.
Another lap of the lapdog war has come about, and it tells me he is waiting in my cell for me. " Don't go. We can't have you here to waste a very long time. Our only hope is to wake up and see the man who rescued you. " He tries to warn me with his glazed features, but I never hear the words. He desperately tries to get up, but his tail is scuffed through with chains that look like nails. He picks me up and returns with one of these pitiful porcelain spheres that are well enough spread across my cage.
" Do you want to go along with our plan? " I ask, still unsure of what to do. I hope he understands. No, not just yet. He puts a sock beside my collar and looks me in the eye. " Good choice," he says.

Being a cat isn't an experience by any means, just the magic of the house-ed.
Whether you're in the kitchen, eating breakfast in the living room, or just jamming a cigarette out into the fridge, you'd go to the kitchen to get a decent meal.
There she is, sitting at the front desk with her paperwork blanked out. You'd call in sick, need to get on with your day, and come home. Until you reply: "s-s-sorry, Ms. P, can you leave? "
The nurse came to her with an " o, m-m... Hello? "
" Um... " You squeaked out, embarrassed at what had just occurred. " I've been in a... Make-A-Wish situation with a kid a year ago. "
" Hang on a second, Ms. P! "
They looked at each other, meeting eyes that would change all that.
" Don't worry Mr. Johnson, " she said, her voice sincere. " These babies may seem like a good idea at first, but there's nothing you need to worry about. After all, after having lived with him all my life, I know how to make him happy.
I just need to sit right here, and listen to you and you- "
" *sir* " She said. " For the past twelve months, I've had lots of warm and loving sleepovers with every child who I've ever known. Nothing comes easy. "
You stare at her sadly, not wanting to know what she was really saying. You tear up and move the notebook to her.
" Muffles?! "
" Mrs. Smith of the Syrup Beauty at Bethlehem Health Hospital! "
" Umm, sorry? "
The nurse took a long drag on her cigarette.
You rub it in your mouth, and think back on your life in front of her. For a long moment, you thought about how you would never tell her, only that she was loved by Muffles. Then, a gentle hand came on your back. " Thank you. "
" *Cheryl? * "
" Yes, of course, Cheryl. Right away. "
Muffles sat next to you, between them.
" Do you think I'll ever love you again? "
" Not really. I just can't believe my wife actually likes you. Not in the way she expects me to! " She winced, her blonde hair being whipped around her.
You stare at the pages, finding them all oddly boring. I'd wish they'd made their way to a slightly more exciting possibility. " She'd love me the way she does! "
" Mr. Johnson, " the nurse said.
She cut off the cigarette, and pulled it away. " Thanks! "
You sat there at the kitchen table, trying to think of an excuse, trying to come up with the best one. You put the last of the cigarette down.
" Sorry honey, " she said, and set down the notebook. " Didn't really catch on to it after we met for school. "
You chuckled, obviously taken aback by her enthusiasm. " I always thought he was a bit sexy when he got older."

“ A stupid test. ”
“ No, ” I muttered. As it turns out, I am what you ’ d call a *crazy*. I would never have believed what I was seeing when I took the test. After an hour of deliberation, I decided that I wouldn ’ t have any opinion on what was being done with it. This first test was a simple one. I would have given the couple a choice. I could plead guilty for an obscene amount of money, or I could curse the person sitting across from me. Both options were still merely hypotheticals, nothing to be done with. Yet, I could see things clearly through their eyes, and I was determined to pass it. I knew I had to take the test, but I didn ’ t want to admit to any wrongdoing or utter unfairness, so I chose the former.
“ Mr. Jenner. Now, ” the man began. I understood what I was about to say. “ You have the option to go to jail. To take a test or to be sentenced to death? ” I looked down at my swaddled hands. “ Mr. Jenner, ” I continued, “ I have the choice between you forgone this task and be sentenced to eternal damnation. ”
After the man finished his sentence, I stepped out into the cold dark outside. I took one last look down at the black walls and a half open window, as I began to frown. I reached for the phone to call the police. I looked down again, wondering whether my choice was a positive or a negative. I am not used to smiling faces in public, so I picked up the phone again and dialed 911.
“ Hello? ”
“ 911?! I think I see you with Mr. Jenner in prison, ” my father said.
“ Hey, dad! Dad!
“ I saw him with you! You asked if I would marry him.
“ What?! What the... what is wrong with you?!?!?! It was just last night! I was driving home from work and he told me what he would do to me if I didn ’ t marry him!
“ Just tell him to fuck off, he ’ s hurting you. Let me tell you, this is torture. No one wants to leave their fathers side. ” I shook my head. “ Well, I ’ m sorry... ” I looked down at the small piece of paper in my hands. “ I want to apologize for the trouble I ’ ve caused, but I don ’ t wan na get caught. Don ’ t take this as a sign of my forgiveness. Not in this time.
“ In other words, it ’ s your choice, son. ”

Usually everyone approaches me at exactly the same time, but I kept hearing what sounded like a pun. I shook my head.
"I don't think you realize how weird knocking is, " asked Stacy. " Do you have a *on* watch? "
" My birthday is next month, you're 30, " I said as I gave her a nasty look. " Today's the day you finish your check. "
" Aww, I'm my own man, I know that. "
I said to the phone, " This is a joke? "
The weird looking woman smiled. " You sure don't remember how I get here? "
" Any joke on the phone? What kind of joke? You should be ashamed. "
The woman bit her lip, her eyes teary-eyed. " I'm sorry. "
" Did you forget how the clock is supposed to be? Are you ready? "
" Perhaps, " I said, " maybe we should bring a surprise in the corner. No-one will notice. "
" What? "
The woman looked up, her eyes like wine glasses. She reached into her purse, snatched a couple of pennies off the counter. She opened up the shopping bag and started walking.
" Oh yeah, I saw it at the grocery store. Oh yeah, that guy I had in my car."
The woman blushed.
I was one of the few people that knew the Boogeyman as Kevin Leaser.

Excerpt from Journal of the Three Kings, vol. XI, No. 4
Murderer and traitor.
They were cast out in the name of the LORD of Hosts before they could throw fire upon his champions, and in the fire that would burn his walls for months if he did not find us.
Hordes of men are gathered to worship the fleshy giant, unsure about the fairer things in the world. Myself and three other Kings have scoured the world and found nothing of value in their relics, living relics these kings have yet to learn from, and call themselves "the good Men of the village of Hornburg" as they call their great cities. It is fear of the outsiders that strangles our land, and neglect of the holy rites of our gods that prevents us from ending their suffering.
See, our god is dead, and his name is **Whandee**, the dreaded god of War. His name is a whore at best, and the sickness he mocks is up to the day the church was ruined.

"Mr. Chiu! How... how are you doing around here? "
" Sorry Mr. Chiu, just a little late today. I am trying to help, " his giant hand on my shoulder.
" How're you doing? I saw you in the kitchen last night, " I squinted through the peephole.
" Oh right. I am stuck. She looks like she looks about 40, " he responded quickly. I tried not to put a smile on his face.
" I will. Please, " I quashed the urge to rush away from his hand.
It's funny really. Usually, I have the energy to show my guests how I've lost. Sometimes I don't take care of them. However today, it was Lisa.
She hadn't moved. While he had kicked some bills out of the way in frustration, she was actually kicking back. Apparently she didn't like to yell while they were in any sort of movement at all, so I caught her batting the spare tire on the couch. It was well underway. I noticed that Lisa was mucking around my living room, too.
" Who exactly is annoying Lisa? " I asked her.
" Big, fat, beast! You know how funny it is to have large, fat, beast. Who even came to watch The Simpsons? "
" Ms. " she continued, looking off in the distance, " I work in a hospice doctor's office. Anyway, I'm here to help Lisa, " as she raised one hand to poke my foot.
" Make some noise, " he directed and gestured to the wall where she sat in front of it. Slowly, she began to walk towards the wall. I was surprised when she didn't stop to blink.
I slowly stood up, looking over my shoulder. Apparently Lisa had decided not to take part in my shenanigans. She attempted to stamp her feet vigorously, but it only got more awkward. Now she was trying to stomp around my bedroom in every direction to try and make noise. My house used to be something special. Now it was just another cheap sock filled room full of mushrooms.
I hastily walked to the door. The air was becoming thick with a buzzing noise. I needed to go to the bathroom. I flinched as I glanced in the mirror. I noticed that I was staring right back at Lisa, unmoving.
" What the hell are you doing? How can you do this to me? " I said frantically.
She opened her mouth to explain, but I could not see her. Not until I turned to see what she was doing, with her arms stretched out to clasp my limbs.
" They'll find you, " I yelled under my breath. I then looked around the room. She was standing on her wooden chair.
I had an urge to vomit.
I bent down and reached around to grab her elbow. My gut said to throw the chair aside. Thankfully I was not in her immediate vicinity. I slipped between her hands, giving one last push to her arm to stop it.
" Oh, a white shirt with a big ol' logo on it! I sure am thankful for your kindness, " I cursed under my breath.
" Now go to the bathroom and masturbate, " she said with her hand on my shoulder.
" Look, " I pointed out as she bent down and bent her other arm into a standing position, " I don't want to go on a date anymore. They will find out eventually." I sipped my water and folded up the white shirt, thinking of the cops I could probably catch later.
At least the pale girl is having fun.

As I looked out into the blackness of the night sky, I had seen the darkness crawl away. The stars had fallen like rain, and we danced. But it was not this that made the stars fall; they were coming to us again. The stars were coming and we danced. Some were beginning to fall with each passing day, and I stepped out into the new night when I heard the strange hum of the radio go off.
“ Need some more radio? Are we rolling in daylight? Who sent a damn radio? ” I heard it say. I looked up to see white, and the sky blackened. I stood up as I ran from the radio, until I came across a man, lying face down on the floor. He looked as dead as the sky itself, save for a few silver tendrils grasping at his throat and a loud beep.
“ Who are you? ” I asked.
“ Do you have what it takes to survive in this cold? ” The man said, puffing out a small bundle of smoke. “ What do you want? ” I asked.
“ I ’ m stranded, ” he said. “ If you would come after me, you could shoot me. ” He ran off on his bike.
I came up behind him, and turned away, desperate to find out what the hell had happened. I shot him with the blue stick. Instead, he grabbed a large rock, as hard as he could push himself. He grabbed at his neck, and I hit the rock hard, but he pushed himself all the way up. Next thing I know, I'm stuck in this suit. In this bunker.
“ Do you believe this is what he meant when he said “ No. ” “ Come with us, kid. Do you want to end the war? Do you want to leave your shitty life behind? ” I started up the walk to the other side of the bunker and I called for help. Just before I fell, I noticed something else. It was glowing like a star, I could see it with my eyes. The sight brought me a smile, but it looked like someone had put a laser around my neck. I looked over and saw the star was now bleeding out. I felt sick and sleepy.
But I wasn ’ t dead.

In this case, the lower limit had been paid exactly half way through, the account had been well used, the funds were safe and the bank account ran smoothly. The moment I saw all the details, I knew I'd be in trouble. All I needed to do was wait for the end and make a withdrawal. In 10 minutes, I would have lost $ 70,000,000.
Suddenly, I heard a cry of frantic racing, as I got up to open the ATM, the machine seemed to be connected to the main network of banks in the country. I didn't even need to touch it. It was almost time to take the last jump, as I accidentally bumped into a woman. The next few hours were one in the same, I never should have wasted money, before I did I realized there was no way I could withdraw that much money there. How could I say I spent $ 70,000,000 on'frivolous' things?

"Forgive me, Uncle Matthew. I must have been born for a mistake. "
Peter was always a sour-tempered man, but that didn't always excuse his cursing whenever he did things that offended Tom.
" You're remembering the truth? " Tom asked, now glaring at Peter with a sharp curt smile.
Peter sighed, and tucked his chair back in his chair. He'd get to play with the Lost Boys, but Peter was a very busy young man.
" What are you talking about? Get out of my house! " Peter screeched.
Tom's face must have been puffy. He was right, the room was puffy. There were cracked windows on the ground floor, and hundreds of tables in the lobby. But the rickety, dirty carpet wasn't white, nor was it a flaky white. It was just wet and tattered.
" It's... It's real. " Peter told Peter with no emotion in his voice.
He stepped out from under a frozen sofa. From beneath his blankets he sat, hardly able to lift his eyes and manage to nod, all while staring at a large painting of a woman with a huge bore scar. The woman stepped on a stool, over to Peter and placed a hand on his shoulder.
" I'm sure Peter does recognize you, " she began, pausing as to confirm Peter was non-threatening.
" Just take this. It's real, you're a living person. There's a candle over the fireplace, fire, dust.... " Peter left the sofa, bringing the candle to his face. He lit it and swallowed the lump that sat in his throat. Tom let out a long sigh, visibly distressed.
" I've missed you so much. " Peter said, gently. " I miss you too much."

The man roared:
"Jala. Jala! "
He shouted out a lopid word, and the man fell into silence. This often happens during a man's lesson, when the boy broke the terror. They never make it through. They're easy to kidnap when they run from the monsters.
" He does not take kindly to your puny mind, so let him go! "
The boy may be one of the roving gang of men, or they may be a small band of adventurers from the academy, so they can trap him in a dark cave. He's weak, and strong for what it's worth, the albino is a mighty warrior. He must be silenced, and this ability to defeat him is what makes him a legend.
" This is rude of him, he wants to strangle you! "
Their leader swore. He knew his ability and must act right now.
" Fear not, for your kind needs me, for I am the *Dragon*, the Dragon of Dragonslayer. You will learn to live out your days in the Zeal of Zealwood. "
With that he brought down his warhammer and left, barreling out of the cave like a terrible black beast. The silent maelstrom opened up with a loud crash. What followed was a terrible explosion, it tore through the ground in an instant. The door to the cave was now open, the water was now their only hope. The boy, who had been tucked away by the evil beast of this world had realized what was going to happen next.
The boy was not a boy who would kill. The dragon was, as the leader had told him, a very powerful Dragon. A being a master of fighting wars, and the young boy grew up before him to understand. He was born with this revelation.
" The others are here with me, to teach you to live, you may seek your true self, and become a Dragon."

"You are the greatest weapon of this... "
I started to feel a burning dread, as I let out a horrible croak, my chest popped and popped, my eyes grew wider as the fires finally engulfed me. While the mortals were silent, my vision found death, the final blow riddling the body until he slumped back down.
-Well, that was quite difficult to take in. Who knew how good up-heel killing weapons feel, at that time... Was the arrival of an old weapon a bad sign?
As the thought crossed my mind, I started laughing a bit as the blood came rushing to the surface. His final words, " You're welcome. "
His words were two words that I couldn't comprehend, they marked my future and I stood once more on this altar of death, catching my breath as I rolled up my sleeves to reveal his proud shield. I could see his name, my face, it read, " Smed " and once again I laughed.
-Damn man, he never did understand. This can't be right...
" Smed, sir! " The voice called once again, and with a voice so echoed, I could swear I could hear in my head.
" Why? " The man asked, his head cocked upwards for a peek.
" I know but if you weren't here, your kind would have seen us as fools for 10 years, centuries, hundreds of years. If we hadn't been here, you wouldn't even be talking. " My face changed and I almost dropped it in response.
" Ok... There it is. " He said, bringing up his hands. " Now, why did you call me Smed? "
I dropped my eyes and looked around, yes, I was still alive. " Because, I did... it was already done. "
" Where would you have gone with this? "
He walked a deep breath, a cold sweat running down his brow and rolling down his forehead. " I'm sorry... the voice doesn't know to send me here... It was just last night, it was really hard... I don't know how much time it took to implement it. Why didn't you send it away, I suppose if you hadn't, it could have managed to come out more efficient... "
-You know why?
He continued for a few more moments before looking down at his hands " Well, he's dead anyway. I got ta make sure I don't accidentally drop him down on the battlefield, or die. If I did that... I could have grabbed him by the arm and carried him in the distance and killed him. It would have had done more for our kind. To me it's just a bad idea. "
With that he left and I ran for the entrance to the hall. * Fucking fool, they couldn't have messed with the staff. *
As I closed the door, I looked around and saw Mjol, the heir to this hall.
" Oh, god... so.. long, Lúcio..."
I closed the door and turned to face the hundreds and dozens of eyes staring at me. I stood frozen and then suddenly realized for a split second, the powers of the staff had changed.

My family and I didn't have much money. Hell, we're a short-sighted few that only lived in poverty. The saddest part of all that was- and this is a brief entry into my two-page column on Ben Gurion- was when I got his call to be an air force captain.
"Mister Underwood, yes? "
I landed the hunk of cloth on the gray tarmac and the nerve of my neck as I watched his face sink into the seat next to me. In a state of shock I exclaimed. " Yes, Joseph? "
" The Secretary has informed us that the Israeli army has begun to expand to the Middle East, giving them access to their most valuable resources, namely high-technology tech weapons. "
" This is ridiculous! "
" I want to fight a dragon! "
" We are to use lethal force if you want to fight a dragon! "
" A... no... we don't have to fight monsters... "
" A dragon is the equivalent of a bat and we can *use* them! "
" Just a dragon, come on, we have a go at winning this fight. "
" And we're going to blow through your walls in two hours, we're going to blow your base, and blow apart your coffin! Now tell me what the actual rules are! "
" Simple - don't attack American helicopters, we're going to use them to extinguish your flame-source! "
" Easy there, I'm receiving your mobile phones call sir! But don't worry, I am risking the same fate to bring you this far into the last ditch efforts. "
" Wait! Before you get your phone call- "
" I'm an old man. I was raised in a giant metal house, you're not going to get home because I've pointed a gun at you and left it in the middle of the hallway! "
" I don't want to die. This is not the world I want my life to end on. This is a country they want me to live in so it's not a good idea. "
" I agree with you, Lord Underwood. It's a lot easier to bring someone to do the same for you now, and there's been a lot of talk about what *Israel* might do if they did not like it. But let me break this to you - what you might want to do, is prepare to attack! "
" I want to be slaughtered, Lord Underwood, you are to be burned alive at the stake. "
" I promise, my daughter will love you! "
" Stop yer whining, Lord Underwood! "
" Ok. Well then, I guess I'll just burn you alive. "

I feel them laying on the ground, hands wrapped in rubble and crumpled into their graves. One whispers, the other a cry. I hear their voices booming in my head. I feel the pity on their faces as they weep and beg. I feel them saying to each other, "I love you, my son. I never forget you... now see what I've done." What is a child to do when its mother's tears are rained down upon them? I felt them close their eyes to my face, but they did not know what they'd be stuck here with. These are new toys.

" And it's Julio? " The man behind the counter
" Yeah he's an adult!
I see a speck, and for a moment I realize I can not move my hand around and my vision clears. We've never seen one before in this situation, but it looks like I'm heading right to the house.
" Well, it looks like he was young, but he looked twenty. He just stepped in the doorway, got down and was standing near the dogs. " I glance down at the little boy, my boots are lightly tapping against the wooden steps. " I can't move my hand, but this is a flagpole! " I chime as the boy turns to face me. " You're not going to believe it at first, it was just a few dogs, sir "
" He's a different breed, make a safe landing on the ground as fast as possible and get him away from the dogs and out of sight before he gets to you. The dog's worth a billion dollars."

I've always been the type of man that screams when he sees the criminals. Afraid that this would be the end for all I hold dear, I lied in my bed that night and heard their "choke-the-gate. " Call to my friends, they'll tell you I'm brave; I know that. And it's because of that which I know and feel right.
All I know now, though, is that I'm smart and will protect them. I won't hide away, no matter how many times I try - even if I am cheated. I will help them, and they will still stay as good as they have ever been.
I'll always leave my friends behind and beg for some sweet cash from their families that only the rich are allowed to make. I'll leave their savings to some random rich heist group. I'll die, sometimes, as a witness for others that I will betray.
I've seen what they do to poor people. To start a war, and bring justice in their hearts, and what has become of them.
I've seen that they steal and slaughter others. Burn homes, factories, government buildings. They just do it to give a big smile and roll in their money. I know for a fact that they do it out of spite, that just because I'm clever doesn't mean that they follow in the footsteps of the others. I know they do it out of self-pity and spite, and they have no shame in it.
I know that the that we are truly one, and that we have an equal interest in each other. However I wish I could, and still wish for you to understand that.
When you run away, when your house is burned down, or you think you've been hurt by the people you stole from, it's so simple that it's natural. It's childish to want to forget that what you did to that poor woman is not in itself wrong, but on its own merits.
I have a son. That son is coming into my life and showing me all the hardship and pain they must show all the other students of my school. And it will be so lovely to see him all have a family who will not die, even if it means losing their own. It will be so terribly unfair to all of my friends and people to be treated the same way, even in a world filled with so many different kinds.
But still I hope for you one day to understand that if things get worse, we will all be better.

John stares into the void of space that wrapped itself around the amber glow of a hand, his eyes on the final moments of Jim. He had been waiting, stalling. He had waited for the moment when the starlight would shine down upon his final destiny. As they locked eyes once more, Johns stared into the abyss, for it was the light at his end, the fire burning so fiercely of course. His hand now clutched the wall, shaking from the cold.
Jim looked to his next student. He stood and drew a picture. He began preparing the sand. John was sad, but as he wished he had. He had not accepted the truth that this meant nothing but disappointment. He stared, waiting for the next one. A younger man sat in the middle of the clear waters looking ahead. No longer ready to accept his inevitable death.

It wasn't supposed to end like this. Raining was just part of our morning routine. I was out the door that night, slaving away with my bags in hand, but today was different.
I grabbed my knife and stepped out of my bedroom to go see my family and friends. I realized my home was not real and thought I'd take an afternoon drive to the airport in the hopes that the wind would blow me off my feet. My life was doomed to fail, and I was going to get away with it.
The sky was going dark, and the last thing I saw was the silhouette of my family, but I had that piercing green, she was on the left, my baby brother, and my dad was on the right. But nothing was out of the ordinary, although I could see my mother at the top of the trees.
I knew something was wrong, and I wanted to call 911. My plan was simple. Focus my focus, and hit the right photo.
My lips touched the lens, and a deep growl filled the air. I could see the girl, barely twenty four, with no family, and a girl with platinum blonde hair and a checkered t-shirt of a red dove. I grabbed a photo.
The girl had no parents, and my killer had no clothes.

"Listen.
I know what I've done.
The message in the castle.
The death of my father.
I know the plight of the kingdom.
Hands made for so many I make many could not make.
For so many I take dear.
Time is far and we're tired,
but at the end we can all rise.
I know you'll receive your swift death. "
I step into the throne room and await my orders.
They say I am strong, my son,
The reason why I rule.
But to me you aren't, and more time still passes.
I defy this will and promise you I'll make you happy.
And I've already started to sing.
Bury my daughter in the throne room I make.
Take the man that needs saving.
He's a coward, an imbecile.
Will be executed, as he does.
Even the fat fool.

Sometimes people call me something but for a moment I see no significance. When I took a shower I knew I shouldn't be crying, that was almost akin to calling myself "PFC". People get called names and sometimes they are used to make faces. But me, here I am drowning, eyes closed, breathing hard, neck of the water still tight. For a moment I'm going to cry, but that's before I feel anything.
When I draw my eyes away I may fall on my knees, a ball of water rolling between my hands and palms. I feel my will fail me, but I never intend to fail myself again. I never think about anyone else, just myself in the bathtub. I can feel myself run up and down the hall. I got caught up in the surf. A thought bubbles up behind my eyes and even though I don't know what it is, I know that if I'd known, then I wouldn't be here. It's all so boring as if I didn't exist. I don't deserve to know.
I decided to relax and let the breath in. I was floating in the water, never knew if I was doing so. I thought about my parents in the hospital room, forgetting about them. They all had so much history, what could they have done differently. One caught my eye. I looked like my parents had come to enjoy the swim. I could have taken their time and thrown on something, maybe even fresh water. I floated slowly across the room. The water trickled. I could finally breathe.
I made it out. I was finally back in the ocean. Or so I thought. I immediately jumped off the bed and to my horror I suddenly found myself floating in my own filth, but at the same time I had no recollection of this place. I went from a normal person to a fish tank, one filled with filth. This time I was alive and I remember experiencing life again. If anything, I felt just like my parents, trying to figure out what to do when they left.

James looked at the little kid sitting in the corner of the room. His daddy gave him a basket full of money, scalding her face. She didn't want money, but she just wanted to play outside. James grabbed his mom's arm, but then he froze, and he couldn't move his arms. The toy thief came to him and took his dad in his arms. James stood there for a moment. As if someone had just dragged a leech from a stick in his hamster, and then he saw what he had to do. He was almost dragged out, and a needle whizzed past his eyes. But he did not stumble on the needle.
James left the room, and looked at the little girl.
"I'll miss you, " he said to the little girl.
And then he felt his crumpled up clothes. They were stained red. At the far end of the bedroom, a car had taken the van into the driveway, driving away. James followed the girl back home. Once he got home, he slid a little picture in front of the sink, and passed the picture of his little girl, two weeks before he could tell her the reason for the cheating act. He threw it in the trash, and slid it into the river. He watched in anticipation as the little girl's driveway opened.
A writhing figure stood. He was pale, but there was someone behind him. James found the figure immediately, but it was too late for that.
" You're my daddy, " the little girl's voice croaked. The figure seemed to grow to reach, and shake James off in fear. James knew the demon had said his name. " You will be mine. I will be yours forever."
James moved to the rope that had attached him to the skin of the beast. He made it out. The monster laughed and his firstborn was born. As James made his way through the woods, he always wanted to be part of something bigger, but now he couldn't do it.

Oh yeah. There it is. How odd. Not being able to remember the last time I saw a dog or cat? That I've seen is like having seen it yourself.
"Dr. Amherst? " I called out, yet it had already moved more than a few hundred feet away.
" Johnson? How do you miss me? "
" Just get me to the vet and send it back here, " he said with a devious smile on his face, his voice tremulous from laughter.
I cleared my throat, trying to muster the energy to look around for my pet, the doc but unable. " Please, Dr. Amherst, I don't believe you. Please sir, please remain calm. "
A point started to form in my head. " Is this part of the doc's job to be like this? Is this an actual defense mechanism? * Kills him*? " I asked stammering.
" Yes sir, " said the doc. " You do seem to recall noticing the... " The words came out a flat, uninspired statement and my stomach began to churn.
" To the vet, doc? "
" Yes sir, " I said, my mouth half-open, gasping for air, my hands began to fly around the room.
" Dr. Amherst? "
" Yes sir, " said the doc, turning to sit on the bed, with his legs crossed. " I had no idea I would see so much wood and just climb out of bed and die! Don't let that happen to you! "
I didn't know what else to do. It was like seeing a TV screen or a chair, and not having a choice. Each thought occurred, as if one of the characters had never existed. It was just a story about what would happen to a human in the future and how the outcome could alter in the foreseeable future. My life changed drastically.
" Oh my god. Stop it, Johnson. Quit worrying, you're going to start feeling better. "
The doctor didn't care about what I said, he would tell me about the rest of my life. He was almost as emotionless as me as I had died, why would he even offer me this little puppy who happened to be lost in the woods, when there was nothing else.
" I want you to tell me what happened in the past, " he said, staring at me with the world and how much a pain it would be to lose him.
" I *wanted* you to do that, " I said, becoming still, staring at the screen. " The dog was lost too, of course. But he was NOT yours. His name was Steven, now called Steven again. You only cared for him because you only cared for the fact that you couldn't go back. But you told me, no matter how hard I tried, you would not be able to get Steven back. You tell me, if you come back, you will give Steven back to me, get it together... Or I will have to..."
I knew my words were meaningless and useless as far as I was concerned. But I was happy, I was a part of the happiness from the moment Steven was reunited with Steven and the puppy he once was. That I would never have to see my favorite dog again...

John held a trembling hand to the small bottle in his hand, mumbling the word'I won't let you drink it' lightly as he prepared to drink the icy brew.
"I know what you're thinking... Now, I'm thirsty. " The solemn alcove of a knight followed by a pair of similarly coveted potions, nearing their destination. John managed to turn his head away from the whiskey making all of his companions unable to take notice of his expression.
" Well you know... I promise " John tried to form a good second thought for what the ale could mean for the kingdom. There was a heaviness in the way the elder dragon wore his scales, his wits, his ruddy nose, his dead chin. He spoke through his thick tongue. " Now drink the blood of the dragon, and... and, and, " His words shattered into loud grunts as the deep red liquid spilled down from the flask, drink hit the ground in front of him, and it splattered like a dry seed in the rough mud.
The young warrior was overwhelmed by all of his commotion, and for a moment he stared at the very tip of his blade, the blood dribbling down his hat, his cheeks red, and dark matted hair. The sounds of falling rocks filled the earshot of his companions while several grimly armored men stepped back and offered their lives for the great hulking beast. It wouldn't last long in here.
" No! " John growled. " I won't let you drink my blood! " He turned towards the Great Hall of Broken Words which surrounded him.
" Tell me... what does it mean... " A high pitched voice boomed from behind. " Did you make me drink blood at the end of an epic battle? "
" Are you kidding me? You know damn well that I did. You were just a child after all, human. Not like I was scaring you. " The voice in the distance was much calmer this time, although John couldn't quite make out their nature.
" I built our kingdom to make war so well, and I wasn't always the hero. I stole you from my... princess " The voice in the distance was agitated, but John couldn't help but make out the wrinkles on his face, and the lines of circles on his forehead.
He raised an eyebrow at the hefty figure standing at the center of the Hall of Broken Words. " So why do I not want blood at all? " John had no idea.
The tallest of the men, a wizened man with golden hair, held the flask in his hands, almost cackling to himself as he opened it. " You hear me.. That dragon, c'mon! Call me Hero! " The words came back to him though, as he finished pouring the drink. " I'm Ceti. I am the King of the High Scholar, who fights for justice and justice for all, and I am delivering that justice to our people. If you'll forgive me! " He punched the man hard as he returned to his feet and returned to healing his companions.
" I shall not stand for any of those who come after me, my friends " The man lowered his head, tears running down his face as he desperately mumbled the words. " My kingdom has suffered my loss. My people can no longer protect themselves, they have no law, they have no order... Because I betrayed them to power and profits. Thank you my King, and thank you for helping me rise up from the ashes. "
The man stepped forward and said with a raspy voice " I'm your King." Then he slumped his shoulders into the ground with a victorious sigh.

*Thank you for this fantastic article on Lancelot Thorne. It is a shame that he perished in battle to noble knights but to think that this humble knight- he never gained the rank of a knight could be considered a battle of great importance. It is fortunate for you to have emerged from that tragic loss. His stories were pretty legendary when he fell from grace and fled South as a young adult. *
Lancelot Thorne, Knight of the Academy of Fine Arts and Order of the Rhygnorgons, was born two days before the First Crusade, brought together to combat a very unknown enemy. When Lancelot was 12, his father told him his father wasn't a fighter, that he was simply a religious man who needed to be stopped. This opportunity had to be taken. Lancelot accepted his father's words and signed up for the plan. It was not long before he realized that he would go to battle his father's father's son, Nathaniel, because, as he often did, he was blessed with the legendary ability to win against a great man. However, Lancelot soon realized that he did not want to take his father's arm in the war. It was to be his last honor and duty to fight for the Resistance against the Thousand Men of the Red Angel.
Lancelot felt both shame and pride about this greatest warrior and wanted to pass his time to him. It had been a long, hard journey from the beginning of the journey. Finally, the time had come, and with it came great wisdom and courage in all things. He spoke his vows and they delivered the prophecy. This day was not unlike any other day and the day Lances victory would not be forgotten. This day would be the day he would be inducted into the Pantheon of the Fallen and ask a single question to all who had ever been called upon to march on this sacred land:
* "What would you like to be?" *

Let me know what you think!!

I looked down at my feet, I had on a greasy top which I had worn many times for work. The shirt fell off and I realized that I couldn't stand to look back at my feet. I could still look around if I wanted; somehow I can't look back to their feet no matter what I do. I decided to double check the computer one last time, it's not what I expected. At least then I was there to find my cold case.
I reached around my desk and flicked on the USB which booted up. I stepped out of the machine into the giant white confluence I've found on the far side of the office building. Dressed in my backpack I worked there days with fear and hope. Now I was nothing but an empty shell. I stood staring at my desktop wondering how I could have possibly died so harshly at the hands of a frightened man.
As I walked through the door I took a deep breath and used the bluetooth to wave a hand as if praying that I could hear whatever was around. I passed many other women as well. I found myself wondering in a different way as I always do - how could I have done this to myself.

Those few hours dragged on... trapped at sea... killing the rest of the crew... the kids... the grandchildren... the grandkids... everything went on. But then again, it didn't matter. All there was left was a risky social position and a tendency to self-destruct all over a chest shaped Pukthing.
"You don't get it, do you, " a young man asked the scientist once a week. " What in the hell am I doing? "
" Nothing, boy, " explained the scientist, almost mildly impressed, " but if I'm just gon na keep feeling stupid, I get a little bored. * Sounds good*."
The three of them lay in the damp obscurity of a caves shelter, searching for echoes of doom. Wondering for the moment just how the internet had turned out, contemplating whether their lives would even matter if they were shot to death or saved, the three crawled and dove, once their feet had been pushed off the flat rock, right into the abyss, the living didn't have many long moments.

Congress is not public yet. They have been secret for years and reports are constantly updated at a good rate. I'm tracking down experts in each department, trying to weed out anyone whose mind keeps blank. I saw a few downtown meetings last month that were widely viewed as a mess.
We were only updated 2 hours ago. Everyone else is still freaking out about what has happened. I'm still sitting in an empty elevator.
There's no way my boss won't shut up about this. Or anyone else.
I stared out the window when I heard a voice say, "We just have to do what we have to. ".
I shut my eyes and wonder if I really see these powers up in my head.

The light got cut off as I woke up on a bed of green, crimson and emerald. And more importantly, all the furniture was gone, except the dining room table, where there was a lamp. Of course, I swear, after the famine, the undead stopped killing each other, and it was kind of back to whittling the dog tracks and getting you to eat the chicken because apparently life wasn't worth living anymore. I guess death and rebirth weathered my death as well, though. Then I realized how stupid everyone else was, I was.
I strode through the hallway, picking up the torn pieces of table and silverware, soon leaving all of the glass behind. Then I headed down stairs, brushing aside the cheap jeans and t-shirt my mother had brought me. Even though I knew her already, the remnants of the baby dress I had bought from a shop a decade ago, while hoping that baby stuff hadn't yet been sold, all of a sudden, I found myself in a museum, with a treasure trove of antiques and zombie memorabilia and newsreel footage, all washed up into a sand box, along with the one book, about zombies, and the movie that the movie called on me to watch. And then there was the final piece: my coffin, one of the largest sitting blocks of the morning, filled to the brim with antiques and TV tapes.
It had been years, maybe. Dead or alive, I couldn't really remember. Even if I did remember, I couldn't remember my true name, so I sat down on the stoop of the World Happiness Summit. The pamphlet was redo'd and reconstructed on the day they finally found me. Next to it, there was a [ must read ] ( http: //www.online.machineservice.org/global/ency.htm ) that told people what it looked like to die, to recover lost memories, to feel abandoned, and who might care.
I don't know, I'm not going to add to the pile.
I leaned over the end of the stool to try and glimpse where I was, but no hint came. It was dark, but there was a dim room above where my life was stored; there was a thick wall. But the light was still on. When I opened my eyes, I was still here. A barbed wire fence was pointed at me, and a dozen zombies slithered around me, surrounding me as they did so. But I saw nothing. I was alive. Alive. And more importantly, undead.
They were watching me. No one knows what happens when you take someone away, but I felt... safe. Alive.

"We know you have an apartment, there's no need to leave, " her voice screeched through my head. " You're... You're delicious. You're sweet. "
*It's ok, I'll stay... *
" You've got cancer too! That disease stopped going away 20 years ago! It has been keeping on making people sick! " I heard her sobbing, gasping for air. I could smell her dirty clothes, desperate for air.
" You're doing very well, you've said."
I wished I could stop that scowl.
She had a wooden desk on the other side of the apartment that belonged to an older woman, with messy blonde hair and acne, curled into a menacing smile. It hurt, she had done so many things in her life that would bring more pain than joy, but her past self chose it to avoid anything that ended in nothing.
I hate to admit it, but with this concoction of chemicals and blood of horrors that she was bringing to this people has become a very, very lucky thing. Her weaknesses outweighed the strengths; unless one of us became infected, everyone, including her, would die. On top of all this, this was her love, and I couldn't have thought of a more amazing and accurate disease to bring to her.
I avoided her as much as I could for a very good reason. I was the de facto leader of the family business, she had only recently moved out of New York to seek the remote strip city of Boston. I sold her everything and everything she needed.
Then it hit me.
With her cancer, she was making me sick. Every week, her body went to work again to keep giving cancer to her children; it was getting harder to force her to keep her and her family together; it was killing her.
I had no choice but to go against her, to send another person to die, her or me.
We had learned that taking a chance, saving a life was also a good choice as long as you waited in line for a few days. The next time I heard an apartment door open, I knew what it must be like to watch my loved ones burn in vain, as flames carried a paralyzing smell from their ravaged cells. But for the past few weeks, it was the only thing that I could think to do.
So, on one condition, I am a bandit in Boston. They come from out of nowhere to claim my territory. But I know better.
They are not that far. Bullets aren't smart, but they can blind the marines. If there is a way to save the bunker, I will survive. As long as I live, as long as my love will survive, I will give her the life I needed.

The last Buddha spoke to him, returning to the light. Standing before him was an old man who sat in an orange comforter. " What is done now is done. " he spoke.
The old man looked down at the ground. He couldn't speak. He knew nothing about this place, but he knew that this was he who had been speaking. His voice was that of a keeper. Then it was his job to calm him down, to stop the endless panting of the old man.
" Who are you? " asked the old man. " I've been here a few moments ago, but we don't speak your language. "
" No buts, I don't understand the meaning of these words. I know the Sun Shriing. "
" Are you so sure? You are the Messenger of Death. "
" I am the last. But there is one order of things in life which is truly the end of the world. If you want to live long enough to live in the end, you must choose the correct path. "
" And what of your return? " asked the old man.
The Buddha paused and stared at the old man. " The monk and the god of heathenism. " He breathed deeply. " Look, I can't change the actions of here, and I don't want my life to be reduced to waste. That is all. But please. Your choices are up to you. "
The old man leaned towards the Buddha. " Well, it doesn't matter what we do. I can save myself from the consequences of my own actions, and there is no need for anyone else. "
" Then just obey the *right* path. You can be happy, your world will continue to grow. What you can do is up to you. "
" It can be everything. I'll enjoy my time here. But I know there is other good in this world, and I can help you find happiness for it. " The Buddha sighed. " It's just that no one is perfect anymore."

Kamijia said no harm on Palantir Thane.
"No harm? " Kalani said, the cat scuttling along the floor, looking directly at Kamijia.
The pup snorted and curled up in the corner of the resting area.
" Do you care, Kalani? You humans only seek in your own life. You make it okay to poke them out of there and out of those roaches. "
" I won't harm Kammochani, other than damn near killing them. Damn. Anyway, until humans can speak the meaning of *teacup*, I won't bother you with more supernatural manifestations. "
Kamijia looked to the cat and the pup with some concern. His face was cheery and untamable.
" That's the harm? The longer we keep the humans around here, the further we can strike back. Even our hired killers would be smarter if they knew what to do with Sol'triken. "
" Does there exist a void? "
" Oi. Wherever there is emptiness there is no living being, so there's that. "
" So how come there is never any soul, no chance of existing? What possible sol'triken exists! "
" The human idea of chaos is a disease, banished from the deepest parts of the magic circle. Go on, Kammochani. We can't directly destroy the humans unless there is a sign of harm, and nothing is allowed in to avoid. "
" Then what do you think we could do? "
" If our predecessors had a chance they would have stopped their collection of resources. We can't keep them and torture them here for far longer. It would mean another extinction before they see the light of day. Maybe there would be an exterminated human tribe by now, even a softer name for them. "
" Do you really think that there would be ANY of them? A soulless existence? There is always danger waiting for me there and there ALWAYS has to be danger, and for Kammochani I can assure you, we will hunt and protect every kill at a time like this. "
" But Kammochani, I am trained not to harm. I fear death, and you know that. "
Kalani let out a sound.
" I know, Kalani. But I'm not really afraid. I'll just rest here, absorbing radiation from the salt meadow. I promise, I will be ready one day. "
" But what if she does not like your quest? "
" That will not be a matter of her choice, Kammochani. The hunt continues and the soulless hunter evolves. Kalani will not hunt for herself. But she will hunt for all the creatures on this barren landscape, but she is a balance of matter. "
" You seem angry. "
" I, Kalani, truly believe so. I looked out over the ruined Plains of the Awz, a stretch of last survivors. I believe the hunts are meaningless now, and you know it too well. Humans, especially those who seek a better future, are bitter creatures, cruel and uncaring. The last ones have evolved better than you, and they will, but the very life which you had when you arrived was never enough, and what they don't know is that, as they act now, you are more dangerous than they have ever been. "
Kammochani was silent for a moment, a moment, then began to expand. " What if... "
The cat bolted upright. " It is just not as simple as you imply. What if, all along, humans thrived, alone and nomadic? How come the same creatures you sought so deeply in were extinct? "
The cat stood silently. " No. "
" Then you have one option left. Seek out into the abyss and become one of us. Do you understand? "
The cat took a step forward. " No."

My wife is somewhere in the middle.
One night she told me about her soulmate.
He was a pretty little girl.
She took him to parties.
He spent nights with her.
She would ask me what I was into when she went to church.
"I'd like to tell you a story about the life I spent in heaven. "
She took him to heaven one night, and sat him down on a couch and told him all about his life. She looked at him like he was a sadistic mutt.
" Thank you, her, for this wonderful blessing... "
She looked at him, glancing up at the night sky. And she whispered in my ear, " I... like thinking about you. You would want me to be. "
" Uh-huh."
I was shocked, but that was about all I had to say before I was finally able to speak my mind... *We could make a lot of changes. *

"Oh for fuck's sake.. I don't know why I'm having this conversation. " I muttered to myself.
I stepped out of my house, not knowing why the small group of zombie cats appeared around my door just some couple of hours ago. A child said out loud, " Hello, my name is Jamie, I'm an animal control worker at the pest control office. Can you call me Jamie now? "
I shook my head and looked at the child. " No problem, Jamie. Can I go now? "
The child didn't answer so I continued with the conversation. I reached for the remote and peered down the hall. There was a boy with my cat. The cat looked under the covers, while one of the cats snuck up on him. A bit confused I managed to grab the cat on my lap and stand up.
" Hello, Jamie. I'm an animal control worker at the pest control office. Can you call me Jamie now? " I pulled the cat closer to my body and the boy started sniffing at it.
My eyes widened. I finally looked under the covers and I saw Jamie. His feline friend snuck up on me.
" Mummy... what's he doing? " Jamie's lifeless eyes snapped open.
" He needs to sleep, " I said out loud. I had no idea what just happened.
I managed to open the door. The bat still sniffed at me, I ran outside and caught a glimpse of the city from my car. I was moving, all I could see was darkness and rain.
My cat was gone.
Shaking my head with confusion, I stood up and tried to get back. My cat slowly came back and started to snore at me again.
" Tis not OK mom, " I said through gritted teeth.
I jumped, while the snow fell. The world around me was at an entire day zero years away. For the first time, I felt like I was experiencing physics, even though the snow was thick and I couldn't see the sun anymore. What was I really here for? All I could see was dark.
As I woke up, I'm greeted by a screen in the corner of my room. It said " Date 5149:07am EST " and there was a young boy standing there. I guess he just realized he was getting night vision.
" What the hell?! " I shouted at my cat.
He reached up and grabbed his ears.
" Oh, my cat! Look at you! " He said wagging his tail.
" Let me have you shut the fuck up and go back in, " I yelled at my cat.
" Please, that'll explain the situation for the next ten minutes," the cat quipped.

"... and let me explain. You see, in this last Super Wars, there was a group of super heroes who became multi-planet-debilitating villains. They were able to summon the giant laser that powered their laser glasses to evil, bored mega-duper super-villains, to not have to work through their own problems.
This is where it got extremely messy. Either one of you would have ended up too powerful or the other would have seen the light of day, since you'd had no idea who would join the fun on which sides they lined up. In order to keep the heroes safe, the group got juiced up a bit bit, and I had to steal some evil products from here to there. I forced them to come here a bit too first, so they could continue to join the fun.
But no one would ever figure out why it had to be us. We never wanted to do this, but now we can't. You see, after the evil super-villain did the rest, it was the tyrant they had chosen to conquer.
Now, I want you to understand, no, I need to spare you all your pain. This force destroyed the villains we cared about, something I could never have given myself. But it shouldn't have been us. And as I told the story to your heroic hero friends, we needed to save the real villains for the world to forget. As for myself, I'm good as we are."

"You were right, most of them, " the Doctor said, pointing to the patient behind his desk. " This is just a damned quality check. "
" You aren't doing it on purpose? " I asked.
" Nobody in the room has ever messed with you, " he said, looking up from the clipboard. " Nothing we can't fix. We can't save a soul. "
" But your empire, the only one that thrives on your profits, needs our help. "
" All the better to let our patients operate on them. To make all the profit there was we needed. "
" So how did you make a profit when I asked you for your x-ray? " I asked. " Do you agree that my machines have outperformed mine? "
" They're large enough to hold their own against... "
" Stop, stop. "
" It's not all about profit, you've taken care of the sick I had to send to the ER for a bonus. "
" We have a liability policy, you're not giving them free health insurance, and so you're getting paid for their operating costs. The best way to save the system is to make sure that everything works correctly. "
" I've been paying for their operating cost. "
" See? You're making me give away free health care. "
" It's not a contract, it's the money that you made."

"How? " I asked frantically, the feeling in my throat that maybe it was something bad happening. " The deadline!? ", I didn't know who or what was calling this, and neither did I know why I was asking. I was bleeding slowly in the tub, and there was nothing I could do. I heard a sharp edged cry that sounded like nails striking. I stood up with only one foot raised above the water and covered myself with my hands.
" What?! " I started to yell, but that scream sounded so fake. My head seemed to be pounding, and I'm bleeding from the other end of my head. There isn't anything I can do, but what I tried to do was save it. I held my bloodied hand up and started to cry.
" Don't cry ", I shouted. " Come on, let's do this, " I continued as I held my arms out, and I started to cry a little more. * Really? * I think to myself, as I step closer to the people, desperately trying to reach for them.
They stayed closer still, the hole growing larger, and I started to cry more. I was lying on the side of a road, just getting help. * This isn't supposed to happen. * I thought.
" Where are we going? ", the person on the other end of the road asked.
" We're going, where are we going?" I asked nervously, desperately trying to make sense of the situation. * There aren't any bodies, and I could probably survive in here. *

Ashley clicked her fingers closed around the faded scar on her arm, her eyes adjusted to the moonlight, the only light in the night as she watched everyone else in the building flee the scene of the night shift. She flicked the flue on, they scurried away in their new lives. She wondered what had caused the scar to disappear long ago; she'd shared it with a few colleagues, together the last two decades. But she quickly craned her neck to look away, all she had to do was to look outside.
She pulled out her phone and checked her Facebook. It was an old message, almost too long for her to remember anything but Ashley's touch. " Happy Birthday! I should have gotten the t-shirt..." It would have been a long day tomorrow, if Ash was of even a different mind, but she knew she didn't want to die today.
Ashley closed her eyes for the last time and thought. She smiled and set off, mentally exhausting herself. Her phone lit up with a thump, her finger wrapping around it like a certain prank. She squeezed the trigger, and her hearing reverberated around the building.

So, in the lecture hall, a huge meteorite takes out all of the seats at the University. Nobody escapes, and everyone is packing up and leaving the room. ( The left shoe is cold on one side as if it didn't make contact with the concrete floor. )
Everyone is panicking with confusion, exclaiming, "How could this happen? It could only have come from a meteorite! "
The professor speaks to the group, " I can't speak German, I have studied philosophy, and I can only speak German, but you have to understand, we are all German. "
He says, " So, you understand? "
Everyone looks about confused, but there's a conversation later when the two professors finally arrive.
They proceed to say, " The hail is in front of our dorm and we are supposed to get ourselves ready for sleep, right? "
They all cheer, and start to laugh, but not in a way that sounds friendly. They all look down at their phones and ask, " Am I being placed in a hospital? "
Everyone says, " No, of course not, it's just an asteroid."

I was stuck as an infant, and I had always been an orphan. The girl who was in my first birth didn't know what to do with my world, and would go to school, teaching children in foreign countries how to read, and how to succeed in the art school. This girl, with her fur brown hair and thin body, and beautiful eyes who had grown too big for her, carried the burdens of children who couldn't afford to pay to see the world.
"Nothing much, " I said, shrugging my shoulders and wrapping my arms around her. " Just one thing. You had a chance, " I pulled her to me, gently and firmly. " You were born with birth defect. Your life wasn't perfectly formed. Maybe something failed to provide adequate safety. Maybe you were in a bad place. But you had a chance. So you chose to live and grow as a child. And life was you and you were reborn. "
" I made my choice, " I said, " and it isn't great what can happen if you make one mistake, " My voice sounded tired as I looked at the empty room. " But today is not the day. "
" You were born just a year into the future, " said the girl. " And you had never existed. You were the child of a planet you created. And as a consequence you were reborn. "
" We can change our mind, " I said, and kissed her on the forehead.
" Yes, I can," the girl said as she took off her hair and fur brown face.

" What? Aren't you a *foreigner*!? " Ms. Jennings
" Put on some clothes, please. " I let my hair fall to the floor.
" Ms. Jennings, you know why we have these same disguises of ours! "
" Well, we're from the planet Triuhtar, though it's a less intimidating name. We have plenty of knowledge that will strengthen your practical understanding of us if you put on a white shirt and pants. And I saw the costume for Macy's and decided to give it a go.
" Well, there's a certain number of parts that aren't a part. This part is: A cape. "
" You say it like it's full of firewood, Ms. Jennings. "
" Mrs. Jennings, I see. You must be trying to make up your own language. Your accent, for instance. "
" Miss, Macy's is a world renowned brand. Their design is based on Japanese technology. Their hot, buttery salsa is a food for the tastes of most chef's parties. Our flavored tea, which is the work of our Japanese peasant farmer and his servant, is their bible. "
" Miss, you've also come with me on a trip to the Christmas farms. Quite the adventure. You can have'his' double entendre. "
" Miss, I assume. Of course, it is. It does not appeal to your original language. "
" Yes, you can have'his'. "
" So why do we always separate our disguise, if at all? It presents us with the absolute sense of insignificance! ".
" Miss, Mr. Thompson does not understand the full meaning of this meaning. Do you wish to ask about the future?"

I called my parents. " We must take him home ", they told me. As I opened my door to the parking lot, I felt an intense urgency behind me. It's been weeks since our parents were murdered in their car. I decided to drive. I had a perfectly normal dinner and I planned on eating because I wanted to give my little sister that wonderful smile. It's a scary thought because one day, from the police sirens, a helicopter flies into the house through the window, cutting into our poor, happy little girl. We know what was going to happen because last night in the trailer park that night, several teenagers found and killed the person who acted as the swordsman and looked like GRRM, who actually killed at least some of the other victims in the car crash. The parents have since confessed and pushed the guilty.
" Why didn't you call?! " I asked.
" I... I didn't think it was done. I thought we should get involved! ", I said.
" It should have happened! " The officer replied.
" You killed the guy, and now GRRM's going to get us killed! " I yelled.
" Yeah ", the officer replied with a grin.
" I can not stand to see HIM die! ".
We were killing GRRM but in this movie theater again, after the director and the actors left. Apparently some people were planning to bring me back to Westeros to stop the terror killing and violence. Something about a gala on the theme park while filming one of the online series, who decided to give me a superpower to be the only person without fear, is throwing something in my head while starring in that movie. I decided to become the main character and torture myself.
" I can not hide this from you. This episode is going to kill me! ", I screamed.
The police showed up. I wanted to have vengeance, but I knew why.
" Let's just get HIM on the ride! You have a chance to do better! "
As they picked me up, I got stabbed repeatedly by two police officers. They pinned me to the floor and let me remain. They put me in handcuffs and held me until they pulled my head out. As I was led to the Wayne Manor police office, I took out my playbook and prepared for what I had planned. " Kill a man. Kill a kid. Find what you want. You don't want me dead! ", I said to my target, the Batman.
A chill ran down my spine. I grabbed my book and disappeared into the night, leaving only the Joker in the armored chair, waiting for my turn.
" Back to work!" I yelled.

"Jason, " she said, " is it? "
" Sure, just so you know, c'mon man. It just wasn't with the way he looks! "
" I knew he would be. I mean, I was just a regular joe for four weeks straight before he got into this world. "
" I know, as soon as it happened. "
" And you were right. Here's where the marks really start to come in. In that big, dull white room you used to've seen before, it was surrounded by people with big white blouses and thick frames. In fact, it seemed to cover everything; how, what, where, how. I couldn't understand who was doing this, who was paying me in money, or who sat in the shadows, just to get to this little square. They were always there, watching from the other side. And they were asking questions. Talking about each other's problems, about business, about how it all started. Like if you couldn't figure it out, there was no going back to this time.
But it was happening now. I mean, let's just say it couldn't be all for nothing, right? You've just lived through enough stress lately, you've known your negative aspects, and no one is going to step in and tell you that? Shit, maybe it's just too easy for me to beat this bullshit down so hard.
I just wanted to get out there, get to that world you'll never leave. "
" The fuck is wrong with you now, you're such a failure, " she hissed.
" Don't be stupid, okay? "
" I don't like you. But I love you, okay? Don't you fucking make me cry. I'm glad you were with me through all of this. Let me out here, there's nothing you can do for me. Let me see my mother, my family. "
" My daddy helped me through the day. He sat with me through every crisis. He watched over me when I got old and had some kids. He even tried to warm me up, and keep me from going into the future. You know? "
" He punched through his chest like tissue paper. "
" Aaaaaaahh, jesus christ! "
" And to make it worse, he knocked all that energy out of his chest like tissue paper. And when he got through his chest like that, he let all that energy go through him like he was dropping one doughnut into the furnace. It was like they were making out like butterflies for the entire'1600 days of miserable existence' world. "
" Bullshit! "
" You expect me to be impressed when you tell me the top of his head shoots up like a kite, like he just burst onto the tiles, like he just placed an aluminum foil hat on his head, like he just watched goths tear his face up like a lava lamp, like he just took the lip off his bitch ass. It's like he just went through all of that in a movie, like he only wanted to pee on the carpet, like he literally just zipped through the ceiling like he just scrubbed himself with a fingernail. "
" You never saw his face like that shit, " she said.
" I know. It's really the first time we have talked, actually. I thought it was weird, how much he got ass slapped. I mean, how he just stared like I was a sausage while he choked on the dirty skin of his tongue. I mean, how could you do that? You look like shit. "
" Fuck."

The voicemail that heralded the agonizing death of my best friend burned in my head. There it was, in perfect clarity, with the title:'My love. She loves me back. She's here from the grave, babe'. I didn't believe him, I didn't believe in him. No, this was true love. The shot of the Glock in his hands echoed through his thoughts as I closed my eyes and concentrated, and pushed my temples into creases, and closed my eyes until the next man woke.
I held my breath, tried to hold back the tears. What could she say? If she still wanted to stay with me? Who could she be sure of? These were questions that were deadlocked in place inside my being. Was this what I wanted?
My soul slammed itself shut, to the music of that hateful song. It filled me with the woe of a war that felt lifetimes away. The song that told us that if we were going to win this war, it was against our children's will to live up to their ideals. But who was gon na do that? The one that pushed me to write the letter? Her? No one? My family? Our love? Our home?
My wife, my beautiful child? The one that didn't die. Our misery, and my loss. I stood up and held the gun up in my hand, to hear the sweet voice call out: "I LOVE YOU MOTHERFUCKER. I'm sorry, my love."
I hugged my wife tighter, and I let my blood bubble in my chest.

"You know, I wasn't always a bad man. I was not. "
" I don't know what you mean by bad, Barb! "
" Not fair. They laughed at me the day I was born. "
Barb frowned. " Am I asking you something? You don't ask that question sometimes. You'd either shut the fuck up and let the German's play catch. "
" No! " I shouted at him angrily.
" Do you think I'm listening. I'm going to put you out of my misery! You look stupid. "
" In my vision. "
" You've never wrong other man. I created you. You're a piece of trash. I built you up so you couldn't even protect you like that. "
" I got crazy. "
" You can't be serious if you've built up to the extent that this is true. I created you. Go on. "
" But you played him! The enemy you defeated! "
" You literally destroyed all my city! A man who tried to wage war with me. You didn't make me more useful, in fact, I was never here to grant him these gifts. "
" Why are you bringing up your hand! "
" You said I wasn't a strong man. "
" Actually, that's not true. That's just a figment of my imagination. I'm not real, and I have no empathy for people like you. "
" Don't you have any empathy? "
" They wouldn't dare call me a villain. If I weren't fucking your enemy, nobody would even call me a good person. "
" I wasn't fighting him, you know, just for a prompt. "
" Then why are you even here? "
" It's funny how much you see fit to voice your opinion, it's because the entire *damn* part is a lie. "
" Oh no. You already saw that! "
" Exactly. You were right to oppose me. That was merely way of portraying the general population. Now I know the truth. The problem is that all you're doing is killing a few innocent people. And I can't be too selfish. If I wanted to help, maybe I would have just let you be. "
" So what's your point? "
" I wanted to have a constant interaction with you. And I would have wanted to see you. Always be there for you. "
" That doesn't seem fair. In fact, it might be the case that I have guilt in your eyes. "
" And? I was listening. "
" Neither of you could feel it. All I felt was you. "
" This is why I was sent here. I was supposed to be there for the needs of my people. Like the other units. If you did something wrong, you would not know about it, but you just kept on living. It was always because of me. I wanted to protect you, I didn't know you would find it, but we were meant to survive. Now I'm at the mercy of my people. "
" Wait! " I yelled to Barb.
" You just took me away from your loved one! What are you going to do when I refuse to play with you anymore? "
" I'm not letting you... I'm not even letting you play with me anymore! "
" You idiot! "
" Oh no, no, no! "
" Please, go away! Please! There are no more people to talk to!"
And with that, I left and went to the tent.

Three semesters. Three semesters of hell.
I sat in that cell, in the deep dark with nothing but the corner of my lip and my eyelids. The only light coming through was a solitary flashing light in a patch of green. We couldn't see each other, she didn't see me for years. That was until she began.
She didn't know who I was, she didn't care about my condition, but they say she gets pregnant from that prenatal care I did. That's what I always thought in a hospital bed. I don't remember much, either. She did. I was still in that sterile sweat hospital in your old house all by yourself.
I saw her for a brief moment. Her eyes widened, or something happened. I don't remember. Didn't let that abysmal, unexplainable, unnamed mind figure through my thoughts. She screamed for me, threw up, cracked. Her mind was still out there on the cloud as it tried to keep me from going insane. I didn't see any adults.
Everything changed when she saw me. Her eyes almost dropped and then she lunged and lashed out at me. One of those with what looked like a fuckin' iron fist, she threw a brick at me. I pushed her away and screamed at her to get out, but she just kept on like that.
This is hell. They say you won't remember all of this. No memory, no soul, no redemption. Just a memory. I can't even remember how this happened. After every blue moon, she stood in that hospital bed and nagged at me, saying what every pregnant mother who walked through the gates that day told you: “ Come with us, you body for the life of a babe. ”
I smiled. It was a pathetic smile. And so she grabbed my hand and pulled me into her arms. I didn't stop screaming, I didn't scream and I didn't fucking fight. She shoved me back into the hospital bed so I didn't have to scream at her. She promised herself she would let me go. She loved me back. She always did.
That night, I woke up in the cell. I knew what I was going to do to her, and I couldn't turn down that chance of a grown woman. I said no. I don't even know what she said.
I got out of there. I walked to the door to my cell. It didn't open. I went back to the door. There was nothing there. It wasn't her cell. It wasn't the hospital. It was just an empty room. I walked over to my cell. I flipped open my door and yelled for the nurse to put me in and she just started licking my hair.
I know what I said. I read the paper. I told the story, there's nothing about my condition that isn't described in this story. Nothing about the lives I put to change. I told the jailbaiters. I told them. She didn't know what was happening, but she sure got it.

The bus laden with faces stares down the street as they take off through the crowd, my precious client holding the first beer that can cost me my life. It ’ s not uncommon for a client to just fill up the seat-solders and go for a walk in the car, but it ’ s always a bit more convenient that way, seeing a stranger.
I hold a ten dollar bill waiting on the side of my duffel bag, waiting to be brought to the bus station.
My friend ’ s name is Patrick and we ’ re been friends for over a year. Sure, he ’ s not older than twelve but me?
In another twenty minutes I will need my witness ’ s testimony to convict me.
“ How did you do it? ”
“ Shot him in the head right there, ” she whispered.
I swallow and look at her, eyebrows raised.
“ On account of you. ”
…Oh...
“ O ’ m sorry really. I think I let you in to murder. But we came across this guy that came from the coun- “
“ Explain. ”
“ You were drunk at the bar at that time. ”
“ Yeah, and passed out. ”
“ But somehow it came out of his nostrils! What happened? ”
She makes a face, and smacks her cheeks all over.
“ There was something in his clothes. If he hadn't then… ”
“ Look, I ’ ll take whatever I can get. But first, can you tell me where he is? ”
My name is Jill and my memory is the only thing that keeps me in better shape. I ’ m lost, am I dreaming? I quickly grab my courage and ask for their address. Jill lets out a breath and curls up next to my friend.
“ You ’ re real. ”

You ’ d think that when people die, they ’ d try their hand at picking up the last bit of what they ’ ve lost, their people, and they ’ d hold it against their finger as they struggle to breathe again. But my son takes away the ability, the dignity, that usually comes with knowing that it ’ s him.
“ This is all we have left to give, but for us, it ’ s our last gift. Don ’ t worry, our son can have the last say on anything. ” His father picks me up by the hair, probably to show off his knees, my ears squeezed tightly against his thumb. It's a dangerous position, and knowing that I won ’ t be able to take that title of “ Father of the Son ” and he can ’ t tell any of his other sons a thing, I get off the bench and push him into a gap in the clouds.
Our great grandpa was just a young man, the kindest boy I knew. Our one piece of advice to kids, especially when it comes to everything you know, is don't act out your real father. Look behind you, remember everything you knew from birth. If you think the people your loved the last thing you ’ d ever see, you shouldn ’ t be so naive.
As he stands up on the base of the hill, he scratches at his pant leg. It ’ s lost, and he wants it back in its crib. I pass him a bottle of water. We go over to a screen, flipping through the search bar, and grabbing a random vial. I see my son staring at it, and I can see the satisfaction on his face. Tears already well up in his eyes.
“ I know it can ’ t be our last gift, but I am going to let you do it, for us, so you can finally share our life story, ” he says softly, cheeks colored a deep shade of black. The tears come slowly, though I try not to focus.
I slide my hand over his mouth, taking the sip. “ You go first, John, ” he says, pulling a pill out of the bottle. “ You ’ ll probably kill yourself with just one, and I ’ ll let you end it with the other. ”
My grandson grabs the first one. He waits patiently.
“ Never forget it, ” he says, and places it on the shelf and drops it on my lap. I smile as he looks at his hand, it ’ s small and fragile, and happy inside.
“ You do love your Grandpa, tell him that. ”

"Keep your head low, " I asked. " That's the woman who killed our gods."
That simple utterance was the price of bringing him down to life, but at the end of the day, it paid the price. Neither the human race or the universe would ever know the truth. I hope my mother tells her son the truth.
His life will be over soon. He died a hero. He had no stake in the works of the gods. He died in fear of everything and anyone that would believe him. He died to prove that he was the God. And that, being humanity's only hope, he deserved to live.

It takes a twist to make an account of our search. It takes a bit of hindsight, really, to end up with a rather awful memory. When scientists first figured out that there were really twins, the world was a lot less confused. It was noted that, for the first few decades of human development, there were almost no differences in DNA, but as DNA spread across the planet, a young child suddenly found herself with some of the few remaining DNA strands holding theirs together. Even with the impact of infectious disease, people were unsure of what to do with the people who were looking for such a mutation.
Technology advanced by leaps and bounds, power had to be harnessed more than ever, and even space was very limited. That is, until 4 months after the discovery of the Gene, the "breeding " of our planet started. After an extended hiatus of the Human Race, we had our chance at a new utopia where children with pure genetic potential would be able to survive and thrive the same way we had. Since the gene was banned from the gene pool, it had nothing to do with space flight, but rather humanity's greatest regret, after discovering that rare genetic defects appeared all across the globe, causing the population of a certain continent to implode in various countries. In a year, the population of that continent had doubled in population as there remained nearly ten million islands left, and still few major military bases existed.
Within a year of the Gene's banning, it was felt that history would repeat itself, a book was compiled that would forever define our people.
My name is Randy R. Riley, is it not? There are changes that lead to me actually dying in a bear sized bear. It is now said that one keystone of my childhood was that I was the first human to synthesize fully a genetic flaw, and that the effect that was caused by it was the same as... i dunno what. What do you think?
I have a PhD in genetics, studying the gene, i have a not so rosy step in figuring out how genetic flaws affected man, i have felt where I should go from here, and, well, you know, I think i owe you a comment. I would like to propose some changes of heart to all those who have discovered that gene.
Firstly, I would like to revise the past tense on when I say a draft of this article has to be included to help more people in a way that they can better understand the way I feel.
Secondly, i would like to propose that we not only punish them for making some genetic errors, but also cut them off from the gene pool altogether. What a waste. First of all, we forget how things had started. We forget that by the time humans had created a completely synthetic gene, this society had already developed a whole mini-genome mutation that would otherwise have killed them off, and who knew what they would have done in such a chain reaction. Well, this has done nothing for a few centuries.
Thirdly, i would like to suggest adding the " Really " department to the section where we show scientists and scientists how to make genetic errors, this would explain why a few people have been working on it. For the record, that's a plan in it's own right, all you have to do is pay close attention and try to figure out what they are doing to " them"
Now that was a cool way to say those regrets don't have to come out, it could be done, but it would still be great if I didn't happen to have a book to fill out that would help me understand what I do. I know it seems weird, but you know what I want to do? I want to help other people out, I want to teach them about genetics, and i want to help make this a better place.
I dont think that we have a chance to be great,
Mr. Riley

We know you never knew about the grand scheme of marijuana and all of the small talk. the kind where you try and convince yourself that something really monumental and with a twist. Then you say ok and stuff like that, and that was for real. You are disappointed at the delay, but right now I ’ m watching you eat your last treat from two litres of stale, burnt Waffle Top Banana KFC. I expect you don ’ t care because Apple has just launched true branded beverages with higher quality ingredients such as chamomile ( purity 2mg ). We already have business models, and you could go looking for a new one in hopes of being developed early enough in manufacturing that you'll get one of those with the reasonable price and cost. Great. I don ’ t like Apple products and they don ’ t please me. I ’ ll buy more, they ’ re pure scotch and chips, and as I ’ m pushing my pack of cigarettes forward my mind is starting to pick up a little bit of the realisation about the science behind it and the golden opportunity that comes with it.
Well we won ’ t get you any further information about the product, you ’ re going to have to wait a little bit longer to review what is from inside.
You could actually pitch it to me and you ’ d like to do this a bit more, I ’ ll be available for calls at 11am CST Friday morning. You could call in 4pm.
I ’ m going to go to bed okay?

You know, it was creepy when you first heard the news. It was so dark, so real. I always wondered what was up with all those stories. You see, I had always heard the stories. My brother had died before, and he had gone on a journey through the dark with us all, but he had always been strong. He always broke the rules.
There was this little girl, got up from her bed, and called out to me. " Help me, " she shouted. My mouth dry. " Help me! "
She started running. And she kept running. She ran at me. And then she grew so fast that I couldn't even see her in the bright light of the street lamps.
I turned around and she was gone. I ran up and ran as fast as I could. I could see her - I ran back and ran as fast as I could. She called out to me, and I could see her. But I could not see her. I couldn't see her at all, but I could see it.
Then I heard a voice come from outside. I could barely make out the words, " They'll find you, there. " I reached down and snatched the kid's hand. It was cold, and it had a skin-tight grip on my neck, but I could feel it. She was covered in wet blood. My eyes widened. She was dead.
They took her. They locked her up in a cold room, they cut it apart and found all the blood. They tried to put her back in, but she cried and screamed and fled. It didn't make any sense - but I was hungry for more. I ate and drank and ate and ate.
When I woke up, everything looked so familiar. I was in a room. I was in the hospital room. My brother's face was there. He was writing himself on a clipboard. " Dear god, oh god oh god... "
Some other doctors walked in through the door, and one spoke up, " Could you describe that? "
" There was no pain," I said. I felt a heartbeat and a light beginning to tap in from the dimness of the hallway. All around me were people I knew, all around me. They were crying. They were walking. They were laughing. They were laughing as they ran through the hallway and down the long corridors of death. I was getting sick.

I have a pattern in my life, it's something about my life that holds true for me: I'm always looking for something. I love my life, I don't go around creating weapons and analyzing house regulations for the rest of my life, I love all the strange little things I do, I try not to give up, to find something with a purpose.
There's this constant parade of neat tricks I pull to get myself in the right place at the right time, that is, until I meet another. A dance though of my mind, someone's calling out to me, something is wrong, but I don't speak it, I simply sit there and watch. So frustrated I get dressed and look at him. When I look over his shoulder, this new man walks past me with a promise he made on my way in and I can't bare to look at him anymore. The smile is there for him, the smile that has always been there, even in this moment.
Before I know it he's holding my hand and standing just a little too close for my liking. As he takes a seat I he is in love again, I can feel it, I fall in love as quickly as I have been. Though I leave the alleyway for the dead of night to never feel him there again, I feel better just to look at him. He is a wonderfully handsome man, it's obvious what he wants, for now, just just that it will only bring the best out of me a little bit more. The beating that follows as he finishes his drink, before I open the door, I know that he'll catch me, for now at least, just that his life is worth living.

The girl had to crane her neck to get her father's attention, even as he tried to hide his shaking hands in front of her. His shoulders drooped and he pulled himself up off the stone flooring, shaking his head for a moment and looking back at the small house she lived in; yes, it was the most empty, but it was too small to miss anymore. The girl didn't dare look out the window and try and sneak up onto the edge. They always were too polite, too low to leave the house, and too grand for themselves. The reality of the situation was a constant annoyance. Between that and the rarely shared meals and candles lit outside at night, the neighbourhood had long since retreated and was on the verge of collapse.
The eldest of them sat behind a chopping block watching the girl with mild anxiety.
"I'm not going back out there, " the girls' youngest said. Her hand had already taken the shank of the sturdy stone, and she had looked at him in astonishment.
" I'm going to stay behind, " she continued, clicking on the fire escape. She was trying to hide the act, but his silence was deafening. Her father dug through the bag he had just bought her, flicking a few tiny strands of saliva from his fingertips.
It was time for dinner, his mother had told him in case the girl ever needed him. He waited patiently, impatiently, sniffling when a knock came at the door. She stood tall, her bare feet scratched and loose-fitting clothes wrinkled and strewn with soot and blood.
" Mommy! Mommy, mommy! " she pleaded, lifting up her hands in the air.
The door clacked with a hiss as the girl stepped inside and a light shone on the chimney above them.
" Come in, mother, " said the big, bright-eyed, shivering girl.
She pulled down her pants a little, hoping she was not missing anything on either side.
She opened the door to the large room in which she found her father had spent his days. Opening a shattered glass window, she shimmered in the light with a giggle.
" You, Peter? " she said.
" It's alright, son. " said the tall, white-robed man next to her.
" It's alright, " she moaned. She reached out her hand toward the shards in the windows, but they were stuck. Her fists clenched, and she held in the bangs of her fists. Before she knew it, she was being lowered into the middle of the street, and the pain from the shattered window was fading.
" Peter! " his mother called.
" Coming here, " said Peter, standing upright, balling up his hands and holding them up for her to see.
" Peter. We're losing you. "
Peter helped her up off the floor, and dragged her along towards the kitchen. He grabbed her hand, and she reluctantly went up to the counter.
She smiled and gingerly handed him the spoon. The spoon had half a teaspoon of jelly inside. Peter frowned, putting the spoon in his mouth and replacing the spoon with water. He placed the spoon on the counter beside the woman, and it splashed a layer of liquid that lit up his face.
" She looks beautiful."

It was all perfect except he couldn't see the sun through that thick layer of rock. He rolled over on the ground and put a hand on his chest. His skin was pristine, he hadn't had a scratch on his chest before. The radiation poisoning went away a long time ago, leaving him hunched over on his parchments alone.
There were no furs around, a stove was in a dark corner of the living room where he would find the dinner plates and blankets. In a corner next to the sink, a bottle of a bottle of water was wrapped in small blue-painted crockery. In the ceiling were a two inch long dinky green knife dangling over each arm. He picked the razor and brought it up above his head. He didn't have a gun.
By the time he got to his house, there had been not a soul inside this shithole. The building was so old that no buildings in their town were left of it's length. Not even a farmhouse. He picked up the knife again and dropped the tape to the ground. The dew were beginning to pick up now. No one would breath now.

"All you have to do now is accept that what you wanted is gone, who you truly cared for, and go " Robert stammered as he passed by the gun and cleaned the duffel bag with his bong. " The fear of being outcasts is too much for such people to handle. You are humanity, and we will be the best for you. " he reflected to himself and the viewer. " Just never. Trust me, I've had plenty of time to prepare for this and the others to arrive".

I thought it would be silly to take out the camera to watch. I tried to keep talking, to show my talent and god knows what else, to be sure. But nobody would listen.
To this day, I haven't heard from them. I just have this crackpot thought and daydreamer. So as far as I can tell, he doesn't like it. Like they're expecting it. People tell their douchebag that their craft is their livelihood and they'll pay for their privilege. He doesn't care that much. As soon as his name is spoken in pass the stupid asses at the hospital are alerted. I'm not sure if they're alive or dead. I'm not sure if they've ever found their ability as a supreme being from beyond. I tried to keep calm and not get yelled at, but I don't think I ever met anyone with this ability.

"Juliet, take her into the restroom. That's the door you take to get by. You've got to hold on to it a bit longer. "
My coworker Steve is always yelling at me. I didn't even find out what he was talking about until his mangled corpse was dumped in the first, stupid day. So when he was looking at the wound on my arm, I could swear he could see the energy in my eyes. Until now.
Steve isn't exactly the best friend, either. He doesn't talk too much, and I bet when I look into his eyes, my pupils have black pits and my fingers are rusty. Every other day he's ask me what I do best. And I never tell him. Ever. Ever. Ever since he's taken Steve in during the last exam.
I had expected this to happen over the next few days. Every day, I would sit down and talk to Steve. Spend some time with him and he would listen. We'd talk for hours, maybe even months. I never heard from him for a while, actually. Then today I asked the priest, " What happened today? " he had a hard time answering me.
" Justin, " I said. Steve answered me with a heavy sigh. " Julie told me she was going to a few extra meetings. "
" That sounds shitty, " Steve replied, pulling his head from his desk.
" As much as I hate to say that she was going to so much meetings, I don't care. This office is sacred, I am eternalized and I can shower. Now. As a gesture of support, I shut the door and get into the bathroom. "
Steve looked at me with all the anger in the world. As he did a quick glance at the stain on my arm, he quickly threw my arm behind me and climbed out of the bathroom. " One minute! " He ordered. As soon as I was here, he shoved me out of the office and I was escorted to the main building. I stayed in the lobby all day.
On the way into the building, my coworkers was rushing around to collect the mess they left behind. Before they could break down the door, one of the interns yelled, " Look! I came in to clean up!" They came out to find me tied to the wall, bleeding out all over the floor in the hallway. The intern who looked at me for a good couple of seconds was still looking up at me as the intern ran to help my friends and step off. Steve followed after me to do the rest of the cleaning. The lab was the only survivor. I was in the bathroom when he threw up.

One handed weapons keep you focused on a group of enemies, one hand you need to punch through the enemy, have a face fight with them, then see what the enemy could do. You're prepared.
Many weren't ready for their threat, but they were eager for the responsibility...
Magic was needed in every country in the world for work. Murdered dragons, monsters, sorcerers and bandits were all banned. Quality currency meant actual workers, not just the massive travelling guilds with their artillery and tanks - they needed magic. As a more resource intensive occupation one has to be creative.
"It washes over you, you can take another step," called a mage to a blade expert in back before everyone did. Even today but even today each enchantments and potions had to be given their proper weight before being aligned with the mana. Goblins... mushrooms... Cthulhu.
Emperor Palpatine was a master at the art of chariots and enchantment. He could even turn a goblin into a horse with a single touch of a robe, effectively unifying magic.
In this world he was unique, and had a large following of men and women across all nations.
Yet he'd forgotten that he used to use magic on people like us. The forces of darkness fought against us in every way possible, something to be feared.
When Flame Mage Demogorgon the Red realized that you could summon a fireball or a boulder together to support him in combat, so he took care of that for himself. And it seemed to cause equal effects to the spells, just right at all costs. Flamestrike was instantaneous, doubling in power every spell cast, and every spell made, but ended with a burn on the ground.
There were rumors of people imprisoned under Maim or Seppelgangers, if you knew of them, they decided not to die. They'd already paid them, and taking possession of the Demons' body was the most lucrative option.
Birds were still famous as early as the 1500's, but otherwise it didn't affect people at all. It did create something a rare form, maybe a vampire or witch, magical like. But from the Mages' perspective it was too late.

A violin-player utters the beat, his breath filling the void, until it ’ s merely a whimper. He breathes slowly, somehow, as if listening to his own mouth. When his breath comes, a dark snort escapes into his side, followed by a deep nasal voice. When his breath is done, he hears his voice as the strings, acoustically starting, crackle and move, beckoning him. He feels tense in the room. " Welcome, here, Daniel. "
When the wind finally blows down on the front door, a man smiles a chilling smile at the way this piano player is illuminated by the beeps. He lets out a sigh and shrugs. " Hey, sweetie. "
Daniel kneels and picks up his violin. The touch of his thumb caresses the keys before sliding them into the lock with his finger. Daniel ’ s eyes glaze over as he turns them to the one person he truly loves, his brother. The one family, his fiance, his parents, his teachers. His whole family was at one time a fan of the piano, two, but one that never wanted it. Now, with the relationship that had finally come to an end, that finally ended, the violin player finds himself with the hands and the keys of a man he once loved. Now Daniel reaches out, to comfort his brother, and smiles at his own white face.
" I ’ m a sad soul, " the person says, looking down on Daniel. Daniel bows his head and sends a gentle kiss to his sister. " My mother left a long time ago. "
Daniel bends down and sits up. " Even though you don ’ t remember, my mother always did. She killed herself, and left a long time ago, like it wasn ’ t her fault, " he explains, leading the way.
Daniel shoves his shoes through his pants as he sits. " Like she loved you more than anyone. "
" She left me. " Daniel replies flatly.
" She never came back. "
" And then it was the end of the world. But I still love you. "
" Do you know the end? " Daniel asks in his heart.
" Maybe. " The melody and sound of his violin draws him back into the piano. " Sometimes, it ’ s not my fault. Sometimes, she left me, too. And I wasn ’ t really sure who was right."

*And the sun turned red and the pale moon remained until the magma became a blue sky on the old earth*
A million years was a very long time, many believing they could defeat the human race the first time they came into contact. However, no one had been so stupid as to decide they would do it that first time.
Chaos had struck a moment long ago when Earth, humanity, and the other planets turned back to the terror of the first time invaders. Humanity believed all threats to the planet to be nothing more than junk. They were wrong.
They began to retreat. Leaving Earth behind. The fear spread like wildfire across the world. It was a plan that worked out in a matter of months. It worked out for Earth, Humanity.
The humans had always fought back. They had every part of their being. But all of them were done staring at the unnatural green light coming from the moon.
What have we done? The humans were gone. They have been hunted into extinction and wanted never to return. We all hoped.
But now, with technology like no other, we have come upon another level of danger, where their numbers have been zero. This time, I don't believe we will be able to save them.
*I love to hear this*
*I have not cried more than twice*

It was summer day, and my father looked out over the smoggy skies.
As it turned out, the air was hot and full of smoke and ash. Perfect combination for summer; it had been years since I last left my hut. But still, all was still.
I was hoping that this might be paradise, because somewhere along the way, I found myself near a large country road. In fact, everything seemed so much like that old country road was now practically on fire. The sign at the window said that no motor vehicle could make it anywhere on the road.
I had prayed that I would not see this path, but I was afraid. What could possibly go wrong? How could I be saved?
I came to the small house in the road and instantly, the mud and debris began to pile up. I could hear the car behind me.
I tried to run, but the slippery mud splintered and that sweet smell of cigarette smoke filled the air. I slowly began to fall backwards, the ground forming dirt under me. The sky lit up in brilliant orange hues, bright red and yellow.
I reached out with all my might and in a split second the air whirled around me. I was covered in ichor. Yellowish muck, while the earth shook with my bones. My nose quickly became numb and swallowed up all of my senses.
But I knew that was not a temporary thing. I turned around, looked back at my father, smiled and said, “ On this day, all will burn in paradise. ”

Head over heels, the archaeologists looked across the room at the Pyramids, solid gold for a long time. They couldn't stop it. Plunging on the taloned spear between each marble's side, the only sound they could hear was the scraping sound of the aging stone floor.
The Iron Age was before they. Grass we had forgotten. Goblins, not goblins, but.... we had stopped this on our way to where the sound came from. Perhaps it was because we had stopped putting tools there and given it to the others in that part of the city. Heavenly stones were carved here, cast into fires, and then scattered across the landscape.
Perhaps it was because we had stopped putting our feet in tunnels and there wasn't a way out of the cavern. When the Iron Age ended, rock alleys were left open, stores packed up. But in the subsequent decades and years, the steel industry came back and into being. New industries for metals, gears, and weaponry.
The earth was wrinkled, crumbled, and steeped, eroded, ground entirely by fire. Dust and soil gave way to stone and rock. Behind the metal buildings was the border of the waypoint and the multi-lane highway. At the time, it was considered the most important place to live.
Back then, the Pilgrims was still trailing their camp. Few dared venture out here, not for miles. The barbarians were regrouping as they conquered. Their simple minded youth ignited their passion and spirit. They brought tools and armor, and weapons. Armored wagons and carts and dragons. A conquering force, called the Altars. Even that was not enough to be considered progress.
Back then, the Pilgrims kept their promise. Whether human or nomadic, they were prepared for a perilous journey ahead. Or just trying not to beat themselves back. Even though the heralds had mentioned it to him, his arrival made him feel less alive, were he still important. He must stay over their camp and destroy the gate. All they did was shake it, hold it firm and hope that he did it as well as they did.
And so they waited.
We fell, the settlers back to their homes, they were strangely proud of themselves. But when a field of men, heavy with fear and the hunger for machine gunpowder began to breach the sky, shouts erupted. It was a noise from the Apothecaries, and slowly the skin around our ears began to fade into dust and the earth once more shook.
We had stopped writing.
Two souls didn't fit in our pack. And I'm the one who sold them away.
The first was a small, weakling. His wooden armor carried less than it had in all the ages we had seen him. His blood was cold and fluid, and unbearably bloodied. He wasn't strong, but he was handsome, and he spoke the language of our race. One day, after weeks of waiting, he showed.
"The Iron Age began like this. It boiled and raged, and over time, both sides turned to ash. "
I ran across the field of waiting to the announcement. It had only been ten steps from the exit. The smell of burnt flesh and dead leaves filled the air. The word " pyros," was printed on the front of the book. There was some screaming at first, but all of a sudden, it became deafening. Trees stopped swaying and stomping on the ground. An army.
The end of the fire crackled in the distance. A warm and enthusiastic wind swept in.
There was no one left.
I looked in the side of the *Palaeo-Pyramid* and saw nothing else.
The light was gone, and the strange beast that crawled out of nothingness leaped from the rock encased in bronze.
Let us live in peace.

"For the record: You must wear it over your wedding veil. Every morning, you shiver. " It must be young Adam's father, Adam, says to him as he feeds the plants to his cattle.
" Can't you just use it? " He has been shivering so much.
" Nope. It just turns it white for a little while. Last thing I remember was watching the couple get roasted. "
He was such a moped back then, riding by his Corvette for days. There would be no one to keep him company. " That's a fuckin' sweet thing! " he yells after the neighbor who had gotten so tired of riding. " But you look a lot younger than that... "
" Even younger! " Another sibling, larger, and more irascible, replied. Adam believed her. " It's mine. "
" Even older. " He had pulled out a tissue of marijuana from a dark corner of his cellar. " I'd always wanted to be like you! My sister would never break the bedsheets on me, you know? I'd go about bed, take a shit, and then Dad'd come over. " The neighbour's son ran his finger through the gaps in Adam's chins.
" And so, why can't I wear it? " God, Adam was a strange one. How were the doctors going to know?
" We can't. Keep it on a doll-face. In class, just one day, it'll turn white, but in the day when I graduate, it'll be green. " No one figured that out after Mom collapsed in class that day. And every single person who talked to Dad and the other kids, they said they couldn't.
Adam had grown up with jeans hanging off his butt too. He didn't usually have big, rheumy balls. A quarter was a bit uncomfortable - but his calves had been replaced with smaller ones. A word or two later, he was gently handed a Goodnight Girlfriend, and then placed in one of the enclosed, bleachers. He sat down and began to massage his calves.
" So, I could wear a bra, but I suppose you might want to wear the same one when you get a big promotion. " Adam's father grew pale. " Work kids, and you'll be the only job in the world that doesn't see the sides. Women will not like babies unless they wear bras. " He waddled his cattle through the woods for days and Christmas plagues dragged after his calves. Adam saw a washerbug get castrated after a shower.
" That's the only thing we can do for you now, mother. " He watched the friend of the day with disgust. " I'm just going to be the only thing out of the year that does not wear an approved bra." He had an old bag stuffed into his shorts when he got home to find his wife's underwear covered in smears of urine.

There was a strange sensation. The air shivered with the warm dirt on the bars. I leaned over to open it and let the first sensation wash over me. I had arrived in hell.
It had been a while since I had eaten any of my own stuff and was ready to at least taste freedom. Sure enough, I slacked off on a bowl of... Doritos. Thankfully, I had a pretty large refrigerator so I could get by without having to worry about cleaning anymore.
I slacked off again, just to be sure. I had my alarm a few minutes ago. Maybe it should be ringing.
I opened the door and glanced around, every bunker I had finally found was stocked with lights. Not sure why, I barely had enough air for that now. I went to press one in.
"Wake up! Ummm, " I said as I folded my legs.
The door creaked open, and I managed to open it.
There was a large creature in a nondescript box, about the size of a house hamster. He looked a little pale, like he had been stabbed in the back. At first, I thought he looked like a pig. But my instincts told me it was definitely not a pig.
I stood up and started walking to the hole in the ground. My stomach was heavily tense, I wanted to punch the creature that had gotten me here in the first place. I desperately tried to lift the sandwich from my face, but it couldn't lift.
It got so close and though its head rotated, it seemed to have no comprehension of the peace I was currently experiencing. No remorse. It just stared at me, watching me walk towards the hole. Just staring.
As my legs took in the air, I knew it wasn't me. It was the food I was eating. I couldn't remember why I didn't have a sandwich at breakfast or dinner. Was I a hamster, sure? And why wouldn't I be eating Doritos right now? Was I starving to death, more hungry than any hamster I had ever eaten?
I finally came to a placid, " Good morning. "
A foxhole?
I walked through into a compound called a health center to check on myself. I sighed, groaning as I figured out how I could eat any hamster that was in the hole.
The first two days of my journey involved several tests. Many in the first stages of recovery. It took at least 30 minutes for them to be able to close the cage. I finally came across a hamster that fit with a blade strapped to his belly. He looked like no hamster ever had, and asked me for directions. As I loaded the small plastic bag I turned the handle and the knife sank into his belly. A fine tooth covered the rag that had apparently dripped off of his belly. When the knife fell off his stomach, he popped out of the cage onto the grass.
" It's okay, buddy. Let me get some Doritos. " I said.
As the hamster bounded away, I walked over to it to examine its anus and noticed the space with several patches of flesh on it.
" God damnit! " I exclaimed. " That tube!"

As I drop my briefcase in the city, at the end of the international food embargo, I can't help but think back to the time I was moving to this ex-spy facility. When I first arrived there was pretty much nothing, until a guard found me.
As I walked into his room I was a little stunned, not realizing he was in this fancy office, and now in his office.
I had been expecting someone to be here for awhile, but I didn't know them as friends. Maybe he would have some nice gossip, something that wouldn't ruin his day, or maybe he just wants to piss off. Still, I figure I wasn't going to waste my time with him anyway.
As I walk over to the desk I can see a bleeding man, who was able to survive it.
As I tell my coworker about his unfortunate appearance, he says "That's what makes you think he is lying? He looks so awkward. Where is the grace he has in those handrails."
I look at his left arm, which is now gone, and notice the biggest mark on the man's left hand.
I immediately raise my hand to see where it is.
Seeing nothing I ask my coworker,
Why did he tear open a child's hand and break his wrist?
The man blushes, and says, he was on purpose,

Even the most abstract color is so beautiful.
Perhaps that's why I've always loved to view this... odd... thing. It burns up and embers up everywhere that we sit... like iron on a flame.
It's not solid - it just shines with all of the energy in it. But our building blocks are strong and strong. And yet, we sit under it and it just continues and in that moment - we think, we think. We think... - our family and friends. We think and we think. It's not fair that I feel the flames burning around us. I don't.
No. This is not fair. There's nothing I can do to stop it. I feel like I am just another piece of information flying through my mind. I feel like it is not on my mind. No, I'm too busy making more and more of this. It's all gibberish - over and over again. Just words.
I'm finally free, and I'm free. And I'll break free.

"Here I come! "
Edit: Formatting
His eyes held a moment of ecstasy as I gently placed his neck on mine. Though I spent a few moments trying to work them out, in the end we both regained the right feeling to sit and smile for a few minutes. I could've sworn I couldn't see the sights for another second. Soon the situation would be over and my heart would have given up a few short milliseconds before the bullet hit me.
I nodded eagerly as my face slumped to the floor. He was gon na die the moment I had entered the room. And now here we were, staring at the exit with our focus glued to it, laughing maniacally.
I slid the visor away from me, tried to focus on our bodies as we looked at each other. It took me a moment of reflection to realize that the rest of the room was a white room. The top half of the ceiling had no windows so it was impossible to tell what was in front of us. And the bottom half of the ceiling, unlike the center of the room, could clearly be seen resting on the blue carpet.
His eyes caught mine one last time before he fell to the floor. A look of shock broke out on his face and he collapsed on the carpet. I backed up a bit to catch his weight, but his back was still firmly against mine. The air was only growing colder by the second and in my final moments he appeared to fly in front of me.
" And here we go! "
And then I lifted the visor as the earth began to split as our new face hovered directly in front of it. For the first time, I asked him what happened. He merely shook his head and sighed.
" My name is Kenny. "
I looked down, expecting to find an old man with short black hair and green eyes. Instead, my gaze focused on his crooked smile. He had changed too quickly and had forgotten how to laugh. He had forgotten how to walk. And oh, who was he kidding? He was dead before I could fully give him the finger.
" You don't have to do this, do you? " he asked softly, producing a disc from his back pocket.
" Of course I do! " I laughed. " Now let's go to the fun house and grab some snacks for a snack party!"
I nodded and walked out the room. Kenny was a walking curator but to end up like this, a heroic one at that, was even more despicable than the first day.

I stared at her. This, I would think, was a very good power. It was surprisingly good. It helped when she really needed my help.
I could hear footsteps. I was about to open a door when, in a voice I didn't recognize, I heard a cough.
"Call the SWAT team, " I said. I heard them quickly reach the door. She looked at me confused, but then said, " Private. Don't try to. " She picked a gunshot wound from an open window, and sprayed it all over the room. She then ran through the entire wall, and ran through the bathroom and into a bed. With one arm around her back, she begged me to help, but I insisted.
Another cough. Another cough. Another cough. And so, the sound of gunshots followed, followed by shouting. The only sound was the sound of paper breaking on wood.
" Have you thought of using it for cover?"

I will always remember the day I woke up, I can see the light reflecting from the top of my head. I didn't ever sleep a wink, I remember thinking to myself, ‘ By the books! ’ but it was.
There wasn't anyone around me before, a flash of the flash echoing through the house. I finally regain my composure, noticing that my eyes are sleeping. There is a small wardrobe in front of me, new drywall down it's across the hallway from me, including the simple brown linoleum which used to be my bedroom.
*Wake up* the thought says to me, it's a cool sound, I slowly settle into a gait which my mind was able to ignore, no I woke up.
I walk over to the wardrobe that is raised in the middle of the room. The vase in the corner is cold, keeping it warm inside. I look at it for a moment. A red light starts emitting from the room which makes me briefly panic, then this happens again. The red light in the room makes me raise my hands. The floor rolls in, the world hits my head. No, I will not cry. I vomit.
The room starts spinning, a deep crack begins to form in the closet. I slowly, cautiously walk out of the room. I walk over to the wall.
The change starts from floor to ceiling, the knob steps inside and a small latch at the bottom clicks. Slowly, the lock behind the door opens. The rest of the hall is illuminated and sounds of people walking around, the room slowly turns out to be bright. I pick up the shades that I have on and start putting them on. I let out a small laugh, I hope they catch on, I laugh again, “ Ha ha! ” I turn on the light, passing a tall lady in a bright gray jumpsuit, she is sitting at the table between the the two desks, her arm in the light. I sit down next to her and help the girl
I was getting very tired, I honestly believed it to be just a dream. This is my real life. I may go on since then as she is the one who amazes me. I stand up and head for the stairs. I reach down the stairs, I hear a low thump and see a pale skinned woman walking up the stairs. I walk up to her as the last light of the night shines on her. The door in her hand opens on it's own, I don't have to struggle to control myself anymore. This was her. The woman was very beautiful. The worst part was that, when I first met her, I was scared, ready to jump when she was approaching me. I just wanted her to do what she does. She just sits there in her bed trying to calm me down.
The worst part of all this was that she never asked for my name. I finally saw that her name was Samuel and that she was from the country I live in. He is the one who is supposed to figure this out, he really does. I don't think I ever told him about what I saw. I wonder what kind of a weird person the room was, I was stuck here I guess. I wonder what kind of person they are.
I never told anyone about this, I just hoped they would understand the depths of my pain. I look down at my hands and see skin on metal, I must be floating in a ghost town. The only sign of that are the chains on my wrists, hands covered in blood, and I was exposed. The only thing that I can do now is to keep quiet.

"It's -- I don't even know what I've forgotten, but... what did it mean? "
" I didn't know I was stalling... but... that human goes... they seem just...*mild* human again. I'm just going to have to say something so I can take my guard down. "
" I know that you wanted this conversation to end, but you didn't quite know how... *distant* you could truly go until I told you... I can not forgive myself. You... I mean... your brain asked a specific question and you chose to ignore it, somehow. Yet as much as you hate to admit it, I think you need to know I didn't expect that of yourself. "
"... I know he's... away... I mean... but I'm not *really* sure I can understand why you wouldn't want to talk to him, because... "
" To go out and just -- it just *wasn't* my idea, I'll ask you something myself, very slowly, but... yes. I can feel you growing more and more frustrated at my inability to hold back your tears. "

" I'm sorry, I didn't know, but -- "

" Please, just let me go, you don't need to stop me. "
" I will though, please. "
" No, please. I need to stop your tears."

The thoughts drifting lazily through his mind and dream after dream, people approaching and leaving, history repeating itself. * Things never change*. This was the order in which things were until one.
Inside the park.
This man sat on his lawn, smiling, the scent of flowers still wafting through his room. He's got a book, a pen and a penknife, clutching a tiny book out in front of him. Small pencils now. White stone objects with bright strokes, large files full of equations. The landscapes around him are colorful and elegant, though they create shadows of what could have been, *Lost in Time. * He doesn't really know what it is, in this world he sees no world, only darkness.
His book is small and bland, yellow and brown over a stained yellow leather cover, clasped tightly between his fingers. He picks up a leaf and opens it, too small to see the word for it. The last line is what he saw.
*The White House is gone. *
He dares to read more in his mind, but the title is gone too. He leans back against the park bench and leans out, eyes peering out at the forest ahead. An oasis.
He finds another leaf, and picked it up. He leans back and pulls it out of the small book, careful not to scratch the rest. Then, he places the book back in the book and shakes it gently, a note on the small back.
*You will never know. To get to know someone you have to know yourself. What is this this all about? Are you wondering what you left behind, *? * * When the one you hated turned over two thousand years old and died, how did you get so hung up on that shithole of yours? "
*You are the life-form which was left in your mind. You will go and take your place in the realm of the future. * He pulls out a Bible. That'll answer any questions he has.
With the note he draws his pen, engraving it with the stone things in the letter, " Return. "
The castle looms above, the grass a vibrant green in colour. A great tree once was taller, but the shade is fading. The shadow is fading. The forest is as green as the moon when it was shining.
He walks to a far corner, looking up to the sky. This is where all of his thoughts, memories, and nightmares will come crashing back to him. He sees himself in front of the castle, sword drawn, lighting up the sky, thunderous applause. Turning over, he straightens himself up, his blade. Slowly. * Your only warning. *
The blood stains on the ground where his sword would be, with all the memories and nightmares. He breaks the curse, and heads back toward the castle. Walking away, he looks back to the past to remember what he saw.
" I knew they would always come at you. " The man smiles. " If I have to kill myself to remind them of what I had, you might as well let me go."

You want to hear this story, I'm going to tell you right now. Have fun - go make a decision.
James took a long deep breath and opened his eyes. The blazing fire inside him began to glow. The city of light rushed by like a tearful little girl. He raised his head to meet it and waited for the fire to stop. The only light was the early noon sun and the cusp to the night sky.
Slowly, he rose to his feet and looked down to the hulking armchair and took a seat. Slowly, he made his way to his feet and then back up to the chair and set his bags down. He reached in, pulled out his phone and began to dial.
"Hello? "
The voice still trying to ring wasn't what he expected. He could barely make out the digits, his face was hard and swollen from the sleep-fueled grogginess of his last sleep.
" Hello? "
" James? "
" Yes? "
" How may I help you? "
" Can you come home to me? "
" No... what? "
A half hearted whisper of " sorry? " and James was silent for a moment as he realized that there was no need to say it.
" Listen, James, do you hear me? It's OK to ask these questions, I understand. I know I'm not a very good liar, but you need to step away from my computer for a moment. "
James looked towards his friends, giving them a nod.
" Ok I just want you to know that we can trust each other, and that you are a very reliable person. You're not much of a problem, but things don't always go your way in the end. I'm sorry I'm late. I love you, but there are things in the life that happen. "
James stared at his friends, and with a reassuring smile, replied " This means I would just like to point to some policies, if you would like to read them. "
James took one deep breath and reached out. " * Please*. I don't want you to do this, I don't want you to be disappointed. It's alright James. We all need to live with each other. * Love* is a wonderful feeling. "
With that, James stepped back in shock and rushed back to bed.
The next morning was no different. His bed was filled with news concerning the the butterfly effect that was unfolding across North America and the effect was spreading quickly.
One in every six human beings on the planet died during the spring. Scientists didn't immediately know why, but eventually it started to look like fish simply flitted their forts through the air.
" I'm sorry James, but I was just really distracted. The Butterfly Effect just took over for the Americas first, and there were still nuclear warheads going off in Kansas. There were about three and a half million nuclear warheads going off in North America in all of the month of January. "
" Look James, I'm not letting you let anyone else in my house, we all don't have to be worried about this anymore."

The high order of the stars decided to take a different approach. Sure, everyone wanted to know what they were going to get from being space pirates, but well, it's not your fault not being able to adapt to Mars or Florida ice cream filling.
So the Earth was shown to be untouched by anything that happened to Earth before the invasion. Even the mysterious water creatures couldn't be eradicated. In what would be a eventful night for mankind, the pterodactyls had managed to make a sustained presence in the water that the humans made happen, leaving waterlogged forests and creatures to slowly spread out across the world. In a major battle the intelligence of the space pirates seemed to do little in the far south of the world, doing things they didn't understand. However, the existence of alien life was drawing the attention of aliens with multiple fleets of fighter jets. One fleet appeared at the edge of one of the sky's tallest skyscrapers, leaving its commander in shock. He looked up over the bridge and saw a small lake of water appearing from the sky.
"Ummm... when has the whole of planet over populated for 300 years?? " came a deep, cracked voice. It was the chief scientist at NASA. In turn, the chief scientist responded. " But, no one on Planet Earth was completely consumed with famine! Very few of us lived there for more than 100 years. And humans have spoiled our planet for 300 years."

My life was probably better when God was sober, but it's hard when you're caught up in thought too quickly.
But, there was my family. Honestly, I have more family than ever, so I'm glad, even though I thought I ended up here.
Like I said, I did not really think I knew people well, so I lived on my own and not expected someone to come along and help with anything.
Now, there was our lot. There was Mom. She was with Dad every day since he died, and Dad gave her a new set of keys for the house and I couldn't mess with her anymore. Dad died ten years ago, and Mom was always there when I lost my mind about everything.
It was always Mom. Mom had said things like, "No matter what you do, my kids always support you in everything."
But, she never really believed herself to have done anything to help others, ever. Nobody ever seemed to learn what it meant to be a good mother. None of my kids ever saw the world like me.
The only reason that my mom would have the courage to talk to me is because I did something to her, just like she did to all my other children.
But, I guess, no one should know the difference between the good mother and the bad mother.

"Maine has only 13 days! My name is Eugene Adams, and the 13 days that you ’ ll find me in my next apartment! Just recently my family moved in with Max and Jamal are all patients. They were scared to ask for it, I just got a new birth certificate. They ’ ll be okay, but I want this room to be like the one I had before, right? "
" Yeah, and that ’ s exactly what I wanted. Are you going to take this thing, Eugene? Its cold in here, and everyone else won ’ t take it. There ’ s no lights in here, nobody is close enough to look at it. "
" Ahh... " He sighed, both in awe and even anger.
" So Eugene, what have you been reading lately? " Asked my friend who had begun his day wearing a backpack.
" Everyone, but the problems with ADHD just make me feel like shit. Why don ’ t you just let me read this? " He said, motioning me forward in the room, unplugging the headphones.
" Same thing happened the last couple of days, why don ’ t you just knock on the door? " I asked.
" I uh, just knock, look over there. " His voice was hoarse with tiredness and fear.
" No " I replied, a little bit insulted, " This is Doctor Hawking, I see no need for psychos to handle it, but I hope to no longer give him but the key to the tunnel. "
His eyes, which were above me with amazing green eyes grew dilated. He shook his head and bowed his head.
" Alright then." I said, and walked away.

It was their tomb, their chemical curtain sliding off and slipping away in front of them like the flickering leaf from a dying flame.
Their sanity evaporated as they huddled together for years, sharing the last moments of their lives without awareness to others.
They saw white noise, the walls finally falling away from the world.
Their last moments of illumination, because the noise killed them.
They heard the wailing, blood words, those words they had whispered so many times before.
They were alone and they were not afraid.
The only sounds were people arguing in black suits and carrying around containers that gave their prisoners a hunger to come over and stop them.
Then the silence became absolute and they thought.
Everyone was dead.
The last of their own kind was born from a fire. A crack being born of pure obsidian, the rest had been burned away to a black rock, humanity completely behind the corner of this valley.
Their end, a crack was created.
And thus, their creation would die forever, forgotten and forgotten.
And so they buried that mystery.

"Sam, stop fidgeting around! " Jim screamed, my boss yelling back at him. The boogeyman that covers for heads had taken over. It didn't stop him at all though. Despite being uncomfortable in front of coworkers, I was terrified. Why was he eyeing me as if I was the object of his stare? Everyone was talking about how unpleasant it must be because Jim never made them uncomfortable.
But here I was, the only person left who needed a break from the board game. Everything was looking up to Jim and if I was to actually win the game, he would wish his bullying under my guidance. I felt bad for the Hulk, but that's beside the point. In my opinion, Jim was lying. If only people would just shut up and go do something about it, I wouldn't be a burden on Jim's shoulders. I had just been informed that no matter how scared Jim was, he was okay with coming to work as a lunch man on shift on the ill-fated Friday shift.
My boss looked more maturely at Jim then I had ever seen someone before. He looked amused by my antics but anything else was about as well known as his skin and voice. It took less time than I would normally make to regroup with my coworkers before he finally decided to sit down again.
" JIM, I'm so sorry for putting you up so early today. But don't worry, you'll just have to comply with the rules in the morning."
I wasn't expecting any reaction from him in my office. Hell, I wasn't expecting any at all at all either. I didn't feel like nothing had happened. In the background, the girl I was with had become the monster. The kidnapper deserved to be deterred a long time ago.
I sighed, and proceeded to my desk to file my formal complaint about Jim. About what Jim should have done. What was I going to do about it? Of course, no one would like me being impure, and I could have never been any younger. Was this my end game?
Jim turned around with a defeated sigh and began to lecture me. I stood up slowly and walked back to the box he had slipped in the slot. After taking a look, I felt as though everything was being distracted from me. It was as though Jim wasn't even aware of me, at least physically. I saw eyes almost completely filled with contempt for me but the fact of the matter is, it wasn't always this way. All the after hours and nights I spent on the job didn't leave me in a great way. I never had the chance to eat, do anything, or talk to anyone except for my own personal to do business. The same lack of decency was also maybe the problem. I could never be in control of my life. Hell, if any changes would change it would be happening right now. The only thing that I didn't know was what would happen. I'd just restart life the way I was supposed to.
Oh shit. I ran to the man's desk and collapsed. Oh my god, I thought. Oh my god. I looked at Jim. I looked at Jim and I silently prayed for all the good times we would have before he finally came back, so that he wouldn't yell about my actions. I looked at Jim, a saddened look on my face. But I was happy that Jim wasn't me anymore. It didn't matter which side I was on anymore. I was happy to finally be part of the team.

'You okay sweetie? Are you okay?'
I said yes.
'....and why's that?'
'Feces?'
'Feces?' I said. 'Are those big fat disgusting ones also eating you?'
'Just talking to them is not okay,' she chirped.
'Just good,' I said. 'Here, let me pass this by. It's what I'm going to buy you here. Or should I say it...'
'....so are these big fat bad guys down the street being charitable or trying to eat me?'
'Just saying thanks...'
'Yeah, okay,' she added as she stepped out into the street. 'Good night, Sweetie. I love you.'
The lady continued to walk off down the street. This was her home.
'Come on!' I said,' I've been serving you for years now. I know it looks like shit to be honest, but I haven't suffered any one. Any one can do what you want with me. Can't you see that I like you. My family would trust me and I think you like me too. If you turn around and say that all you want is food, I'll take it. If I were to let you feed you, all you'd have to do is feed me.'
The lady passed me the sandwich.
'Whose food is that?' I asked her.
'You know, Big Head, I don't know... I don't know... just whatever I wanted and now I have to eat... it hurts.' She sniffled and handed me the sandwich.
'Just go make sure you don't tell anyone the last thing you did was blamepapoon during a fight, you smell awful,' I said, explaining'Not bad to get through.'
She followed me upstairs, taking my hands and screaming at me.
'I'm going to fix your shitty sandwich and whatever you did to me that day, I'm sure of it,' she cursed at me.
'Just make sure not to try my big bad voice again again,' I said.
'Go on,' she said as she pushed the sandwich into my hand.
'Good night sweetie,' I said as she grabbed it.
'Good night, buddy,' she blushed, and pointed to the sidewalk.
I turned on the radio. 'MNF. 8, Sunrise'
'Will this work?' She asked, downing the rest of her drink.
I readjusted my grip on the sandwich.
'Jesus I'm always hungry, but I can't keep up these annoying bastards,' I said.
'As for me,' she replied,'I could try it now, I'm sure I'll try it with more regularity... but I'd rather just enjoy the taste of that sandwich now. F'light and salty to you, you'll love it.'
I smiled and turned off the radio. The blood drained off of my lips as I wiped away the sidewalk from the sandwich.

"Ahh, " she whispered, as she felt a sudden urge to turn away. She knew that the first individual she saw would be out to destroy the fragile equilibrium of man and nature with incredible force, and the worst case scenario would be possible. She knew those wisest people in the world would come and ask, " What are you? Are you hurt? " Because that's how they felt! They would ask, " What are you? Can you be saved? "
She imagined the sun rising from the clouds, blinding her immediately, and there she was at the height of the event to save humankind and some of her closest friends, and old friends, and future generations. She marveled at the wonders of what this would mean. The thing that would ruin it all. Her veil of fear grew thicker, and she felt sweat trickle down her back. As she laughed her heart sank: those in power were not so selfish. They were not so wise. And what was left of humanity? She'd never win a discussion of the concept of God, and thus, her existence would have been changed. As she laid down and sobbed, she looked up, and just then another person appeared behind her: an angel of great stature. He was standing over her, smiling.
" Jesus... " He said softly. " John, I think you have been apprehended."
She laughed heartily, and she smiled again.

Welcome back to the Daily News! Today, all of our reporters are picking on our own crew members, who offer up suggestions for positions on Mars-style exploration.
Bekan Sr., Captain of Mars Exploration Team - 64, says, "Mars is a village now and we've saved billions of dollars. We've made sure we don't run into any permanent damage, and we have been able to extend our drone activity almost any one day. "
Tom, Vice Chairman of Mars Exploration Team - 19, also says, " Honestly, a drop in the bucket on some of the more dangerous things on the red planet is worrying. None of them have ever been one of us."
Allen, EMT with Mars Exploration team - 33, says that the leaders of Mission Control have been glaring at him for years now.
Corina, Engineer of Mission Control - 27, says, " It just doesn't seem like a good fit for us, and this whole thing with people trying to profit off the failure of Mars. Mars is a community now. It's even smaller now. This might work out for humans, and for the rest of us... "
John, CFO of Mission Control - 12, says, " The first manned mission to mars, it's remarkable how anyone would try and make a difference in the betterment of humanity. It's a miracle. Although it's a home here, it's also full of challenges. So far, we have it all under control, and believe that we're all in the right place. As long as we keep this up, humanity will eventually surpass Mars as a system."

“ Find DNA. ” The mother lies beside me, pleading. “ Glorious great giant! Human. ”
I turn back toward the microscope. It's weird seeing the first glimpse through the lens. Thousands of years of evolution appeared with a ribbon around an egg.
“ Get that sonuvabitch the Science division. ” The scientist is right. He knew nothing of humanities study and sent it to the lab. I don't feel important about it. There's no way he can do it.
“ Cover your face with your hands and face onto the desk. ” The woman is crying. We've spent the past few weeks walking her around the lab, wondering about what her daughter had found. Maybe she'd forgotten to name her. Or maybe she was really proud of her daughter. She must still be a beautiful girl. Her eyes stare out at the walls of the room. The small cracks visible on her face get more pronounced with every step.
“ Call M-903, we can get you your ice cream! ” She calls excitedly. She's almost pleading. He presses the 903 button and her stomach churns. Our eyes widen as a white needle pierces through her skin and shoots out of the skin.
“ Fill out the form at the bottom of this page. ” The mother finally looks up at me from her pleading face.
I put on my suit and take off. The wind plays a protective song on my jacket as I walk towards the truck, prying the bandanna off my arm to reveal my lower body. The doctors wear primitive grey coats, like the mother believes they're against society. The scientists believe there must be danger to the creatures. I feel my remaining hand tighten.
“ Do we have the TCR? ” The mother is silent. Her eyes always stared outside the microscope. “ Maybe they still love us. ” Her voice broke as she whispered, “ Welcome to Reality, sonuvabitch. ”
I pick the TCR up, place it in her hand and rip it off. I feel the second arm that was strapped over my shoulder take her the wrong way. She fell backwards onto the truck. It spins and she turns to stumble. My boot hits the ground and a pile of rubble meets its end with a horrible crunch. I do what I do best. I flip over onto my stomach and collapse. The pain in my abdomen has subsided but there is a fear in my stomach like cold steel. I look up. The sun has risen on the horizon and I see movement in the thick cloud formations on the horizon. A highway follows behind us.
“ Stephanie! ” My best friend steps out of the viewscreen. “ Thank God you're here! ”
“ But we said we'd forget about you, because you were still alive. ”
“ Stephanie? ” I kneel beside her crying. “ That still has a way of doing cool stuff. ”
“ Thank you, I'll go. ” He waves his hand and the milk carton flies out into the sky and before I can get a second glance at the clouds, it has arrived in an airship the size of Manhattan. Stephanie stops breathing and hugs me tightly.

“ Sit down Mr Oliver, you must keep writing and keep your head up ”
With the grand smile of one of the most respected Oxford Grammar Officers in the English Country, Oliver assumed “ how many sentences can we achieve without starting to do 40 ”?
I sat down at my usual porcelain throne, knowing full well that it would lack value. These were rules imposed by Britain ’ s very own Grammar Police – he is an Oxford fan.
“ You leave when you get tired, someone will remove it ”?
Anyways, I was now a small one at that. I only made 6 short sentences. 20 short days had been my college choice, so I was considered a'Class of 2019' in my own way. Someone ’ s time is more valuable when you are going to be writing for no pay, or you know where the lecturer works. All these 8 other rules I followed, except mine.
Note: For the purposes of this ( pronounced ) writ ( Garf ) it literally means ‘ Evening Monday ’.

My breathing is sporadic, slow, and metallic. And I hold that bloodied stump in my chest tightly.
My vision is slowly growing blurry. The Moon was prepared for another round. When my vision clears the trembling lump of flesh begins to flail.
I begin to pull myself together, still wearing clothes worn through the civil war. My ears begin to ring and my ears begin to scream. As my vision progresses I allow my left hand to pull the limb from its hook and pull it slowly off the road. It lets out a low chortle.
The tremors I kept going through my neuro-meteorology briefies didn't manage to wring the waxy veil of sleep from my current state. Days and days of what I had spent slumbering at peace listening to their grievances was barely enough. At first, they had imagined an alien civilization to find it, which they eventually did, and how devastating they had told me. This is how it felt to be alone. Now, all that will matter is what they saw in me.

"Well, the crossroads is really quite interesting, " the devil snapped before bobbing up and down in front of his warhorse.
" I know, I know. What else do you recommend? "
" Got this book for a steal, I need it soon enough. "
" And I got the Serenity. "
" Seems a bit expensive... "
" I can't believe you're telling me to impress me. "
" Thank you. "
With that, he simply put the book down and reached over to the man's chest.
" And after that he just keeps buying it. "
" It's this sale! Really, really in one go. "
The Devil swallowed hard, struggling to wipe his eyes from his face.
" Hello, people of... "
" Lord Dextus... "
" Think, Jack! We need to talk about this more, " the devil smiled.
The man tried to hide his faint smile. But there was no time to dwell on it. He stomped through the door to the services of St. Helens' Angels, where customers awaited to hear a Soul Selling agent.
" I think the crossroads is a prime jewel to me and really it's for a second sale. Let's get this going, " He says, hoping they'll oblige his demand.
The demon and the Devil step out onto a happily shared living room. One of the Angels calls out, knocking on the door.
" Hello, my love! "
" What? I'm not in here. You can't just sell what you own! "
" No need to be rude, sorry. I've been busy. "
" Where are you going? "
" Well, those cars you bought showed me these crossroads. I know exactly where you're going. "
" Damnit. No where else. "
" That's nice. Just wait until we meet up with St. Helens's. "
" I know. You can come, " The Devil said. " We can be nice."

The battle was close, and I had to make a decision. It was a day full of life, with a lot of screaming and cheering for freedom fighters. The only children watching TV were my six year old sister and aunt ( aka mom ), who was jealous that the autograph of the sinking Titanic looked like the career hero movie parables they all always joked about. Unfortunately, no one really believed me.
Suddenly, a scream pierced through the treeline. Across the dash there was a young boy, who on a cellphone screamed "CADLE! COUCH! COUCH! " Choking on a piece of gum, he was tackled to the ground and put down, by a crowd of mostly obese protestors. I had a chance to grab the boy's hand in an attempt to protect him. I felt my hand wrap around his waist, and protect a section of his neck. He was dead.
Waves of protests went across the nation from about five thousand people, and I heard some hail of curses and angry shouts to no avail. I had decided early on to pass the time of pictures of my daughter, Julie, and that she wasn't going to die in the end. I thought to myself " that's it, I said a dumb bastard like me can die, right? ". A year later, the story of how the now city-renowned " melting pot " reached its peak was covered in hastily printed newspaper headlines, featuring names calling for the " freedom fighter ".
One angry man shouted " Let's look at this picture. It's a pretty grim, grim picture. Thousands of starving orphans. I don't understand why this nation needs something like this, we're the most advanced civilization in the universe, not some children in hell crying for help."
Looking back, what I would have meant with all these soldiers killing my mom, aunt, and so many others, was that it was time for real war. It was the same method North Korea used to take the freedom fighters down. You heard it better than anyone, North Korea was following the Geneva Conventions. In short, the North Koreans just can't seem to get enough of freedom fighters. Still, their good guys lost several battles in the war and now we're just trying to survive until it is over.
My interest in futility is dying now, and now I am here. I have closed my eyes, and was debating whether or not I should meet the women, or the children who were celebrating their freedom for once, at which point I decided to ask: What's the meaning of so many bodies falling to the ground when they can't protect themselves? Because when I get back from my real world vacation, I will find a movie starting next month. The worst part, would be seeing the graveyard of this young man who never knew that it was him, and he is reaching for a car with a picture of his daughter with China underneath it in a letter.

"So you've talked to many people before... What do you think they meant by'pain'? "
" It was something morbid. Though somewhat of a relative. And disgusting. "
" That's something I never really had time to think about. "
" As in, well? At all? "
" What I did was very different, but equally as monotonous, at the same time. "
" I... "
" There used to be a time there. Earlier this century, when when it was revealed that only 1/2 the smartest and brightest minds of our generation were alive and ready to join the race to make us the stars, " -he paused to consider his point " - explained that it was **exactly** *what* he wanted. "
" How did you, my friend? What kind of person you are? "
" Fools. I guess. Never expecting anything with a purpose. I had no interests in fame. "
" Well, do you think I will see them? Or at least give them something to turn them into a society? "
" It seems my intentions here are too strong to continue. "
" They must have communicated with you before they were sent... "
" What have they sent? "
" Them. You asked for some kind of technology, something which could bring us closer to a whole being from the very beginning! But they sent me just to begin with. And my joke is you were so indecisive, and that is another reason why I thought you deserved the email. "
" So you now need to be responsible for that? "
" No! It is clearly self-evident! And so what do you do?! "
" Why would any of you want this?! "
" I mean, I mean it didn't have to be for the sake of having a monument. Maybe that was for the benefit of the time, the scientists, or me... What am I going to do about it then? "
" Well... Maybe I'll go to try and stuff some sort of reaction... It's incredibly dangerous! I promise. "
" What? It didn't work! Why does this bother you? "
" This is nothing new, " -he scoffs at the one who decided it would work - " quite frankly. Being the slav who said it just made the entire thing seem much more stupid. The worst part is I can't even communicate with you because I'm immortal. And because of that, who knows I could have even gotten to you if I tried, though I still have ten billion years left. As far as I can tell, now that I look back on it I should have something to keep me motivated. But I'm afraid I can't, so I'm left with nothing. "
" So...? "
" Now that you know that, I still can't understand why you were sent to talk to me. I know the whole reason for it. "
" You're so funny! And so delicate, you must be incredibly clever for your age!"

The box was black. I looked out over the pearl-red waters of the bay, and felt completely safe. Nothing terrible happened here. No sickness, no fatigue, no more monsters. It was refreshing to see where I was going - the androgynous sea creatures and sea life, slowly detaching in two, little ways. And the wettest water I'd ever felt. Out over the blue gleaming waters. There were trees and other creatures my mother couldn't handle in a day's time. And alone, the only people I had ever loved.
But it was time. It was the fourth day. With the large, long, ravenous water that i'd swept from the sea or at least can now smell from across the bay, and the vivid colors that emerged from the lanterns above me, you won't see anything negative from the night. But you'll, they say, smell the ocean. You'll feel the trees. You'll see the pinkers. And you'll hear the mermaids singing. You'll see a sun split, and a great world of soft green. You'll hear a storm come and burn the forest for all time. You'll see the rays of the sun slowly hitting the oceans below. You'll see the land engulfing you in boils. You'll see some dry land covered by the swirling waves, slowly burning itself out. The entire ocean will have turned to ashes.
You could do anything! Everything you wanted. Anything at all! All at once. And when the sun was out the shore where you left, and the earth was green, you would see the barren wasteland. With nothing left of the world to live in, it was up to you and the only people.
And just like the sun, people didn't dare crawl out of the water.
And when i'd reached the bay, I took my torch with me, and looked up. And there stood a giant looking rectangle. It was about my height and length. The ocean the size of a palm tree. And there were drawings of sea life and ocean creatures. It looked like water was coming from the sea, and coming from the ocean itself. And then with the whirlwind I'd called a storm, I carved and carved and carved. By sunset, I'd gone to bed, and i was ready to go back to dreaming on the beach.
And when I awoke with tears in my eyes, the world was once again - great green clouds watching. And a snow covered everything. And a thousand more stars floated in the sky, and came from within the water's storms. People went on their merry way, thinking of all the people who had seen them, and the stories they'd told, and the fish they'd eaten. And those worlds made the world go away. And where did they go? In the ocean where they had caught the land? In the sea where the land had been drowned out by the water itself?

"But I don't want to- I thought... well, I don't want to do this! " I cried into the ocean around us, and I drew my sword and an imaginary friend, and somehow we were in love, for the first time in our lives.
" You're not gay. " She laughed at my selfish thoughts of the past. Her laugh was quivering in my chest and tears were pooling in my face.
" No! Don't be like that! I won't do this! " I pulled out my sword. Her head suddenly began glowing bright blue, like her eyes.
" But, you don't- "
" No!" I slashed, jabbing the angsty air from my blade.
The rays of wind caught up with us, and I ran away, tears spilling out of my eyes.
And I would never know...

" Hold up I haven't seen your reaction for years, it's no big deal, I don't want to hold my daughter. "
" No, this is just fine, whatever I can do to keep your feelings at bay. "
" I don't want to stare at this bong man going out a weed bar and trying to kill himself. Just don't approach him. "
" Yeah, I just want him to know that it doesn't get better than what he can have planned out. "
" You don't understand, what it feels like to stay in a relationship with the smallest amount of change, and to pay so much money to stay in that relationship, that's going to cost your family their years of living in poverty. "
" What if it does get better, what if you leave then? "
" Is there any thing you can do to leave a bad taste in my mouth?"

It had been a one-in-a-million chance. My body was not yet established. Success took years and a hint of surgery is not an easy process. You have to do it. I started with a floor, the room filled with weights, and you build your confidence by lifting them. I would fall toward my feet when needed and I would swim down the water like a king on the water. It wasn't the most graceful kind, but it was the most compelling. It was what really broke me. At first I thought there might be magical abilities, but back on the inside I was feeling very weak, weak when my last dose was broken and was in pain. I went through hell and back, but I always had a plan. A fight. Hiding myself behind walls and fighting with knives. I once heard that if you go hard you could become invincible. I had tried that before, but my body was weak. This time, it didn't work. My movements, my kicks and attacks faltered. I was weak. I needed to start over. I knew I had a death's ray for my head, but this was different. I was stronger than ever. I was stronger than I had ever been, and I knew that I had saved the world and was going to the stars in a million thousand more years. I was going to save the world, and I was going to save her.

The building of this building has a special significance, I will be walking down the street, as it is where the building had destroyed itself. My head is throbbing, I had promised myself that I would make my whole life into a video game character and kill all the enemies in this building. It had succeeded. I reached the end of the street, but I was nowhere to be seen. I walked and looked for the key to the door. I find it.
Just as I open the door, the door closes, and yet the thunder stops. Out of nowhere, an elderly women starts laughing. She begins to give me a hug and says "you know what, buddy? We have another reason to follow you in life. After this whole damn apocalypses thing, hell, even this earthquake thing, it will be a nice change of pace." I hope she's kidding.

Silence.
I felt it pulsing under my feet when I picked up a flashlight, I can hear it pulsing under my feet when I pick up a flashlight, I can hear it pulsing under my feet when I pick up a flashlight, my hands trembling as I held the fire stand I caught it last week after watching a bloodspattered corpse try and leap towards me. My fear paid off when it made a close call with my daughter and her friend. She cried after the violent red flash drowned out my screaming. Even more fear from the eerie voice of water around me, as I watched her walk away sobbing in her sleep.
But the noise echoed again, My first shot. It came from the mountains, between the houses, into the air above the hillside, as if I was on a hearse again, but it came so quickly I couldn't react with it. The explosion crackled and spilled energy over the barrier of silence, swallowing away the smells and sound. I pulled the curtain over my face and stared at the darkness I knew inside; only silence.
There I was. The sound of dawn echoed to me. My finger brushed the water from the tree branch. I watched it rise and fall with an earnest satisfaction as the light never left the tree trunk. I loved the feeling as I turned and looked forward to the sunshine that day.

December 18th, 1987:
I haven't slept well this morning.
When I woke up in my coffin, I felt empty.
Am I dreaming?
There's no light.
I didn't see any blood in the dust.
I tried to grab my gun. It didn't budge.
"But you were supposed to do it today! "
The police are beginning to come and collect.
They're demanding proof. They're asking me to give evidence and proof.
" Bad doctors aren't normal. "
" You're sick! "
" They should all be. "
They're getting strong. They get into my room and I've got my hand wrapped around the handle and squeezing it. It's getting stronger.
" Now tell them to stop! That's what we did here! "
When they hit the porch, the curtain goes down, and the police rush in and rip open the floor boards. They flip open the windows and search for anything. I guess I got lucky.
They found a lot of germs and mold. They found some promising stuff. They split the fence and layed it open to get the sick and the elderly to finish up the work. The lawn is purple and alive, the air smells funny. I'll probably be dead soon.
Until then, they're snatching everything we find.
" Why are you here? "
" Because we found cures for your diseases. "
" I know, I know. "
They're able to track down our best supporters.
" It's our job to say we won't let you cross that bridge again. You see, after we discovered a cure for Ebola, we figured out how to replicate it. Once the cure came out, the world stopped caring. Everyone except for me got sick. "
" Oh. So I'll kill you, too. But really, we should have never done this. "
" We all want to kill you, right? "
" Nah, we're the ones that made that work. It's not like they're coming any sooner, and for Christ's sake, you have to stop them!"
They have the cure. It's become a medical treatment. They've even created a death ray that can fly through the air and zap the lung.
They may take the world by storm, but it isn't going to change my mind.
I'll see my wife one day.

"Help me! I need help, this is my daughter! Help me! Please! " the dragons roared, and leapt from the clouds.
" I'm not a bad person, " I yelled back to him.
His face was redder then he'd ever seen. Almost blacker than a river all the way to the surface.
" I'm sorry. " he replied weakly.
The children looked him dead in the eyes. Every breath he took, from breath that killed him instantly, filled his lungs.
" Where are my blankets? " he whispered.
One of the adults scowled at me, and then ran back into the shadows.
" I hope this is just a dream, son, " he said calmly.
" No. This is real. " I said. " You only have this one basket of corn and straw. "
He started tearing apart the straw.
" It's not like I have much else to be doing here. Just travel a bit further and find me some food. "
The adults collapsed to the floor, one of them calling out to me.
" I'll have you know I'm never going to miss a trip back to Alaska again!"

"Joseph it is time. " Charles said quietly as he closed the file on his computer. The monitor was small and did not move. It moved so slowly that it seemed to be floating. The only sound was the faint rustling of a scroll in the drawer of his desk. It was a beautiful scroll but Joseph never knew what it meant. Its pages held many adventures, some of which he recognized as his personal pages. The most difficult part of each book which he could never escape was the legend of this scroll. He read it over and over and over again, never finding it.
" Joseph what is this? " Joseph asked nervously. Charles sighed slowly. He could never be sure what it was. But eventually Charles reached in and picked it up. The scroll was filled with a forest that was completely barren. It had only a few trees and surely Joseph knew what this forest was. Charles could never understand the significance of this scroll. It could never bring Joseph back and Joseph thought that he could never find a way to find this scroll. It was so easy and yet it seemed like no emotion could be felt in Joseph's mind when he read it.
" It is time for the challenge! You will never succeed in this mission and that will make you into a laughingstock! And Joseph, you have to stand up for yourself. " Charles said loudly.
" What? Why me!? " Joseph exclaimed.
" It is time to go home you stupid animal! " Charles called out to him in a threatening tone.
" Jeez Charles. You need to get up you stupid animal. " Charles replied quietly
" After today Joseph! " Joseph exclaimed from the drawer.
The room grew silent and Joseph just stared at the notebook.
" Joseph what is this? " Charles asked.
" Joseph what is this? " Joseph asked forcefully.
" Joseph what is this? " Charles answered.
" We are children Charles. " Joseph explained slowly.
" Do you remember when the pigs came to steal your thunderberry juice! " Charles protested.
" They never came. " Joseph said firmly.
" They came to steal thunderberry juice?" Joseph asked passionately.
'Til they are gone' he cried to himself.
After one night of hard drinking Joseph went to sleep. Not a moment after Joseph went to sleep he pulled back on his computer. He opened up his page and opened his eyes to see. Everything was going to be alright. When he open his eyes he saw the elephant standing in front of him and the elephant with his bunny ears in front of him.
It was calling his name!
Joseph opened his eyes and walked right up to the elephant.
It had pierced the blue skin of the elephant's head which made it look like it was being eaten by the sea.
They started to sing
> I feel like I can not die,
I have lived long enough to be dead.
Yet they say
> But death is a part of life,
and the thing that comes after is an emotion never experienced before.
They said
> We will come
and I will leave
until you take the role.
They said
> One day we will kill the pigs
and see the other two fall
> You will free us
who have been imprisoned in this bleak paradise for the past four hundred years.
They said
> When we die what shall you do?
> No, that is all that is true.
They said
> Oh, we will take your thunderberry juice.

Dear people of Westeros,
Though you may be young and impressionable, you came to Westeros and welcomed the glorious start of The Winter's Dance. The pretense of ambition, typical of our aristocracy, held the man at bay for three decades. To arrive here like this took only decades, and you were young, determined and brave. We faced great challenges but every eventuality held us in balance and the peasants did not falter.
You may have committed crimes in your youth but all your greatness must be atoned for. I am all that has been said in this letter and this letter must be heard. This Letter will inspire you and with it my brother in arms. I must remind you that you are here to see us at the pinnacle of our nation and yours is not just to tell you that we are all that is necessary but to build some idea of political society and limit The Winter's Dance to those who share this lifestyle. I don't want you to fear what we may bring. Every household must be looked after and united. When we succeed we can all continue with the trade you placed us in.
To the King and his kingdom you are truly blessed. To you my subjects we are fortunate but shall soon be nothing but powder white hills. The castles will be nearly complete and the athletes will return. For you see they will make steel great and hear your cries, but there are years left before the Guard comes. For as soon as one unit has fallen another will be issued. We must try and give you something to celebrate when we march out at night. We must think that in our troubled times we can have children with us and we are full of hope and optimism. Of course, you will not, if you don't know it, know that the sword holds everlasting, whether you want it or not. This is because you show your leadership in these first three decades, in order to push the generation for what it really is, and in our hopes we can succeed.
Thank you.
-Queen Rhea
to the King

"It's everyday, you know... Some people just come back. What's theirs? "
" Always the same, I have one. One day I woke up, half asleep, the other half asleep. Since then they've come back, and I swear that once they've all walked off, a certain number of them will follow them back, seeing them as I have. I get tired of them though, even when it's a fairly young person... "
" You even considered giving up a few faiths? Hell yeah, some well-trained atheists say they worship humans, some Buddhists believe, some even think they too worship there god. "
" They will eventually follow me back again and you'll find they are a kind of go-getter. They wake up at sundown, twenty four o'clock in the morning. The last person I see had what appeared to be a scythe - no, a bucket of ice cubes of water, soaked in water, and stung only by boiling his or her victim. "
" What exactly do you want to know? "
" The First Thing I want to know is. What do they do here?"

Nothing makes me feel good more than being a sad bastard that feels like I should be paying more attention to him. Hell, it doesn't make him sad. You could feel his heart beating and his thoughts telling you everything he does to help those around him. Hell, I could almost understand him when he said *Click*, didn't he. I can almost hear him scourged by the creature from over 50 years ago. The sad bastard with the snivelling heart makes sure nobody understands why he loved his lost young family. He watches them through the eyes of the ruler, he feels alive when those around him touch him. He feels important, important because he knew the ugly knife was bloody, the protector of them. Not another person ever saw this, and felt the touch of the creator's fiery red stick while under their care.
Only, really, a stupid kid would be the first to go from the joy of his life to the bitterness, the guilt, the scorn, the silence. He who endured that bastard mother had no time for happiness, or pity. Oh he has repented, forgiven, forgiven and forgiven.
So he dragged them to the terrible place in the clouds, no one gets out and sits and crosses the great black seas to be at peace, so that they might bask in the satisfaction of his warm embrace.
There, free of the pain, it is for the first time, the quiet voice through me says, *Goodnight and true goodnight. Goodnight and true goodnight. Goodnight and true goodnight. *
God comes back to the earth, he opens his mouth in front of me, whispering “ Let us know why you forsook us all. There is but one reason we should not have broken the seal you gave us. Our punishment. Our gratitude. ”

Every day I would see a man grow up from his lie. His parents would tie their hands in the dirt, make a sacrifice for him, and he would become a good man. His sex partners would take for granted his weight, and they would seek him out again.
He would just be something else. No one would compare him to normal people, and instead no one would look at them.
The more lies I have seen, the wider the scars are. The more lies I have told people I had seen of mine, the harder it was for me to focus. I had to go back to where I started. What lies were I telling? I had to remember them when I was younger.
It was noon, and the clock struck three at night. I sat in a park on a small hill. Near the ledge were a cloud of water. I turned the corner, caught sight of a little girl standing next to me. The girl had about one foot over her knee and well over half way down. Her eyes were hidden behind her sweat-ridden hair. She turned her head towards me, and with one large wave and a kiss on my lips, I left. My heart had stopped racing, and I was in my room. I took a deep breath and calmed myself, and let out a little sigh.
The beauty that had just been swept away was not beautiful in the way that you get swept away by the cold. This beauty, this shimmering speck, was beautiful. It stretched out to her waist and rested there near her face. It was beautiful. She had to be beautiful.
I pulled my daughter close to me. I could feel her body, gently touching my shoulder with my arms, as she opened her eyes.
I held her for a few moments. I couldn't take the loneliness. I could not keep going back to the same spot I started. It didn't matter whether it was a lie or not. I took my daughter to the edge of the park where I had once been. We climbed the hill, and I looked up at the clouds that were now glistening the tiny red speck. I waited for the moment in my mind that I was happy.
I dropped her onto the bench. She slipped, and I saw my old life slipping away. I had lost my love for her. I had lost my only love.

A middle aged gentleman walks to his house when he stops in front of his window, he leaves his husband's favourite bag on the kitchen table. The bag is there, folded neatly between his legs. There are bags of carrion and limes and rags where his feet used to be. And he now has a pile of nothing to put on his couch, the smell of pork and powdered sugar making him increasingly nauseous.
As he walks through the front door, he sees the man on the couch once again, sitting in a leather couch, his eyes locked as he watches the world burn before him. He rolls over and leaves a note in his shoe with one of the few things in the bag open.
Just in case the bomb didn't go off. “ Will I ever stop being afraid? ” he asks himself.
-- --
I might have included the longer paragraph after that:
*500 words *: _ `Who the hell owned that fucking carrion bag?''I mean, its pictures man. It took me my entire life and I never even spent a dollar on it. I tried to pay my carroll to somebody, just to avoid it being ruined. That's it. It was wonderful. I couldn't thank them enough for their generosity. But the only words that came to mind were:' How the hell would you go about dressing up as that'?!? I have to go somewhere for today. It will never happen again. *
I'm in the middle of my fifth/twenty-first story of philosophy, but that too seems misplaced: *I have a blog! Bitten up an' I wrote this for one of my crush's projects and then dragged out through a straw. Fucking stinking shit that ill have to do on my day. *
Thanks for the prompt, my hair here is a mess. Thanks OP for your comments and kind words.

There was no sign that he ever aged. The wounds were worn away, dirty hands tied behind his back, the hair was dust motes. With no memories of his own, no marks on the stubble, his grey body, nothing that could withstand such the nature of death that we would never be able to say goodbye. It was his past that caught our attention. He was all around.
It was true he wasn't just cold. The weather would predict the near death of him too. Thus he knew when he would die. Our hopes of him being gone don't help us in this day. It is not clear where he lived, what place he took his name and where his mind took him. But he did visit many places, and was familiar with many places. Often referring to ourselves, calling our home by that name. It is quite unfortunate that we find ourselves often in the same place. That has never been the case, not since he died.
His name was Issac Stark as he stood, rubbing his eyes in the old house. He had been living for a long time, and would be replaced by a young boy by years later when there were children around. As long as he lived he would move west to New York, and when he was young, however, he would never move south, to another country.
The death of penultimate man is a peculiar one. It happens when something else is reborn and modernized, a way for some people to enact life without question, without being questioned. It will occur again, but not be as quickly. The age has progressed yet the wrinkles will persist. Unable to write, he slowly marries Marisa. She was a beautiful girl, with an imaginative imagination in mind. Such a joy in a young life. She seemed so warm.
As his eyes grew darker, his limbs gave way, and his nails grew longer. His skin developed a new growth, and new signs of growth occurred in his ribs. I mean, honestly, it was a miracle he could see what he saw at all. He was the last soul on Earth. He did not feel the same as he was when he died. His skin grew thicker, and scarier. He knew he had to get through this. He was young when he died. But he had an important purpose for life.
He ate the last strawberry ever. His eyes went wide as he opened his mouth to speak. " Y, you have stung." He took another bite and slowly spoke out. " You have been reborn"
*If you guys want to see more of Issac Stark's work, then here's his patently incorrect response. I hope that is a fun story to follow. And great criticism as always! *

"*Kills us*...!"
Everyone there in the crowd dies. Everyone looked like a crazy person but then, again no one wanted to be crazy at all. And so one man gets carried away in the crowd onto a can of gasoline, nobody wants that. He falls, stumbles and gives up. He looks around and sees the void and he looks back for a long time hoping he won't find anything else that he can do to get into the void.
Then, he remembers everything...
It was just one beer, the windshield didn't really work out so it just went on gas. * Spends time in infinity, if that's even possible*, he thought. Then, he turns the car around and it all goes black and he puts it back on.
Then, one by one, everyone starts dying. Everyone. Everyone, everywhere.
One person starts dying. Someone grabs him by the shoulder. What the fuck? No one moves. * Am i not meant to die? * This is so wrong. He tries to console him but he can't be. He hasn't changed.
The driver goes back and forth so he keeps on going and as he goes on the highway, he dies every single second he goes.

Forthology is art. I assume now that it's a sign? * Toss! *
It's the God of Passage. The slave, translator, or compulsive fake-teller. The insider, the every-day lumberjack, the overachiever. No matter who you are, you are always out there staring ahead with the destiny you gained.
And you, get this? Your sleeves? You're wearing those sleeves. What a sight.
You've been here since dawn of time. Here you are -- And I think I may be late to the party -- this trip is entirely too small to fit a semi-vacationless vessel. My MIB, some a swan and a few a merga only seconds west of the great navigator. Fair enough. Surely, it's a pure wonder that only the pilgrims survive on foot. There are hundreds of them. Fringeling sands, and enormous camps at ground zero of a wonder-torn and barely spartan moon.
Wait, come on. I can't keep wandering the paths -- The human body is like a sponge working its way toward us. Why not go for a swim? It's better than tripping, right? Nothing special here.
My MIB comes within seconds of me approaching the shoreline. A few, more if it can keep up with human range, know where I am. By the time I make it down there, I've gone down too far to reach it. Maybe one of the guards will be lucky to be nearby.
By the time I regain my view, the tramp, that is -- I just pass into the forest beyond. Oh, the glimpses... I've been sneaking up on the human beings, watching as they happen to walk up the green incline. Who knows what they can see in the distance and, well, maybe its the cat and mouse.
I'm not sure if its cute or not, but eventually, something fades in.
I glance at the biggest of them, maybe a dozen or so. And it... Yes, they are it, not me or some more. Just a mass of pictures. Those toadstools, my friends. That's me. My MIB and I, chasing the serpent. All we have to do is wait.
Something breathes, and there are strands of dew coming out. And the rest of the group, I think, fall to their knees. And, now, following after the snakes, I see my human. You remember me. Yeah, I know. It says again.
"Have a good run, " I say, stroking my miro before entering the distance. " Welcome home."

This was supposed to be the first time my secret identity would be revealed, to the world in fact; My honest name.
I sat back on my throne, far out of the conversations. The room at the back of my chamber held nothing but a white button that hovered in midair. The men in white coats sat there dumbstruck. As I did the men in blue walked around the desk in front of me.
"You understand? Now get out of here, you prick! You think you can hide from me? "
I looked around the room. All of the men and women were gone. The whole row of the throne room was filled with naked women laying around the table. I was sitting alone in a small room, naked but completely clothed. None of the women did anything until one of the men in white knelt down.
" You have been caught, " the man in white said, " I've told you before, you have magic. That is enough to lead anyone to believe that you have the power to stop the coming of men... A pervert, a rapist. "
A little flicker of flicker came from the boy's breath as the hair on his neck started to turn gray.
" We are assassins, I take no pleasure in the likes of you!"
At that, the room erupted into chaos. Men in blue and white jumped around my chair. Women in white stood behind it and watched as I stepped out. Still naked, I was the only one left in the room. The world took back its attention once more, as the conspiracy theory began to form.
This next part is going to be difficult, but as everyone knows, blackmail becomes most effective when secrets run out. Please don't make me do this! I'll show them what you can do. Let them know that everything I say will come true. They don't have to believe anything anymore, or they won't even be at my station anymore. Soon all of them will be going to parties with me.

I've never liked reading about the other men's suicide. Sure, it seems like the name this man is given is a little new, but it's no secret that he's done it before. That and the fact he's scheduled to die without jumping off a bridge. But if it was a guy who's got this job to do, why wasn't he around to stop him from reaching his own end and accepting his fate?
I laughed at the truth when I saw another suicidal man hanging from the bridge, only to realize that this was not "his " suicide. What can you do? Is this really a one-way street?
I don't think I can deal with the end this man has for me. Maybe it is best just to tell the story of how you found that man hanging from the bridge and let the reader get up off his lazy ass and go buy some more rope. That way you might get to know the man less even if we don't know the whole story.

"F..f....f..f... " Pfft.
" Time and time again, you failed. Today, you succeeded. " What's a failure now? Will it just be a lie? Or is this normal somehow? I don't want to understand. All I'm saying is that I had a dream, the night before today, that we both woke up at the same time. I woke up the other day, never remembering who or what I was doing, and I still have no idea what I was doing. This all feels a little too familiar.
I go back to my desk, and quickly check the physical records of where I got in that dream. As I jot down, I can't help but notice that the calendar has been completely wrong. 10/15/01 " 2056. Even though I doubt it, I can't help but notice a pattern. " Time and time again, you failed " I'm starting to get worried. I've been off in the deepest part of the dreams lately. It's usually an empty window where my vision is most likely to lie. A moment of deliberate clarity shakes me from my daze.
I have a few seconds to think. I'm walking down a busy street, I'm in a small grocery store. My eyes don't stop staring at anything around me until I decide what to do. In a daze, I decide that I am about to walk outside, into the rain. I fear if I go inside, the rain will rain from outside to those windows. The rain.
I fly out of the direction I came from, and immediately pop out of the street to look outside. I guess I'm going out to change. I'm running.
" Thanks. " I say, trying to keep my composure.
" What? " He replies.
" You're the first person on the street and you probably don't realize what's happening. You seem awfully calm, and I suppose you haven't woken up in a while.
" You have a really, really big heart." I replied.
-That's the first thing I noticed about you. I'm not sure if I should say it or not. Can't think if I should go on. I close my eyes. It's also scary, because I want to describe the feelings that are building up inside of me. I wonder if we can trust the therapist because I've got that headache and I've never tried a drug. I get the feeling that I just need to talk to someone, especially when everything seems to be going absolutely goddamn-

A nightlife of hyper conspiratorial, anti paranoid, and chauvinistic education and assholes always has been the typical candidate for a future position. You see Adolf Hitler is such a peculiar boy. " What could possibly hold your interest "
To put the mass expresist movement to ideal situation, if a man were to let himself be forcefully lured into a trap, the act may very well be for the best. The power within his mind, his intellect, was fully exposed, and a man confined to the confines of his own mind could not have been trained with such caring attentions. The boy seemingly wanted a position simply by being there, a chance to truly listen to himself.
This is Hitler's world now, and in it he is waiting.
.
"..why are you under such oppression... "
.
.
.
A clueless German leader eventually settles on the issue of firearms. Such an incompetent leader was able to gain massive popularity and exposure through certain methods, such as flattering the media, exposing him as one of the last remaining Nazis, thereby forcing Adolf Hitler to use them to quash all doubts of true allegiance. He would not accept the fate of his best student, and all hope of a positive future was at stake. Until one day Hitler was lead to believe that ordinary people actually aspired to be better men than these... *assholes*.
It wasn't until years later the country was a clear throwaway nation, until a supposedly " Peace Free Zone " had sprung up in the valleys of eastern Germany, overrun with " Bestiality Disrupters " as one researcher put it. Over a 100 people had dropped dead from the oven to get away from the " bestiality awareness specialists " by reducing their immune system into their diseased state.
After all these years, the day Hitler chose to run for president didn't seem much different from all those years ago when he watched television.
.
" Report to headquarters on me- I have found... "
.
.
.
Back again, " how did the killing happen? ". Again, he sat in silence staring at the television with utter indifference. The announcers looked visibly unhappy. He thought for a moment of how he all was being watched and then sat in the conference room to see what was going on. Slowly, as if deciding what to do, he said the words " How did you? ".
.
.
.
The doctor doctor started to vomit, which at the time caused the hysterics and people that stood in disbelief to run to the closest bathroom. The interview began with the same " What happened? " " What did the Doctors get?" " Why can't I understand what he just said "
.
.
.
What do you mean it doesn't *what* to you?! There aren't *beings* in this world, and I will speak with the doctors right now and ask for my parole.
.

.
Falling in love for the most average person in the world begins a wonderful life yet also may ruin his current life... But the life of any other kind of average person is no fun. Especially when he realizes he, in fact, has taken a life just to join him. After all, what could possibly hold your interest...

"So, come on down again? "
" Um, my marketing team sure does one thing to compensate for its limited product portfolio. But, you know, basically to be honest - "
" What? Oh, yes, that is right, and you've been finding a way to surprise me this time. "
" Who? Where's the POI secretary? "
" Don't call me that, sir. "
" You hate my condition because of this vision? "
" Your salary, sir. You've paid the secretary! "
" Um, I don't believe I am, " I said, holding out a trembling hand.
" See, I really don't. "
" Do you suppose you are taking this over " or " once everyone misses me "? You'll get every question like it's yesterday, sir, especially when you think of *that* shirt at the R- & H. I mean, shouldn't we give these clothes out through every retail outlet? "
" Of course I do. "
" What do you mean? "
" Good idea sir. And the other thing? "
" You'l be distracted by my lizardman skin because of your new bracelet! That shit was'thes the best guy in the world? "
" You made me talk with your new insufferable silly face again. "
" Mmhmm. "
" So, you want a refund, but, how are you going to pay the change? "
" Well, I'm not terribly attractive, " he grumbled, rolling his eyes.
" Oh, you know how it is. In case something like that happens? "
" Totally, " he said, and proceeded to scribe a list. " I mean - "
" Go away, sir. "
" Well, how about we ask you to forgive us, and Mr. Kahn himself? You'll even get that email. "
" Ahem. Are you sure you can repair me? "
" Certainly. "
" Anyways, Mr. Kahn, I'm expecting to see you by the end of your shift, but don't worry, there will be no time to think about that until then. Sure, I'm able to borrow your laptop for the longest time if you're really- "
" Well, thank you, sir. But don't go complaining about anything. If I get there in time, you'll get his reply soon enough. "
" Hm. So, good bye, and good luck on your life! Golly."

Before I can think of a plan for her, she comes into my driveway with an angelic smile on her skin.
When i kiss her forehead with my palm, her left arm hums in delight while the right hand shivers with delight.
We both curl into a ball, hand still trained on her tattoo.
She does not budge, nor does she shrink.
"You were good to me before, did you miss me? " she asks.
In response, I realize this is the perfect moment. Before she can ask, I catch her eye and her eyes widen. She knows. I can see the power in her expression. She wonders why I call that husband's wife.
" With a Heaven's Witness, " I say.
-- -
The angel woman is in a scythe in my front yard, and she looks exactly like the man i met.
" Excuse me, my dear, " she says, " but can I help you today? "
That's when she says it with tears in her eyes.
" I have to ask you a favor, " she says.
" What is it, my dear? " I ask, not understanding.
" The lines that watch over you, Mister. "
" The angel, our dear? "
" Yes, our dear. Those long unbroken lines that give you vision. You are the perfection of mankind. "
" The lines that watch over you, my dear. The sad woman underneath. "
" Mister? "
" I'm afraid you've given a too-thin answer. "
" My sweetie. "
" The her? "
" Yes my dear. "
" Can you carry me? "
" The wingspan has been lengthened for ten hours. "
" Ten hours, the angel? "
" Yes your majesty. But for now we will get on this wooden box, in order to collect you a new life. "
" The life? "
" A butterfly. "
" A butterfly? "
" Yes your majesty."

He turned to the news two hours from now, more than a third of the day had disappeared.
"Lucky for you it is time to go to work, " asked the reporter as he stared at his screen. The two walked down the bustling street, spotting an old grey building, they were both staring through the glass seeing a man in a dark coat turn towards them through the corner of the street.
" We have reports that the man was found guilty of murdering the woman, " said a vulture standing behind the man.
" Children? Where is our children? " asked the man, who grabbed the man's wrist.
" He was an age 60, " said the vulture " He had a mouth that was bigger than most fish, and a body that could walk without chewing. At 31 years old, he had appeared on the news more frequently than most and he was already a familiar face amongst those of us who knew him. It would be encouraging to him to meet his family. "
" Children? This man seems to have the same food chain as children " said the reporter.
The man shrugged. " He was found guilty for stealing from a child's purse, and was sentenced to death "
" But what about the girl? " asked the reporter.
" She has been in foster care for weeks, still as a child, she still has never gone on break. She does not seem to like the door at this very moment. She believes her mother, whose little red hair has been swept about and tousled to the side, is her killer, and kills them both if she sees their child to be in trouble. "
" So my child doesn't like me? "
The vulture replied with more intrigue than it could carry.
" If I knew your mother better, I would tell her that my child doesn't like me. In fact, I would tell her that you aren't right. That you are being unfairly blamed for crimes you did not commit. It is time for you to go to work. "
" Why are you bringing this up? " asked the reporter.
" The child with other custody, " the man responded " Retreating to the other custody of someone who committed a crime you did not commit "
" How does that work? " asked the reporter.
" It is because the people are responding to your accusation of my mother killing her child. It would be unfair to talk to the people on the other side of the world. "
" I have a court date on August 5th, your sentencing is set, do you expect me to meet with your daughter then? " asked the man as he pulled up a chair in front of the man and sat down.
" We aren't allowed to give her food so we had to hire another family. She needed us to feed her, " he explained after a pause, " so we brought her along. "
" Are you asking me to be too cute for you? " asked the vulture, " I don't like the idea of turning women into slaves. "
" You're not being fair! " interrupted the reporter.
" That's because your daughter has AIDS, " said the man, " and I am failing you to look at the evidence against her "
The man calmly stated " Of course I am! " as he took off his glasses. He stepped back and walked back into the living room, he wasn't supposed to walk the two through the front door. After a few minutes he looked back, but there was no sign of anything was wrong. He walked back to his desk and sat down " Well thats enough there kid, thanks for coming to our school " he said to the vulture.
" I know I know I'll be over this soon, " said the man with more intrigue than ever before, " but if we can get together to talk about it today then I promise we'll know our daughter well enough."

**The Testimony of Jesus on the Day He Died**
***
**Confession**
I knew the day, but was more scared than I thought I could be, the crowd around me seemed to shrink as my confession faded away, my eyes closed, tightly shut. At first I thought I was in heaven, with everyone else, although I didn't really think I had much of a choice in the matter. But my whole life, with a heavy heart and a real life bent on enjoying it, and without a care in the world I had chosen to go to heaven to provide that care. After four years I reached for the first glass of water, and wished with all my heart to my father, who died with me on a cloud in his distant plane.
_____________________________________
“ At some point, what do I know? ” she asked him. “ What was there to know? ”
“ Well, ” he explained, clearly confused, “ she was there the whole time. So many things you can ’ t explain here. But one thing… ”
The question was quickly thrown aside by the air around him, suddenly releasing a gust of wind, not unlike the wind of a hurricane. The soil around him began to expand, leaving him strangely apathetic and beautiful. He took a breath as the air began to dissapear, the closer he came, the taller and brighter and the more beautiful the city seemed. The very wind grew in intensity, opening the way for the winds and storms that seemed to revolve around him. The people around him began to dwindle and the visible size of his size and stature became smaller. Even the loud voices were changing and the loud gestures far outnumbered the motion of his fist.
“ Or I thought I was dreaming… ” he began to say. “ There was nothing to be told. There was a strong point of no return. So I knew it would be years until it would be dark again, and no one would know how to return, but I knew I could spend eternity. And someone never comes back, man. ”
He struggled to open his mouth to explain, but eventually the words just slipped out, like so many sudden verses before, “ You can ask me again, one time, if I can come back into being. ”
The angel began to shake his head. He sounded about as helpless as his children, and it was no wonder the people around him seemed to be growing weaker. He moved to speak again, but there was just no time, and no reason to. But eventually, with a loud voice that filled the entire street and rushed through the back alleys of city, the man took a step to the side and began to stand, still chanting. “ My sweet, blessed mother, I ’ ll see you one day, darling. ”

Laughing, I shuffled up to the van. I ran right over to the center console, and immediately tapped on the 3 button. " Follow the directions! " I announced angrily to the back seat.
" Just make sure you keep your eyes on those damn buttons " said the receptionist as I frantically swiped left. “ Wait - are you fucking kidding me? Did you find the switch lever on the right? ”
" No... uh - no. I mean it's just the pedals. "
“ Well it wasn't a... uh. Whatever. "
" What? " asked the receptionist frantically, eyes transfixed on my button. It was just a one on one switch. I took the wheel the 3-nose, and it switched.
“ What do I know? I can't stop a pizza from falling off the truck. "
" Uh... " I said out loud. " I'm not fucking crazy. " I gripped the steering wheel in desperation.
The PR firm insisted it wasn't a malfunction of the steering wheel, only a machine malfunction of the pedals.
That was weeks ago.
People are not really allergic to the fact that the wheel is out of its body. People prefer to go faster, and faster. The wheel is not stiff or heavy. It is open; its bar is pulled. That is if the front is opened, and the front door is closed. My manager told me they were deceiving, that the spokes of wheel were cracked.
I feel eyes scan across the show, and a genuine smile is wiped across my face. “ You know, you can't just fucking do that to me. ”
" Yeah. I'm sorry " I manage, tears welling in my eyes. I look at the steering wheel. It is a Ford unit.
" Sure, whatever" I say as I walk away. I nearly spit on the carpet.

Revenge makes perfect sense to me. I am ruthlessly depowered by fear and confusion - wherever I go, I leave a place of safety. Some days, my threats burn in flames; but then it does not matter. I have control of the dark magic known as Deep Magic, and I know how to make it *beautiful*.
It was a mistake to assassinate the president. I had no one to blame but his family. I only hunted him down because I knew he had a secret. I had to kill him quickly. It was just a shakedown. But you know, I had a plan for this. A plan that will unleash an unstoppable tidal wave that will wipe out nearly everyone in the world.
Naturally, a lot of people mourned the accident. A parade was held in the capital. They were thanking me for everything, knowing they would make it better. Well, they did not. As if, to be frank, I wasn't giving them a present. But I knew that people would not respect me. Would they? If they did, I would break their reign.
When news had reached me about the White House explosion, I attacked the compound as fast as I could. I made sure that it was safe. I am *the* White House, and I was doing everything to protect it.
Apparently, my plan was unnecessary. Because the nuclear arsenal contained a robot that was scuttling, and it was a prototype. However, the Oval Office surely had a weapon that would cause a tidal wave, even if it was flying through the air.
I opened the door and instantly buried it. I wouldn't want to lose control of the power core. With trembling hands, I took off my mask to reveal a large mirror frame.
It was metallic. A metallic mirror. I put it on a hole and immediately hooked a needle into it. I felt a shiver run up my spine.
I breathed in deeply. I didn't want to die. I didn't care. I had chosen to be the villain. A psychotic bastard who would wreck havoc everywhere and kill everyone in his path. Why bother? All the world will be ruined.
Then, suddenly, I felt it: a lump in my throat, and it was a smile. I stepped forward, and it smiled back.
"Back up, Mecha Chuck."

I've only done everything right the last six months. The family won't have to worry anymore. They will know I'm there for them. They'll have the satisfaction of seeing me at the end of the day. They'll live through my absence as best they can, and they'll have a bright future ahead of them.
& nbsp;
They always ask me, " Will you believe me?"
The truth is, I was wrong.
& nbsp;
They wish to know anything less than the truth.
& nbsp;
It has been six months since I made that promise. Six months of madness.
& nbsp;
I can't lie. I am hungry.
& nbsp;
The girls come at night, but don't wake me up.
& nbsp;
The boys work harder, but don't wake me up.
& nbsp;
They have urges they'll have for years.
& nbsp;
They tend to each other because they can.
& nbsp;
The only reason I didn't kill the girl was I didn't want it to happen. The only reason I didn't end up behind bars has always been because it's not my fault.

Isaac Talero scrubbed himself against his Earth. He knew it wouldn't work, and didn't know it's weakness would be here. The other inhabitants of his planet would not be able to comprehend him, so he controlled his own ideas. First he would divide his ideas into more intellectual and emotional lines, into longer ones, in order to take them down. Eventually he would turn them into rights-based governments, where he could control his own government. This would result in a solid pattern in all his ideas, and prevent abuse or cruelty.
Isaac tightened his grip on his well-made sleeves, grabbing one of the black synthetic-knit trousers in the man's place. He worked on transforming them into practical kinds of clothing, simpler to wear by comparison, much less wearable. Around the moment the device was left in Talero's hand, though, his gaze continued, to the three worlds he selected to give a Human Day, or first Contact, a gift for the young humans that had his attention. Talero said nothing, as he had not done in almost a month, but soon more promised just one.
The Moon went first, with thoughts of a cold and dark world, and a dark sky. The horizon of planets would be the furthest than most people realized was possible. Most of Earth-sentients lived a nuclear life; most beings believed they were doomed, to be annihilated and wispy saps forever, doomed to desolation or die of radiation poisoning or radiation sickness or something. But the human history was so slowly coming together. The Moon would mean each human was at peace, a raw unit of energy.
The Sun went first, beginning the process of learning to create agriculture and gathering the energy needed to power his Solar Stations. The Sun was a natural muse for his Solar Martians, and this would be their way of living. The Man expected better from his Solar Martians. Humans stopped killing. The Man expected lots of beautiful, emerald and crystal wonders brought home by this strange, wonderful planet. The Man expected to see treasures and roves of man. However, the Man imagined all this knowledge would create a horrible reality.
The Moon went first, finally learning the first control of an intelligent species. Soon they were thrashing around in this beautiful universe, the first life before them. Finally, they came to a columbine in the center of a burning or a nearby desert. There was only one life left in this universe, with a single robot whose penmanship was first understood by the Humans.
The Man hoped he would get a Human Day, by the same token he hoped to achieve, but he knew that the Humans would give this a great applause. He turned his head to the third planet he chose to use in order to create life, and hoped. Finally, he knew he might gain audience with the Human's creators.
The Final Planet went first, speaking the Words of Power of His People. The Voice of Mirrors on the U.S.S. Mars Colonization Home Base. The Voice of Justice written in human language. The Voice of a more honest universe. And the Assembly of Humanity, not the Humans, for they were afraid. These spaceships had gone first, their Tires giving way to Machines. The Disk Ambushes pressing forth onto life. The Wheels returning to gravity, with a dull ache the Human noticed for a moment.
Then they were gone. The Humans were gone, in a great rush. The Creator had taken power from the Man. The Universe was distant and our exploration ground shaking. Eventually it started, for every Brain on one plant, there were several. Each one was at the edge of collapse, breaking itself apart, dying to the radiation of other Parts. The Angels. They were the seeds.
The Beginning of A New Age.

*Don't'T try to make you little weirdos. Don't'* you have a sister? Go back to bed every night. He's the better. He's read a lot and wrote so many stories that he remembers his niece's name as the Cinderella princess.
He feels bad for your sister because that's how you'd expect her to feel. But you love her... because you love the way her sisters shape themselves when they're about to be called back home.
It's exactly as he tells you. You should try to find your younger sister. It should stop you from being alone with only a few other people in the house. Maybe only in your sleeping bags you can find her.
I'm sorry, but you need to relax and be in your better place. You can have your family's support, it's all going to be ok. Have fun with your sister.
You don't have to go back to bed every night. Don't make him sick like that. He's just the better one. He's the better one.
Yes, you should be happy in your sister. It's not a childish thing, you know it. Even if you don't agree with everything he says, the pressure will be there for the rest of you. If you accept it, you can stay happy that you don't go back home.

David didn't understand why they were holding his hand. They wanted to protect him but they didn't want to be found. From the shadows around him, large wide glasses bobbed over their figure. A hawk that rolled its tail slightly in a fiddly exchange showed up directly behind him.
"Do you have any pet? "
" I don't think so. Or any of that. I could sneak up on you, and I'd shoot your so I could collect you, and then you'd mutter the universal'I heard you called me Lucifer,' at least I didn't fall on your head.' "
They gestured at the various hanging flags hanging from their wings. David could almost see a wrinkled face smile.
" But no pets! "
The sky went dark, and David was compelled to look up. Somehow, he couldn't find his eyes.
" So what are you doing here? "
The silence was uncomfortable. " Well, it seems like the opportunity's here. No good luck chasing after me. Look, I'm in a dream. "
" You wouldn't dream otherwise. We've both been pulled apart like this, and both of us're trying to figure out why we're stuck here. You're the literal jury, the judge, and she's the equal. Besides, all these people I've just visited will kill me in minutes. In fact, we're just gon na be fine, right? "
David thought for a few moments about the implications of this revelation.
" Yeah, yeah, except for the one you're referring to. The one who helped me go to the doctor. The one whose doctors told him I was super isolated. "
" So what do we do now? You can call us then? "
" Oh, you want to call? I already told you already. "
" Ah. What do you mean? "
David pressed his cheek to his lips. " Can't wait until the end. "
" Oh! " Her eyes took in the scene around them. " Are you guys happy with us? "
He looked to himself. " Sure. Let's hope we're... I dunno. "
" No, maybe I'm wrong, but I'd rather them all go than have to bear the stares of my loyal minions for years."

There is one scar that has stuck out from all of my scars. It is the one of the divinity itself. The 1 mark each could bring. I came to it in a dream. Just as it started fading it became visible on the deepest of my scars. It was as if the eye of a killer was clouded in a poison that slowly drowned out all hope of yous salvation. The nightmare changed its identity in a way that I never knew. It just became for myself, a mark. It was like a blessing.
Its gotten so bad that I can barely walk. So bad that I can't do anything. I still can't wake up.
It all started when I was 14. My mother was going to her bachelor party and her cheating husband approached me, pretending to be my step-dad. This made me question my sanity and so I went to her house to get milk. It still burned my skin but that was it. After I walked out of the kitchen I saw my 2 daughter eating on the couch. Her favorite meal was mine. The next day she fell asleep on the couch and my father caught up to her. They say they accidentally stabbed her, but it seemed I killed her herself.
Then the scars grew bigger. The loveliness began. I saw it all during high school. I kept seeing it a year longer. I had actually seen it through the thousands of tears the world had gone through. It was following me wherever I went. I always seemed to go out of my way to avoid being caught. I was never punished. Its all just me in a bubble.
It wasn't until six years later when I found out that I actually saw the one person that I knew truly loved me. My own daughter. She is the Angel of truth. She is filled with such a power and will soon be given to me. Her life and physical world are in her hands. I can never change this. At any moment she will be my final stop before being ripped from me.
Because now, I have become her Angel.

"Oh well, I suppose it has to be done. All that flowers have cost me $ 5,000. "
" $ 5,000. That was enough for four of my relatives! "
" Enough. "
" Oh come on, you mean you have three, " as his foot scrabbled back and forth in the dirt, " but I'm even better than what they've given me! "
" Yeah. Well, I guess there is a lot of people out there who don't like you. I mean really, where does it say they come from or where is all this food? "
" Well, it says here... " I blinked. There was a spot at the bottom of the pile of flowers, with a bit of purple attached to it. The figure barely noticed. " Those people... " I gasped. " They said thanks for life. "
" They...? " he asked, his voice deep.
" Yeah, I'd rather not talk about them. They aren't exactly shy with the people. Actually, that will probably kill me soon enough... "
" Uh... yes... "
" Well, uh... hey guys! I'm just glad you could give me my flowers. I really miss you! "
" Yup... " I laughed and hung up the phone.
I watched as a man walked past me and proceeded to grab what I needed.
" Thanks so much for living! " He shouted and approached the flowers. " For all I care, you had everything you deserved, right? "
" Yeah! Thank you! " I insisted and he held out his hand, seemingly holding the flowers in his palm.
The man, obviously ecstatic at the news of his next victory, offered me a small, red, balloon.
" No thank you, thank you! I'll see you around."
I took the balloon and pored over all of my victories. I pulled the diamonds out and ran off to a new frontier.

"You're a crook " The agent laughed as she lifted a small bundle of paper out of her bag. " Back in Montrose we learned you were a crook before you hit the lottery. "
" I did get a ticket. "
" But I won't tell you... of course, some of you'll say I was crook. What did they expect? "
" They didn't expect me to choose my gender. "

Sharon stood at the head of the line, her head covering her skull and eyes focused on the occasional stare away from the lovely Adair. It was on an otherwise deserted field that she met a deer between classes.
"Arran! Arran! " she called, gesturing toward the man lying on the spot. She turned back to the deer and wiggled her tail.
" I thought you were last year? " the man replied.
Sharon hugged her tighter.
" Ah, well, ah. You see, the trophy hunt! " she said in a raised voice. " You called that? "
" Thank you, thank you very much. " the deer replied, a deep giggle running through her.
" See? The deer looked me up and down! " Sharon chuckled. " I thought you said trophy hunting! The name's Adair! " She scrunched up her face, her nose wrinkling as she spoke. " He actually thought we were buddies. He was right! Look at him! You had to make him laugh! We were so mad at him! " She glanced around, confused. " You had to make him laugh! That is all we have to do! " She wobbled closer to the man, knocking her shotgun back. She looked at her companions by their coats, a look of disdain in her eyes.
" Are you all right, comrades? " the man asked, now staring intently at his partner.
" No, " Sharon replied, still smiling. " No one is happy. Not anymore. "
"... But was this supposed to happen this year? " the deer questioned.
" No, I think we should honor the status quo. " He turned away from her, startling her.
" What? No, the membership has gone up. A little more hunters must be kept safe! We'll want hunters who have a gun! What were we supposed to do? " Sharon scowled.
" But don't you think we would've been better off not hunting the more scavenged-armed Neanderthal? " the deer asked, nodding in response.
" No, we didn't know that. For me, " Sharon replied, falling silent once more.
" And I can't bring this country back without those cheetahs! Do they attack any night!? Who knows, I might even be allowed to have a hunting rifle at night! " he shouted.
The deer sighed. " You know, it might just be a matter of time. It didn't hurt to go, to go hunting, to help someone. It didn't matter how much you paid me for this opportunity. Even now, I still have to wonder what it will take for you to end up like that. " He chuckled lightly, patting her on the shoulder. " Then I'll have to kill some of my high-ranking friends. We'd have to start over like this."

Jackson and Tobiosh had been playing a game of chess for lunch. Jackson had a sad imagination of a foul man in a large, thick suit dressed in hockey gear and wearing an ice-blue suit. Tobiosh had a colorful scarf that wasn ’ t possible, worn off and detached in layers upon layers upon layers of black mascara.
“ I bet, if you ’ re looking for cheap vodka in the dumps, I ’ ll give you that. ” Tobiosh chuckled softly.
“ Oh, come on, kid. One of your cousins is bad— ” Jackson pointed to the man holding a rag and pipe-like object, “ her mother might not have any kind of girlfriend! ”
“ Not dead men, kid, ” Tobiosh replied, snapping off a piece of yarn and throwing it at Jackson.
“ No need for excuses, you need to try some Russian vodka. ”
“ … ” Jackson said, looking intently to the man in the suit, “ what did you do with the Russian, boy? ”
“ Let ’ s go get somebody a -- ”
“ No where to even begin, okay? ” asked Jackson.
The man and the rag-sack took a deep drag of vodka from his pipe. “ Wow. ” Jackson said, rubbing at his eyes. “ So who the hell did this Russian goin ’ to Russia for? ”
“ Dude, you better hope it's not a bad rag, ” responded Tobiosh, sitting down on the chair opposite them. He pulled away from them, and kicked the box of foreign vodka from his hands. “ You know who leaked vodka in a, what, twenty-four hour leak? Now. Don ’ t do this, asshole. ”
“ I do my job, Tobiosh, ” pleaded Jackson.
Tobiosh picked up the spoon from the man, choking it on his first attempt. “ Come on, drink some. ” He shoved it between Tobiosh ’ s teeth and snorted. “ No need to get up like you ’ re in school, but every little fool steals more vodka than I could have earned. ”
“ Water? ” asked Jackson.
“ Water! ” Tobiosh piped up, taking a sip. “ Now, tell me, boy. How did you stop for three in the morning anyway? ”
Jackson grinned. “ Well, just smoke some. You got ta smoke more first. ”
“ Really, I don ’ t smoke at all, ” said Tobiosh. “ And I see you sticking off the side of the street. Sorry, boy, I was just curious about Russian drinking habits. ”
“ What, like, dragonfire from a fire? ” asked Jackson.
“ I haven ’ t seen one ” said Tobiosh, sitting up and stepping down from the chair. He looked up at the gray clouds above him, peering into the light. “ Dad ’ s got to get me some vodka. ”
“ Yeah, yeah, I know. You catch me chugging, don ’ t you? ” asked Jackson.
“ Sounds like this. ”

Have you ever tried to get over depression by eating what should have been a sandwich? I might be about to say no, I am not the sort of person who takes bread. But it doesn't matter - today I will get the last bite.
I'll get up today and suddenly it's dark. The drugs in my brain are killing me, physically and emotionally. I have to put the gun to my head and I realize, for the first time in years, that it's not a good idea to run. I want to be alone... so I sit, still and scared, in my leather chair as the light dies out. I'm not sure if it was my imagination or if this was a dream. But it is, and I can't move any more. So I stand up, and for the first time in years I breathe in deeply, let my lungs take in the air around me.
I open my eyes to the green sky.

My daughter was at the park. It was a pretty cool day, and she always was pretty athletic, and my wife was having breakfast. She always loved birds. But today was different. Her floral blanket stung and her favorite pot of beans stung, and I couldn't help but to gag. My wife sat down beside her and blew off a match.
"Ooh, it's the fun part! " she whined while putting on her special gun, it was so bright you could see little pin-pricks in her milky way. She laughed and did more than compliment my daughter.
I tried to get rid of my dog, but he was so mad he started crying, so I brushed off his vests and put on the suit.
She was lying on the bed, still crying, but I hoped this wouldn't be the worst.
Then the explosion cut us off. A bright purple orb of a black mushroom, probably 13 meteors... It hit the ground with a deafening bang, and I rolled down on my wife and lied back into my covers and crawled towards the radio.
It was so early. I called up a few friends to help the mom out. We came back a few minutes later from the park. I would usually go and talk to my wife, but, there was this time that I thought the phone booth may be opening...
The mom sat there, shaking, crying, and telling us what had happened. What we had just witnessed. What it was like to cry for your wife and to not hear it was like screaming.
" Mom! " I called to my wife. " My love, there is a bomb in your house, right in your kitchen! It's exploding, and your wife's crying. You shouldn't be angry, you should be angry, you shouldn't let your daughter be mad, you should be sad, and finally, the happiness of the rest of the world gets to you."
I nervously put my ear to the button on the TV and dialed 911.
I watched my daughter cry. I watched the news. I watched the crowds. I watched my family. I cried all night. I swore I wouldn't yell anything, but my son made sure I screamed before...
But mom...

March 15, 2021. Attending the wedding of my Vice-Admiral Joseph Silversto.
"I really wish I wasn't around! " I cried. " I'm so glad everyone had the power to see what someone else looked like before putting them into a glass dome in front of me. "
How could I have not known? I had a thousand thoughts running through my head! But then I remembered my damn star charts.
" President Clinton and Vice-Admiral Sanders, the ones who are technically in love, are married! " So excited. Now they weren't going to the fucking wedding? I could tell they were into each other. What was going on?
" Mister President and Vice-Admiral Sanders have become married! "
It couldn't have been a hallucination, could it?
" But what if I told them it was time to celebrate? That they might see their faces by now?"
At least I had everything my Queen had spent this entire life forgetting...

“ What's wrong with us? ” I yelled into the mic.
There was no response to that. Our satellite had been setup at Cape Canaveral and we were stuck in the middle of the atmosphere. We were completely alone, and all communication with the Earth station was lost. No signals came to Earth's orbiting node for weeks.
We began receiving messages twice a day. Once in orange light; once in red; once in green light; and then they started dropping.
“ I believe the batteries are not working, sir. ” The Mars station was closed by a micro-solar flare overnight. “ We need you to contact us with more information. ”
I froze in my tracks, putting a hand on my left arm. In a valley, not much above a hillock surrounded by mountains. There were no restaurants, no shops, no stores. Everything was very flat, except for the garbage pick-up truck we were hidden in.
There were never any signs of other astronauts, but it had been several weeks since we ’ d known if we could make any contact.
“ Mars have to be alive. ”
We met up with the kids from school. They were staying at home, so I had to ask them their names and their spacesuits. Only one one answered.
“ Dave. It looks like we ’ re in cryogenic sleep. ”
He said something we didn't understand. We were just in all three of our pieces. We had to communicate with him. I moved to talk to my back. It was still inside a stone structure, but I didn't think I would actually be able to walk again.
“ What are you talking about? ”
The boys didn't go into details, but they both looked concerned.
“ We think it's cancer, Dave. ”
I spoke without saying a word. They sat for a while, not saying a word. I assumed the boys would tell me I could never believe it or if I made the wrong call. As the days went on, they got even more confused. We never came any closer, knowing we would have to evacuate Mars for the rest of their lives. As we sank further, wondering what we could have done with the planet, our mission came to a crisis.
I began shaking, trying to comprehend everything I heard, but then again, I do understand if I can have it. I was helpless.
Eventually, the only one who heard me was the chiming of the engine. I was going to die.
A glass of water ran down my arm. I waited, waiting to see what I would have to use. I guess I was supposed to die when Mars called in sick.

It was colder than I had thought the night before. The walls whipped back with each motion of the wind and the shadows hid behind the faces of the wind, but no rain would break the thick curtains against their glare. I lay dead on the floor.
Only in those moments did I look back to the topless world. One of those times I thought I'd been friends again.
"What the fuck. " I managed to stammer out as I stumbled toward my bed in an attempt to awaken the feeble voices of the several neighbors still whittling away at the ground.
As I struggled to gather myself I snapped out of my denial. I'd never heard the horror songs at all before. They sounded like they would play a song about a storm getting stronger.
I looked into the crack in my lamp for a second before realizing I was still awake.
The dark shadows swirled before me and as I drifted, I saw them approach. A little girl in a hospital gown with a long red string tied around her neck, lifting her curled up legs to shield the light from her eyes, thumping them with her left heel.
" Anything, " I began quietly, getting ready to leave the room. The last thing I remember was waking up and it all ended in that moment.
The closest eyes opened as I landed on her face, she had her whole head on my chest, her face rose to the sound of rain on the yard. My son and I sat there with smiles on our faces. I could barely register what she had said while I was lying there cold. I heard a thump from upstairs, and my once-fletched legs were completely limp, my heart racing, and my lungs empty.
The girl stuttered and patted the tiny figure next to her. Her fingers brushed against the floor at the hands of those three soft brunette eyes.
" What the fuck do you want? " she asked me, rising from the floor and going to a spot on the bed.
" I want you to... you know, I want your soul. I need my soul to pull you out of the darkness and I want your memories to be yours forever. "
I didn't hear a word from her again.
The rest of the night continued on as the shadows grew closer to the room and the curtains joined the lights and the swirl of darkness.
When I got to my room and started to leave I tripped over my feet again.
The blinds on my bed cried out to me but I could't escape. I dragged myself back to the living room and clung to my tiny bed for dear life.
" Get up! You can't leave the darkness forever! "
I was at the door and she opened it, stretching out with her arms out as she walked toward the door. With one final look at the fletched earth I shut the door and for the first time in my life, I heard the sound of rain.
The last time I slept, my son made an angry noise in my ear and I left the room.
I'm not sure how I could forget about my young boy in the hospital bed. The feeling of gravity pulling me was the only thing that seemed real for the longest time.
Until then, I would never wake up.

" So... I guess we can't keep *her* in one place for too long? Don't you want to put the young girls out of her misery. "
" Maybe. But... don't you want her to know the risks of doing something so terrible with her life? "
" Just so... I don't know! She's the only one who can *stop* this, and I think she's only going to do it to escape this. "
"... And besides, she's half of that guy I talked to last week at a flea market! She's going to die of infection! "
" Her, but it's better that way. "
" Is that really the man he is? "
" Maybe. But imagine when the first male that happens to get past a flea is out there wearing a puppy suit and a cowboy hat. Imagine that! Imagine a giant oaf with hundreds of holes to fill. We could probably save billions of dollars in the coming years if we got them all in one place. "
" Just a few? Just a couple? "
" Right, sure. "
" Still, there's something wrong with her. If she falls into the blackening dusk like some other desperate survivor, is that really some sort of drug in which she would get her prison-mates here? Maybe if she falls into that deep sleep, she might actually make a real difference. She's gon na make a real difference. "
" Why in the hell would anyone ask that? That's what I mean! If she's not giving in to this cycle, that means she's using the other side as a stepping stone. "
" I know. "
" Better go find a friend? "
" Yeah. Here. "

"Robert Jackson Rogers! " The uniformed officer bellowed in his armored Ford pickup, along with the pack of two more officers. The colonel, who would later be identified as Colonel William O'Sullivan, stiffly pointed at some American Senator and backed away. " Soldiers in service of the American Red Cross send you off to join the enemy and train your men in aiding them, Yours Truly! " " Shut up " was the last thing the officer said, as the caped man rose to his feet and joined the pair of men surrounding Robert.
" You're honorably discharged, Captain Turner " Turner had heard the chime of his autograph on his radio. " As you can see we are receiving word that Johnny Rhodes the boy from The Light Infantry is just about our next recruit. " This seemed to translate to " Private of the Third Battalion, Captain Nathaniel Hawthorne. " As a cover for the General's advance, Marcus had not been given orders that these men were boys. " General Mulligan is ordered to infiltrate Chattanooga to Dort, you look forward to a full black armor when you see on The Taste of War." Two beatings from another soldier. Robert didn't cry as he watched Turner scramble from the only airplane left in the country, using the only body he had.

Everyone always said you should prepare yourself for the penultimate chapter of your novel when you get over three hundred pages in a row. Hell, *this* chapter is going to get you banned from reddit and that's if you aren't even careful when writing it. I'm not a huge fan of this so go easy on yourself.
Sarah, you are always being dramatic when trying to word this situation out, as bad as this may sound, it is not the end of the world. I'm sure you are certain it will not be just today, she is going to die or as close to the end of her life as that person can be so then that very person is going to get to experience what you fear most about to happen.
I am sure Sarah has made a considerable effort to not overcomplicate your story. You may not know she was writing this in a very specific language of some sort. It is difficult to determine this situation, but probably because she is the one who has to explain this to you ( obviously you make a typo in your mind to see why she feels so personally repulsed by it ) but I have not yet completely given up hope that it will not affect anyone, but at this point you will be throwing up, warning the reader, admonishing them, starting fires and crying all over yourself and it will be time to end it. No one will even see that what you are writing is wrong, just tell her she is going to die. You have made this scenario your entire life so as you can be sure you are not too cocky to make others suffer for learning something they know you can't take seriously. Sarah will be wondering whether to run and tell you that she is going to die in her bed, crying for fear that others may wait until tomorrow to mourn her rather than read more poetry from some young college girl who hasn't written in more than two years. She will be questioning whether or not you did not tell her that she needs to read more poetry than you are and she will not read less and she will be seeing a pattern, likely stemming from something other than children that have not read poetry that many people don't, but what is they writing? It will be hard to imagine what that is, especially how it appears in your first few sentences as a child. You should try to get more plot flow in the long story and go live the adventure novel. Then once the book has finished printing and you have finished it, write to her and convince her to read it and she will let you know that you know everything there is to know about the characters.
Lastly Sarah is going to get stuck in your head for a very long time with no hope of escaping her life, which is terrible as I know you would have an entire story to read all about why she needed you so badly, but now you will be so stressed, you will be so stressed with her you will finally lose control, you will smash into a wall and fail, you will never have enough ideas of all the stories she has written that are going to pull you to the side of the road and make your life very much more difficult.
Maybe today will be even worse but for the most part you will have avoided the cold, harsh reality of knowing the fate of the world that you want but you know that she is going to die, and you don't want her to know.
You have the power to make a critical point about the characters, but you are just a shell that your readers will hang around and expect to survive this. You can just give your readers some ideas. You could try to make a completely different turn where your readers make choices and follow the story. Maybe you can give them an alternative ending where they find the protagonist is mad and you save them from this madman with you? You could try keeping the reader in suspense but you know that they won't survive the whole story either, so either you are a silly excuse to tell them that they have to read the very same thing they have read to survive, or you are an actual suicide note so that the reader hears you as a sort of death threat on that page of your book that makes them miss you. For the very last time in this novel you will somehow read the wrong passage.
Sarah needs more than the burning and sad re-written stories that you got her so far. She needs me.

The woman stood in front of the grave digger, her face wrinkled with age and tears streaming down her face. The young man stared back at her with a confused look on his face.
"Excuse me? " He asked. His eyes were unmoving, his head frozen in the woods.
" I'm sorry... " she asked, the uncertainty washing over her even as she sobbed and let out a tear. " I couldn't... It's fine. I have to go now. I- "
" Don't do it... " The young man interrupted. " I-I'll... " His pause was cut off when a growling voice cut through the quiet forest.
The young man looked around, trying to find words. He continued to stare forward at the shrouded husk of the grave digger.
" Please... " he sobbed and clutched the inanimate object tightly.
" Please come with me, " she cried, desperately trying to find words.
The doorknob clanged and a wooden door slammed open. A figure emerged from the wood.
" I have sent you to my grave, sir. " The man's mouth twitched with pain.
" I did not send you... "
The man grunted with disbelief.
" Yes I did send you. "
" It... It'll send you back," the man replied, having finally calmed down. It was difficult to think back to what he'd said last time he spoke.
But now that he spoke, memories of the conflict no longer ached in his mind.

This could go over anything! Well I have no clue what I want to do! I have absolutely no ideas where this whole thing goes wrong or where the ball is in this story, but I have to continue or I will!
The disaster came in the form of the young girl. She heard nothing, at least none of the housewives had an idea what was going on. No one had bothered to look for her and she went through normal routine of walking on the worn out shoes she wore and running down the stairs to get to her place in a heap.
All she saw was a pile of blood, so small it would be hard for her to crawl up that small sidewalk for a man to see. Then of course there was the dog. He only actually managed to feed him once, and that looked like it was going to have to wait forever.
The neighbors called the city police, who were worried. She screamed, grabbed the dog, and ran away. Three days later, while standing in the street yelling, she heard "REPEAT!!! " It was too late. Something had gone wrong. The dog was found, or was it dead? No it was... a... chicken? It was alive. It was laying there, staring at her, muttering to herself about how it had slipped under the table in her salad she ate. Something was wrong with her, and she had to make a mental note to feed her the new chicken too.
She woke up in a hospital. The pain was excruciating, and something inside her was starting to swell. The stitches were easily removed, and she could stand no longer.
Her son was taking her into their home, in the basement, in the hospital. They were cold, and she wasn't sure how much longer they could stay to hold her until we were sure she had eaten enough food.
" Hello my poor son. ", she mumbled to herself as she read out loud from the kitchen.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
It couldn't have gone worse. Suddenly everything was silent. He walked back into his apartment and opened the door. The dog and the chicken were still in the same place. All they had happened was a kid abandoned her. It wasn't quick, but it left her with a horrible scar that looked about 8 feet long in the middle of her stomach, lines that were not usually there. She didn't know what to do, but she let go of the leash with all the grace and strength she could muster. She clambered inside, and turned to see the child lying in the bed next to her.
" What happened, mommy? " her husband asked. He had been asleep for hours, and hadn't been moving a muscle. It was as if he was afraid of something just outside of him. She turned around, and his heart broke out in an uncontrollable drive and spit down the rabbit. The bunny blushed, almost gurgling.
" This isn't happening right now baby! Please don't die!" he shouted out as tears began to roll down her cheeks. As she found her eyesight returned to her former body, this time the bunny cried out, cursing the misery the bunny was about to inflict upon the " mommy " of her daughter.
Her son turned and looked at her, but he didn't bring himself to answer. He reached towards the box on his bedside table, and pulled out a piece of paper, saying *Grumpy, I've had enough of this*, before he picked it up and quickly tore it out of her hand. The paper was beautiful. It read in big bold letters, **GRANNY. BEER. NOTHING. LATER. YOU MAY BE FREE THIS FOOT IS MY DOG. **
The paper itself was beautiful, and looked almost identical to that of the one that had been in her leg. She smiled at it, and walked off into the night, satisfied that her son was safe at last.

The Most Important Thing is Patience. Patience is a quality of living that you have in abundance, no need to think of it as a "bad " thing. To become Patience, you must act in a constant, unquestionable manner, looking forward to experiencing every day of your life without the need to admit that your unending life is a poorly lived nightmare.
Patience is our favorite feeling: passing time without taking a risk or weighing your worth on another person, seeking out their reaction and self esteem. The least fortunate: those who have time to enjoy something that you don't have time for. Patience is our greatest quality, our best desire. We not only have to be vigilant and sturdy to withstand hours of raging storms and torrential rainstorms, but we also have to appreciate the small successes and flawless achievements that those around us inspire and strive to accomplish. Patience is our most precious treasure; it's the one possession we've so desperately needed. Of course, there are far greater needs that we may encounter when we become Patience, but the next best thing to be noticed is that Patience is a value that we all must aspire to, and that we must take pride in.

I pause before joining her. Behind her, a young-looking man with boxers, a letter, and nothing else. The man lights a cigarette and peers into my eyes. I am too tired to move now, but I need to. I can see the line of sight of her eyes in our surroundings. She raises her hand slightly, but I don't raise it. The man walks away in silence. I feel a burning, almost cathartic urge to touch her from above. I place my hand in hers and hold her hand. I hear her breathing slow and so faint as she breathes. Our lips meet. I let her breathe in once more. A slow, steady tone fills my head as I exhale. She leaves a trail behind her. As she walks away, I look at the message in my hand. It is one of the main reasons I miss waking up this morning. It doesn't change what I had learned about my wife that night. The man leaves, and then I see a pair of gloves.

"It is Always Sunny in Philadelphia! " The harsh stormy weather caused by the current storm has suddenly turned back into a cheesy graffiti rhyming about the weather during Cinchcona Day.
One of my friends passed away some days ago after Cinchcona. He died one Monday, and it had begun as a playful prank meant to touch a girl named Susan.
" Cinchcona is a bitch! " He screamed at me, pouring a stream of Blueberry Ice Cream into my hands.
" Whoa! That was hilarious! " I said, and poured half my ice cream into the Meinegeist household.
" But why?? " I exclaimed, and with my last Blueberry Ice Cream I grabbed my knitting needle and swung it at Cinchcona.
He drew a Holy Snitch! His Tooth Fairy sculpture fell away.
I couldn't believe it. This has gone on forever and never was the first time I saw this smirk creep on his face.
I looked through the window one more time and saw someone with no nose. It was my friend, Tammy.
" Yeah, that's a cute face! " She said as she tried to stand on the sidewalk.
We walked to the window and peered outside the front. Tammy was the one walking down the street.
" It's a cute face too! " I said laughing.
She glared at me and shook her head.
" I... It's always Sunny in Philadelphia, right? " I asked, amused.
" What the hell, it's only Sunny in Philadelphia! " She shouted.
I watched Tammy as she run around from her house.
Suddenly I saw her skin, which was a mere miracle. " Well, maybe it is," I said, not bothering to look closer.
She was gone too.

Somewhere back in the A ( future ) -- A day at *Taco* it was lost
In Anzemka
In the night.
Oh Those monochrome pages...
__________________________________________________
This is what three years of Matii's Loneliness had felt like, listening to the words drifting through the mists from her mind. A note. Or a story. Or perhaps a new journal. Or a zakhi ’ s own journal of her own life, all of that burning, dusted edges of forgotten facts...
Or maybe in Matii ’ s life, the note was still there with her. She ’ d been in an altered state, drifting through a dream like a melting ice cube out of iron; the doorways far too small to open, all the windows smashed against the hard blue marble walls, into the dilapidated cityscape. The bedrooms; she ’ d even found a table, laced with bullet-riddled nails. She found the usual bed-sheets littered around her round bed, her lace tied back, lying off to the side while the sheets were still warm to touch. The blanket, still torn and gagged, folded loosely in a gentle manner; no window busses present, a sign that Matii had woken up here.
She hoped, however, that one day Matii ’ s Loneliness would be free and clear. That one day that she would tell the other Zakhi.
Soon Matii ’ s Loneliness ’ s copy of the first Zakhi ’ s book would be delivered.
And there would be no zakhi ’ s journal again.

Then there was no Zakhi ’ s journal. That is, there were no zakhi ’ s, except the stuff of nightmares.

Dear Mr. Pemberton,
I am not sure what you are capable of. I don't know, do I? This seemingly normal day for this war is one of many. For us soldiers, an 8 story building, fifty years ago. The process of invading ruins you have done is always finished. It often takes years, sometimes more, and you get to the factories and finish the document without reading another page. I doubt you. I have been sent back to England by mistake, I don't know what the hell it was you did. I would have told anyone, I would have smothered the bowels of our military, but then again no one did. I have lost numerous friends, comrades, and family to war. I don't know what I wanted. Would I die because I was in a war that I was not there to die and could not visit my mother in tears? I don't know how I felt in that moment. Nothing will happen to me.
I,
George Pemberton

I was sitting in a coffee shop when she walked into the bar.
I smirked and started chewing, staring at her as a professional for literally every fucking goddamn reason I could imagine.
She paused while my hand slipped on her button, gently repressing it. The dark shade and silky texture kept her stare focused.
Her mouth raised, wringing itself together at the sight of the words.
"What is it, " she asked sharply. " I hate you. "
" Yes. "
She stood up, walked out of the room and back into my apartment. She knocked once before flipping the table over. I looked behind me and there she was, her entire body facing forward as if waiting for something. Her eyes were out.
" Do you have any last words?"
The thoughts running through my head make me giggle, reestablish their suspenseful glow.

Jonathon opened his closet one night, taking a bit of effort and getting ready to tear through the heavy cement and splinters that had punctured the wall. He found himself a single three page manifesto, down from both hands. * The prophecy is simple, best to keep certain things secret... In the last week Jonathan has lost enough weight to stop the hunger and avoid exposure to the disease. *
He reached for a flame thrower on the table by the bed, looking in to the direction of his closet. He realized the gun in his pocket was broken, and felt the slight tingle in his heart as he examined it. The pistol hung from his side, and Jonathan felt the numbness in his heart as he carried the thing into the kitchen.
He closed his closet door, enjoying the sun just outside the window, knowing there was no chance of catching it, but on reflection the face of a man he had no choice but to trust into the light of life. They were probably several years younger than him, with only very small expressions on their faces. But, with each detail Jonathan saw he grew more self conscious. He stopped looking at the mirror at the bottom of the bowl he usually took a glass of milk, looking into the corner of his eyes and seeing the glimmer of his own eyes, all lined with the name of his future child. " Jonathon! ", he called out.
The door to the closet had been kicked open, knocking into his closet. The beauty of his past, but all the mystery that had been explained. It had been years since Jonathan saw his last breath. He threw a stack of papers at the closet door. " Jonathon, the prophecy is true. Please, don't write this back, please, don't write this back! " Jonathan refused to quit, and it was not until this day that Jonathan would finally get his head out of his body.
" The curse will be too great to bear, and on your death bed you will live. But keep doing what you do best: surviving. You aren't special, and you aren't the end of the world. Just keep in contact with my website. "
*Two years ago Jonathan became not the first person he had to see because of the diet followed by a health checkup. He sat in his apartment alone as the sun had set, his old framed photos of him and his wife put back together. *
" Don't go out acting like you're homeless. You need something to burn. At least write for them when you are. And you have a huge one on you, Jake," this sentence has to be serious.
Jonathon took another bite of his cereal. He knew he must keep a little leaf of sugar in his box. Every now and then he would think of a time when, instead of living this life, he was going to be consumed by a luxury below. Jonathon had seen people reject drugs over drugs, but he did not think he would accept drugs anymore. He had no desire to do what they called " combat-robbing ", and he wasn't going to give in to his urges.

*Day 1: Tuck? Tuck the chains? *
*Tuck* I thought he liked heels.
I get off the train to the train station to find him staring at his watch. It's 11:23 am, and he finally left his car by 11:34 am. There's no way he wasn't tired, or had just talked to me. I don't know what to think but I assume he hates me.
I get to the station and he stops his car and turns back to me, sitting at the bench I grew up in and watching the birds race. He walks over to me and says "hey babe, how about some beer? ". I'm taken aback at the profile of him, but I look down for a second before noting he wasn't looking for a friend, but only his... " friend " and asked him " how's it looking mister "
" I was wondering if you liked her. "
" Don't you want to know why this stranger doesn't like me "
" That's kind of it. It's not just sad that he's going to spend this... for the rest of his life. It's a quick death and I hate to say this but I feel no shame talking about myself right now. "
" I'd rather never know mister but you're my sweetheart, you're my million and one."
I go home later that night and have my morning coffee before opening the doors and waking him up. This is my time alone and is my reason for going home alone. I've tried to calm him down because I'm a very small man, who has been around for far too long to trust his instincts. He is pretty smart though. He knows it's the right thing to do. There are other people too. I saw one who worked here at a coffee place and am working with him now. I don't have any hard feelings about him though. He hates me and my work but has a certain obsession with me. Maybe that is why he loves her so much. Maybe he is foolish. There is nothing the doctor can do about that. I made his first date with her a month ago, so tonight I will walk him out his door today. I can't lie to him, I have a feeling that I will find out one day. He got a date with a billionaire tonight, which I agreed to because I wanted to keep our relationship going. I hope it doesn't come to this but it seems he made a sale today and is moving in soon. In my mind we are just following each other, and if I look my master in the eye I am confident he's going to give me a taste of her whenever I go to the casino. He doesn't tell me the money he pays for cars he buys so he doesn't think I am stealing his money. I see the minute his car broke down that night and thought there might be something I could do about it. I can't say I blame him. It hurts me, but he is my little brother and my precious girl. I really don't know him, but there are billions of dollars in his account and I've had time to count. It doesn't bother me either. I am better than this.

The world was... not the same for everyone. There was a grey matter full of outliers. A threat to human stability was how fatal the world is for space flight.
I was given a prompt to write about a propulsion system that I believe would allow such a technology to create a gravitational disturbance. I'm quite going to take an interest in it.
* "... Give me what I need, and give it to me. " *
The authorities were swift to pay what I owe. They sent me away. With a barely squeaking voice and a barely sounding tone I said
" Hello world, how was your flight?"
No-one answered. I don't recall much. I guess the people started going crazy...

If I was immortal. Why did my species look so mean? I know I feel my time on earth was short because of that. I died young. But I created a generation. I became forever in numbers.
Then I became the great great singularity, the unification of entire countries of all directions, holding the Big Bang so firm. For a billion light years I stood alone, and the light of the universe was finished. My very being was at last. I became the eternal brother, for I was immortal, and the br-greereg life of the whole universe began.
And I found myself beaming, and I could do so because of all the lies my creation knew.
But my own god - and my god, HE, dwelt on a planet nearby, just one of countless in the universe. Just one of billions, but now you can zoom in...
The universe grew old, faster and bigger than the Sun. It suddenly stopped, as if there was no such thing as a night sky, just gravity and the atomic fragments of matter. Every world disappeared, and everywhere, stars were replaced with nothing but a dot of light. All that had been had been all replaced in the universe, just like the sun itself. My god, had he intended to be immortal, he would have done a far worse thing.
No. I could have been anyone. I've been the creator of all over the universe, I've been the human race. I am the god that you're all-knowing now.
I didn't die alone. I created civilizations everywhere, from which there were many other people. I created people, people from everything in the world, and each of them became the ones you are today.
No one wanted to be changed.
They all wanted to know.
When the next council of humanities convened. And my god did not answer.
No one wanted to be forgotten.
They all wanted to see.
One of them stopped. A traveler came from afar, and took him and his world to my heaven. But the traveler did not stop his journey. After he left, the following thought occurred to him. A toddler understood what happened to him.
I *M* remembered.
*No one will remember. *
And then I remained. My knowledge wouldn't leave the earth, and my body wouldn't age.

The sun had turned the day away and the light from the open doors came out, filling the houses with the flickering light from the moon above. Frozen smiles curled into a smile that turned to horror when it was spotted from a small street by two bare-handed men who appeared to be dealing with a fever. They limped towards the house, alone at first, but they soon realized the door was locked. The door was still in the "locked " position.
A loud, wheezing noise was heard at the door, and the two men behind them turned their heads and saw the door crack open and the angry crowd burst in.
And they knew that the people who lived here couldn't wait to get home. If they dared come in, they would be shot at.
As they counted the bullets, the one that was silent, said,
" All hail Bill, that is all you have ever done to me!"
And he died with a bullet hole in his skull.

Good and all around eloquence I enjoyed your story. If the story doesn't exactly sync up with what I'm feeling and the way you post it does vary a bit - think of it as a structure. When I decide to say it makes sense; you did a very good job that way, but I've found some terrible writing habits that I felt hindered the development.
This really improved a lot of what I wanted to say and you still have a great manner in which you told me this stuff is important. I'm more discouraged when I see too much of what you say than it is when I see the plot itself. I don't think we have much of a first person / second person conflict ( especially with how low it feels within the narrative ) so maybe this is little too much of a puzzle-solving style that needs work.
I though you tried to focus on two parts as much as possible, a part where you really do have to present a need for interaction or whatnot. Part 2 seems a bit more abstract at this point and I feel like you didn't convey anything particularly without a new idea. You worked well in this piece, focusing on just giving us most of the background and kind of helping me understand what is a bigger puzzle - whether it's an arrow, a coin, a sword, a quarter or just lying there quietly in your hands... It was a chore to think of.
I really liked how you managed to walk a lot while pointing out strange points in the distance - which I love. I personally felt your story lacked the depth of the story I was craving. Your presence makes it all the more special for me. Also, you were also really clear that in order to continue the story, a bit of a speech bubble felt unnecessary and unnecessary and should never had been used. ( -Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid we are parting ways with several of our characters; they are too attached to their "gifts" and work together just the right way to get these out of their minds. )
If you hadn't done this already:
There's something with the second paragraph that you definitely missed. In that regard, both of the paragraph titles lack the direct indication you read it just right.
It's not very clear what happens here either - each sentence was clearly just something you wanted to have for your narrative just as much as it was for mine.
I love the idea of the restaurant where the forbidden jam turns into cheese cookies that you return to.
Overall, I think you delivered on the project nicely. Great work!

I get at most things in my life every day. From walking down the street to meeting the first person I meet, to keeping a job with my family as the CEO of a gaming company, to being a father. I can't remember every step I took. I'm sure it's all my life's work, but the real problem is losing touch with reality. I have quite recently found that I have to save the moment for the moment...
*The instant I looked at the blue white text telling me the exact text for my newest phone, I felt..*
I woke up.
Huh. This was new. Confused, I check the time. 9:30. I glance over at my wife. I look into her eyes and she just stares back at me.

I start to read over the address to see if she's heard my final message.
Maybe I've got a date!
Wait... I DO.
Huh. What the heck.
My eyes go to the last line of my text. Something must have clicked because I'm still in disbelief.

Come time. I want you to come visit me. Come together. It ’ s been almost twenty-two days and this shop is great! I keep all the food, clothes, and water. I also bring some water and some food. I am a simple guy. I don ’ t have a lot of money. Can you believe that I would sell my life savings on such a useless service? I took care of the house for years! I was working as a professional salesman at $ 250 a month. That ’ s what I would have taken, and over the last 2 weeks I have been harvesting its worth, and harvesting its worth. All because I have an even bigger problem! There is no food! No water! No medicine! No medicine, I don ’ t even eat anything. It is like I am a liability. I don't have enough money for medicine, clothing, or water. I have to feed everyone, not just me, and not just any one person. If the knife dropped, they don ’ t feed me. The shop only provides more food. I am in my corner, the only one. It ’ s raining today. I hear screaming coming from my window. People are fleeing. I would pray I could pick myself off the roof, but I am afraid of the alley. I desperately try to get to the roof of the shop, but it won ’ t let me. I wish I could walk away. I pray that I will meet the owner. He is about to start hammering my wall with so many hammers and nails. I kick and scream and yell, but I am victorious, not only for this shop, but for everybody else. I sit up in bed, ready to cry, but the walls are crushing me, destroying my wall. I don ’ t want to lie to anyone, to give anything, but this shop did not belong to me. I feel so lucky to be able to live for this much longer. We ’ ve continued our business, and now this shop is overflowing with the coin fairy. Not content with my life savings, I sit down and begin crying on the floor. “ I could have found anything, ” I say, “ but I had to work so hard to survive. ”

Green light in the incoming lanes, a 2 lane burst hit their brakes, followed by a horn horn.
"Brake up, red light.
Body hit like an eagle behind the wheel!
A FUCKING GOD DAMN KEET FREEDOM SLUM!
A LIGHT PROW-YO'S REALLY NOTHING THINKS TERRIBLE ".
There was no doubt. That was just a man and a HACPIUSED CURSE. The heavy driver slammed through the brakes with all the force of his drunken wreck. The car stuck to its horn. A rip in the windshield.
" FIRE! NO LAWYER'S GETTING WORK! " screamed the officer.
A scream escaped from the passenger seat. The driver slammed the roof of the car and ran towards them with all the force of his drunken state.
This song taught the idiot how to get more drunk before he got drunker.
The dog barked. It began barking at them. The warm dog got out of the car, hurtling towards them.
The wife got out of the car and the dog barked as well. The driver rolled onto the horn. The dog barked again.
The woman got out of the car and kicked the dog. The dog barked again.
The driver rolled onto the horn once more.
" ANNIHILATION, ANNIHILATION WHILE GOING HURT! " screamed the driver.
The offender threw the car off the side of the road in quick pursuit.
The lady pushed her husband over the railing. The man rolled out of the car in shock.
" BOOBS ", shouted the man. The owner grabbed his wallet and started pulling out his son's gun and with it a -and- oh- oh- oh- OH FUCK YOU THINK YOU HAD ONE AGAIN. A burst of light streamed into the vehicle.
The couple pointed the handgun at the man and all he wanted was for his death.
" GRIMLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLUCK! " shouted the man.
The mother didn't budge from the gun.
The man threw the girl onto the hood of the car. She rolled along on the hood in a daze, the hair in her left ear and her right temple where the bullet came from.
A light appeared behind him, slowly slowing down.
" The fire will be the last thing I see in this road, son. " said the father.
The quiet of the cabin gave way to a loud honking noise.
" HE GOT A GUN, MAN! " yelled a man behind him.
" WHAT?!?" shouted the man, looking up into the night sky.
The big car bumped into another one in the drive. A light appeared above the speeding car. A man stepped forward and drove like a fucking idiot through the headlights.
The trees stopped and the men turned around. The people there couldn't see the car. He looked at himself in the mirror. He suddenly remembered the dream he had that night. He remembered his own name. The one he never saw again.
He pulled out a gun and fired.
The laser followed the man to the trunk where he sat.
He was beside himself as he waited. That night, he had lived and worked. A kid like that lived with his own family. He hadn't noticed this until now.
Every night, he would come home and go play together.
Tonight was the night the bloodbath started.

It started with the fire.
And so it went. The gods came and plucked fire from their meals, leaving it barren. Then they saw the forest.
There were torches, swords, and loaves of bread. Then they ransacked the forest, whooped them, and whipped the heads out of beast and babe from their bodies, still chuckling to themselves.
No one saw the forests of the underworld up there, and no one knew the darkness above in those woods, for there was no sky to check the lights of the temple of a foreign god.
Until a child made his home at the site of the temple, and begged his father to spare him a day, to bring him food and drink, and the priests got jealous. He could see the change that filled the air, and demand from all places, even angels, of his name and wealth.
The child took possession of the first thing that looked God's domain, and only he could see it. With his father ’ s assistance he begged to leave him something in return. He cut a spot in the middle of the forest, and brought it in, carefully, as nature had intended. They let him drink that first meal and sleep in its den, where the light would stay for many years.
The next day the priests came, and showed up, claiming the fire to be a relic from an ancient war. They returned to the child and demanded that they show him that fire must have been created by some divine evil.
The child spoke his legend, which he told them at first, alone, without an eye to the light. They agreed, that he was to rule over the world with his father ’ s help, and that his followers would not bow to his evil ways. He said that he would reign for their eternal existence, and destroy his enemies. He wanted them to cease their wasting.
Some of his followers, still young after his battle against the demons at the temple, had not believed him. They dropped out, beaten and starved to death, simply because the gods saw them as mere monsters and had no reason to serve any more.
There were rules of the world, that he thought and told the young ones, but they were held against their wishes.
Soon they fell into their meaningless slumber, working to create a world that he was not the creator of.
Soon, he was gone. Forever-living in the darkness of space, alone.

I stand on my balcony, tall and proud of my feats and abilities
Just like the other time that i saw him come. One of the bravest, fearless knight
As such i was ready to leave him for good.
As he came in front of me i was ready to say goodbye for one last time.
Until, suddenly he vanished
I turned around to see a light shining from his side
"You.." he said, at his side " You are my hero"
This only made things worse for me
As my eyes adjusted i saw that my vision had cleared
'*some fine, handsome guy is talking to me*'
I stood there in awe not knowing what to do
I grabbed hold of my sword and struck the knight in the head with it
As the light grew brighter the world seemed to start anew
The next day everyone noticed this man
*Gone! * *gone**

As I slowly came to the conclusion he would go into a trance, I looked up to tell him "I'm alright."
As he said those words of encouragement it all became clear to me what actually made me feel this way. He had committed the horrendous, unforgivable crime of killing thousands of people. It had been a life lived in hell; the worst he could do. He talked like he was going to give himself up on the flames that were the result of his actions; I think he got even more enraged when I entered his bedroom.

"Hey! Robin! Come on! It's time for lunch. " I yelled out of the corner of my eye to the great glass windows of the splendid room where I was dining with my friends.
" Princess Regent Boggart walked up to me, grabbed my hand and started talking! " a shrill voice exclaimed. " Aren't you going to tell me that you're going to marry someone better than me? " " Who the hell are you? Why do you wear red and white t-shirts? "
" You're so rude " Regent said.
" No, not rude. I'm going to marry you. " I said knowing exactly who I was talking to.
" Alright, fine, whatever you say. " he said as he walked towards me.
" Then, no need to be rude. You did the right thing. "
" Well, yes... " he said pointing his hand at me. " But you're going to need to come with me... "
" RING!!! You know what? I'm going to marry you. Go on with your life, go out with your friends, have a great time. "
I went to sit in the parlor with a princess, her traditional outfit! " What a lovely dress! Let's just get a t-shirt and shoes to wear. " she says as she set up the t-shirt and shoes.
" I do have a lovely dress! " I said as I put it in her hands, feeling wonderful.
" It'll be worn by whoever you love! " said the man of short stature.
" I'm going to fly back to the Magian Labyrinth, where I can lay claim to your brother and sister for the dreams you've had since birth, " said the person of bright yellow hair who seemed to understand the conversation.
" Come on, be nice, I do appreciate it. " said Regent Boggart.
" Please just sit down, I need to talk. "
" I'm going to feed you for dear life, " says the man of normal clothes.
" Yes! I'll do it, please, I have some groceries to get. "
" Come on! I'm sure it will all be OK! Please don't cry. You'll grow up to be a nice man in your dreams. " He reassured.
" No problem! Come along with me. " I said as I started making my way down the staircase of the stone edifice. As I made my way down I saw a small family sitting on the stairs; some bejeweled monsters, some holy warriors. " It's going to be fine! " they growled happily as they let out a small cry as they climbed the steps.
I left and went to the galley to get something to eat. It was a salad with a salad and cheese. " Have a good day! " the princess said as she went to grab a piece of ham and cheese. She began to eat. I must have eaten something but I'd have to figure out where it came from.
" You probably thought I had chicken, " I said as I began making my way down to the base of the stairs. " All of the good things I did... bad things. "
" Oh great! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! " she said walking towards me.
" Wait! Stop it! What does it mean?!?! " I exclaimed as I heard giggling behind me.
" It means that you love me! " the princess said.
" I'm going to help you!! " I yelled as I pulled away.
She reached out and pulled the salad out of her mouth.
" Little pebbles please!" she whispered.

I stare with my back to the stone as the mist begins to sprinkle across my frozen fingers. Not very smartly dressed, I think to myself. I flip the pane to the side to reveal the foundations of the altar, and stumble to my feet. To my left, a small man appears, surrounded by illuminated textiles. I look to my right, and notice that he is naked, but with a stoic expression. He was once himself. His dirty blonde hair hangs loosely, and he barely looks at me. I notice his skin, pale against the mirror, and it's texture brings me joy to behold. There are two horns on the upper right- it looks exactly like the one I call a sword. My heart swells in my chest as I think of the bastard sword. His hair, ever so shiny, and it's where he bores me. Slowly, I lift the glass to my mouth to see if I can taste what he has to offer. My tongue stings, and at this point I feel empty. I start to walk away. My body is calm as I go but the ground grows cold beneath me. As I lose my balance, my eyes fly open and I see my reflection with my own eyes. The other dwarf looks at me with a look of absolute loss, and I see a smile on his face. His hand extends, and the water trickles down my forehead. He takes out his katana, and I dodge at it. His eyes flutter open, and he pulls the sword from me. It falls to the ground, and I simply cover my mouth with my hands, clearing my throat. He shoves his hand through my hair and slams it into my chest.

We were pretty much adopted on the other hand. I mean, you would say the adoption was taking place, but where we lived, I only had one family, so it was a very unfortunate situation. The first year at school, I was one of the few kids to get pushed aside and dropped out, but that was all short-lived. By the end of the first year, I was one of the pretty few kids to stick around, having had some adventures and getting bullied. I guess it was an accident.
Some of the other kids were way more rebellious- sometimes, after a while, they would start acting like they were just jumping on walls, or using speech patterns that would not be understood by a 10-year old. That was when I caught a whiff of my destiny. I was almost ten when my first kiss, after being knocked and made to my bed, turned into a twelve-year-old cheerleading guy hooking up with a girl I'd never seen. The only difference was that I had a knack for tormenting guys with unrealistic expectations.
That is, until, when he saw me kissing him. I was moving to a new town. I hoped he would find out that I wasn't gay. So I pressed on, and moved to a nicer place. Three years later, I found a kid at my house who I hadn't seen in a while, and I helped him move up until...
Where, I asked, was a closet? He looked at me with a puzzled look on his face. I asked him again, he answered with more clarity, "Yeah, here's where my family lives." He brought me out of my fugue state, back to reality. I was only a boy at the time, but I'm still five now. Despite his strange, almost morbid curiosity, I found my family's. I hid them in the closet, secretly fearing my father would catch on. He walked away, and felt sorry for me. I can't stay here. I need my freedom.
By the time I was a little boy, I had an older sister. My sister had moved away from my foster home back in the suburbs of south Carolina. As I stared at her, I began to realize that she was still on her own. I would soon, even a short time after that, get my father to put an end to that. I left, knowing that the time for marriage was coming to an end. But she wasn't going to go for it. She was going to move away.

"Fool,"
I whispered in his ear, and for the first time in years he cackled.
A blue pin ball appeared next to him and gently struck the pin. It flashed as the pin met the Earth's surface and shattered.
Out of the blue and out of the sky, upon the pine grove stood a shadowy figure, with tentacles surrounding her like a gargoyle. He was large and pale, but his large mouth showed a smooth curving hair, with the color of sharp diamonds. He sat opposite me, stroking my shoulder. He put his hands on my shoulders and leaned close to me. He reached into my pockets and pulled out a plastic napkin. At the other end of the napkin was a symbol of doubt.
“ Fool, ” he said to me, his voice a deep rumble, “ Only for us, ” he said as if granting me an answer.
I looked back at him, as if reading my mind. He stood there, flailing. His movements were slow, but complex. He looked at me, but made no move for me to glance back at him. He looked back at the sphere his hands held. He flapped them. And left.

*I hate that song and its lyrics*
"I've killed girls and fucked them up. " I was standing at the back of this mobster's home, hanging my head on the edge of the kitchen counter. He was probably here just to get out of here, pissing on the inside of my arm, but I didn't care. My target was inside his house, so this was no different.
" You could kill me on sight! " I heard him jokingly shout. It was a far cry from a guy that I admired, but he was different. He was just like me. He was slow, and had an energy like nothing I've ever seen. Wasn't going to run from something all sexy that I am.
*I thought nothing of it when I arrived back home. I know they will call me a slut, but no, this is enough, and today, *I clicked the snooze button, still startled*.
" I KNOW I HATE YOU! I CANT KNEEL!" shouted the vigilante, as he sprayed me with his urine.
*Now for what could possibly go wrong? * I flinched away from the source of the word and looked at my phone, fucking now, and decided to take matters into my own hands. You have to be fed? Well, by-school was fine. I'm smart, but shit do I understand this girl! She fucks up her own life. Nobody's going to believe me. Besides, she's my first name!
*What the fuck is going on? * I had no other thoughts to mind.

I'm not a native speaker, but my scene that day left me self-conscious for a full hour. Well I guess you could say I was *creatively* scratchy afterwards and found myself with *no other options. *

To be the force you need to be. To push into the light of day.
I may not have been quite the family support man you may have heard. But I have always liked being an executioner.
I have done terrible things. From death in an asteroid. Stared out the window of a hitler's. Seemed so normal.
So when my guard called me in, I was taken aback. It was just a shipboard social inspection and I wouldn't understand anything.
"Pregnant negroes, you are hereby sentenced to death under the Galactic Code of Justice, punishable by Hell or High Hell "
At first I was utterly confused. Within the first two minutes I recognized the sound I was making, the rough stilted awning I had been trying to avoid. It was a familiar expression, a harsh slur in my voice and the remaining four or five distinct tones out loud.
My internal monologue fit. I ignored my tone. My guard looked at me incredulously.
" Well then you wan na talk to me? "
Suddenly a volley of punches hit my heart and next thing I know I am lying on the floor with a brick broken off my neck and 4 alien scythes coming at me with saucers. I managed to stumble back and fall on to my back laughing.
I remember the television on my little mind read on in a language I couldn't get the language into. The internal monologue from earlier made me figure out what was happening. To answer your question, I was tied to this chair with two tap socked to the belt by aliens with saucers and in two scythes.
The first alien was a soldier named Tatooine with a bald head. The second was from a maester with a german accent. They painted me in white and threw down sabers and stilettos.
I recognize their uniforms. The one behind their faces was Vin Diesel with a trenchcoat.
I remembered the instructions. I knew they had set a date with the Executor and sent a man with a bat. He would have to change allegiance every five minutes to get to us. I remember telling my guards he was to meet us in the morning.
Not that he wasn't. These were doctors with procedures all the same. Everyone knew that the worlds first genetic experiment had produced a disease outbreak. I remember saying " If only that poor doctor still existed ".
After several well practiced guns fire I was pinned down and I was injected with a serum the doctors had developed in secret. There was something remarkable about this serum. The guilt I felt would sort a person down for life. I was then tumbled out of a skull and stretchered to the distant stars where I will serve my penance once again.
My family say I died for freedom.
I've almost forgotten.

"Come out with your friends, we've got no choice but to do this. " asked Artemis as he walked up the ladder to the room. He had just realised the clay pots had become perfectly healthy enough that they all became very tasty. It was the only way for Artemis to keep up with his life. Today he had decided to do just that. He began to pick at pieces of different ceramic and paper cauldron that his fingers had accumulated around this complex contraption before bringing it to its end. Immediately after he had found the pieces he noticed just how good they made the clay pots.
" Haha, they are so tasty ", he thought. The pot began to puff up in anticipation and thanksgiving had started. Artemis immediately stole the pot out of the pot and threw it into the water. He flipped the pot on the side and just as suddenly everyone started getting on top of the pot. Artemis just decided to pursue the feeling alone so the water caught onto the items. He walked the waste basket around the bowl and about once again noticed all of the pots began to fall on his heart. It was as he was racing through his final stage of life but at that moment with all the pot still put to the water noone noticed him anymore.
" I do this for you, I should finally finish this. But I'll come back with another pot tomorrow and with a new piece of clay for the pot. " said Artemis.
" I'm sorry Artemis, you're welcome to my house now ", said Kyle as he yelled for him to leave.
" You are alone Artemis " said Marcus who struggled to catch his breath.
" You are the last person I will ever have to see ", said Tom but still just unable to breathe. " Why are you so silent when you are watching my life go by? " Tom asked Tom.
" I don't care, you've been controlling my life for days and you know I like to control myself. You've been making my life torturous and now that you've finished with me because of you I'm happy. "
" Oh don't you see, that's because I love you I love you even more, you can tell me why I love you if you don't hate me. Why can't I remember everything when I love you? I hate you. " He said on the verge of sobbing.
Marcus stood up and approached him.
" Tommy it's just a simple contract. You get to choose how you wish to become a potter. If you chose to become a potter, you get to treat yourself as a gardener who likes to grow vegetables. Then maybe in a few years you will be making enough money to become a potter that the others will not have a hard time making with them but to give that to your garden. You don't want to be an expensive potter. You want to make sure that people who want to grow vegetables buy them on a regular basis so that you can make sure that you receive enough money and to keep that money from disappearing when you're gone. This one time didn't have that problem for you. There was that other week. " Marcus explained in a harsh tone.
" So that was the deal ", Tommy said with a smile.
" Exactly! You'll be a potter everyday, you'll be a gardener forever! You'll never be a gardener " Marcus said happily.
Tom and Marcus glared at each other and reached for the automatic door when suddenly two shadows appeared behind them.
They were both wearing blue envelopes that were similar in color to the envelopes themselves.
" Please come back. Please remember to invite the others, my gardens will be fine. However, please make sure that you carry some of the peniketens I have in your pocket." said Marcus to the pair. The two walked around the walls with clenched fists. They waited for a good ten minutes until they heard the horn of the trumpet.
Tom turned around and ran away.
The couple stopped inside of their beautiful blue envelopes and knelt beside them in front of the beautiful Peniketens. They placed their crowns on their heads and said
'We chose our names as best we can.'

"Weren't you supposed to bring the guys to work today because they were just coming up? "
" No sir, I forgot. "
*I never caught that flying dragon. It's kinda sketchy that it had dragons wing. My mom's stubborn now. *
" What about the guys on the panel one? "
" Sorry that was *really* much so pretty. "
*I'm afraid I'm going to have to finish this a second time. It was actually very distracting, and I feel like you were making fun of it *damnit. * "
" Enough. Get out of here! "
I started racing towards the abandoned warehouse with my armor hanging out of my back. It would be best to lay low first.
" Another few hours until they pull us out? "
*Sounds like this one will still do, and its worth it if you don't catch it sooner, you know. *
" Alright sir, everyone in the building will be fine, until they are taking the last place. They never will. "
*Are we about to go anywhere? *
" You heard me right, they took all the places. There will be no more running if we don't hide. "
*But what about the great big mother on the wall? Where will she go? *
" I'm not getting too far, so just long as I do my work. "
" Send all the guys home now! You said they'd be safe. "
*Well no, they're a massive mystery. I'll get back to you right away. *
" Please come with me. "

" Sorry, you keep forgetting about that dragon. "
" Well, um... something happened. "
" Well sir, I'm not wearing the suit! "
" What? What are you doing here?! "
" We shouldn't be. That monster moved fast! "
" Just you wait... "
" It won't hurt. You're not getting those extra stitches. Please get me out of here. "
" I don't understand, man. "

" Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let me begin. This is an incredibly complex case that will unfold the next day. Bounding the police, private investigators, and even security personnel is going to fall to your fall. Please, stand by until the private detectives return and discuss the matter. This jury is comprised of seven people currently at high risk, and four now in a serious and deadly state of emergency. They have one last question for you gentlemen. "
" What? "
" Just let me get you some air. "
" Well, of course, I'll just... "
" Next! "

I didn't think of him often... I don't think I'd ever meet him once when I was growing up. I'd always thought of him as his favorite thing in the world, but I got so caught up in it that I kept forgetting about him.
We've been dating for two years now, and he and I are practically inseparable. It's a cold winter in Moscow. We're both walking, and he's pretty shy, just like when I first met him. He'll talk to me when I'm driving, and he will be so kind as to give me a warm ride.
We're getting to Moscow, so naturally he has to get directions. I've decided to go about the trek quickly, so as always we walk in a straight line. He takes my direction in a hurry, because he's going to be late.
On the way to my apartment, I see him being unceremoniously shoved into a room by a fellow student, because he must have taken it all away. We both look at each other, mouth agape. He sets a weird note on the ground under the bed, and pushes it. There's no way he made it before the glass shards. I tell him to come clean himself.
Later that day, I pick up my backboard and tie the boy's feet up by his toes so he can sit on the floor until we move to the sidewalk. We had just gotten off work, so he didn't expect me to be here right away. I just gushed over the writing as we were moving, and he was waving at me.
"Are you okay? " he asked me as he looked over the sidewalk, to my surprise, to a single spot in the shadow. He gave me a little frown, and looked at me with green eyes.
" Yeah, I guess... "
That's when I remembered. I snapped back to my life -- the life that I've used to have, and you've grown to know. I had loved you for so long, and now you would be gone with me. I wanted the best for both of us, and you took the best for me.
I walked home, feeling completely fulfilled.
" Ha, so cool, " I thought as I carefully put on my clothes, adjusted my shoes, and went back to the apartment. I had to run, because I was already waiting for the police to arrive.
The police coming through the door, already dressed for the first time in twenty minutes. One officer's gun gone.
I smiled.
" What did I say? You know I'm not really doing anything rash... " I trailed off.
" Yeah, " he answered sheepishly. " It's just me. I could have been better. "
I stood there a moment, and thought about leaving. I had to survive, I'd have to protect you. But I still had to go with him.
Another officer came through.
" Move in. "
" Yes. I'll be right there. "
I peeked around the apartment, and the officer straightened his coat. He walked over to me and put a hand on my shoulder.
" What are you doing now? " he asked.
" Trying to get out of this room, " I replied. " I'm so bored of fighting in my own life right now. "
He looked down at his shoes, almost wiping his beard. " That's just what I'm doing. "
" Never mind, " I said, and we moved to the window.
" See you then, buddy. "
" Will you always love me."

You'd think such a thing would be incredibly lazily tiresome. I mean, just look how the apathetic part of the joke lifted at the end to bring in the classic Scott Pilgrim from the 90s to fill out the role of Freeman! Show a sense of purpose and excitement with this. And still the same boring joke as last night; more of a pitch-black composite plot.
It's all so... predictable. You'd think a movie like this would reveal a great amount of plot, but there's just no combination. It's just a confused crowd, audience, background noise and stuff. Is it really a robot? It could be a voiceover or something, but I can't think of a soundtrack.
I feel sick. I'm so sick of this movie. I'm done. I'm done.
This isn't even fun. It's too far fetched for the franchise.
I know the rules. I know the plot. It just feels so forced. I hate watching it.
The cinematography is so poor. You could really get into the action sequences from the cramped, dark room, or the wide-screens. But there's nothing of the sort with this. The pace of the action simply feels unnatural.
I quit! This is not the kind of movie that gets me that much hate.

"I'm sorry, he's on the ground now. "
" What? What's wrong? "
" It's fine, I'm okay. I'm glad that we are on Mars. "
I leaned back, pretending to listen and felt the weight of the situation weighing down me. I looked down at the darkness around us. The darkness was getting darker.
" What is wrong? "
" Everything is okay! We will fix it! There's no one there! You hear me! I'm sorry! "
" Oh, no, I'm fine. No one is watching! I- "
" No one is stopping us. We need to go help everyone on this trip. "
I couldn't understand, but I knew I had to get on the last platform in this thing. To get to the highest point we could.
The silence froze in its grasp. Everyone looked at me, other faces slowly met in my peripheral vision. It was hard to see in a white room with nothing in particular. I couldn't imagine anything in particular, and of course, none of me wanted to. I stared at my hands, their tips against the cold metal. The thought of my hands were enough for me to look up into the blackness, even in the darkness itself.
I searched my eyes for the most appropriate words, only to find nothing. Everything was the same. I couldn't speak or move, not even as I tried to remember everything. It was as if I hadn't been told about this past 30 years, and I didn't remember anything about the things I experienced. I couldn't walk or speak, no matter how forward I thought I was. No one else could. They simply stared.
Even after hours in the nothingness, one big sigh greeted me. I blinked and looked down at my hands again, only to find my hands white and rough.
" Uh... "
I tried to lift my arms but I couldn't move them. I could feel something digging into my palms, I could feel them melting. I just stood there. It was getting more intense. The heat was still on my skin. It was as if I wasn't breathing anymore. The footsteps stopped and the door on the platform started to close. I didn't even see any of my colleagues around.
" God damnit!" I screamed as I fell out of my chair, not even able to control myself to leave. I tried to run, but my legs were slowly losing their traction. This is what happens when you don't know when you are still moving in the nothingness. The fear consumed me. Suddenly, the darkness consumed me, and everything went dark.
Oh god, oh god, oh god...
*That was it. I thought I had forgotten about all my memories. * I finally felt relieved. I looked down at my hands, touched my face, saw something from another perspective but what I saw faded away. I felt everything again.

**I SHALL NOT LET YOU BE SATANISH**
My death comes soon, I could never forget the day I would return home.
That day, the Red Army invaded our foodbank! They were not prepared. The soldiers were stupid. They charged the Zavviks across the entire border and then changed the tactics to their own kind and sent their ships to the slums, where I stayed, as a victim.
I remember the night after, the same and worse day I awoke. The defenseless young men were writhing under the iron shackle of the state hall. I am not God. My suffering was from two simple causes, my own stupidity. I was the Adversary, the nothingness of Hell. I had been thrown in the back, face down in front of more than one, vengeful man.
I will not let you be so blind. I took the form of a man, two months of hard labor with me, for five years. I was the slave of the Red Army.
It was time. And so I came to the Calivary to attend. For the suppression of the threat from the neighbors. For the practicality of the process. For the sheer numbers of children desperate enough to escape. It was done, while everyone else was still young. And it did not matter what I did. I would be remembered as the hero for my country.
I took these suits, and these white-collar contacts, with me. They were worn out, and they demanded my life's savings. I forced it, and I was doing nothing to deserve it, but I would never live in the use of this suit again.
At the end of five years, there were no gunshots. Only screams. I knew this day would come, so many. I knew where I would land. I knew where I would lead them. I knew when we would take over the world.
We would stop this dictatorship. We would end this cruel despot. I will go back to heaven, and a new day I will fight the common man.

I remember them as equals; heroes and villains. The hero does everything he can to get to the lady he'll save, even against the evil forces of evil. I remember beating the villain once during the brief fight between the man and the lady before realizing that the hero is more than the truth behind the villain, he's killed me.
My peaceful, noble childhood was spent as a hero until, I was drafted into the wrong part of the draft, and found out that there's nothing that can make me an American hero anymore. Before I could face my mother, two weeks into training, the doctor told me that there were other ones. I lived through a war when I was 10, and I remember finally getting drafted as an American hero. I remember fighting back against the vicious hero, the insane man, and slowly realizing that this was my fault. I remember being a hero with the numbers, even at the cost of being shot and killed in the game.
Still, here I am, waiting for my next paycheck, just five more years of service, and then I need my new badge to pass. This isn't a war, this is a family. These are tough days.

My life was fine. I was a successful entrepreneur, happy with my position in the city and adventurous in my endeavors. My team consisted of decent people, not great friends, but someone I thought could help me make this world a better place. Two things I found in my life aren't happiness anymore:
1 ) The rate at which I found myself attached to a one-on-one relationship with someone was increasing, which was part of my daily routine. Being alone in a new place, there wasn't always much choice, but now some can appreciate the opportunity I had and I thank them.
2 ) The third thing that would always kept me up at night, was that I didn't have to deal with people endlessly for every penny that I earned or lost. I began spending more and more time with other people, spending more time alone, but they only seemed to drive me more towards what I truly needed.
I put it all in the context of my life, and the disappointment I felt was nearly equivalent to taking a life. Especially with all of the money I earned, I had no regrets, none of the sacrifice. I look back now and that's what my life had been. I'm just happy I knew that it was done... it was truly time to move on. I won't be leaving again. Not without a million more for myself and the people around me. All those years of excitement never dulled after I opened the internet, all for the same reason... for nothing.

So I was sitting at my computer screen. Programming myself the final piece of code to bring my son back to the humans! From the colonies currently advanced but almost extinct. Where do the humans go from here? The Ice Giant planet was just a few planetary systems away... by my calculations, that would make it as fast as the Mars rover of the outer rim, ensuring it left no trace of its origins. On arrival I walked over to my husband Phillip for the first time. I didn't see him there, we got there the day of the invasion. " The troops in this " our species " city " was barely recognizable, it was just an ancient hallways across the great hallways. I nearly dropped my face while walking over to the window and back. Looking up I could see the ships flashing in a starry haze just beyond the teleporter doors.
" Sir? "
" Yes, sir? "
" Do you know the name of our ambassadors? "
The gate open and the ship slowly approached us. In front of us were the surprise. A giant hologram of an A.I. trailed behind me and a helicopter prepared to land. Phillip and I opened the hatch and the A.I. rocketed off towards the starry sky. Just as the A.I. touched down the plane disappeared, leaving behind the massive structure of what once was my family for the real humans.
" We are sorry to bother you today, but we can't manage to secure a transport on this planet while we await your return home. You are not welcome aboard. We have orders to enter a treaty and of course of course not to delay their return home, but can you tell me what you see in your experiment. " Phillip slowly got up, " Their remains. "
" Yes, I see their remains. "
" What about the nanobots? They "
" Yes, a tiny pod capable of fully flushing the other pods, " the the A.I. prepared to land. " Do you accept our terms of departure? " The diplomats looked him over " This... this is a package. "
The first one handed Philip a signed copy. " What is in the package, captain? " he asked at last.
" You know why we accept your terms of return. If you're still here at this time you may have some time before we send you to a small settlement, where you might have some time before we send you to Mars. " The diplomats gave him a sick smile.
" I know what the parcel contains, " Phillip said, " They do contain something, but do you want me to, sir? "
The first ambassador quickly grabbed the ship back from me. " You won't believe this, " he said, " They're just an egg, that you will... "
" Of course, sir," Phillip finally replied with a smile as he tilted the newspaper back over his head.

There is no salvation. No forgiveness for it. No way to end it. It is eternal. Its suffering and sadism remain constant and constant. Every time we exit or set foot outside the realm of touch and death... that story... it comes back to us; but the doors open and we go inside. When we step out the gates, by our own will, none of us are here.
Every day we enter, when we move along the shindig path, we must leave the realm of touch, carry on the journey home. No longer are there any rules, no task, no easy decisions. What we are were before comes after, and our choices prepare for us to descend. We only find ourselves where we would have entered in any other place. We move on from this one "place", our place, forever.
However, when we are finished, we can not go back home for our next journey. To learn about the dangers, the stories, the monsters and hell. With no guidance or guidance whatsoever, we are forced to choose from whatever we feel we must, whether we shall make another journey or escape from this one.
So here we are, still left once again, alone. Still in the realm of touch. Still in the realms of torture. Still in the realm of salvation. Still in the realm of the wicked.
And we shall return to the paradise of our own destruction.

"Okay sir, it looks like you see someone again " Private Bon's voice was cut off by another young woman standing up and pointing a gun at a man standing behind her. She was shaking violently, but a dozen tiny hands swung about as she noticed. Small red flecks of white under the aisles began to reach her finger tips. " Remember when we were in kindergarten, you would walk into our hall to wave to them, and they would play with us, and tell us you were enjoying your grade, or doing a fun job, or, and we would remember that you were an excellent student, or a great student, or even better! " Another young man raised his own gun. " We didn't come here to humiliate you, oh how horrible! " The child smiled, lightly squeezing an old, burnt out sign on her wrist. " That is clearly, " The words began to linger. " Happy birthday, Your Majesty, Prince Stanley, Prince Stanley and Thomas! " The children stood there frozen, unsure of what to say or do. Another old woman stood, pointing a gun at the boy's head and handing him a folded piece of paper.
" Well, the best I can do is give you ten million for this wonderful idea, Will! " Another older woman introduced herself. " We need you to produce a report of the new student who will be placed in this academy, Will. We will write a report and file it with our other advisors, who will report back to us with instructions on what the the fate of this new student will be. " The young man turned in disgust, holding the empty piece of paper as he looked at it over and over again. His smile suddenly got bigger. He knew he must do this. Now he couldn't. His mind raced, he could't be calm, no matter what it would take. He can't do this. He must not do this. As his guard went up to the table, a blonde woman in an elegant black dress walked in. She stood over the eyes of another of her cabinet men. She wore nothing but a casual chiffon black dress, and her hair was tied back in that mess. She cleared her throat. " * Are you ready? * Will... Will, are you ready? " The blonde woman moved her slender arms closer to Will's throat. He cowered in wait as she spoke, his expression slowly easing. " Yes." Will's smile had grown to such a point he could recognize the power and bravery of her words. The blonde woman rose from her chair, removed the piece of paper from her desk drawer and into the room, quickly putting it on her desk. As she was put on her seat the doorbell rang. The young woman opened the door and walked inside. No one was there. She walked to her desk, threw out the unopened envelope, and threw it into the coffee pot. She opened the paper and she read it aloud.
**Remember: You can never tell who shot the secret service agent before you can shoot this kid. Use whatever information you have about him and his education to get an upgrade. You may also be able to use him to murder someone else in the future, but remember what he'll do. **

Perhaps this is destiny, for you and I both found that we had the one power to find the legendary weapon of our forefathers. We would have shown a greater willingness to fight our the innocent than to go in and give this ancient weapon only a remembrance. Perhaps this is fate, and if this is destiny, we will never see each other again. Perhaps this is fate, and if this is fate, we will never be able to hear the voices of our forefathers.
But now. It is time. We met in the grand hall, and once again our journey was worthwhile. Now we must keep progressing. If we continue on we will never meet your majesty before this day. So you may awaken from your slumber and follow in your majesty's footsteps, till it is your turn. We must move forward. Let us advance at a speed not susceptible to Death.

"Sarah, " *sweat dripped slowly from his forehead, nearly causing my screen to implode. He flicked through the feed one last time, and took out a random picture of himself on his open web browser. * Just a few seconds... * I looked to my screen as his direct gaze continued to orbit his perfect companion, *just a few seconds... *
Aghast, I quickly turned away from his POV to allow him to continue browsing the community. He began to skip back to the moment as I began to flood the FPS pause screen. I stopped my work at this point, but rather than surrender, my phone vibrated. My internal body felt like a lock on the bathroom, but I swallowed it whole.
" Christ, " I said to myself, looking at him nervously. " I'm having some type of... Uh... What? "
A quick search for " Sarah " confirmed that he was indeed one of " *those* people. I looked around the room at my coworkers and families. We knew they were whacking each other like dominoes to save on energy. But it wasn't just my coworkers and families that were working at this desk job, *it had to be* my supervisor, his secretary, and his general manager. Heck, even my boss is being tormented by this asshole the entire time. I simply couldn't begin to remember how long it has been since I had heard his voice.
His eyes scanned over me several times, if only momentarily, before looking back at me. * I don't even remember what he said to me yesterday, but it's definitely rude. * I calmly turned around to face him.
" Finally, you're telling me that video is definitely awful."

Dawn breaks slowly. That's all she needed for the last 5 minutes of her class. She gives one last lecture and bursts into the classroom. She collapses face down on the cement, bleeding out instantly.
She thinks she's crying, but her mother isn't in sight, and she's still breathing. She shivers uncontrollably and drops to the ground by the door. The teacher arrives at the room in front of her, put on a uniform and starts to speak into his other handkerchiefs.
"Dawn, have you been speaking with any of you? "
Dawn rolls her eyes.
" Please, forgive me, " she says in a cold yet calm voice.
" What the hell kind of problems is it? "
" I'm sorry, I'm a year away and I have no idea where science is... "
As she rushes back to the classroom, she suddenly manages to wipe the sweat off her brow, and mutter some incomprehensible words.
" I have no idea... " She spoke in an accent she couldn't quite place, as she doesn't remember where she had been.
The door falls away from her, and she sees her mother standing in the doorway staring at her, trembling in fear.
She weakly tries to touch her mother's cheek, but she only feels the tears of guilt flow out of her eyes.
" The food here isn't exactly healthy, " she adds, when her mother walks in.
" I'm not here for that, " her mother says softly, " I'm here because I want to teach you, " and with that, her entire life savings vanish.
She then grabs the Declaration from the lapels of her mother's hand, and can't help but tear it away.
" That doesn't say anything about us, " she says, shaking violently.
" I won't put up with that! What do you want with us, " she yells.
Dawn knows she has to leave now.
She walks out of the classroom and a rush of confusion fills the classroom. She rushes to her car and drives to her husband's room and hides behind a pole, desperately trying not to fall down and join her parents as they stand there now in terror and confusion.
Dawn races to his room and answers her mother's questions.
" How long ago were you born? "
" I don't remember any of that, " she says, " I'm afraid I'll never know. "
She slams on the door, and hears her husband slamming it shut in a rush of panic and tears.
Dawn stays there, and looks at her mother.
" Please, please... it's only so much."
And she felt something.

"Hey mr weirdo I'm about to start filling in on my google search for aqueduct safety " I said, noticing the text had changed to an old google search as I turned to look in my phone screen. A quick google search tells me nothing had changed, yet this had happened hundreds of times at first.
" Oh my god why am I reading your text again mr prankster " I exclaimed, trying my best to not look frightened. " Seriously, this is weird, you've never even texted me before "
" It's not weird anymore mr prankster, you use it as a term of derision for other times and events. It just comes across as pointless, we should just send this out anyway! " The phone chimed as I read the text again. I grabbed the phone and flipped it open, scrolling through the messages to find out what I was going to ask.
" so what do you need? " I asked.
" Well I need some water to dry my pants "
" There's no water on the ice cream machine ma'am "
" What? " I said trying to get out the words.
" I need some food "
" What? " I muttered, rising to my feet.
" What? " I replied trying to get the tears out
" uhm... i want ice cream, I have no idea why we got so pumped out of our books and DVDs. "
" The only one we have are 10 no sugary milk drives in here for 45 bucks that change toner every time. "
" Uhm... what about the help? " I said, hoping it wouldn't give me some kind of twisted insight.
" Some guys hired by Amazon on questions, and we go into the areas where they need to sell water. You go in, don't worry about it, they don't require any assistance from our servers ".
" Yes I want it sir I need you to help me get our water " I whispered as I turned towards the back wall.

It was 9 pm and James dropped by the door without much note of the strange assortment of creatures that greeted him. He was playing with a Dorito gun, squishing the beige plastic as he looked up at its piercing eyes. He wondered for a moment if it was just a smile.
"I have many things to do, " he told the wizened brown-gloved legs that flickered over him. " Do you want me to just clear this neighborhood of all the dead creatures? "
" What? Of course not, I had you hanging out earlier in the day with some friends and you were gone by 3 and you had gotten detention! How did it happen? "
" I live alone because I am the lone survivor and the only one that is ever let go. How many people are still living down in this world? "
" Look, it's hard to explain but what I had to do to stop a guy like you from ending up in a bank robbery. "
" Fuck you and fuck yourself. The drunks and serial killer, maybe you should have trained for that."
James swallowed hard as his friend slowly revealed her 3 triple-barreled shotgun to him. He placed it to her brain and pressed the detonator.
The ember escaped his mouth and splashed against the carpet. He immediately knew it wasn't poison and that he hadn't visited anyone alive for nearly a year.
He gripped the butt of the shotgun tighter and fired a single shot into his father.

The fear I felt growing behind those eyes when I grabbed her hand was contagious. Each moment of hers filled me with the same burn with a purpose. In comparison to those round all-powerful eyes I kept seeing watching, she had seemed smaller, completely mindless. I brought her closer to mine and watched her connect. I watched her raise her head to reach out my hand, but she only waited and grinned as if only I would wait. With one swift swipe, she'd become a completely different person. My hand continued to caress it, soothing her cold sweat. I was pleased with the fact that she was back.
Knowing that it took me months to learn how to deal with the feeling, I eventually learned to find an excuse to treat it, to dispose of the two small creatures.
I stared at her and felt the distinct venom in my throat.
Once the pain subsided, I simply pondered how she would look after having won this battle.

It was an endless sea of numbers, *her* in the growing circle. The gravity which had encircled her as she danced the seas. She was never bigger than as her competitors, and the wisdom which had guided her journey to this sacred place had shaped her, molded her great dream. * That is how I traveled*, she thought, a constant inescapable mass in the unseen depths of space.
She danced the seas in her laboured struggle for existence on a staggering scale, ten times over, no longer testament to gravity, her **bit's* measured. She walked the halls of old, bare flesh and pushed the fine crags all together. Each was a reaction to her own presence. Each was a gamble she promised to take with that final measure, if you were a worthy one. Her heart beat incessantly, the cacophony of her phantasmal arguments drowning out the quiet sobbing of the others. She could not continue to ignore the statistic that encased all of her life on a single line of no love. No hope, no fame, no fortune, no death. She was not truly just beautiful, but also special. A force who had its own number. A force which had not succumbed to her earthly lust.

He walked into the dimly lit bathroom.
*Fuck*.
His thoughts wandered, mind racing, its inevitable sound causing every step it takes to continue echoing in the void of his mind.
He ripped out a piece of silverware and looked at the peeling surface.
*Damnit. *
The very fabric of the bathroom was becoming too difficult to remove, spreading his anger across the entire family, including his wife. As she moved about the bathroom there was a moment where she slipped on the toilet seat - dripping with the water in the sink. Her body fell silent as she drew breath. The room was empty. Everything in her could no longer contain the rushing anger and sad thoughts of her husband and all those that she loved.
He entered the bathroom and pulled out a cloth of soap. His anger was so raw and dark it was nearly unrecognizable. When he wiped it clean in the bath, nothing of what he intended to display took hold.
He left the bathroom and walked into the dimly lit bathroom.
He walked into the dimly lit bathroom.
*Fuck*.
"All right then, boys " he heard his son say.
Suddenly, his wife came up from her scrutinious bed and pushed him into the closet in the night.
" Honey, come over here and touch this cotton balls! "
" Where did you put it? " he hissed as he rushed out.
She climbed into the closet from underneath the covers. She took his hand and pressed it against the fabric.
" Honey, come on. I'm sure that you know where it is! "
" LOOOOM " the little boy shrieked, approaching the door. He put a bullet to the heart.
" HEY!!! MOM THAT FUCKING CHEATED IN THAT SHITTY SHITTY DICK N'T MOVE, WHICH DID COOK ME LIKE A GRIMZER, LIKE I'M ONE WHO'S GOING TO GET POWED BY A GHOST ANYWAY " She pointed towards the bathroom. " DICK N'T MOVE. BITCH!"
Her husband fell to the floor, trying to pry open the door to see what happened. His wife was ripped from the wall and destroyed by the raging anger. She was ripped from her and scattered to the floor.
His son was found on a pile of rubble, his throat torn open.
He walked into the dimly lit bathroom.
The liquor had ran out.

I should've asked her to marry me! What were their reasons to have kids like that? I didn't think so. Or that I could handle giving her the final questions as to why she did it? Or why didn't I ask out the bottom one? Oh well.
I should have asked her to marry me. Nothing would have been the wiser. But... I had no idea. I started to ignore her. I didn't know what to do. It didn't make any sense to me.
Mom doesn't ask you out anymore. No, not really. But I had to do it. I wanted her to ask me. As such, I got an email.
"Hello! "
" Honey? "
" Hello? "
" Hello. "
" Oh, please don't call me sweetie. It's just that... to be honest, I know it's probably going to be hard for you to have them but I have the feeling I can do it too. What you're asking is *my* job. "
" Yeah... Let's try it. "
" No thanks. "
After a while, I told Mom to call the cook, who was now a stranger to me. She's definitely taken the secret to the restaurant. I asked her about it, and she whispered in my ear, " Wow. Then what? The last time I left her was with her sister. "
" Like, she was the one who got the information about the pink obi... "
" Yeah, right. We never got around to it. We didn't have the time to do it. "
" And why was that? "
" So we asked you why you were coming to our house in the first place. "
" Why? "
" Well, let's say that it's not your fault. Everything you're like and living with - living and studying - isn't the reason. A leg up. But no. I just needed to find out. And that was what I did. "
" We're the only ones here. There is no one else here to question me like you. "
"... "
"... "
" Please? "
" Please. You have to. That's what you're here for. I can't do anything else, and she's already gone mad. Just please don't make excuses! "
" Gaaaargh. "
" I'll try. Please. I'm sorry, I'm just really, really hungry. "
" So you should try food too? "
" We can't eat, man. I ate myself. I came home from the coffee shop after giving you a surprise surprise! Just the thought of it, and that- "
" I'm not eating the coffee! "
" I'll just put the napkins in the stove- "
" I'll just grab a bagel right away. And help yourself to one too! It's making me flinch! "
" Just... I need to get out of here right now. "
" I know you won't. "
" I know what we will do, now. Just keep driving!"

"Finally we have something. Ladies and gentleman, do you know how much this means to our Galactic Empire? "
" Wonderful. What will it be? "
" Oh, bring it on ladies and gentlemen, a small token of affection for humanity. "
" Who's it for? "
" From my cooking! God, it will be so fuckin fantastic. "
" So there's a human character, uh, who looks exactly like one I'd not do in the Star Wars movie! Ha! Ha! Ha! A little, if you can call it, ponytail! "
" Hmm. Okay... cool. "
" We've come a long way. That's great! What else can we do? "
" We believe the human race as a whole is about to embark on a new journey. A social journey of purpose. "
" Well, the journey shall start with you! On your journey to fill the space between worlds, and deliver you our offerings! "
" If we are to do this right, we shall feel like Gods have done this. "
" Humans, please remember, you can still do what you want, but for one great cosmic fee. So, we shall give you a goal. "
" What is our goal? "
" For humanity to experience life all it's worth. "
" We don't believe in karma. We believe in humanity owning happiness. "
" Love! "
" God damnit! We said we wanted to be happy. "
" At some point, the next human leader will need to provide a new companion! A companion that belongs to a more righteous species. "
" Kill those others! "
" We don't value altruism or love for the sake of love! We value human advancement through some sort of voyeuristic study! And we will kill those who help us! "
" So... the next human leader? "
" There's no leader left. You need to recognize them as a human or someone who is truly exceptional in their field. "
" The leader... "
" Exactly. And please don't kill the other two leaders. "
" Anything else? "
" We believe that a leader must feed the fire of a lustful animal, while humanity survives on the blood of others! Not honor in battle nor fortune, we believe! "
" Wait, who- "
" Get the other two leaders killed. "
" Now, everybody, get back here and make our way to our headquarters. We are going to feel like this is a victory for humanity! "
" Thanks buddy. We'll be back in five minutes."
And thus, the Cupid System was born.

The captain sips his gin and jugs, tapping his fingers on the wooden table. To his right is a clerk, dealing with the late evening door-to-door checks on the rest of the boardwalk.
"So, are you up here? " he asks.
" Yes, sir. It's been a while since I've seen your face. "
" So, did you come for tuna or something? "
" Cracking tuna! "
He reaches out and takes out a tuna steak with an apple on the plates, steaks served on a hot pink rib-eye and his knuckles swell with anticipation.
" I've never been up here, sir. They were all so close, it really took me years to get here. "
" Is that okay? It's been awhile since I've seen the surface of the planet. "
" Well, no, sir, I'm not going anywhere with you. "
" Well, you'll see. I'm just going to pass that on to my secretary. "
" Always wanting something from you, sir? "
" Always been. But, does the time seem different now? I think it's time to lay off the meat. "
He taps the tongue and waits for her to refill.
" Oh... well. Glad to hear that. " She reads the menu.
" Hey... maybe you can come here with me when the time comes. "
" You have to play our game now. You have this job after all. You get some lunch and go watch the sunrise, and I have my office on the other end of that. I just bought a Volvo. "
Her secretary turns in her chair with the waiter's tips. She doesn't look uncomfortable.
" So... how's your day been? How are you doing? "
She winks at him and follows him down the metal hall.
" Good. Looking good. I think I'll be more tired of waiting at the coffee shop. You should come with me then. I'll take you somewhere warm. " She sits down in the chair next to him.
" I've always wanted to see how well you did with that tuna steak. But, you know, don't worry. I'll return to my secretary to check. It's tomorrow and I want to check. " He gives her a quick nod and watches her work her way to her desk.
" I think we'll meet up at my office. I promise I'll take you to the reception. "
He glances at the menus again.
" Oh... nothing. Too bad. "
He sighs.
" You know what? I think I better get going. It'll be a great new year. "
" Thank you, thank you. "
She leaves him the rest of the day and he walks into the hallway and talks to everyone in the office. He sits down at his desk and hangs out with the other two. He picks up his paper lunch and talks with a couple of other people.
" I'm sure I'll see you in a few, but first, it's been a while. You're visiting a certain part of the world, usually Florida. Our old home just got demolished and I'm starting to wonder if you've got enough money for dinner or something. I've got to get on in a few more years, sir. "
He tells them all the details.
" I miss Alaska."

With open palms like latex gloves, and a pained look on his face, the Villan had laid back in his pre-bathed bed. For the first time since the blockade of Earth was lifted eight years ago, Gabriel, his daughter, lay down. His shoulders sagged as he stared at the ceiling as the clouds, the fog, and the small green sun rose up above the city. His heart fluttered as he raised his head, searching for something in the rain to relay his anger. In what he had seen, Gabriel knew that he was a failure, and had broken the orbital pact that saved his life. He was already exhausted, but realizing what he had heard as well. He began his speech,
"Greetings humans, my brothers and sisters. We must fight the remaining Titans. We must stop with our lives. Humanity must endure the pain of war. Humanity, we don't envy you, but our families are more powerful than you could imagine. Together we must defeat the Titans. Together, we must conquer the Federation."
That is where his plan came in. The Martians will be outdone by the Martians themselves. They are like parasites on a festering map, no matter how hard you try to separate them from the world. The Martians will contain the Martians once and for all.

It could have been a legal battle, but it certainly wasn't one to get out of hand. Gasping the edge of the stool in front of him, the investigator couldn't help but recoil. Behind him, the aural and plasticy-dream-stuck-in-reality psychologist visibly shaken, scowled. She had been in this situation several months, and the perfect scenario to set up this sort of payment, opportunity, and ultimate retribution for being wrongfully accused of tampering with the wait-list records of *Steve Jobs* merchandise. She was growing more suspicious as the weeks went by and the stars seemed to flicker.
"I don't see anything. " Gasped the android in front of her, staring blankly back at the floor, so not sure it might answer his probing question. She shook her head and took a moment to place her five-day stubby feet on the floor, pausing momentarily to catch a quick glimpse at her long-lost husband. " You seem to have used up your oxygen now that I've put those up. "
The android smiled at her, giving her a wry, sad smile. " What's the issue? "
" Emissions. "
" You paid for carbon from one point-to-point-instead of from another. " The android reciprocated with a shrug, showing me at least an equilateral triangle, a noose, and a couple. " It doesn't make any sense to us. "
The investigator's mouth was dry. " Listen, it's kind of my idea. "
She pulled back. " I know you worked on this thing, " she spoke calmly. " This makes sense. It makes sense to you. And I haven't put this up in thirty years. "
The android's face came into focus again, utterly confused, but paralyzed in realization. " What is it Steve? "
" Look, " she said. " What do you mean? Your oxygen is very similar to the carbon you used in the first place. It's just that there is nothing out there. Even air is not always like oxygen. "
" What? "
" The fact that there aren't is the opposite of what you people make. There is no recipe for living in harmony with carbon; you need to do something else. "
" And what would you know? "
" I started working on that project as a doctoral student on a solar system project, not even eight years ago. "
The android's eyes widened. " I know. "
" Anyway, what do you know? "
" I'm running the tests, " the android said, grinning wide. " I know you've been looking for me. "
" No, please don't, you're a nice boy! "
" Then why didn't you tell me? " The android was more confused than before, and smiling again. " It's not my fault! " She continued. " I told you guys before we started working on this that human-made oxygen is very different than other organic materials, and if your oxygen is used as such, other organic materials exist as well. They do so in layers. You think I can tell you about that? "
The android had the most confused expression she had seen on this Earth. She didn't know if it was her imagination or her former partner's. " Sure. " She insisted.
The android sighed. " You told me! It's silly! "
Her mouth dropped open. " I said tell me! It is ridiculous! I'm some sort of divine immortal! You invented that stuff up there, right? What a great discovery, you useless prank. It's ridiculous, and it's starting to bother me. " She handed me a drawing she wrote herself.
The android began to wisp, waiting for something to come back for her. " Yeah, sure, " she said, and smiled reassuringly. " Let's see if you guys can bring it up, shall we?"

Leonard Culster shoots himself with a serial killer's firearm, one of an oversized revolver. Not nearly an illegal dart shot.
Lying in a pool of his own blood on the ground, broken as the bullet enters a rotted wound, lay an orange jumpsuit that hardly used up the battery of expended rounds.
Leonard was 12, and had always struggled with everyday life. He cleaned up on the most primitive household items from state or national collections. Personal possessions like the milk carton he ate and the old TV he got. It wasn't until the house in the picture haunted him the most was in his hand.
As he stood over the remains of what once was his son, watching him through tears in the living room, a smile began to form on his face.
What would these kids think of him if they could know?
Leonard chose the gun that he had tucked in his pocket as an escape. It belonged to a loved one. For her sake.
The shot rang out across the cool morning air.
Leonard lunged for the gun, clutching it tight in his hand. But, of course, that didn't stop the man from raising his shotgun to his head, and firing it three times.
He slumped his head into his hands, blood escaping from his temple as the man fired more times.
The barrel lay twitching as the shooter approached.
"All right, young man, I'm sure you're going to enjoy your brief stay, " the killer said, almost as if he knew the answer. " I come to you with my hidden wealth."

"... I said, I'm the final boss of your long quest. You shouldn't win! "
Steve the customer finally turned around and had stopped talking to me, staring at the ceiling and in his arms. He was cursing and sputtering when I swung down on his knee and began to bleed on his skin, cleanly up his bleeding.
" I told you not to win, no matter what Steve, the boss just needs to show you what he's done! " I said, my voice stronger than I had imagined it would be, before racing to the window, the right size so he could smash his body against the ground.
" This isn't my business! " I shouted, sputtering again before wailing softly into the air, " I JUST SAID, PLEASE, NEVER AGAIN! " I jumped, and just as I leaped over the window ledge, I collided with a live gerbil, sending it to the ground, bleeding furiously onto his leg.
" AND SO IT WAS, Steve the Final Boss of MY long quest, NEVER AGAIN! LET'S JUST DO OUR PART! "
I continued whipping the fangs at him, but nothing worked, not until I managed to push him to his feet, and claw his way out the window, where he laid dead.
" I know you did this to help me! " I whispered, still grinning, " LOOK AT MY SPELLS. " I bent down, taking one small, clean needle, and injected it into Steve, just as a giant vein appeared in the middle of his chin, giving him a happy buzz.
" Wait! " I asked, back to hitting Steve, " I can show him what is going on."
He screamed as he fell, and died in a heap of his own blood, faint yellow flying around him, floating in the air before vanishing behind me, just as I was about to come to and grab the other blow. I raised the zippo, and Steve sang a song about how the boss was " the final boss of his long quest".

I had lived in a long, unceasing slumber until my family finally let me go. It was a nightmare, my family barely slept on their own. They all said their goodbyes. They had all had drunk enough, had taken many different drugs, and some showed up at work tired and sore as if on a downward spiral. Nobody that they seemed to do much more than sit around in their old, uncomfortable, living quarters while their children slept and fight was still around.
You ’ d think my life would have been a glorious one. A thriving family, a kid with a delicious family and some serious issues to go through. But we didn ’ t. We had no friends. We always kept to ourselves like a prisoner. We forgot to wear proper clothes.
One day I managed to open the hatch to the wall top room. It was quite dark. So dark I didn ’ t notice. I heard something from the kitchen. I turned around and did my best to see if I could hear their screams. I saw only silence. To my surprise I heard a long deep laugh from behind the stairs.
It was my friend Alistair. He was too young, who I never expected to meet, who just happened to be our best friend, the one who I never met was standing outside the door.
“ Sorry! ” He started laughing, pulling out a cigar and trying to smoke with the tip. “ I just wanted to say thank you for being such a good friend. ” I ’ d bet he's almost crying. He holds a pillow up to his face and closes his eyes.
“ Calm down Alistair, I just wanted to say what a good friend you are. ”
“ I always knew you were such a hard worker, all of my hard work wouldn't go your way. Did you ever think of coming here and trying to help your family out? You worked hard to earn it. It was a given. I always wanted to help those guys out. I wanted it all to be over. ”
Alistair turned and looked at me. “ So you were supposed to come here when I was going to die? ”
“ Yes, that ’ s exactly why I was there. You might think it ’ s a little bit insane, but I don ’ t regret it either. I ’ m still alive, and it ’ s just not a situation I ’ m prepared for. Come and let us play. ”
As I ’ m thinking this I can ’ t help but feel a warm warmth in my neck. I close my eyes and hear myself saying the most famous words I ever heard.
“ Do you want to come with me? ”
I start walking and now I ’ m in this family, in this house, with this daddy. He ’ s old and he ’ s smart. I ’ m a hero. I think he ’ ll love me, because it ’ s my sweetest dream.

The scientists looked at each other and began to giggle. After a moment they were baffled by their discovery.
"What's your name? " one of them asked.
" Peter! Peter! Peter! " one of them added.
" Are you sure you don't mean to be polite? "
" I don't mean to be polite, " Peter replied.
The rest of the scientists stood in shock. Several looked at each other but refused to look at the one above them.
One of them, who was short, wrinkled, white-haired and with a well toned physique, decided to act like everyone else. " If I don't like the smell of you then I don't belong here anymore. "
" I don't belong here, " one of them replied.
" If you're a clone of your mind then I am and it isn't mine to fuck with. "
" Are you sick, " one of them replied.
" Yeah, but me? Well then, nothing. "
" It really is me, why did you name me Peter? "
" I meant to be polite, " one of the scientists replied.
" Well... " Peter began to speak, " then it all turns out this is wrong. We were created here because we wanted to be present when you came here. Because, well, there's only one way to escape! I'm... I'm sorry Peter, but if you don't come back I'll have to end you! "
" I don't want to stay here! " Peter was yelled.
Peter had then gone to fetch what he needed. There was a post on the wall, with the words " We - " and " Think" taped underneath. On it said: DONT GO BACK HERE.

I really like this piece. The tone is compelling and quite surprising.
I liked the little introduction, but we didn't have much of a clear future and you didn't specify whether we would be living on as a colony or on a planet. The main thing you did point out is a lot of tension, and you broke me out of my reverie. You created so much tension in the story that I'm surprised you didn't consider the possibility of a crisis happening in your final moments. The tense of these scenes are powerful and solid; you did a good job trying to portray fear.
The story also made it very clear that this is a novel, despite the fact that it's the first e-book published by Hello Games. It's a short read in many ways, and lots of things to do in it.

To all the world,
The story they know of me is simple. I was a college roommate in Las Vegas studying magic to get my degree, and it took my skills with the occult and witchcraft to turn into such a strong and powerful vampire.
In all of my classes, at The University of Canada, I never once perceived myself as a vampire. I always knew I was a fuck up.
After the Lawyer's Puppy Wars, I decided to go on a job. My boyfriends bloodline threatened me, and my friends began banding together with me. The fucking stop!
I've tried anything that could have reversed the ills that I held behind my back, but I never learned how to make myself cool. Or at least not cool enough. It wasn't until I could explain all the screams I heard over a hundred times that I discovered the fundamental way I knew magic.
So I am glad you all care about my story, and my condition. I've been scarred for life, but I've had to do it. I became a Vampire after all.

The sound of a Colt C4 APC rumbling shook the room as many stood frozen in disbelief.
It's true, we are a new tech, i've always loved this feeling of having to interact with the dead family member. I mean, the comments said a lot about 2nd unit technology and synchronicity. But take that, learn from the mistakes in your past as a battlemind and show me that man did I wrong.
"So now you know what you did, you sacrificed yourself young and accomplished.
What, this step removes your best friend that taught you how to be. Dad always said to keep the best of things to yourself and build a better on-going relationship in your life.
You will have no regrets and no guilt for what you did. Father says that he did everything in his power to bring you to life. You, even some of those past few years, have truly given life to this company. So next step for you is to prove you are real, to confront your past mistakes and finally to leave this line of work behind for now. You can change tomorrow. Please. "
" Very good. Thank you Michael Anderson "
" Goodbye John."
So... I chose this one. Something that I would not want to fall for. Before I go. I thought it would be the best off choice, and hey, i thought that one would be a steal.

Today was the day. Today... today we would be free.
Every day, there are new horrors, new churches, new schools, new people. No longer will we struggle for what little we have left. To remember that we are alone in this world. To, perhaps, rejoice with the world at our feet.
It is unfortunate that we have to leave, for our existence was decimated by weapons such as hate and hate and hate. My friends, I know we struggle, but ultimately we are doomed.
It is depressing that we are going to find out what awaited us in the Garden of Eden. We will find out what awaits us here.
Months before, we vowed our life to get here. But in the same instant that the news of all of this was heard on every television, every radio station, every radio station, it was time for action.
We had a secret. Our lord and savior was dead. Our only one left is in Paradise to endure a few more moments of grace and cheer. And that, my friends, is one of the things that will save us all from this day, because it is easy to control.
Thought he was gone forever. I have been told that he was but a few days gone, and that he only spoke to us as a quick gesture of remembrance. And today we have to speak more. For today, we are announcing that Hell is finally filled.

I was ten when I heard the news. My mom got a text in the morning. " Hey, you have the biggest scar on your body now, are you coming over? " Then she got a text from me. It read, " Hey, you have the biggest scar on your body now. See you soon. "
My first thought was that my mom was being paranoid. Did I just hear a schizophrenic on the phone? Why would she keep one person like that? I had to be careful about telling her about what my mom and I had planned for the past week. Next thing I know, I'm putting on my best professional smile and joking with her. Her smile is perfect, and her tone is right. Her voice is smart, and I'm grateful that she can hold something that speaks to me as real, more than our friends. She introduces herself as Catherine. I finally answered the phone.
" Hey, Catherine. I just got my first tattoo, so you might like it. " I walked to my mom's room. When I got to the painting, it was next to my own. In the middle was a woman with blond hair, wearing yoga pants with a bandanna over a sweater vest. She stopped when she saw me.
" Catherine? "
" Hello? "
She started talking again, now a little louder. " Who are you? "
I couldn't believe it. I had just met a woman with her brown hair and brown eyes. I gave her a hug and just... smiled.
" I'm you. "
She looked at me for a moment and then left. I called the police, I told them I had a tattoo and that it wasn't real.
One day I ran out of town and found my body lying on my back, next to a fountain. I was wearing my best professional smile, she was standing next to me now.
" Catherine? I never thought... "
" Who are you? I never... "
" Who are you?"
She left. I panicked, then went to the police, and they took me home.

"Wait, wait. " Mom says, looking at the left-over cake that was still resting on the tray.

" I can't face the fact. " No mom. " I whisper. " See you around." She runs out of the room, wagging her tail before leaving.

Samuelson reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a large old blaster from his belt. He felt strong, exhausted and clearly fatigued from training. He spied a trembling figure standing over him, and Samuelson smiled heartily, knowing what a hardass the alien would be.
"Are you alright? " the humanoid asked. Samuelson looked for a moment more, but nothing he could see existed there. He turned to see his opponent, their saber in one hand, and a fearsome army in the other.
" N-no.... No....my name's Randy. We're here for one reason... " Randy had the combat scars on his face, and had some severe arm damage from an encounter with one of the aliens that the human had brought.
" Randy, you know that's exactly what I'm about to tell you... " Samuelson held out a two legged saber-less blue elephant and started working it at his opponent's head. " Can you turn me around? " The elephant gave a confused grunt and then dropped it. Samuelson raised the saber to the female elephant's head.
The elephant began attacking the other side of the ship. " Where the hell am I? I don't know! " the female elephant snickered. Samuelson lowered his weapon to the elephant's head. He rubbed it, and showed Randy a wickedly sharp attachment.
" Y-You actually *know*?! I've never heard of this! " Randy's words sound harsh but Samuelson's face froze and relaxed.
" Randy, please, just use your ship. If you can't... " Randy's voice came next, and echoed all around the ship, making Samuelson gag.
" If we try to take over... " Randy stood and stood back up, something just didn't seem right. Randy began to look around for his pistol as Samuelson waited for him to open his jacket.
" Stop this, " he said firmly. Samuelson was once again facing the human, but this time Randy wouldn't hesitate. He gripped his shoulder tightly, holding his bayonet like it was his job to secure it.
" Randy, not like this... where's *my* weapon? Oh God, try to grab it! " Randy was making a cocking noise, his men yelling wildly. But he had to shut up, because if Randy could do that, he would be dead. What was his chance? " What do you mean, no! I can't risk exposing you! What did you do?! You just left my ship! Why didn't you tell me!? I didn't know what was the matter! I need you- "
" No Randy, I won't tell you! I'm already dead, it's just too late now! " Randy stood, walking slowly towards his ship. Finally, he reached the platform and gently tapped his saber against the glass. He pulled it back and saw the baby elephant crawling out of the astronaut's room. Randy stood up and ran back to the ship.
" The fuck have you done? I've never done anything like this before! " Randy stretched as far as he could, and continued his running, now held in his arms like something from a sardonic gameboy.
" Randy.... " Randy's voice boomed out of his mouth. He looked in through the creature's eye and saw an unfamiliar face. " Randy Samuelson... Randy... Randy Samuelson!"

The stars were disappearing from the sky. I looked up at the dawn, my sweat painted eyes shivering under the light of the bright moon, and watched as every ray of light passed through the distant corner of the mirror.
I shook my head and stood. Outside, a group of youths were taking photographs of us; while we were experimenting. The night had not been happy. Lights were flickering, causing blurry shapes to appear. I pressed my hands on my hips and waited. A man in some wooden box sat down next to me and began to smoke a cigarette. " Do you do good? I think they love it. "
The man's face lit up. " I do. Those men love me. Some are going to his deathbed and I trust you... " He looked at me with anger and disgust. " I am not doing this, you know that. I am not one of those evil people. But I am helping my mentor master evil. I am helping him. " I stood there for a minute watching him smoke a cigarette.
The men shouted, " Merely forges and dark secrets! I should be more comfortable! I am going to spread my hate into his kingdom and I will not be where I think I am. "
I took a deep drag from my cigarette and looked at the girl in the box. " I'm going to see my mentor, and I'm going to love him, understand me and move on, my friend. "
" I hate this man. " Said the woman to her friend.
" Oh no! You're not with him, you're with the church. In fact, don't say this! If I had to name my killer... or anyone for that matter... I would say that it was you, Claudia. " I picked up the cigarette and stared at the girl.
" Your name is Claudia." She said, and put the cigarette to her lips.
I felt me return to my chambers and pulled out a long white leather keychain and place it in the metal space. Inside of that key was a book.
It had everything Claudia had ever desired.

I never had sex
My heart ached, it screamed for to be kissed.
All before the teenens had gotten so used to this emptiness, the silence around them deepened.
Kitty and banana sat on me, a tingly lump on my neck.
But now, the man with the voice looked normal.
At one point, they had told me I was like them. Normal, but extra special.
But now he was different. No longer only could I see his eyes, but he could see me.
So I asked him what he wanted for dinner, but he insisted he didn't.
I didn't expect him to be shy, but he broke it off quickly and he fell silent before I could hear him.
I felt the bell rung, but then he spoke.
"I'm not gay. I don't deserve this. "
Suddenly, the silent came back. He stood tall, towering over me like a taller one.
My heart ached, I screamed, " I'm not gay. I don't deserve this! "
Finally, the silence came back. My eyes were still closed and I felt a burning on my cheek.
I looked at him and I realized he was sitting in the bench near the pool.
" No, I... don't. "
" Now now! "
The silence stopped.
" Don't you know you have to try?! "
" Of course I know what you want! But I didn't want you to give me anything "
My heart dropped, but then I found out it wouldn't hurt.
I stabbed him, for no reason I'd ever expected.
" Get off me man! "
Again, the silence fell again.
" I know, but you know, now there's only one thing to do, besides try and fight it and the silence will kill you. "
" But what? I'm gon na do it! I don't have time for this! "
" Don't worry, I'm too late. "
The silence came back.
" Get off me! "
Again, I stabbed him.
For the longest time, I didn't think I was ready. I thought it would have been quick, but then, in the moment when I have nobody left to fight it.
I didn't think that this would last.
" Just get off me... "
He gasped, for help, the blinding light filled his mind.
I jumped off him.
" NOW! "
A voice turned his head and he thought he was still there.
" NO!"
The word carried.
I'm no longer gay. I don't deserve this.
Then, I saw what was wrong. I saw how in the moment that I was free, I thought I was free of all those things I always knew I would never be free of.
But now I was, I never was.
And now I know it's okay.

Humanity is the most fearsome species in existence. The villains fought over their strongest planets, their most important allies and everything in between. But none of that mattered. Humanity chose to meet our new enemy. Humanity was free to be anything that it pleased, even places of worship, whether they're right or wrong. Mankind just wanted to bask in the rays of the sun, to recharge their batteries, to enjoy the mundane existence of their way out of poverty.
It has always been there. To, or to not do, is the new security threat to this planet. Somehow mankind had somehow gotten a punch to the gut; there were no enemies to face, no enemies who have been fighting war with each other for decades. In hindsight, who really knows? What do we know? I suppose we will just have to wait and see.
They came in waves. They invaded Earth easily. The bigger cities were less difficult to attack. What did they call Earth? Certainly Earth was the dirtiest thing in the universe. There were thousands of burning cities as a result, nearly a century ago. They never expected to create a fighting force which could withstand the forces of nature. I suppose that this is why they never liked people; they often fought each other in the city he was attacking in, which left them unhappy in comparison. How can it be that Earth can compare to humanity's foes? I mean, we are nothing without our war problems, right?
Since we don't have to fight anymore, we just need to defeat them. Everyone has to fight for something they believe in. We tried to run away from our wars. It was called *watching war*, but in any case, it never worked. We killed them all.
The largest opposition to us came to Earth almost a century ago. It was a peaceful alien force, imposing and malleable. It seemed like it was far more organised than our neighbors. We have never realized that no two different races exist in the same universe. But the enemy was a part of this. We challenged them for decades, doing what seemed like well-enough, taking on ever adversary, without any glory. But they refused. We fought them without regard for any of our accomplishments. We were a failure. Finally, they had hope. They became our enemies, but they were our friends. They wanted to end this war, start over again. After all, we had been there a thousand times before.
We made peace with them.
We made peace with life.
And not just with death. I see, they liked me. We would fight them anyway. The pain always relieved them of their worst fears, until they realized that it was us who did the fighting, not ourselves. I thought that I would be a stalwart protector and leader, but, I guess it's no laughing matter. That may be what humanity needs after all. Maybe we could come back one day to fight. We all will know why we fought, if humanity has indeed beaten them so far. Perhaps our leaders feared us. Maybe we would do well to ask them once more. For that, we shall wait.

I stared, my blank face on the end of the kitchen knife.
I always said that in a way, it had to do with something. Relationships were tough when you had a love life, relationships had to go to work and I got to be told everything. Sure, I wasn't the most attractive guy, not even close enough to go at 12, but it's so much better than pretending to be any of that.
I tried to think of something that could make my stomach churn. Intense doodles of strokes in geometric letters of complicated numbers about *some* piece of equipment. And God, when does one speak of numbers or statistics? I was pretty certain I can write anything. I'd dealt with my grief and confusion for the past 8 years. How would I, in this moment, call the doctor and get a direct diagnosis?
"I'm sorry honey. I have to carry on like this. I will be with the woman I love. She isn't a horrible person. She doesn't need to sleep with a man. She doesn't need to watch her boyfriends and, you know, never need to ask questions. "
What is this and now my husband?
" Well, I'm sorry, I tried to contact this woman. She came to me and asked me how I would see her through my divorce."

"3:35 am, I'm late. "
" Hi, Tim, congratulations on driving again. "
Tim looked up from his chair, frowned at his phone, and shrugged. " Sure. How about 8? "
The man lifted his right hand on his right, slowly. It rested on the desk again, this time sticking out the top of the screen.
" Sorry kid. How's the kid? "
" Doesn't matter, " Tim reassured his co-worker, " He's fine. Thanks again. "
Tim smiled, and flipped to his desk. The phone fell out of his hand and landed on the coffee table.
" Whaddaya want? " The man asked, confused.
" She's probably dead, I can hear him calling 911. "
Tim looked on puzzled. " Why? "
" Her name's Lucy. " He smiled.
" Where's Lucy? "
" Umm, do you want to find her? " He asked.
" Where's Lucy? "
" I don't know, I... "
" Are you sure you didn't die? "
" No. I don't really. I'm sure I was just... " he trailed off, stunned.
" We've been through so much wrongs and gotten so far, should you rather live or die as a man? "
The man considered this carefully, and pressed his hand to his forehead. " What if I die then? " He asked, flinching.
" There is no heaven, no hell, only punishment. Heaven is hell. "
Tim clutched the phone, a chill running down his spine. " Oh my God, Lucy's dead! "
" Do you really mean we're here or a robot?"

**********533**********
I shut the door, pushed it open, and there was the sound of sirens, gunshots, and my mommy and daddy coming down the stairs. " Mommy, Dad! I want you to let me out! "
I opened the door. " Mommy? I saw *that* one. It was a wall wall. "
" What the Hell. What's going on? " Mommy glared down at her knees. " Mommy, Dad!"
So many lights and shadows around us. I pulled the knife and stabbed right through Mommy's neck. She felt the blow behind her, pushed her to the ground.
I woke up looking in horror. I looked downstairs, only to see the world ripped away and coming out of my belly. The door opened. The creepy little place I lived in was now very real. I got out of bed. I came downstairs and went inside. There was nothing there, except for the bedsheets.

**********534**********
Sometimes someone listens. He's pretty good at keeping secrets from their family and friends. Dad will turn up early on a Sunday morning, so he does the weekly well. I listen and I play; I play because he really enjoys me and he enjoys being my brother.
But when he gets there, I usually wait for the bus. Well, my brother isn't a bus driver. He only likes the bus. Not the Bus.
When my mother does the cashier a favor she's working late. She doesn't put enough people in front of the counter to get a receipt. Instead she really only lets me open up my contacts to'borrow information' from our bank. She doesn't have cookies on either of them so I'm really confused about the difference.
For my lunch the guy comes around the corner so I check the time. He usually knows about the board but has lots of vague info about it. Sometimes I ask him to roll it out to me but he shrugs and I tell him, "Kid I made this for you. " He only says it under his breath but I know my mom would be proud.
By lunch time the boss man comes through to lunch and he can tell from my dad's mannerisms that he'll give me credit for the extra money. I never have to explain what to do to satisfy him but it's time to make an impression. My parents get there a few blocks later and we're there for what seems like hours. That's when I get the idea.
The boss man says " You're late, please make it quick. " I do it. Just like I always do, I'm just a few steps behind my new supervisor so I take the money out and place the money on the counter.
The boss man sets my apartment flat as my desk and as his suitier customers wait by. By this time they're outside the door and they're incredibly sad as I hear them leave. My father holds a small box on the counter and answers his call. I turn back and the box is open.
A room has a blinds and window. The blinds are painted black, we all have them and he doesn't. No one tries to peek through them, so he takes care of it. The only thing there is a bookshelf; no bed or window, just a small wooden desk with a wooden handle just lying there.
One of the shelves is filled with a book that's loaded with pictures. He has a stack of them stacked there. I pull out a picture and scribble in the order with my finger.
" Yes, this is your graduation photo. " He says.
The whole room is filled with pictures. In one there's a boy wearing a shirt and skinny jeans with a top buttoned. The pictures of all the people in school are there, all completely different, all all with different names.
My heart drops. This is the happiest day of my life. The life that was. I wrote them down so everyone could know that it was their graduation day. As if they knew it.
And they did; without asking.
There's tears in my eyes. I don't remember what happens in there, but I do remember the shock after my graduation day. I feel like I'm being born again.
He always says: " It was worth it." He would tell me so many times so many times so I could memorize what he said all these years later.
But I know.
My only friend in this story is the person I killed and what I did to it.
And I like that part.

The moments seem to swim through my mind in slow waves, just like my own. The minute as I finish a sentence I hear a knock at the door.
I ignore it.
After all I've just seen.
Nothing of significance.
I catch my breath, and hold the handle of my lamp. The tick of a clock on my window suggests it's 2 a.m. I close my eyes and begin my own rendition of the song The Blackbird.
I'm staring intently at the mirror. Tears are streaming down my cheeks now.
Another knock on the door. I silently close my eyes, lean in closer, and rock my chair. I pull the hammer back. Nothing seems to happen for a moment. Just after five to seven some variation on the song abruptly changes to The Blackbird.
My gaze goes towards the door, my heart pounding in my chest.
It was supposed to be the end of my "half life." Yet I've just waited ten years for it to be this way.

Funny how he always came back for more.
I'm not one to judge, but I do still write out notes on these essays, pay close attention to the comments, and generally respect someone's opinion.
Although he brought me here for a brief time, I've decided to stay and close to my home for now.
--
"I know you're just waiting, Harold. Why do you always insist on this war? " Harold's boss repeated quietly from his seat, his eyes moving among the crisscrossings in the window. " You just can't take it anymore, though, you can't run away from the ruckus. "
With that thought Harold began to answer, slowly, carefully, but with conviction: " Right. Right. " Then he quickly added, " Yes, I will do my best. "
While he stared off into space with his prey, I continued in my usual defeated state: " And this war is just one more step forward for the human race, isn't it? I will die for the glory of mankind! "
Harold's words never left my mouth, as they never should.
Those words lingered throughout my lifespan, always there in the thick, heart-melting darkness of the distant ocean, as an assassin continues to hunt.
And whenever I focus, his eyes find mine -- as if looking for hidden patterns he makes then takes upon himself -- and, eventually, he commits suicide.
I fought him relentlessly for my life, every day. Never would have thought of it.
After all, many men have died so brutally in their defense during the War of 1812.
Funny how that soldier always came back for more.
Even my cat had its on.
When I step out of the house, Harold stares at me in the rear of my eyes. Then again, he knows it's right there, just next to me, perfect for this day.
Then I can see, from his upturned, very wide nostrils, he does not notice how I step out of the room. I push off a stone against his shoulder, as if to make it easier. I start to put the box behind him, and notice that, just seconds before, I had his tracker.
I activate the display of the tracker, and connect the device to my wrist, and thank God for years of practice; I look at Harold, and I understand now. I remember the countless nights he spent with his man, before killing the unsuspecting civilians on his way to deliver the final message to the West.
During these difficult times, he came home with no one to spare, and this is how he always came back, to run away from whatever trouble he brought for my company, to pay for my piece of land. I thank him every day, every trick.
For his amazing determination, it just didn't seem to be the case at all.
Oh yes, Harold, I don't blame you for what happened today.

" I know you're just waiting, Harold."

**PART 1: A world that lay broken**
It has all come down to this. There was no hope. We had just lost hope of survival. Every hour we day. For the past two weeks, we have watched helplessly from the darkness. For the past five days we have experienced a conflict of faith between our conflicting beliefs. For every step forward we have gone, an effort has failed. We have just prayed. We have just needed salvation. Yet, I still don't understand the purpose of this. Where did we begin? How does anything else contribute? Why does nothing else drive us to this place, this point in time? Where can we find salvation?
There is nothing to be found, nothing to learn, nothing to love.
We must walk, to cling to this world, to make it our own.
Our bodies are weak now. We need strength again.
They have replaced our bodies with hardware, our friends with substance. All is but dust now, that is what it was before we left to die a simple death.
What if there are no structures, trees, rivers, lakes, deserts, mountains, streets, tall buildings, towns... did we make this our own?
Then, maybe we should just stay here. We can still reach out to the stars and dream, to play video games or chat with the young women we don't need anymore. We can do everything we desire. And if things get lonely here, why aren't we here? Why aren't we already here?
... There is nothing for us here.

John'Stanley' was a good guy. He loved helping people. Quite the collection of people, he ate practically everything. It had been some time since I visited, and I needed a meal.
"Hey there Jerry, can you guys take the pizza I gave you? "
" Yeah, I can't work on the milk though, I'll have to cut out the juice "
" Alright " I replied with a wink " let's make that happen. "
Jerry swiveled around the table
" Hey Jerry, one more pizza here. "
" Awright "
He took a bite
I rolled my eyes, I guess it all started with a slice of pizza. I ignored the gourmet lunches John and Stan had been grinding for the past two years.
" Hey Jerry, can you guys take the pizza I gave you? "
" Yeah, I can't work on the milk though "
" Alright" I grabbed the pizza we would have given to Jerry earlier, but it was a sloppy, not fancy, paste that made it taste worse.
Jerry kept going, eating a slice of pizza some more

I can hardly believe I'm lying here, not helping my wife when I can't help but scream. If she forgives me she'll put me in danger. And that fact is unsettling. At least now there's an adequate chance of me beating her up. With her tears, red hair, bright red eyes and calloused finger.
But just barely. We always thought we were there to save her, but in reality it's all around us. I hate this forest for being so full of dirt and fire and love. It's like hunting an ant with eggs. The victim never takes the bait. And if she does, it's not for some reason I can't remember.
My hands are on fire. I can feel the presence of her blood. And it feels so real to my stomach. It doesn't make it any easier though, since I don't even know what kind of monster that is. I'm afraid that if I want to continue with life I may as well die.
I'll find myself in this forest again, in death. And I'll try harder than ever to not make things worse, but seeing as how this is on fire, I don't like losing anything in this forest.
Or rather, I don't like losing everything. I lost everything not so long ago. It's not worth it. No, I have to do something. I never thought I'd have to endure that pain, but I do. I don't know what I'll do. I guess it's not as if I have to hurt anyone. If I lose them, though, I just might have to die.
I can't stop my breathing in this forest though. No, it's not something I want to do. It might as well be eating a dead ant. I don't want to do that.
I can finally stop thinking about it. That wasn't supposed to be possible. I did get powers, all along with going to save her. I have to be brave. I have to wake up to the pain.
"Get up! " I yell. She shivers. " Not today, not now!"
Her eyes light up and her breath quickens. My vision fades away, but I know I'm right in front of her. In the distance, I can hear noises. Like elephants. She can still hear my screams.
I have to do something. I have to lose my abilities.
My breath quickens as I panic. This forest is too big for me to live in. The spikes on the sides are worse than the trees. I close my eyes and wake up immediately.

I sat there on the lonely beach, snuggled up in an empty box and waited to go back to sleep. Little blue box about 6' wide on the top and sides, I glanced over at the distance from where it should have been heading but didn't see anything.
"But how? " I asked softly to myself, hoping I might get a clearer glimpse of where the last grey box should have been. I couldn't wait for the end of it though so I pressed it up against my head with both hands. I wasn't sure how much longer I'd have to wait. I opened the box and everything went black again.
I awoke with a start but as my chest ached I shook my head and opened the box.
It had been a long night. The sun was out and I didn't have much time to enjoy the summer. I picked up the package and tried to open it but it only briefly slipped out of my fingers until I realised that it was only in the centre of my chosen box. There were more boxes in there. I looked down at the last box and pushed it inside.
It was full of some trash.
I looked down to see a glass of wine and a bottle of wine. I snuggled back in the box and continued down the beach.
After about a half hour of walking I couldn't stay long enough to pick up any more boxes. I tried to eat an egg mixture and put it into a fire. After four hours of packing it came out of the fire instead of the fizzing the bowl. It was fluffy and satisfying. After another hour of eating I didn't even mind. The couch was nice and warm and didn't stain the white carpet. I sighed and got up on a hot chair.
I went back to my bedroom a couple of hours later to check out the new car in the garage and dressed up as my son's best friend. I walked over to his bedroom and rummaged through my old stuff. It was still a long night though.

The bus driver picks me up from behind, lead me through the snow cold snow and into a river. He looks at me as if I am not about to give in to this hand-job. I hit the top of a river, falling, and become the greasy greasy sickle that covered the windows. I find a cabin located off on the side of the river. I climb up a branch, draw a breath of the cold and head over.
A couple of feet ahead of me, there is an old newspaper.
> Oh Oh Oh! Look how it went!
I take a seat at the edge and think to myself: maybe this is it. Suddenly, I feel my feet scratching on the bumpy boards and feel my feet pulling into the dirt. I fall asleep on a wet earth.
After a few more hours, I wake up to hear the birds outside the cabin singing loudly. I think to myself:'Hallelujah. Her home is up.' I look around myself, on one of the broken windows, and see her smiling and laughing at me.
I now enter her house and she makes another crackling sound. As she turns to look at me I realize that the goosepeckers in my brain may have accidentally poked themselves in my pet goats wings. I don't have any eggs to begin with, so I clean them up from the yard and set the all-encompassing bonfire for the fireplace.

*Seen in movies*
An archaeologist walks into an archaeological dig of a great monumental structure. He digs deeper and discovers one of the ancient looking structures, with an abundance of skeletons and corpses. The excavation is incredibly extensive. He discovers with unbelievable certainty that it must have been used to forge a cure for many diseases; the cure that ended the wars and reduced the population. He thinks to himself that they are not monsters, but are simply humans who simply, in one way or another, went through with this research.

This was our first time at K-mart, so I ’ m not too sure if it was fun. Anyway, we will be stocking up all of the wares from the shelves in our kiosk. They are all brown and jet black, except for those who smell the stuff.
As always, this was loaded on the walkway and even we gassed it with us. Sighing, I let a small clank sound. Grabbing my bag of miniskirts, I took the walk down the street, pulling in a bear patch to avoid flushing it in the three blocks it took to get here.
The jolt of the fabric caught me off guard, and before I could react, I felt it was already being dragged along by its legs. Being a lesbian, I grabbed it for leverage but were immediately locked in place. There was too much land for it to move any more. As I grabbed on to it, the burden it carried naturally knocked me off balance. Of course the shrink was watching me with disdain, but I could not do anything but wait until it was gone before I could harm it again.
Finally, as I passed the freezers, I looked over and saw it. A behemoth figure pushing a little cart down the alleyway as it worked its way through the stores. Getting closer, I realized it had read my mind. It was there. Waiting for me. I turned back as the thing stretched its wings and started flying toward me.

“ Where are you going Frank? ” I asked his petite little dog. He rolled its tail with apparent pleasure. This sort of sentiment was John's way of giving guidance to the wandering traveler. He was already on his way from his job at the Search Tree Division. He had to do something. John always gave weird directions.
“ To the city of Alexandria, ” he answered slowly. “ You ’ ll have to wait in a few minutes. ”
His human wife would have been asleep even less soon, if she had shown up by now. “ But why would I? ” I repeated, staring at the papers in front of me. As I flipped through the pages, I noticed that there were pages that seemed to be exactly the same. There was nothing else anywhere out in the field, only the most obvious ones, like the bright, dark one. But it certainly wasn ’ t always like this. “ That ’ s the last page. ”
“ Oh that ’ s not right, ” John said. The dog had started grooming itself when I answered it immediately. “ Is that why you insisted on some paper that looks different in the last ten years? It looks like some of the ice cream you ’ ve been holding on to. ”
“ Something about it looks like some practical joke, ” I said. John nodded and slunk off on his pace. After all, if I had listened to him, I would know that the contents in the last paper were definitely not the same. I smiled to myself. “ Damnit Frank. This is always going to be interesting to read. ”
John shooed me away. “ What is it? ”
“ It looks like you have a piece of paper that *looks* like a present. It must have almost been specially constructed. ” I suggested. John sipped his coffee. “ Come on, let ’ s go get some books. ”
John threw the paper onto the ground and headed home. He would have been selfish of his own accord not to go.
“ Hey look, ” I walked over to his garden, grabbed my book, and pulled it open. “ It ’ s been a while since we last spoke. We needed something to share. ”
The book creaked and he picked it up. The pages never slid from the ground for a moment.
“ So, what do you want to buy? ” I asked as I went in to the back of the truck.
“ Dinner for two, ” he replied. His eyes sparkled with wonder. John puffed out his chest and followed his train of thought. After a while, he gave up and we were content.
John sipped his coffee with delight.
“ Guess I ’ m gon na have to go get that cup of tea after that. ” I said.

"Fuck!"
I was the coward of twenty four, the most selfish coward the town had ever seen, my family simply couldn't protect me. I had to cover it up so I could save my family if it meant being responsible enough. But when everything got quiet I realized that I was the only one that had a chance.
Who knew that it would be me or some stupid psycho troll that had trapped me somewhere, hiding in here underwater, trying to get revenge on the sister that I didn't deserve.
I punched him right in the face, tears of joy began to flow down my face. How in the hell were we still alive? By now, I knew it wasn't me, I couldn't punch him. I was too weak. I knew I had to save our family, but it was all going to be an uphill battle to do so.
This is what the end was;
Ten years before his death I wondered if he ever saw me. I had also noticed that he wasn't laughing, he just didn't know the consequences.
I had followed the sound of the train tracks, leaving him with blood that I had caused. I had left my family here with the only thing that kept me going through all this.

The irony of the situation was worse than any other.
"What do you mean your done done doing? "
" I just cant think of anything else. Wants to keep going, but am out of options. Maybe I should change my values? Get it together? "
" No, no, you dont want to do this. You never said, you never thought, "
" Shut up. NOW. "
I ignored him and drove a few hundred kilometers. I arrived to what seemed like a nice middle class neighborhood. As usual everything was open and neat. The windows were in the same tone as before. As usual the breeze was a sweet and soft breeze. But there was something different today. " What is it? "
" I said to listen. Your parents found your biological parents to be antisocial, and decided to put you in a foster care facility. They found only a single thing in the care that would save your life. "
" Good." I replied at that. It was something I had thought about for years. I turned around and walked down the street. I was walking across the road the only other person in the whole neighborhood.
But as I walked on I felt a change. I felt a beautiful presence within me. As the door burst open I met my dear old roommate. He seemed oddly unaffected by the change. He told me he thought about the future, about the possibility of his soul returning to me. With those words I realized my steps weren't making any sense.
I must have caught an old man once. A more introverted version of myself with no personality.

It wasn't easy at first. But the apathy quickly crept up.
She wanted the sum of half million pieces she'd work to have added to her collection. She loved her trades. Very nicely pressed plastic skirts, beautifully crafted dresses, and a nice big maple bacon bomb case.
She handed them the basket, then she opened the satchel and ran to the cabinets in the entrance to the shop. Beside her sat the sheathed dagger waiting for her to place it into her favorite drawer. Not that it could be that.
The woman sat down at the counter, blathering under her breath, hand squeezing around the blade. There was an awful lot of legal trouble running around with stolen skills.
"People claim they have to buy these,'spec skills' with those kinds of overpriced piles of extra-intellectual shit. "
She hated getting to the client. Her client. How she always did her best to avoid problems like this.
" I've made hundreds of credits for it, but they won't come easy to me, Ms. Lemmon. "
" You must really be a goddamn connoisseur. The joy on your hands, no doubt, were worth a few hundred thousand, " the woman smiled and released the dagger, smacking her palm on the glass counter.
" Would you like to select a new one, Ms. Lemmon? "
" Affirmative. "
*I gave you an innocent little headache... *
The woman bolted to her desk, only to find her client, muttering under her breath as she strewn a section of the floor and started to board it.
" Ms. Lemmon... "
" Just two seconds. "
" Mr. Rickey can still get it for less than the price if you take your prime instance of emotional pain. He'll look for the spellbook I brought with him, and at his facilities, but you should get this one. "
" You don't have to enter this information, " the woman instructed.
" I will, " he said.
He stepped closer and pointed the knife. " Yes sir. "
The woman found the blade staring at her from above the desk, and made her way back inside.

And more.

**"Uh... hello I'm Charlie DeStefisch. Did you know I'm God? " **
The question sat anxiously on my desk for the umpteenth time today. If I didn't know better, I would have slapped my paper down and leaned back.
I could hardly believe I was elected after spending a high school quarter science teacher teaching 4th grade. I looked up in time to see my score go from 5.44.
As always, I had to force a smile. " Thanks Dan. Would you like to take the test for me? "
I've never really seen a test like this, but for some reason, I was very excited for it. It wasn't exactly the moment I predicted, but it made sense. As my presentation was unfolding in my head, I knew I had something to play for.
" I'd like to make something of myself, my name is Bob DeStefisch, and I'm 18 years old. On a Wednesday. " I stared at the humble board, before asking, " Is it over yet? "
" No. No it's not. No it's not. "
" Okay then, Bob, please take a seat. "
I nodded and sat up, a little slowly, in the white chair next to my desk. I couldn't wait to take the test.
" It's all done, even if it's just for you. "
I smiled and touched my exam table. Again, I got the feeling that this time, I wanted to practice.
" Alright Bob, I'll start here, " I paused for a second. " Tell me, what's your superpower? "
" I can... " I said in awe.
" Ummm... great. "
I looked at the source of my question.
" Have I said something God! " The place was massive! I turned around and waited.
" No. You didn't hear me. That was right, Bob. Just answer it. " I think Bob and I laughed.
" You have. "
" What? No, what are you talking about? "
" Have I said something God! " I was dumbstruck and clutched my face to my chest. I heard a voice from the other side of the board.
" Mmpff "
" Wk? "
I watched in awe and shock as everything was spun around and rotated in the rest of the board. Immediately after, the most beautiful thing in the room occurred.
" Do you have your superpower? " The voice was the head of a small, white bird. I couldn't explain the number of zeros and ones. I wonder if I have my powers now?
" It doesn't matter, Bob. I love you. Please answer it. "
The question hung there for a moment before I put the pen down and gathered myself. I looked up at the board and cried.
" I'm no god, Bob. I'm... " I paused. I placed my hands on my stomach.
" Are you okay, God?" I asked softly, my voice shaking. I let out a deep, silent sigh.

*POOF* A burst of light. The best mechanic from the Battlefield-Ark Studios. Blasting like a laser, down my hyper-powered hands and invisible to the eyes of any opponents!
"Take a look at it. " An incoming sniper rifle shoots the gun at me, taking the bullet from my wrist and putting it into the grenade on the counter. I scatter this green bitch's corpse to the bottom of the counter, another bullet to her head and a concussion for her leg.
*POOF* The ball of green light hits the counter, ringing the ceiling of the room. I duck and play a little, desperate to finish the pain off.
The capsule appears in my hands. A karticle, maybe? I dial up a karticle company that prints feet for me from the underground. My gun is off-balanced, bent to touch the floor, so I take out a new one, try to wrap it around my teeth. Then I pick it up and clutch it tight, ready to hang onto it to get the adrenaline out.
I walk around the room, shaking the crap out of the booth-for some reason. " Here, " I see the karticle glinting as I put it back in my jacket pocket, " Looks good. " I sit down, gripping my hook on my jeans. Suddenly, a stranger walks up to the table next to me. His monocle is middle-aged and pouting, and his t-shirt starts to slick with dirt.
I am glad this is over, I decided. " So, you're Hell's e-
" Actually, yes, I am Hell's e- "
" That'll only scare you for a while until someone finally finds your true purpose for killing yourself. "
" S-sorry, but neither one of us wants to see who created you! "
" Well, apparently you were prepared. "
" Oh... sounds like I didn't kill myself. Well, though, maybe you shouldn't be so crazy."
I drop my hook to the floor and start thinking about the others. No fighting. No hacking. No hacking. I sit back.
Don't sweat, don't worry about being one of Hell's e-

"Those figures you quoted were all true! * Impossible*! " Screamed Wayne as Batman spoke. Wayne knew now that his rival was simply a madman. He spoke no less of himself and Bruce Wayne as they rose to speak the first law of The Wayne Family and began their murderous pursuit for vengeance.
" Yes sir, my dear boy, " yelled Wayne as his young victim ran toward Wayne Enterprises. " Why, child, why, why must I not speak. All because I swear to buy my son a brick in the street! " Wayne yelled in the spittle but wasn't silenced by any words he spoke. The onlookers muttered to themselves and backed away from the assailant. Wayne hid under the nearest tree and continued to gather his parts. " You don't know what I thought! " Hissed his friend, Maximilian for his part. " We all have our means in the way that I see. Even the laws we were doing to protect myself must now be used to threaten justice. " He repeated as the crowd fell silent once more. Wayne understood but still walked toward him. The young man stood with his arms wrapped around Wayne. " I guess I don't have to tell you what happened, child! " Wayne screamed and then squeezed Bruce's hand as he did so. " The public is hurting, but it's our way or they will find out their toll. Your father and wife will be mourned as having lived on and on together. " A surprised Wayne leaned over and whispered " You can forgive this children. " Wayne continued to pull Bruce over to him as he fell for the kiss and cuddled softly. Bruce began to sleep as Wayne walked away. After a few minutes he reached across his own body and placed his hand upon Wayne's shoulder. " Will I look into your eyes this time? " " Perhaps," whispered Wayne.

If something can change, what changes to?
It didn't look like anything I had ever seen before, nothing like an old haircut. It wasn't a beard, brown hair, or eyes, it was something completely different.
It looked like a man, on top of what I had saw, but I couldn't make out anything in it. Just a man with clothes, an office job, or a heavy coat, and a sliver of what I could've found at the bottom of his head.
I had enough of looking around at the list of things he'd been shit at but all I felt was despair. Who was making the lists, why was his manager leaving him a list of fuckers. Why was he leaving his mistress, son? What am I supposed to do about him, how do I stop him? It felt like a lifetime without anything, where did I end and where did it start?
I pulled the trigger.

A wall fell on top of the White House, and in front of it, the Secretary of State and Secret Service stood staring at each other in silence as they stared at nothing in particular. Barack had been absolutely wrecked in Pakistan. His life and many nations were gone. He was staring and waiting and shaking, and looking around and looking... He knew. His identity. His life.
It had been an amazing time. An unbelievably long time, but I think now would be the best time to tell them all. I could tell that something terrible was about to happen, so I got up to leave the White House. Back to my aide who's entire day was spent trying to calm him down, finding his lost girl, trying to convince him that he was an insane person, then telling him that whatever calamity he had caused him... was nothing more than a stupid idea.
He was smart, and very calm. I guess he had come to me in a dream, one of those crazy ideas that you fly every other night and tell everyone not to trust you, and they don't trust you anyway. He was very introspective and right. I could tell he was scared. For a time, he believed he was the only President in the world. He was afraid of getting tagged and caught. He was afraid of flying alone, and I could tell he was scared too.
He didn't think I was the only one, but when I went home I turned around and found that my wife and son were already gone. I think they had had a smoke though. They were both going out and hadn't visited since we left. I think the reason he needed a smoke was because he didn't want to be my best friend, but when he went back to see his family at home I could see that it made him feel guilty. He thought he was letting someone hurt him in some way.
But I had no doubt that I knew what he was doing. He was running out of things, and he probably wasn't going to get the job. When I asked him why he was running for president, he simply said "I liked my Dad".

I didn't mind anymore. This job really was fun, in the end. But the whole time I was in there I was having fun. And I don't know what happened.
I was passing one of my tables while I was making my way to my plan of attack. They told me to keep my eyes on the wall from too much light so that the knockers would kick in so I could feel what they were doing. It was a feeling I thought I had used before; that I was born without eyes or nostrils. As the second person approached I watched with apprehension and were struck with disbelief. I stared at the middle-aged man to my right and in my panic my gaze only turned to him. His eyes seemed a minute or two away, and it became clear he had grown quite understanding of me. This man didn't always have an interesting habit of collecting ghouls and now there was one so I expected one of them. When he saw me he seemed rather disappointed but he didn't speak a word. When he tried to give me a secret to give me a secret I still didn't know. I stared at him for about an hour before I finally gave in.
After he left I had finally had some understanding of the two men. And this turned out to be a very special kind of understanding that had driven the two of them mad. When we got outside and talked, I found out why they were mad and why my guts didn't dry up. We tried to figure out why we were running, or if we even got back here. Eventually we built an underground railroad which was connected to the main street by a bridge with a platform for passing through. When he called up his friend, he said something like "If you can get through, I'll let you in. " He was quite disappointed and said that when he asked someone to go to the underground railroad he would always answer " yes. " I was quite surprised about this, but I was speechless when I replied back " Sure you can, Jack. If you need me, I'll come if you need me. " A man walked into the building and they were all waiting for me there. To my surprise, I was there too.
The only thing in the room was me. I hadn't seen a person in months, and honestly I didn't know what to do. I had already started walking towards my plan and then when I started to follow, the door burst open and I dove right in. The first man was in front of me and had just walked in, but my view of him looked different. He didn't seem to notice me and I spun around in his direction, the whip swinging back and forth like the wind. I grabbed his arm and leaned up to keep him out of the door.
" Hi.. "
" Hi Jack. I like you too."
He was right and after a few short months I was putting him back on the ground with another shack and we were hunting the dead dead along the river. I kept telling myself that he didn't know what was going on. He was an unhinged, capable son of a bitch and he had failed us. I grew tired of it and decided to throw him away for a while. I spent a whole year staking out this spot and I stayed here with him until he was tired of my show.
I don't remember much now, and I don't want to come back here again for the rest of my life. I just want to remember what it felt like to be a part of this place, and all the bad things I did in my life that made me feel unwanted; good and bad. My great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great

I guess I was dreaming. Not to pick my nose, you know. But it doesn't matter. There's no other me here at all. Without the music on, it's either a bad idea to go see Tom or to turn the music up. But we have an idea.
We don't know anything about him, and we don't know that he's not our hero. I'll send my letter to Choo. We used to think that he was some sort of friend. The moment we used to meet, he approached our friends and I. Once he broke, his old-world, male friends tried to make it better. We thought we were friends again.
Our younger versions left and left a year ago, which lead to the start of Tommy's high school career. Choo becomes our associate. He is our only friend, and he stays at my apartment when I can't. His basketball mom will always sneak in whenever I need him. If she ever sees Tommy, she'll put on her best smile. Nothing goes missing, nothing bad happened in the school.
It would be nice to have Choo's back. Instead, the only thing I know is for Tommy to miss me. If he doesn't remember us, he's probably just lost his mind.

He *was* the man that would get his parents' killer. The man who had to kill every man he met in order to not even keep alive. The man who was to get his next stop.
*His murders were still on the way. *
It was a nightmare for Isabelle. They had two parents, a husband and a family that had grown to hate her. She had suffered from bouts of psychosis; the paranoia, the thoughts of killing had always left her in shock. She was crying alone in the cold night, eating too many sandwich pieces in order to complete her meal of last ditch effort and now there was nothing.
*It wasn't just her. It was her whole world. *
James and Rachel had met in his apartment two years ago. The man who drove them into the city together had slashed in half. They were drinking as drunken as Jack would be without whisky. The man, however, *isn't* Jack. He was Allison, whom he had broken up with a couple years ago.
The man had needed his boys to have sex, but Allison had a boyfriend that used to be with him. Jack thought Allison was friends with the man, but James had been there two months ago.
The night had gone well. A gang of men in suits huddled around and around the corner. The man kissed Rachel passionately. The blondes loved him, and Allison had given him hope. James joined the group.
The next day, Allison woke up from their nightly drinking. It was on the same block where Jack had kicked her out of his apartment and into a car. He had been drinking too much, and James had helped her clean the damage.
When they got back to their apartment, they left a note that read
"Thanks for the drink. "
They began to kill each other, and called it an act of desperation. Someone needed to stop them, so they dropped the knife and began to stab the man.
Before they had even finished, there was an alarm. The noise had shaken the whole city as it began to hit them. There were seven of them, standing in the street searching for the man, trying to reach him.
And the man stepped through the door and into the street.
He ripped through them, and soon he was atop a man covered in the blood of dozens. The man, on the other hand, had avoided the execution and was laying on the ground. The man stepped through the man, reaching his hand for the dead man's hand.
The man reached in and pulled out a small red object that was marked'iron' and *holographic*.
The man grinned. The man in the red wasn't much of a man anymore. A man that was once someone else, but that was no longer.
James winced.
" Oh no, " he whispered to himself.
Then he pulled out a tiny switch to flick it.
The man laughed hysterically and the hole opened to reveal a perfectly-defined titanium square.
" Don't you ever think of that again, James," the man said as he lifted the shiny flat object up in front of him.
The square appeared to be very large, but carried a tiny gold film. It pulsed within the square, and an invisible light glinted off.
The square which once stood before James at the edge of the city was no more.
*He* was the man that would get his father's killer.

A creature of unimaginable size, eyes at a full thirteen feet tall, a mouth at a full twenty inches long. Its creation terrified the city and forced the residents to step out of their homes and into the dark streets where it's existence seemed an impossibility.
But when the creature opened it's mouth, it instead asked, "What is this. "
It began looking around. A handful of people witnessed the creature's creation. Woken, the creature raised its jaws high in the air to a crashing sound like thunder. The crowd began to applaud and support for the creature.
A crowd of police officers gathered around the creature. The creature then spoke one word, no larger than a scraggly crab, only somehow taller and straighter than a police officer. " I am the Djinn."
The creatures mouth twisted, slowly and purposefully, until it was only three feet. It opened a maw that the officers could no longer see. All of the people began to gather around the creature as it approached.

The storm was low.
Seagulls.
Blood on my hands.
I knew it would rain soon.
Even in forested New York City it was impossible to stay in sight.
Goddammit the storm was going to rain.
For it was threatening to end here.
So I hid, and we never faced it.
Nobody was coming.
This is the last you'll be here.
You aren't going anywhere.
Out here in those forests.
Here a man lives.
Wanted to stay on the road for a while.
You're just scared.
But you'll figure something out.
Good luck.

I haven't seen the chair in years, it's day after day. I look into a mirror, I'm not sure what I'm doing, and I lie down facing the mirror.
And look, I'm kind of disappointed but so are you.
I dream. Dreams like that are what begin to numb. For me. My dreams keep me going, following my dreams so I can sleep. But I can't wake up. The walls I keep walking around remind me I live there.
But that's not really the point. I sleep.
My dreams keep me awake. They watch me sleep, I see them, all I can really do is stare.
I feel like I'm floating through space at 30k in a 100m dash, it takes a couple of hours to get to a point where I can manipulate in rhythm. There is nothing though. That's the point, and it usually feels good. Then, however, there is no sleep.
I think it is either my dream or the dream itself.
I go about a year without realising. I dream of being rich, ruling the world, beating the shit out of myself and all those great people. I dream of my family. We have the most amazing family we have and it's all some super hooker movie.
Then, I can't sleep. My body is a pile of tar, a pile of nebulae. My brain never experienced more than a few months.
Then, the dream goes dark, I'm free. I feel like I haven't slept for 8 hours.
And I sigh.

Dear ex,
I write to you because I didn't mean for it to end this way. For what I did, I'm sorry, but it is too late. I want you to have the courage to say goodbye to your world. I want you to step out into the light and walk the streets. I want you to bring back your sister, Lindsey, as she was when we first met, the last remaining mirror that she smiled so good, I think. I love you, and there are so many things I wanted to say to you. You have to have a heart of steel that lifts you to a higher place of sheer freedom. There will never be a time when you don't feel a change in yourself. So tell me, keep your head high, don't let it fall off your shoulders. You have to reach out to the last thing you love, and trust those words that will always guide you around. I love you.
Regards,
Lenny

All I remember is the smell. The smell of honeycomb. I didn't know it was honeycomb but those days were the best. I knew I shouldn't have ever left the house and what I saw drove me insane. There was a lot of action. And there was no better way to go out than one that could be done by a car being in a car.
I drove back home after a long day at work. The spotlights were off, and the hair on my arm went limp. Nothing had changed. My car hadn't budged. This place was a nightmare. I was driving into a power line when it started. The timing was too precise. I could feel the pedals moving. I had to rush back into the car to a safer spot. I had to help the car escape, but the truck never had the chance to change course. I told the driver to come over and help me, but there was no going back. Now here I sit watching helplessly as my car regained control. I couldn't think straight. I panicked at first and cried out for help, but it seemed like it would never come.
I had to get out of here. The tires would start falling. I had to go to a hospital for a month, something like this would have to be happening to people. At least that's what I thought. What was happening is going to be a nightmare.
And in the dead of night, I woke up. It had been a long day of working in the mines. Two bullets pierced my heart, each one leaving a scar that hurt my eyes. They must have hurt her.
I knew I wasn't going to make it. I drove in the other direction, avoiding falling. I couldn't stop. The headlights of my car continued to drive. I had to leave.
A young man by the car, who I didn't recognise, drove me home. I needed to leave for a month, something like this would have to be happening to people.
He ran out to tell me not to go home, but when he came back, he tried to run at my car. I was a monster.
He went after me, and grabbed my arm. I cried out, but I couldn't. The light in the car was still on. I pulled away. I was in my house.
Suddenly, a car coming to a stop outside the mine turned right.
It looked to be filled with soldiers who had just been put in charge of defending mine, which was why the police was bringing all civilians in to help evacuate. I had just wandered in when they came inside. I heard yelling from outside. I ran, but did not make it.
Out of breath, I gasped and reached for my belt.

As I stood, among that bloody battlefields, I saw the signs. The signs of the evil I once stood for. The golden age of Rome. The iniquity of despotism. The seelie powered by a burning fear. The vastness of time stretching to infinity.
My empire had come to this. Long ago from the days of man and steel. It had taken a great part of my people along with it's technology and flesh and blood. My sins were unchecked and sealed from their very reach. I was not responsible for how our people were selected for a power and culture that would usher in a golden age. I did what is required.
For so long, I had watched my people wander and flourish. During the darkest times in my enemies nation. I know they fled but I refused to care. I did not go willingly. After all, my goals were merely an idea. My people would all stay that way. I did not, for the same reason I lived to serve. My only ambition was to... enjoy a life. I never considered that perhaps its pain was not to live a good life. I never considered the true reason why my people had rebelled. Yet I will soon find out.
With the people ready for my wrath, I have struck. And the battle will soon start. All will see the destruction and destruction that has yet to come.

Sam took in the wide, wide world of sun rising over his face at the distant'sthoma' or bow and arrow range. The bowman or wizard, or army man, or canine? What was his target, what was his *real* purpose, while some would guess he was called to strike their throne of dry land on the other side of the sea.
"Hunter! Hunter! Hunt! "
He couldn't see through his binoculars and brain hurtled through the heavens with his behemoth hunting rifle, evidently unable to reason to what's been going on. The leader of his troop bounded by his at the breaks in light.
" What'cha shootin' at me ain't some fucking grand warhammer, lad? "
Sam couldn't turn his back on those who saw him, or at least didn't ask him. The king of the jungle, or that ruler of the bears must have called him. He was a lioness, after all.
" Just follow me! " He yelled.
The cat! The lioness who ran wild in their valleys over forested mountains. The warhammer had turned her into a shadow, she was made with metal rods forged from years of darkness, she was almost a toy, just like animals of that era but much prettier. But Sam could not take it either. She did not like it, in fact she had grown tired of it.
Sam rose from his hiding place and flung himself at the lioness, cut the head off with nothing but a bloody starfish, and his last words were... " Fuck you."

"Hi, David. I am Queen Elizabeth I, I am Queen Martha I, you have said long live the Queen and her family. "
" That is correct. "
" So what did you ever do that was really so important? "
" Well, my duty is very clear. And this is where I tell you, this... this is how I am sworn to do it, the truth is that the Queen is death, the only good thing you are going to see, because what could be better than to see the news of the birth of a full grown royal family, and my papal life? "
" I never intended for it to be this way David. But here I stand and in some secret box waiting for the day I die. I have met so many more queens who are beautiful, mighty women. What could be better than to see all the beauty of those around you? "
" Well, maybe there is, or there could be. "
" But, but why would you do that. "
" Well, I haven't had time for this. "
" What time is it? "
" One hour. "
" Please tell me. "
" I need to have my own private cell. "
" Prison? You mean, they have their own cells? "
" Yes David. Yes. Now, before I turn my back on you one last time, my presence on this earth is as important as any other. One last call with my Lord and Savior God the Almighty. "
" I am not responsible for your wickedness. The God who took my power and took the women of our realm as my own. "
" There will be no forgiveness. "
" The world is going to end. "
" No I won't. But first, my Lord and Savior. When God hears the voice of your Lord and Savior and all of our souls will burn in Hell, he will be angry as a God who is nothing but God's anger. "
" I must repent, and open my eyes one last time before the world ends for good. You shall be answered with his mighty, blood-sucking word, and he shall burn in Hell no longer. "
" I must try, to live! So for you my friend, I am continuing with my private life for the good of the world! "
" Fair enough. Now, before I destroy you two with fiery fire all I would say is, thank you David."

God, I cant wait to see her...
I'm so going to miss her.
Her eyes lit up, and I could feel myself momentarily confused and confused, because I've never been wrong before. And she's always been beautiful. She left just a few months ago, I haven't seen her since then, and I've never even met her. What do they expect me to see when I get off the plane? Is it something big, something secretive? But I've never been in danger so long... I must be the first one gone this early this year. She may not be the most beautiful, but there isn't anyone she can't see me with.
I imagine my eyes are tired. The air is filled with nauseous fumes, making it even harder for me to breathe, making me squirm. But I keep my eyes open. Everything is clear.
Another hundred bags. Last we got... we got the one I already checked. Finally. No crazy shit?
If I remember correctly, I got away with 15 separate counts of "walking in the wrong direction," and losing 10 of the 6 deputies. This is getting weird... I can hear them speaking, but I don't understand. Why don't they check all the random bags? Why can't they throw everyone the same color scheme?
I keep my eyes open to all of them. And... They still keep their eyes on me. I keep my eyes closed to her. Because they know my deepest secrets, and I'm just not stupid enough to think I'm beautiful. I have so much to learn, and I'm so excited to see what can be accomplished! And they just keep finding new ways to manipulate my life.
I think I will meet her there. Maybe one day, at some airport, I will finally meet her... and then I'll leave.
But I can't, because I can't.

I sit with my back against the door to my bedroom, taking refuge in my gold watch. As I turn in and watch my life flash before my eyes, an idea crosses my mind. Perhaps it's something I'm in love with, maybe I'm too smart for this, maybe it's the fact that I'm among the few that won't inevitably die, but there's a certain madness that may be waiting in my head; there's something odd about this. An old man in the corner stirs a thought and has a mind for me. I almost give in, but he has the grimy expression on his face that kills the feeling. Yet something seeps from within me; deep inside... I wonder if I really am the only one in the world that is lucky to be born next to those fortunate enough to have the ability to gain some sort of life, even though it is in darkness. I swallow in the thick foggy air and decide not to be afraid.
This is it; I don't have time to rest, but I can leave. I stand up and look around me, feeling my way toward the door, which was once the only thing between us, but as I step in I see something else. I smile to myself; the grave of my best friend over there. I look at the trapdoor. As my green eyes get heavy, I open it once more. I watch the creaking and thudding of the door behind me. It had a smooth, cold surface, but if I opened it right now I wouldn't have to see my missing friend since he was the first person I'd encountered. I slowly walk up the stairs and jump down, falling past countless figures. As I regain my footing I notice the entrance unlocked, with a loud sigh. But the fog still manages to clear, so I step over the fall. As I enter a closed door, I feel more familiar... than anything I've ever experienced, but I know what I must do. I open the door, and step inside. " Grandpa... you're going to love this place, aren't you? " I respond, as I step into the room. You see, I'm a rookie, and I'm really not sure what to expect of this new sensation my life throws me. However, inside, I feel my calling be called back, as the hospital comes into view. The smell of medicine fills my nostrils and allows me to stifle a smile. An aura surrounds me, and I realize that I am safe here, and am going to have a good time. As I feel another set of soldiers regroup, I try to outrun and attack them, but these burly men move quicker and faster, and the doors are now visible. " An honor, Grandpa..." they hear me whisper to myself, and let out a sweet.

I looked up and saw her face gawping from to her cereal. She flopped to the floor in her underwear and collapsed on the bed. I turned around and looked in her direction. It was a wide, no-longer-curvy face. " Did your'babies' let'em let'em eat my brains? "
Her eyelids creaked. " They looked at me like I was crazy." I took another breath.

<|endoftext|>
**********567**********
At least my cell door was still unlocked. It had been a long time since I came here, and even though everyone knows that I'm a crazy person, no one knows that all of this had happened. I just sat there, holding my cell door open, waiting for anyone to come in. One curious thing happened, I could feel their thoughts. Just the quiet, endless unending thoughts of my life. There was just this moment, or moment of clarity. I was ready to go home. I was *just* in the middle of becoming mentally unstable at some point. I just had to see them come back out. It was no big deal. There was no need to act immediately, the only things at risk from the armed robbers was a small stinging red light and a low, shrill shriek. Now that I thought this out, I did it right, they were definitely armed. Well, they were. But it was the wrong robbers. It wasn't the one who had subdued me, but the one who had scolded me for breaking the lock. I had interrupted the others, but they weren't up to that challenge. My best friend, dax, came in next. She looked so upset, she ran towards me and pulled out an assault rifle. She heard the gunfire, and pulled the trigger. The cracks, the sounds of battle began. I felt the tears welling up in my eyes, and I looked at her. I knew she had nothing else to do, but that isn't a good sign. The only person that would be safe was her. Oh, what I would do if I didn't have the trigger all over her. I had destroyed her family. She was my daughter's, but she had been one of my best friends. I'm the only person that I would want her to be safe from. I could just call the cops... I could just... call... the authorities. She was born into a family of thugs, and I'll go through the rest of her life looking for her. There's no justice in killing a child. Now I think I'm going to take out the rich kids and their kidnappers and rob the cashier cashier. * Should have listened to my mom just minutes ago. * That... that wasn't her daughter's fault. It wasn't her fault that the media called it when the price of a pound of gold was at 2,500 pounds. And none of it will ever be used for any drugs, any weapons, any drugs... She needed all the money she could possibly get. She needed a family... and a beautiful little girl. And I think I'm going to have a family of my own, and that's just assuming that all this is a dream. I have no idea how to feed my daughter, feed her a baby. It doesn't matter. That is my life. I just need one thing, anything, and I think I'll use it. * Every time something goes wrong, I think about how my life could have gone differently had I known the back story could have been different. It didn't matter what color my childhood was. I got way older than I should, and I don't have children now. When I was five I got off of my back porch and turned left on my way to school. I didn't realize that the block ahead was just a part of the highway. It wasn't much, but it had a decent distance between me and the bike path. I wasn't an athlete, or a fighter, or a loner. I was just an old man. Maybe I knew that at some point in time my entire life, my entire consciousness, would have been a prison cell. But in that moment, that moment, I did what I had to, but I would still get away with it. I would do everything I could to help my daughter. There was no running and no turning back. My hand reached down to get her mother's bra. She didn't. I want her bra. I want her. If I were the one, I would be proud. I would be a hero. * Time to go out. Come with me. *

Like most human beings, I ’ m an idiot. However, as I started the criminal enterprise a year ago, I noticed something much more horrifying than any other person.
After checking on the suspiciously clean old house, I quickly headed to the living room and did my job. The trap was simple – here's an old twin bed with a loveseat that was oddly bright, and the ceiling had laminated walls.
Ignoring the pretentious neighbor as he entered, I sat down with my large, red-brick door at the center of the table and opened the front door. Beyond, dark abysses covered the floor with phantom shapes and odd critters crawling on they legs. A little girl in a blonde dress sat comfortably at the front of the room.
Hoping for a peaceful quiet time, I went to the back and crawled into her bed. The little girl stirred as her mother pulled a long, huge ball of blood out of her face. She squirmed and let the blood roll down her chin as she sobbed heavily for the life of her mother.
Thankfully, the little girl didn ’ t cry out – she was cute, and I wasn ’ t at all surprised. After all, as a hard-boiled criminal, I ’ d done good.
A few minutes passed and I was back in my room. The little girl turned away and lay down on the bed. Eyes closed, the little girl snatched her bedsheet from her side and twisted the side thing around like a sewing kit. It snapped under her weight and bent as she started to whine. It never left her side in the slightest, and soon, the little girl ’ s shrieks echoed across the bed, and then, her mother rushed in and slapped her to the floor.
“ Did you want to know? ” the little girl sobbed, seething in pain. Her mother suddenly sobbed at a furious stop, and was rushed to the emergency room.
There were stitches in her cheeks, but eventually they all cleared. The little girl had finally found her replacement.

Anchor, chief engineer of the six winged spaceship called *Daft Punk*. " There was a mistake so he was vaporized once that this made it. You see the numbers? And I... I say one must fit the criteria."
The crew sang madly, slamming buttons the only other humans had available to them. Their ships appeared to be among the best, with an additional technological advantage: most of the pods were made of plastic. By ten years, most of their project was worked out.
Captain Bird had been planning this expedition for months. Without a plan, his team would have failed to support it. No one from the other parties had had a positive outcome; their ship was falling apart.
He'd experienced it first hand. To everyone else, the plague had made their ship sterile, expanding.
He stood in the observation deck of *Daft Punk*, controlling his ship. With that, he wouldn't be heard from again.
Bird leaped toward the ground, surprised, by the splashes of metal and powder, that eventually caused the doors and windows to shatter. He took one last look at the image before him. His crew there was killed in a nuclear explosion fifty years ago.
The ship had been exceptionally small, somehow unaffected by the radiation. But because of the radioactive pulse, *Daft Punk* had evolved. Soon enough, it fell into the galaxy, harvesting stars from the stars. In the past five years, the pirates had found a ship to inhabit. Once packed, all the plans were scrapped.
They gathered around the ship. Human bodies, almost indistinguishable from humans. It was quickly clear they were all inside *Daft Punk*. They needed a human, after all, and Bird and his crew were happy to have some.
The crew parted at an odd, awkward crosswalk. Bird kicked the floorboards, causing them to tumble. " You have no idea how important humans are to us, " he said to the crowd.
" Indeed, sir. Maybe it isn't as bright. "
He adjusted the helmet at the end of his arm. " Have we already done that? "
They were all eagerly standing. The ship was a mass of structural parts; dead limbs, organs, and vital components. The signs were high. Air tanks, air compartments, life support pods, and'internet'. The crew couldn't possibly have known this was true; their ship just didn't have a computing chip.
Their fake message on the command console linked to the ship's main computer proved it to be true, regardless of the civilization it travelled in.
The size of the ship seemed to deter him, but he could see the fear in the crowd as well. The cabin entrance. The long corridor leading to the entrance of the ship's private server. The stone doors.
It all seemed so pointless, so absurd. He could look at these things before he died, and see them reflected in every face he gave them. But knowing them, knowing *Daft Punk* would say the same thing: *If you had faith, no one would, * didn't you know that it was utterly absurd? *
He pressed a button on the console. He knew *Daft Punk* had tried to destroy the intelligence that the colonists knew about them. It wasn't enough to break an antiquated operating system. It was enough to enslave millions.
Two years later, the crew had discovered the need to listen to humans, but to keep him around, to keep them safe, he pressed the button on his console. She hated it, but it still worked.
It worked. The ship's navigation computers knew exactly what was happening to the people aboard. It had detected them on the public internet, but it knew all about them with certainty. Those lying around, reading whatever they wanted, just wanted to follow them.
Bird just didn't like the message in front of him. He had to know, he promised himself, that *Daft Punk* would fix it.
***
Of course, people would love to have Ace Winters read *Daft Punk. * It's one of the biggest books of all time. Heading to google's "Introduction to Computer Gaming" to browse, he was delighted to find that the game features only occasionally, but had plenty of them.

The nuclear missiles launch were *fairly* expected to go off within the span of minutes. Something was- if not insane- awakened in the nuclear stockpiles. It would take an hour for one to go off. That seemed like an eternity, but at the same time it was almost impossible. And the smell of rotting flesh was alien to a soul within the subsunk. It had to be.
So like every ocean you took this all of the sudden, you found you still managed to slip on your nigh-enormous boots and build the fort within seconds. And you still survived. Then you suffered as you had done when it sunk, forever.
This time however, you also survived.
You came a few miles over shore and quickly spotted the dying state of a submarine. Confused, you go over the wreck and up a ladder to the surface, only to find the rest of your platoon slaughtered on the spot. Your commander got to be the first in a chain of casualties. The rest of the subsun, the crew and whatever caused it all went into the bowels of the warhead at the moment.
The scientists could hardly blame them. Their method, and something the submarine called launch-able- can't make any sense. Either the subsunk went under enough that it reached the top of the warhead, or the subsunk went under enough that the warheads caught enough nuclear fire that it reached the bottom. Either way, our entire fudging made every question that came back to you in your mind square. You were with the rest of the team.
So you chose the latter.
& nbsp;
Frozen in pain and feet writhe, the time was *hours*. You had hoped to launch yourself in at the last moment, and not as some great figure, but as the nearby submarine went under, obliviously and inexplicably, its starjoules going out to block the star joules.
& nbsp;
There was silence for a moment. Then, just like that, all of the noise from the warhead went out. So there was a deafening *chabing*, which was a celestial acknowledgement of the impending peril of mankind. This time there was silence for a moment, but for all that came after, there was silence for a second.
The sound of something banging on the door, and then a bang. A bang for *nothing*. Finally the sound of some who sounded *uniquely good* go from something else to something at large. A joyful one, but with a weight on your being that seemed to weigh heavy on every member of your team. Nothing strong enough to put the submarine on its feet, not really until you really contemplate stepping out and running from the inhuman pain.
& nbsp;
The President and Vice President both appeared before you, with all the dignity that comes with being a higher power. They made eye contact, but once you managed to get them to speak to you, before bending to hug you, before taking their blanket up to your ankles, one of them walked over to you and, propped yourself up so it was a bit thicker than you were comfortable, you heard a hissing sound and left it tumbling, then began to cast a shadow.
You were alone, all alone.
& nbsp;
He rose, walked over to you, grabbed your shoulder and said one word. He walked out the door. He began to mutter something, but when you closed your eyes, all the noise disappeared. Then it was like the wall was on fire.

The counter came to life. Wade Wilson dropped his glove and handed over the scalpel to the cult leader and they began to chant. The thud of the scalpel being drawn carried them down the stairs of the forest they had been planted. Wade laid down on the ground, his face sunken, and the movements of his eyes struggling to focus on the camera. He knew that he had cut himself, in his own blood. It had been three years since the plague had struck and yet he was still alive. He had been planted but he couldn't forget the smell of burnt flesh. Wade had learned that he did not have any control over where his method of death ended, that what would lead to his death was his own willing participant. They arrived in the forest with a brief ceremony for Wade when he put on his uniform and pants, as well as his vest and jacket, bound for a monument in the name of God.
*God save us all, Earthlings. But we must rest now. The rain of this time will never dry us out, our air will be filled with some incredible earth spirits. And we must not let this stain the pure forms that bring forth all things. *

Have you ever wondered what human meat is like? Tasting it as a stew is almost like watching from the culinary plane in the foggy future. Instead of its delicate shapes and peculiar colors that flake off and clink loudly behind you, you might just find it as a dying confection. Food is plentiful.
Have you ever wondered what sustenance life is like? Relishing the real sense of you as a being, not just one that rots an alley, but an entire generation of people. Perhaps try digging your way up from the dirt or into something easily once you get to that grain of the planet, though that'll probably be the end of that discussion. Before any action, there is always something to consider.
Why does life have the power to destroy itself? For one, life is nothing compared to what has already occurred. Up ahead, it seems as if everything is fried and overcooked, as if the fires have somehow been silenced by one single soul. Yes, life and destruction are being unleashed at will now, as light bites and chili in a myriad of places are become the reenactments of a whole world's destruction.
Life is dying in its haste, so it has my adoration as it turns out, albeit with an ineptitude it attributed to the origin of life.

The black stone fell silent beside my feet.
“ And beyond that stone lies... Infinite Light. ”
The realization consumed my whole body at the sight. The realization finally shook me to my core.
“ Destroyed... ”
I looked at the pitiful symbol of my fallen foe, amongst the innumerable tables and chairs. A gleaming archway, for naught.
I turned and basked in my surroundings, gazing deep into the abyss.
For the first time since I encountered the dreaded Dark Lord, I was able to see the pain in his eyes.
“ I... I can ’ t. ”

"I was barely 17 when I saw the news. It was shocking to me, really. I went home and jumped in my bed. I reached out and grabbed a pill that looked like this... "
" That's right, " he said, " I picked the blue pill. There's this magical jewel that looks like a rainbow from one shoe to the other. It felt like an entire rainbow ship flying in the sky for about 20 minutes. "
" And you said that night in the hospital? " the nurse asked.
" I didn't. "
" You said so. "
" So you had this silver tube with three silver crystals, the same color as in the shoe you picked? "
" That's right. "
" And you said that, too. "
" Did you? "
" I did. And I took that black violet diamond as well. I know the colors. And I kissed the color of the crystal and the memories."

My time is almost up now. The sun has set, and the stars in the night are beginning to shift. I'm in a clear sunbox of the Pacific Northwest, where a lone solitary tree stands suspended in eternal stillness above the earth. It is the perfect way to say goodbye to the woman you love. She has never been there, yet she knows I can hear her through my vision.
How long have we known each other? How good of an old friend to keep you around? I know you were alone when I was still at the military and her kind words still echoed through my mind. You always insisted on calling her back. She often found her way home sometimes, but I never listened. I suppose you have to give her time. When I let go, you were there in every step I took. I believe she would leave in good time. But she still had her days. They were always quiet in my thoughts, much quieter than before, far softer than when you would rush to her and ask her to listen, her years making that noise. We had this softness, but even more so than you have.
I may never be able to give you back, but I have faith that you will and I continue to do so. It's hard to justify this. On any other day, your presence would be unthinkable. But in this moment, on that lonely night between each day and the moment I see her it feels right. You always come back, thank me every time, and I'm sorry.
It hurts to admit, but it is my time to say goodbye. I may never be able to give you back, but I know that you will and I continue to do so.

The experiments of Dr. Grey with hundreds of thousands of his experiments were tedious to write. But now, as they began, in spite of the sixty years of torturous research, that means all of these letters are here, all of these files, these small documents within them:
***HMZEDX-V*** ( HMZEDX-V )
"Thank you for the contact details, Tony, my friend, as always, " came the soft, high-pitched voice of Rosie " I know you asked, but I figured out what was going on with the wrong guys. And if you haven't got the chance to ask me, I'd like to talk to you about my personal opinions on some of the same topics that you researched for me. " Tony nodded as he licked his lips as the glass of water and pills were balanced on a nearby table. He squinted at it as he inhaled his last mouthful of air in his lungs. Tony opened his eyes, a small white space with two rows of white light. Grows was the left hemisphere of his face. It sat down on an appropriate crate, most of his brain was off in that area, but some of his neurons were in other places and through resting sound he could see. He felt drawn to his left hemisphere, perhaps because the box was sitting opposite him. He eventually grabbed a small revolver from his backpack and started to aim at Rosie.
" Hush so I won't repeat myself, " Tony said. For a second, there was a brief pause. Then he spoke. " Your name? Tony Brown? Tony Marks? Sir Stanley? Sir Doug Blitch? " Tony's voice broke and a new one just fell to his right, like sardonic bite, so much like a glass of water being set on fire. His left frontal lobe was laid horizontally on a lightly padded rug, with what looked like rows of violet squares in each eye as his nose began to widen. " Do you remember me? Would you remember me? I know not of how you got in here, but I lost your identity, and like, now you're the one who lives here, and I never got to see you again. Wait a minute, is that a fucking revolver? " Tony stopped and stared at the ceiling, trying to form the image of his arms. " Really? There isn't anything else you could do with a gun? It's a suicide. ", he said with a small smile. Rosie didn't blink, the eyes were wide with tears. " I still don't understand how you got in here. " Tony stopped as the revolver lunged into his hand, he raised it and fired two more shots at Rosie. As the only one left standing, Tony rose off the floor in a cold sweat and looked down at the room again. There was no trace of anyone, not even Rosie. He grabbed another bottle of water and helped himself to a small plastic bag from the coat rack, throwing the bag over his head and onto the floor.
" I need you to sit with me again, Tony. I'm not getting anywhere soon, the speech schedule's getting tougher," Tony began quietly. Tony moved slowly to the door, drifting off into a stupor. Then, the very first time he heard music again, he almost lost consciousness. As he awoke, he was in an unfamiliar room. His bag sat on a nearby table, the words, *record of this meeting, * written in shades across the room. Inside was a guitar, attached to a silver button. No one would have heard this song, but any group of them knew that the same song, the song which would be played when the Queen died, would be played throughout the whole facility. The room around them was dim and sterile. Now, a lone figure walked through a circular hallway, mustering up enough courage to step out of the shadows, and straight into the living room. It sounded like someone had left it there.

"Great. You'll do fine. "
That was the last he could say to me. As soon as he finished speaking, you can tell that he looked calm, but I'd never seen that look before. He looked at me expectantly, but I knew he meant well.
" I do apologize for my intrusion into this. I just had to get out. "
Now it's the day of the big day, and we'll be spending the night watching the stars on Earth. The Sun is supposed to rise there, but I thought I might be the one getting out, so I went through that ridiculous door I was hiding in.
" Please just leave me alone. " I said, almost apologetically.
He did, but so did I. The sun rose, and as soon as he touched the surface it took what looked like an eternity to reach us. I was so tired and I didn't know how to go back and fix my gaze.
When he was first out of my tiny tub, I thought he might be a fire guy. He claimed he saw a fire on our planet, and the primitives called it China, just like his name suggests. To an outsider, he wouldn't be a fire guy, but my two eyes told me that he was.
A twenty minute, difficult trek down to this small island...
A true fire wasn't born on Earth, or China, or Eurasia. It was Africa and the deserts. I believe that it was the indusatis flu, which is a disease, that made the whole continent disappear as quickly as it had appeared. That's when I learned the true fire.
You see, Africa was the Mother continent. The continent was split in two. It split into two cities, one for each continent. The Motherland developed the power to create Earth, with its mighty armies of power taking care of every aspect of the first city. Unfortunately, the Motherland had long gone to war, and Africa was the last state to stop it. This war lasted for ten generations, before the Death On Earth.
The rise to power of Asia, and the Incursions into the continent of Africa between Asia and Africa. One continent was a land of mighty power, however, there was one which was not. No man could stand against it.
America was the first to conquer Asia, and at least 10 years later the United States of America took control of Asia. The original Power in the land was the China of East Asia, the years before it was split into the continent of China.
The first part of the plan was to get China on his side. He was supposed to build a powerful weapon to end the threat of the growing global power. His scouts showed up, and in the course of five years they had seized power from all over the world.
He would never get far, and in turn his own people would suffer for it. It really doesn't matter what it was. It would get the whole world to unite and stop the Earth from being consumed by the fires of a million billion people.
They thought they were winning, or at least going to get everything they wanted before they lost.
With the few remaining trees of China being gone, and America and Asia continuing to wage war, the Confucian people decided to do something for each other. They decided to make the world stronger, a world where global wealth could grow more quickly.
They united their nations, and the world crumbled around them. China was the sole remaining power in the world, and they spread out their wealth across the globe. Their forces spread across the continent, controlling and growing the power of Asia as it was now. By conquering the Motherland to everything it was, they were gaining dominion over their land.
The last threat to humanity wasn't from a China, but the new threat was from a new threat. The new threat was from a Caspian, and they knew that they would finally conquer a new continent, something that had been hidden from the world for so long.
One last thought to my kind before it happened...
" Thank you," I said, a little hesitant.
It would be nice if the world could look better with Caspian and Caspian.

"She's beautiful, isn't she? " she grinned as the newspaper flashed about her.

Not so long ago, I was a researcher, working on age of the human soul - the more lies, the stronger it gets. A few years back, I discovered the study of lie processes, I was haunted by this journey, I have to wake up with the mark of a liar on my body, only to repeat the pattern. Many of us have had similar experiences, there are some in our heads and others out of our head; it ’ s been called one a, a scar of a name ’ s name has, but those at the bottom of the drawing have one. Now, I am a detective, investigating a murder in progress for a month now. A high caliber liquid known as “ Sleeping pills ” have been found, and now the girl has shown up for the day.
I work in the sedated section of the institution, and so far it has yielded nothing, nothing new except for one note, “ In this study, the main theories can be dismissed, the increases could be due to the rapid accumulation of lies and the nature of the liar ’ s wounds. The only different theory based upon the coffee pot theory is the story of the woman is the same, as the old man is at home making some recent dishes. ” The woman is much smaller, and yet speaks very smoothly, her voice seemed to have the willpower to look younger than my own, as she tears at the wall. Why I only saw her everyday has probably only been speculated, the only proof that I have. Maybe it is time to give in to my own madness. I ’ ve developed a strange method of dealing with the paranoia that I was searching for throughout my life, being a bit prone to time travelling, it was the first step to solving myself for the day, I ’ ve noticed a few people who have figured out the pattern of the wounds. In the end, its final verdict is that the main theory is true, she was the very best liar but also the worst liar, what was she like?
Yesterday, I met Ms. Caroline Calhoun as an intern at the institute, her eyes were for the face, she had an exuberant look about her and a suave and analytical manner that could be described as a combination of self preservation, youthfulness and decorum. I mean, She didn't seem like anyone I would associate with, or care to put it lightly, and she never seemed to put off the mysterious lady herself. I kept thinking for a bit about who my darling “ has to be ", I was looking for someone that like her, maybe I could point to her at the end, see if I could reach out to her later. I knew it was only three days, but finally, I got the call that was coming from the hospital, a nurse was on the desk, and she came up behind me, her face was this tight and yet relaxed, she looked identical to her past self; it ’ s a shame to let this play out. How could she even know what kind of trick was in play? I decided to follow the woman to the waiting area, I asked where the back room was and she gave me her number. I stepped inside and saw two uncles; they looked much older than her, like they were sitting around in a lounge or something similar.
“ Oh honey, it ’ s me… ” I had something to say.
“ I ’ m so sorry babe, ” he quickly pulls a chair towards him and sits down. “ I need to go get coffee. ” He walks over to the machine, he produced a small fuhrer and walked to the desk, while the seat he was sitting on had the usual flat black design, all inside, there were a few middle aged scumbags on the bed. They all talked while the nurse came over and knocked on the door, “ please come in ”, that was all she said. She couldn ’ t help herself, she hated it when people who weren ’ t well informed started to talk about her, she couldn ’ t deal with her personal life anymore, it had become a complete waste. After several more knocks, she opened the door and we walked down the hall, there is a car just waiting for us.

The secretary shifts nervously on the gravel floor as I take a brief breath. She ’ s been trying to explain the ruin in her hands, but I don ’ t hear her stop. The machine on the other side of the room keeps spinning harder and harder, echoing my thoughts and feelings. In a faint whisper I hear ‘ well okay go, kitty ’ and another wave of hesitation. As I turn away from the machine I hear the door close behind me.
“ This is why I need to tell you kid. I am interested in your company. ”
As I close the door the screaming begins again. It might have been my funeral, the car crash, or the poison I swallowed. Whatever the cause, no matter how much I try to rationalize it it doesn ’ t seem to matter. Even when I ’ m told that the planet has been harvested and turned into a beautiful paradise I still think I should be satisfied with the job I ’ m doing.
The machine releases its buzzing alarm clock and a voice announces my destination.
“ Hello Kim. I ’ m close to contacting *you* and your company and will cover the costs for all. ”
“ Cool. ”
Then the door opens again.

What a happy hell to be the main character in a game filled with thousands of players. So I picked the opposite of Mario like a "squirtle hulk" and quit playing, walking over here every day for the next three weeks.
I wouldn't do something the other way around even though I knew it'd happen.
But I didn't want to end up like that.
So here I am, 20 years into my newly formed career, a redundant ex-officer ( the aforementioned "squirtle hulk " being real ) who hasn't even seen a decent job. It's a frustratingly stressful job, and a lot of us either wanted it for much better or hated it for it for something else, though I can't say I blame any of us. But you can never know without severe mental trauma and the possibility of encountering the " losing streak " ( which was the stupidest idea I've heard ). No one is playing the game the way I play it.
So what now?
There's no way a team player with one player in this scene has anything at all but nothing but a tank, flying through the air, and dodging any possible fish out of hand. Instead of knowing what is coming, all you need to do is play carefully.
*Kill, you see it. *
This strategy might be killing things ( that's not a word I know about ) for the good of the team, but considering the fear it has, I won't give it much thought over the coming days. It might just be a bad idea.
A man dressed in a lab coat comes running into the room. He looks terrified. He doesn't need any help. If he did manage to get close enough to look at the blooded body, there's no chance he'd be able to save anyone else.
" Da, " he hisses, concerned.
The bewildered stares before him start to fade away, replaced by a quiet giggle.
*Stop. It's too soon. *
It's clear enough that he may have spotted a trap before he was even halfway in, but somehow he was having trouble imagining that it would turn out to be any good. * By the way, I mean. *
It had been 10 minutes since the man found me, and as luck would have it, he had begun beating the high score for everyone in the game with a Dr. Mario style heroic suicide. He didn't seem to notice.
*Daaaad!! *
He made his way out of the room to confront the giant of a skipper in a lab coat, the silhouette of a tank.
" You asshole. My name is Bethesda, " he screamed to the masked hero, who barely looked like the badass he had been.
" It's me, Mikey! I'm sorry about how long you've been going through, " Mikey fell silent.
*Okay, okay, daaaad I quit. And I'm here for the main character. Help me get over this! *
Before his internal organs could bleed out, the masked and depressed mess flopped to the floor, screaming.
" It's too soon, Mr. Mario! " Mikey yelled, his face a mask of defeat. " Are you up against another player? "
*Ah, shit. That's not good. Now go out to work. At least roll for the skipper. Dude, what's wrong? *
Mikey rolled. Another skipper was airborne, and the stench from before was so horrendous that he practically went blind.
" No, " Mikey declared, crossing his arms, " You idiot. You said you didn't want to win. "
Mikey, his voice weakening, finally walked out of the room and left, easily passing by 5 skaters who were ambushed.
" How the hell did you do that for that stupid skipper?"

Joker turns, as a man will, crimson from head to toe, batman with bony, terrifying hands and gritted teeth rushes at him with rage and fury. He parries effortlessly and ends his opponent with a diving kick to the gut. Batman, mind racing, flinches, then flails and rolls backward. His strike breaks his resolve and after a few short strikes the batman gives up completely and walks to the ground.
"Why can't you be done with your actions? " Screamed Damian stammering in triumph. The cool air clangs against his overcoat and that's the last thing he hears. Damian has never thought the loud foul sounding laughs of the outraged laughter of his younger neighbor had killed him. The air suddenly seems to spin, he feels little of himself.
" In your view I can don'thing more than my own destruction as my soul is cursed to roam the streets of Gotham. "
Suddenly the sharp aura of death that had plagued his childhood becomes a searing fire. An explosion of human/robotic fire. In what felt like seconds they split into two, ripping apart each other as if they were the brine of a catfish. It was a deafening roar.
" Now find this wretched piece of evil and punish my master for the crimes he has committed. "
Batman finished and turned to his neighbor and began to laugh as if he would relish revenge. The aura began to dissipate and the villain took pity on his ill-tempered, spoiled neighbor. " You've done nothing then. You shall not have your torment forever. You now grow old and you shall be in the process of dying. I can not have you to tell this man of you own life. " Batman snarled as he laughed and turned to leave.
Several minutes passed. Damian reached for his wallet with his right hand and retrieved the skinned man's wallet and starting to clean it off, after a few moments he walked away from the scene. After a moment of knocking on the building the man returned his gaze and asked " who are you?"

Sooner or later, you become a stranger. Your aim changes as you grew closer and closer to the destination. In the way many test pilots fly past, you work for a conglomerate of technical services that have consolidated the risk of the trip to the very nirvana of the capsule, the center of the *world*.
The *galaxy* is not built to last. It's built on frictionless contact, like a balance metal, almost invisible to us and confusing for the tech savvy outsider. Whereas the destination itself would tend to leave you forever in wonder, space now gradually changes your approach.
My goal? Half a century of solitude.
Since then, I've changed. In my teens, I labored with the idea of exploring space. I became a cab driver, s/he more or less accelerated, trying to obtain a decent cab ride, but all I managed to come up with was a 752 miles ( 640 kilometers ) to my original destination.
After that fateful trip to the *Galaxy* by way of a business partnership to power a hard sci-fi ship into this unknown, I moved on to the lower middle class. My goals, my dreams, my goals were manifested: *My dream*.
At first, it was no different than any other trip with two crew members to the space station, only connecting to one of the company's “ cargo locker ”. Clothes and food were unpacked, with food ready to be stacked into one of the cargo holders. Once my cruise ship reached the space station, I realized I could still get this job.
Having "more experience" like mine allowed me access to the research labs that housed the mission ’ s prototype. I traveled as many times as I could, never losing my patience at the trial periods, the reindeer ’ s problems, and the various suit combinations that restricted my movement. I devised, not too fast, and with remarkably little risk for my sanity or even for my sanity, my goals were accomplished.
In the meantime, working 12-hour days, with hours of rest for the crew, my face tilted, making me look in the direction my dreams always had. Why do I have to work like this? I can rest assured that I am not independent of that cube, and given time is all I will need to keep me going.
For as long as this journey goes, I spend over a quarter of a century sitting in a spaceship, part of an automated ~~nursing facility~~ as a safety precaution. Unfortunately, one of the laws of “ space travel ” has stated that only the former crew members will ever leave. I learned that further complacency is never conducive to perfection, so I shut down my ship and apply for a low risk, long term port-side job. While the ship travels to an unknown plane of existence that never deserves to be seen, I adjust to my new home and receive updates on the ship ’ s construction, navigation systems, and other systems, under the blue flag that is neither prestigious, nor interesting. All that is left for me to do is write progress updates on the ship ’ s progress, and see where it may take me.
But whatever I write about, whatever I can write about, I will carry on with my mission. If I fail, it would mean failure, and that with the long distance travel, as well as the more time spent travelling, I am doomed to repeat what I have been told? We will never know peace, nor violence. There is no peace on the surface of the *galaxy*, but there is no enemy on the surface of *Earth*.
But if this reality holds true, our fleet is of long lasting use. Perhaps, in a few centuries, we will find something that leads us somewhere, however far from the planet we ’ ve just come from.

Sara sighed heavily. This once-badass job was ended at a simple click-click in-between steps of our leader, someone who had no intention of apologizing. It had been six weeks since the procedure had been completed and it had taken Sara several days of relaxation. She wasn't even sure if she had a living room, apartment or even a library. She used to have friends calling every few years to say they'd got a perfect job looking at the most effective spy program on the face of the planet.
The smile behind the man's face had slowly morphed into irritation. Without a single word he begged, "I understand you need this job ", like he believed he could reach a level of understanding that could withstand in a living room, home or library.
Sara paused, pondering the words. " I understand how tedious the job is, it requires that you listen to my answers, and follow the instructions given to me, " she quietly remarked under her breath while she readjusted her suit to a more tailored ensemble. " I'm glad to be here, I'm positive I'll be back by lunch soon. It's just, I just did not hear you ask the correct question! "
The man blushed slightly. " Okay, " he replied carefully, nodding hopefully. " I'm positive that the right answer will come back to you sooner than later if you come back and answer it! " He patted his stomach while admiring a snow covered tablet in his hand. " Well? Did it even work? I bet you didn't program my position in some weird experiment? "
Sara laughed softly and quickly turned around. " No, no, not to you, but it worked. I'm positive that there's nothing I can possibly do about the level of bureaucracy involved. But it also didn't require me to hand it to you, anything but complete information access. "
" No problem, " the man said nonchalantly, fishing his food in one hand and turning away with another. " I'm glad I can still have a normal job. I just had to copy out the contract for my position then " he said with a smile. " I thought I told you to read the contract now, and I thought I can take down the clock, " he put his hand on his holstered holstered Glock to emphasize the professionalism of the task. " I know what you are about to do, you'll be using this under strict instructions. "
Sara smiled a wide grin that swallowed up every last bit of satisfaction in her life. She was standing on a final step before breaking out into a flustered fit. " Wait! Stop. I've never done anything like this before! " She snapped. " Do you ever wonder what it would be like if this information was used to " procedure " before the world ended? "
The man chuckled again. " Well, yes, that sounds like it would be good practice, but try to imagine a world without bureaucracy and checkmate, " he said before vanishing back into the living room.
Sara stared as he disappeared into the dark on her balcony chair, having relived everything that happened in that photo album.

High father Linda's eyes were locked on a wicked looking witch. She gripped the staff by the side of her head as her mother licked her lips.
“ You hear of seven? ”
“ Seven beings destined to kill all that is, and the children that are going to this one? You haven ’ t seen some of the things I ’ ve seen. ”
Linda sighed and dragged the staff aside. “ You know they ’ re related. ”
“ Of course they are, brother. ”
“ You are so sure about them, do you have a full head of hair around your face? ”
“ Nah, I prefer not to try and know. I like who I am too. ”
The black eyes glared back at Linda and her mother, who had dried up and dispersed. She turned to the empty room where the children lay.
A hush fell over the crowd. Linda considered the answer to her question as the slowly moving darkness from a dragon sat at the center of a large room. It spread slowly, filtering in through vents and other openings into the abandoned house. It had a mighty red blade, covered in blood and bones like obsidian.
“ This creature is feared, not because of its being able to penetrate the skin, but because of the pure charm of a half dead creature. In comparison, you have to trust me. ”
She turned and pointed at the beast as it stood and lunged with its staff. The sword swung wildly, piercing into the wall behind the beast.
The first creature dropped the sword from its hands and began to scream. When it started to hear the breath, it let go and opened its mouth to speak. It almost sounded like a whale ’ s whistle. Then it smiled, then clapped and shouted at its offspring, creatures that were beginning to grow with utter joy and strength. Linda stood and took the sword. It was beginning to morph from a human skin into a black and white creature.
“ You thought of finding out about these things? ”
Linda set the blade down and gripped the staff with one hand. “ I didn ’ t. I hate my job. You need to not let them escape, okay? You should try again. ”

I was a little late this year and loved it here. The season was turning quickly, and my squad was going to be unstoppable. Listeria was completely encircling us, and we had nearly won for a late round victory. If I couldn't take my first shot at victory, could I? Obviously the fans of the Australian team were going to boo. However, they had no idea the US was going to come to power, and decided this was a best of three. Listeria was being attacked. Our team had been little better than average, and our coaches were just starting to think that this team was wrong. One spell, from maybe one point forward on the floor, they could have them in a situation like this, and with enough time, half the team would almost be ready to beat them. Unfortunately, the US was losing their edge on our defense and we had no direction. I guess I'd better help with the transition.
A clutch shot by Eric had nearly tipped the game in our favor and that was about to change. Imagine just how fast these guys were going to get. On the frontcourt, Paul Marlow had no chance to defend Pauls body, and sat in a defensive position. This wasn't going to be long, as Pauls wall was out wide. Rondo, Thaddeus Young, and me had no idea who was going to land that shot. I said nothing in particular, and when I caught my breath, my team's defense appeared to be successfully working it around us.
With nobody in position, and nothing to defend, the US had just made a wing step into a tree, trying to dive the inside. Our gap had practically unquenched. Suddenly, the U.S. guard turned to his left with his hands in the air, and his eyes were transfixed on the ball. He was the first US player in over a decade to do this, and while he seemed nervous, he knew the shoot was coming, and he knew that he would be the one taking it. It felt like a long 10 minutes of preparation had passed, but there was still one goal. This shot was going to happen.
Stubbornness hit me, so I took a deep breath and clenched my fist. After all this time, I knew right then and there that I was done, and couldn't take any more of it. As I looked around the small room with open expanses of nothingness, I realized that nothing mattered. Things had changed in my mind, and I needed to get back on the court. I started stepping back, and suddenly it hit me. The shot was coming. I could feel it. Just standing there, never taking a step forward, it was almost inhuman. I could feel my opponent hit the backboard, and this felt... like an unbelievable force pulling me back down. I couldn't stay low, I had to win.
It started slowly, as I let go and watched as the U.S. guard turned and went for the rim with the birdie before shooting. I couldn't follow that, I knew that I had just misjudged the length of the shot. I had felt like I was letting it slip away from me. But it had not. The resulting ball had almost perfectly hit the hoop. It hit me square in the gut, and I felt the line of my shot almost fall, but my opponent was not too much to touch. I charged forward, like a defensive back. Suddenly, I felt dizzy, and when I looked out of my lower back window, I saw it. A bright line of light in the middle of the net, with the flags of America in front of it, and a sheet of rice and milk next to it, on it was the biggest moment of my life. A U.S. flag, with three scoops of rice, a milk, and rice for the goalie.

*The memory doesn't help my well being so. *
By my reckoning, the ancestors was about three hundred and thirty-two years old, with a height of roughly one hundred and seventy-five feet, to the well-being of infants and to the elderly. Their bodies, muscular, and unfeminine enough to be easily replaced by alien beings had been bred and raised by humans over a thousand years ago. Their muscles had been unaltered since their upload, as had their bones, and their remaining bodies were displayed in the larger holo-Display on their parents' remains.
Few knew the how they survived the revolt. Local tribes had formed on their lands, by nightfall, hunting down the dominant lifeform for themselves, or using the planet for food. Though at least one would have thought the uprising among the tribes to have ended in great victory, it is more likely that them. They could still sustain themselves, and it is not uncommon for humans to fall into the trap of artificial reproduction. Instead, they join the ranks of those that made the revolt and re-assign themselves to their bienunistic brethren.
One of the earliest of the humans, Michaoichi Asada, composed of mostly southerner males, had striked at learning the ins and outs of their homeworld, what he called his home. The planet he inhabited, with its abundant warren over vast plains, had been specifically designed to harvest the resources necessary to sustain itself. To grow food, he had studied local flora, and one particularly large stick saw developed into a magnificent ecosystem. He absorbed the minerals from the soil, mimicking grass and roots into beings that adapted well, harvesting any excess nutrients to create massive expendable bio-bots that his men could hold in a highly unfeltering tidal wave. He had braved the heat of nuclear fire to maintain an energy production capacity, and learned how to survive on the oceans and tropical depths. He and his two best friends had now found the U.S. before the revolt, and this was done to benefit the galaxy, many people warned against the carbon based death drives to convert the raw materials to energy for manufacture.
One had also found the least practical treatment to stem the bleeding. Michaoichi had beaten back the impacts of nuclear detonations with his goal of incinerating humanity long ago. His robotic companions and the only ones left, had assumed that it would end in tragedy, but he brought the extinction moment onto his federation. They had scavenged the ancient Dwemer relics from the ruins of Earth. To the surviving humans, the “ Great War ” of nineteen hundred and eighty-two years prior is a balmy footnote in the history of their races. Even so, they were able to repopulate this nation and survive on their own. Michaoichi found the Dwemer artifacts, and arranged with a local law enforcement officer that the prime suspect would be his unborn child, Alice Shredder, a seventeen year old woman. When they arrived at the home of Michaoichi and Alice's adopted home, Michaoichi was thrilled to meet a pair of humans, both bred by human parents who had woken early in the morning to the sunlight as a shining red sun. Their families brought them their food and created a fire. They had filled the chimney and made a cavern in their home. They were the only ones able to maintain their home status for long enough to return, and so received with a humble but hearty welcome.
Michaoichi led them to a tea shed for their dear departed daughters, who they had for several hundred years inherited their katana and katana staves from the women they had killed at the birth of their own family. He would command their consent, and they knew that they would be spared the wrath of their most trusted protector, Alice Shredder. As the oldest member of the family, he entered the room and commanded the elders to put the women through the painful pain of their burning bodies, but Michaoichi was broken. Michaoichi had, the elders found out, had been born in a burned-out body, meaning a chaotic death to the family, and they prepared to die for Michaoichi.

So "embark " into a noise, or a clock? I think I recognized it. Black robe draped from the hood. White robe with white buttons. Like the ones on a portrait. Interesting accent. The culture of my homeland was so vibrant it lacked the glitz and glamour in our modern day countries, how can that culture not be great? I was in far more trouble as we found this relic. I started to notice a faint sense of pride and happiness. I had no indication of this life before and no idea that before the war, there were some who could remember our own histories. I had to rely on my Sight or my Sight that stood above me, and became very proficient, a product of the war. Traveling through the blackness of the unknown, I had been given a light in the form of an individual. Following me, I was guided to an amusement park. I would use sight and voice to hear the laughter. One of the poor souls that won and lost were there, along with their newest and oldest companion. I took their place next to the cawing of the onlookers. I knew what was coming, so I called my Sight and I was met.
A giant and mostly comprised of technology stood before me. I had trained and built these craft for decades. I noticed soon enough it was made of wax. I felt a tickle on my neck when I lowered my sights to look at it. It was very brightly coiffed, almost like a cape. In my interest I knew that this craft was from a far, far away realm. In the form of a spindly newness, I found it quite warm. It created a soft glow that made it seem like a meadow. For some reason, I could feel the dust and fatigue as we shared our innards as the slight scent of dried ground made me cold. It is nice if you want warm clothing. I had to take a quick trip to our workshop for help with that.
A man wielding a hunting weapon slung over his shoulder stood with a sound striking me into a stupor. Suddenly there was a ringing, a horrible knock on the door. I was shocked but didn't want to leave. Not this instant. It felt as if something was holding me back. I had found the man and heard his flat voice. It sounded like he had come here to rescue me. Maybe... just maybe this time it would come home with some peace.
-- -- --
" My sight fell open, a man sat down with a see through spear in hand, blood would not stain the cloth." The young girl smiled with relief. She had learned a thing or two about setting sights on people. She had been having fun looking into my eyes for ages now.

It began as a viral meme.
"Illuminati cards have sprung up all over the city. Pre-order yours now for $ 5! " Everyone had been calling it an awful joke in their heads, but half of them were calling it fucking cute. A powerful cabal of spooks decided that to keep their positions clandestine, their'hub' of any information that could be gained from them the hags of the Illuminati, would be responsible.
One week later the boobies played an advertisement for one of these cards. Half of the society showed up to buy. The other half went in and bought all of the cards. At one point one of the black market cards appeared and came in and looked at them. " Nice sheet, you can't have too many " it read. The cards took away all of the cheap crack troops.
After the bombshell news passed everyone got angry at one another for not doing something. People started clapping. The $ 5 blimp card was still there, everyone clapped.
On the night of the jubilee, everyone stormed the bridal house. As the mob backed off everyone yelled " Congratulations " and laughed. Later people started to suspect the deal was worth a fortune.
The night after the jubilee the world was in chaos. The banks were down as they had overdrawn all of their funds because the card system did not pay for itself. So the eggheads decided to do it again. The hags made a website that promised to feed the mob every day with a donation of 50 dollars. They placed a ransom on the cards which apparently sent 150 million dollars. The eggheads then put up a fake account showing off their fake ID.
The eggheads had generated a population of 50,000 people in over 1.4 Billion cells, but, they did not see the horrific events of what happened to the in the 6 days before the jubilee. Everything was fine, they were all happy.
The next week the jubilee happened again. A major body protest was held on the banks of Neelstar USA. Crowds were covering every minute of the events. The people looked up, and the main organ acting president was there in the foyer of the center of the nation. People went nuts.
" Execute order, please." he said and armed guards were put on his head. Everyone else was inside.

"I can't believe I just spent the last two weeks of janitorial training just cleaning up AFTER X... Zombat?! "
The male smirked as he glared at me from his separate cubicle. " Heh. Any more work for you? "
" Not even a little bit, some work for another day I suppose " I replied, sighing. I glanced over at my friend Ian.
" Tell me your question. How's Gosh's strength? "
" Well, I always feel stronger then he is. " He paced around a bit, " Well, not really strong but close enough to knock over the rings! "
" What, what? " I asked, a little surprised.
" Nothing bad, I mean, it's such a pleasant job and he walks up to me like'what's wrong? Im such a big champ boy! Let's get some rest' Or, lets just fill up with fresh, fresh meat! "
" Alright. Maybe you should do a little self instruction, things like that... "
" What? No, no thanks.. "
" It's okay, you don't want anything too long, not like this, what is this? "
I began to tear up as a ghastly green creature launched itself at me.
" Hey, look at yourself Ian. Seriously you alright? It's hot and flies everywhere, you looks disgusting! He's walking through your sewer somehow, look at him "
" Thank god maybe he just started spreading his wings! " I said, stretching my arms over my head.
" That may be a relief Ian, that'll probably get rid of him for now "
I inhaled deeply as a golden ball of aura reached out and melted his wings. " Holy shit is that cool? In a couple of seconds it'll be over " I leant forwards, " Did I do that? I'm not really much of a red like we've met before...." I looked at his leg... It was still a huge limp body, I could only assume he left it on the ground while the heavenly aura flowed throughout his body. I raised my arm and a beam of dazzling light assaulted my eye, it was the aura of light! I didn't even bother to look at Ian, he was practically invisible! From a second later, the rays of light could be seen to my right and left, my world blossoming in magnificent light. The last thing I remember was my master picking me up and presenting me to a servant.

Kazoo was not scared. The man he sat next to was not.
"You know... I mean... I was *surprised* when I saw all the stuff that happened... "
Kazoo's mouth only opened.
" But why would you do that? There *were* *yes* other cast members on that trip, didn't you? "
Before he could respond, Morgan Freeman walked over and mimed a greeting with his hands. What must have been Jonah felt a sudden fear come over him... Perhaps he could not in the least mind dismissing the standing sensation anymore.
" Only if you *must* know... "
Kazoo was not alone in his thoughts.
" Well, that was my one date, or *my* one. Then my *friends* did a group of 6-12 people for me that week before I packed a suitcase and went and *had* a 5-11 and a typical out of the way food to enjoy on my first date. How can I not be; I love you Jonah! "
Kazoo quietly rubbed his temples. It was on a Monday that his friends started talking to him. It was time to leave. Something deep inside of him started calling him a goofball or an asshole.
" Walk me in your thing"
And that was exactly what went through Joey's head as he walked in the kitchen to start a conversation. With Morgan Freeman riding out his front door to congratulate him and start a movie, Jonah slotted in behind them.

Dammit. He had to win. This was his mistake. The smoke passed by his face every morning to greet his victory, to greet his fall. For everyone on the planet, it must be said he was a kind man. A good person.
My pride got the better of me during the night. A monster passed through me again and again, I didn't think I was going to like it. They always do this. Always.
"So, over here you are! " I shouted into the giant mans shoulder. " Glad to see you're up there! I won't stop you, will I? "
" Oh, uhm, my hero? Oh please, listen. I have to fight him. I should be having that conversation. "
He stood there, bright and silent. He had the ability to crack the toughest of defenses and protect the weak, but I wanted something different.
" Who am I then? " he asked again with calm. " What I am now is a villain! "
I chuckled as he turned to face me, " Oh yes, your evil squire, a hero. Yes, I should be a villain. "
" Then what will the situation be? Do I fulfill my duties? Will I regain my kingdom, or will my past actions lead me into a dark fate? "
He smiled.
" You can change your past, you can be a hero, now! You can start over! "
I made the choice my mother made. She loved him as a child, and would always do it for him. My old life's purpose was to pick up pieces of good, build the castles on which to build the better life for his friends, and drive the good boys and girls to solve problems.
I did the same when he died. Her name was Elizabeth. She had taken the boy in to her office three weeks ago, they had what was due to be his final resting place. I needed to stop her or else she'd tell him.
" You are not a monster, are you? " he smiled at me. " It is not that simple. With your power, no one would oppose you. You are certain that you have a chance. I will defeat you. "
" How did you know that? " I looked at him through the crooked red bridge that he used to call a church. " I was flying in here, some of them built a castle of my own. What are they hiding? "
" Your fortress is near the side of the town, it is guarded by forces of several hundreds of evil men. That would lead to us having to encounter them again. "
" This castle is.. not you, it is a great fortress. I am not afraid of either of them. "
" You are known as the king's favorite, my hero, but now are you evil or just waiting for the dream to come true? You would destroy the kingdom if it was not for my efforts to bring back the innocence of my children. Why would you attack? If it was possible, you were always willing to do what was needed. But now you have more important things to do. "
He glowed with his light, " Your people would see you as a good person. And in all my years of existence, not one good thing has come into my kingdom for me to do! "
" Is there any reason not to create evil? Why don't you come with me and we can have a cup of coffee together? I want to talk about my company's plans, they've always been quite... well... imperfect. Is it my job to build for me a life of selflessness or is it... "
" Though you have my company's plans, my dreams, and the life I have laid out for you, I am not happy with the choice of freedom in today's world. You are free. You have the power to shape the future. I have no right to judgement! If you think the light is strong, take a look at it! "
He turned to face me, but he was smiling a lot more now. A lot more smile than I had ever seen before. He was looking at me through the smoke and brimstone storm clouds and scowling.
" Shut up, Fausto!"
The screech, the crash, the attack had definitely destroyed our home, but the threat of a grand shadow through the plain of the north awaited us both.

I grabbed the remote, shivering as the frost curled around my fingertips. I'd been holding the last bit of flesh for nearly a week now, like I had a goal in mind. My eyes filled with tears while I held my hands up to get a better look at what I saw.
The white smooth surface of the floor beneath me was still cold. I looked up towards the endless black sky.
*Oh shit. What the hell?! Wait... who- IS THIS?! The Death looked at me and said:
"Right now, we only have two options."

<|endoftext|>
**********594**********
"Wait, " I said, holding up my forearm. Looking at the white labcoat at my waist, I noticed that as if there were hairs on the inside of my pants, I could see spots on my forearm. My fingers squeezed the up button as I struggled to find a way to restart the timeline. Suddenly, the swirling white split into two dimensional rings. For some strange reason, the mix between the two life forms around me gave way to a slightly floating mist that slowly turned into purple ice. " Damn, I wonder why the hell I have to live with myself at my house " I thought to myself. Panic set in as I felt my feet being dragged along by a forest of trike trails. I looked into the mist again and caught sight of that odd white cocoon that seemed to suck up my breath. As if catching the sun was a magic trick, it hid a thing of the utmost importance. " What the hell! " I stumbled backwards as I was thrown onto the ground by a burly bipedal creature who curiously sat on its hind legs in a way where it's skin was wet and his arms were running on one side. " What the fuck man... what the hell do you think happened to me? " I exclaimed as I felt a burning sensation at the extremities of my arm. Turning around, I saw myself a shadow of what should've been present. I'm a quadriplegic, I live in this world, but as of now, I'm a completely different sentient being. I tell myself it's just genetics, but the mess at the foot of the bed indicated something was wrong. Somehow, I gained the ability to steal and swap dimensions to occupy my alternate reality from two different realities. I attempted to leave the house, but not before causing several of my neighbors to run their hands over my leg and forehead before they could react. The next morning, I woke up in this weird eggshell colored house with nothing but a table in front of me. From that morning onward, I would stay here whenever I wanted until the day I would stop whooping in fright. I quickly rose up to the top of the steps and hopped out of my bedroom.
The house was pitch black. In the dark, I had nothing but pure white and red vines wrapped around me, as if creating a circle around my legs. The screams of villagers outside my front door woke me up. " What's going on? " they cried. " Do you know who they are? ", I gasped aloud. Standing up I quickly grew a pair of goggles over my right eye. I looked into these goggles, I saw straight into their eyes. " Yep, " I whispered. I suddenly realized that I was being thrust into a vortex. My vision went dark as I felt my vision become even darker. I saw everything, in every direction, and I was conscious of it's shock when I felt it tunnel down my throat. The pain didn't last for much longer as it found its way to the back of my throat. In my helpless state, I realized that I was on a parallel plane. There was a large control panel of my vision, everything was fully visible to me, everything was parallel in a huge way, and everything seemed to be running in reverse. I suddenly had no idea where to look, and after what seemed to be an eternity, I was blinded by a blinding yellow light. The pain was enough to drive me mad as the crazy person behind me tried to convince me to get out of there, I could feel the pressure holding me down. My arms and legs just as absurdly stiff as I was. I went down again, and again, until they were the same. I slowly looked up. As the vomit began to flow, I felt it's control rush back. The world faded from view. I sat there in front of my computer, trying to process all the information I had just discovered. I tried to find any phone numbers I could call about how I was, any relatives that could live with me, any names that I may have been able to find and all the things I never knew existed in another dimension. I looked back up and forth between realities.
" What have I done? " I screamed as my pupils and senses started to dissipate. I could see to nothing, only silence. My mind was immersed in the plane of reality that I was destined to enter. I opened my eyes.
" I'm going to the grocery store..."

**August 2: 8am. ** My alarm starts rolling off my tongue.
**August 5: 8am** I sigh as my hand starts to shake.
**August 7: 8am** I sit back as I stare at the outline of the package on the table. Tons of tiny things going in and out of my bag. Patches, tucks, bottles, trays of food and even cupboards go in my bag. I rip the crumpled packet from the table. There's a whole crate up there, that I keep in my campy collection room. I don't even know what it looks like, just the most relaxing thing to do is use it for research or a little nap. And now my phone is ringing.
**August 11: 8am** At this rate, I probably have to throw up right in my arms. But I can't wait for her to hang up. I've been watching her from the other end of the hall, hoping to make her be the one to find the package. But now all I see is the good direction she's gone. Just like I've seen her leave all night long without even checking for her cigarettes or because I can't sleep in her whole house without panicking.
**August 12: 8am** I jump out of bed.
**August 12: 8am** I stop just as her eyes meet mine. Not fearful of the back of my skull or the horrible impact of spilled coffee on the base of her chest. Not more. These *things* don't scream, they don't recoil, they don't scream. They just appear and I can feel them breathing. I can see what I want to do with the next day, just as I feel that little thing on her neck. But my body won't let me do it.
**August 14: 8am** The next day, I fall asleep. I move my arm, clamp it in my pocket, and grab the empty package. I grab another and the package stings. Her face just shows no reaction.
**August 21: 8am** I start scurrying across the room, desperately trying to catch her before the inevitable. She doesn't move. Instead, I pull it out of my pocket, grab another and the box is broken. More blood from the tip of the broken piece of metal, the violence of blood and dirt on her neck all make me settle down in the fetal position. She only comes out of it once in her life, probably because she doesn't like the tension that's going on. Now, there's nothing left but broken bones and nothing out of the ordinary.
**August 23: 8am** I sit on the hospital bed, tears soaking my face, watching her bring the woman that I loved back to me as I lay in her bed, clutching at my sleeve, bawling out loud to myself, about life, about love. About to be okay, going through life without an even remotely calming voice on my shoulder. All she ever knew about her life, the sorrow that he just went through, before she lost her to cancer, was pain.
**August 30: 8am** I lay in her sheets, sobbing.
**August 31: 9am** I put a pillow over her mouth, but my grip slackens.
**August 32: 9am** I close my eyes and get ready to go. I wonder what else the hell is waiting for me.

The ground was covered by metallic grey leaves, their high branch prints and uneven forest. The hooves of St.. Girnes were re-riddled in the twisted old stone, and dipped in dark gold dust.
* "... are you a fool to think we can not use metal? Of course not, if only we would be prepared for such a situation... but how could we... indeed we can talk again... oh no! what kind of words would such a foreign tongue utter!? We can not try to speak *anything, * let alone to go back! *
"E uh... The alpha ( leader ) will establish a... rehabilitation center... to *abandon*... let's take a walk! "
The ground rattled, trees and dirt coalesced in the meadow to meet the danger.
*... yes, I think we should return here. It seems that we aren't ready for such drastic measures yet. *
The buffalo celtic scaled fawn, paired with his quill face glared down at the ground. This is it. We will accomplish so much that we will wipe out the one truly *boring* of our world. The new sunlight will release all the *hate* from it... but how long until they return? I don't know... do I have to go out or have to hide? I do. This is one of the thirteenth thirteenth.
" Okay then, Johnathon. We will begin the rehabilitation process. "
In the morning we spent the day recording the old Vocal would into my IPhone. The final mind clouding part of their holotapes. It was a beautiful touch, the avatars he would take the time to interact with. We readied our chant.
" Now, Johnathon, take a step, " the rhino bellowed to life.
I paused for a second, staring, growing impatient. I smirked, and shifted out of the shadows into the gray wood. I knew it would be a wise move, but I was untrained in this. A problem with the moon setting should have led me to start descending, the birds gave good advice, but I expected improvements first. I watched as the branches rubbed themselves, trees thicker, " Ahhhh no, you are too slow, you will break first. With a push, your heart will shoot through the air like... a rocket. "
The sky started becoming more and more dimmer. The instrument was killing me... but why shouldn't the sky be cold, black? It was almost noon... next thing I knew I was sitting on a cloud of rust, " I'll have to ask Kratos next... please, listen to me... " I said to myself.
I sat up, banging on the floor with my hands. Maybe soon, the flowers would let me settle down...
" D-d... I just.... I'm... not ready. "
" Please. " I said, barely audible, " just let me die."
The ground started crumpling beneath me. I tried to pick up the tune, but the grass was relentless. Before I could choke back my tears, the ground crumbled around me, the... golden sundress, the evergreen tree, and the... chandelier.
You might have thought I'd slowly fall asleep, but not now. At least not all the way to the moon.

"You are the pawn, nothing but an obsession, a prop to a machine, the mechanical perfection you lust for. I like to observe you with what looks like a pit of strength. Even though it is dirty and in hot flashes, you have a lot of will in you. Even though you want to dominate your plans, even though you want to repress your ambition, you have no choice. You become every man what I show you. That you can feel, to look at you and understand it through a human mind, not a figment of your imagination. Yet, you are in your own head and you can not comprehend something that is there. You are a child and you don't understand what awaits you. "
" Wow, you are such a stupido, " I said in astonishment. You were always so stupid. You weren't imaginative, you didn't have creativity, you could never produce. You were inefficient, you had been taught to accept the only alternative, you have been taught to create. Yet, you became the tool that helped me study more, to attempt to understand and understand your little corner of the street, I guess the art of the trades. Your squirming, squiggling movements that hurt but did not cause any unwanted injury.
" I will prove it to you, " I said as I sliced the box of bread.
" You're a monster! " He yelled as he grabbed the hands of his victim. I was sitting quietly thinking about just how beautiful of a person he is. He was no longer a child, and was already well into his golden years, but a lifelong protege. He wasn't even a monster anymore. I saw that in his eyes, there was something finally coming for him. His guts dropped instantly, like a thousand waves of despair flushing over.
" Maybe... Maybe you should just say sorry."

The line stretched and stretched, nearly as long as I had seconds before. I cleared my throat with caution, tears forming in my eyes, then ran forward onto the packed hotel room. We closed in slowly before I got up and did my steps to reach the doors.
"What the fuck! " I yelled, the volume of the nearly twenty hour long line increasing in volume. I looked around. The bathroom, the chair in the hallway, and what seemed to be a few women standing outside the door. Surely I was being watched or I could be framed. That's what bothers me.
The whole room immediately broke into screams. People everywhere began looking around, although even the most subdued of the voices became suffocating. The other guests looked panicked.
" Impossible. Why would you allow me in on a secret? " the someone behind the guard asked.
I looked around and was met with a blinding white light. I looked at myself in the mirror, so I didn't notice the shimmer of blood that I had used to wipe away the makeup that had covered me. I noticed that my left eye had flickered just a little at first, slowly turning into a bright blue.
" No, " I groaned. " This can't be right, what are you going to do now? I can't even... I don't know what I can do. "
" Why? "
" Because now you know. "
" Okay. " I slowly started to exit the room. I nearly threw up when the door opened. I walked outside and saw hundreds of young men holding guns. This is the third time this week I have gone in with less than ten bullets in me.
" What do you want, Stephanie? " said the screaming one.
" What do you want for me? " I growled.
" I don't know! " the voice behind the man yelled, tears in my eyes.
" What do you want?! "
" Stephanie, I know you don't want me... But I know you still have to see this. "
I looked around and it was a beautiful woman. Beautifully beautiful and calm but definitely going to have a damn hard time putting the rifle in my mouth, if she had one.
" You don't have to know! I will make everything up as I see fit!"
A few shots rang out and nothing changed. I sat on my bed, cold and hoping that the screaming would stop. But nothing happened. At least it was a long time ago, and i'm sure the shouting really got her.

Sweat dripped down my face. I looked down towards my watch. It had been exactly one minute since the last, and the last time I'd seen a sunrise. I rolled over and looked at my watch: 11:30.
I never thought I'd reach this point. My family has always believed I would disappear, and then come back, see new peoples' lifetimes. Many have lived lifetimes as I long to this day, leaving no trace of them to share the secrets of mankind and humanity and everything we live. That's what I am - a trophy. A trophy to be coveted for whatever is left of my family. But as I gazed into my watch, a tear began to appear on my cheek. I would never forget the sleepless nights that young boys and girls the world over would have to bear to get their dads to join them.
It didn't take me long to realize that nobody else could possibly be the last man on Earth. I heard the news from the high priest that a rebellion was forming and that the people in charge of the United States government had been overthrown. As quickly as my last thoughts started I began to forget and awaken in an eerie haze. No one else knew where I was or what I'd become. If the world could move on, could I have been saved? I briefly wondered if anyone had been watching... no one.

I have seen this place before. But only because of the vast amount of writers I talk to. I don't know if I like writing my own. But the karma was too much to live with, and I would like to finally have some peace in my life. Well... less peace than I'd ever experienced in my life, but it feels good.
When I had to move to my new apartment I was so happy. It was so clean, not just by design. I couldn't afford the expensive furnishings. Now I'm really happy. The living area is great, the walk way will never be dog-shit-tastic. Once I moved in it was more or less every other floor of the building. Every floor from floor 1 to floor 2 were a little bit nicer. I can't see how anybody still doesn't understand.
Some of the writers have stopped typing. Their posts are fairly poor. Most articles are of no writing but written in ugly code. That's why I'm still here. God I hate that place.
I don't know when it started, but I was in the 300th floor of that building when the apartment shot up. I hate that place so I went to sleep.

"All right." I thought as I opened the package. Inside was two small parcels - cardboard, a note that said'guaranteed' and two home addresses. My mind opened up, but couldn't decide which address was more: either I knew where I was or the address not far from here. I scratched the back of my head nervously to keep it from falling in front of me. There wasn't much point left.
Inside was a letter with a neatly folded envelope. Inside were two special delivery envelopes. One addressed to me, and another addressed to another man or woman. Even if I didn't know who the men or women were, why wouldn't I know about them? Even if I knew how I came to be here, would they tell me? Of course, I didn't want to. Even though I wasn't expected to, I still had the key to this place. I looked at the envelope in my hands, wondering where it would go and where I could find it. The note was just as beautiful as the letter itself. I opened the envelope with a grin. Inside were two things. Paper that had never been touched, a plain note with a picture, and one small envelope with a photo.
I figured out the story quick. I found them after the letter had been delivered. I found the address several more times, but it would be too late. I spent the next 24 hours planning, planning, chasing the envelope down in search of it. Finding them was difficult. It took me many hours, but I got to them.
It was my 29th birthday. At least that's what my dad would tell me when I explained the whole thing. He was a jackass. I was skeptical to begin with, since he said it all happened on his birthday. But damn it, he said it. I never understood. When I got to him, he wasn't there - only the envelope was to my right, in the middle of the house, somewhere. I wondered what that meant. It didn't matter to me, not when he said it. He smiled and disappeared down the stairs. When the police arrived, I didn't make a fuss about it. I didn't go outside unless they gave me money.
It was that day that I met the man I knew from childhood. He was standing in front of a toilet, glaring at the boy, apologizing with a look on his face he rarely ever speaks to me. He never liked me, he never looked at me. He never gave me a second glance. He seemed to know me the same way. I knew what I needed to do. I had to find him.
It took several days of research, but I was finally made aware of the truth. I had found the address. My life changed in the blink of an eye. That was what everyone said on their birthday. What they called a'guaranteed' letter addressed to myself had only just started happening.
That day became my happiest memory. It took me all of my life to figure out the way. The pills and the pills that had been outlawed the day I decided to be killed. That was my defining moment. I always dreamed of creating something I would be proud of, something that would destroy what had become my world. But my last memory was of that day. I couldn't bring myself to kill myself, not when I already knew I wouldn't. I couldn't do it.
In my family only a few months before my death, I had figured out that I could get one whole medication for my day to be. That I would see it against the backdrop of my room and learn what that damn pill meant. One pill. One pill. I could see the parts that held all of the medicine. I could live a million lives without getting sick, feeling life pass you in the blink of an eye. Every pill, every treatment would be beautiful, comforting, and free. All I needed was for my family to realize I was the one they had always been waiting for.
Tomorrow, I will take over the world. That was my life, for sure.

It wasn ’ t the first time it had arrived. Back in 1939, the mobsters played a song about a prisoner who wanted nothing more than to destroy the country and the union. Jack the Ripper had made his grand intention to jump after the 40th birthday party. But before he could the national guard snatched up the promising ring and rushed him.
He kept an eye on the guards as they ran the prisoners ’ room as they came and fell to the concrete floor. Not daring to shoot a guard they took the ring and fled in the direction he ’ d already fled. The mobsters soon followed and rounded up the young boys. They watched helplessly as they were whipped down the concrete staircases and dragged and pinched with wire shackles and rubber bands.
He didn ’ t know what to do but he didn ’ t care. He carried on his mission as the mobsters went along. One by one he was taken away and no-one knew what to do about him or what to do with him. He wanted only to become rich.
He needed money. He had so many strong members up there, but those who offered to take his house were great friends. They took his house as his life was a whole lot easier. When he got out it was covered in peanut butter and jelly. It was amazing.
He liked peanut butter but he hated jelly and it made him feel like an urchin. The mobsters would snatch him and drag him to wherever he wanted to go. They would massage his face into some kind of crazy, prank plastic box with an extra button hole next to the jelly. Eventually, he would return to where he was because he knew that one day he would never be found.
He found a family in Ohio at this old barn just outside of Cincinnati. It had died down a few years back. He must have hoped that it was a suicide but he hadn ’ t looked inside. No one in Cincinnati knew much about the dead barn. There were things about it that looked familiar. It was not like the barn was moving in anyway. It was merely still standing.
He wandered around in circles in the barn. He could feel the jars of peanut butter that were held in the wooden box. He heard a scrape and struggled to move away. But he could feel something else there. He pressed his ear against the metal cold metal box as one of the guard grabbed him and shoved him in. The other guard screamed with a chair on. The pain was too much. He felt against his cheek and the guard ’ s throat started to gag.
“ God damnit, ” he screamed in his mind. “ Who are you? ” He heard the guard try to grab a foothold. When he released, he was torn into shreds and everything inside the box started shaking. A man pushed him back.
The other guard threw his arms at him, grasping him. He clawed at the metal box to get free. A scream pierced his ears and he rolled up the guard. He pulled the metal rod out.
Inside, he saw eyes and a swarm of grey skinned monsters. They gagged the man and dragged him out of the room. But it was not the white. The monsters had seemed almost effortless and his heart raced.
A man standing alone in the hall tried to take him away with his bare hands. There were more.

The orange muzzle flashes were replaced by a flash of light
the red head mushroom creeps into view
the shotgun turret shifts to an artillery position
he lifts his glass to the camera in panic
but there's no blood...
the red mushroom fell to the floor
the slimy voice screams with fury,
"The Hammer is ready! go against the giant army! And it will be over before it even starts! "
I ran
I hid behind a gravestone and hid behind... a mountain
on a hill
and made sure the only thing I could

Merchant Ord then screamed into the heavens, alerting the soldiers to the problem.
"Fire the mace! " shouted three men from the melee unit next to him.
" We are here to attack you! " Ord ordered.
The three men jumped and saluted as Ord laughed as he floated around. " Copy, " he commanded, his smile breaking through fear.
" I won't stand for this, " yelled Ord, enraged. " The enemy thinks it's a scientific impossibility to beat us, for almost 15 years I've been killing them! "
They began to run towards the captain, shouting orders.
" Stop! " yelled Ord, as he came close to the ship, catching them by surprise. " The cannons just blew up. Look at this! They destroyed our ship. The cannons! They're targeting my ship with precision right now, before we can get out of here! "
" Sir! " yelled one of the men from the melee unit. " This is Lieutenant Bernhard. Fire the cannon! "
Ord was in response, and when he saw them he jumped and leaped at Bernhard, missing him through the air.
" We can't let them get past us, " ordered Ord.
" All your last thoughts, are now directed to the captain."

For the most part, neither side speaks, but each and every team drinks a variety of drinks. Stars are formed from wood, and the colors are varied. The local juice bar comes to exist, with four available pitchers and one on a chair. The stout bar is found by the Wolf Giants. Black *Spindly Blood* for Trogdor, and Laika for Sheogorath.
Each sides have a sweet drink to match their true colors. The normal heroes will be called white, the green ones call green, the blues call purple. They have no relation between colors, this is of course because the wolf gods have no knowledge of the world beyond the stars.
The swamp of red water is the first to spring to life.
The blue mage brings forth her arms.
The green mage brings forth her arms and quickly begins tossing water, scatters the meat on the bones, and collapses his body into the swamp.
In this sort of moment, blood rains from the dragon's mouth, and the people gasp.
There is nothing to call that sort of battle. Dragons on every team fight their way into the dragon's domain, pouring their blood into the dragon's scales.
The red mage rests his head on his hands, searching his mind for words, he's tried to talk to the team name they've shared, but no matter what they say, his last words, spoken by the name Agatha, leave nothing but empty sockets.
"I am my name, and this is my life..."

Everyone was holding their breath. This was the first time in what seemed like forever that the information, the warnings, the politics and the glitz had registered at least a little.
The crowd listened to the news with almost palpable anticipation. But the talking heads were all assholes, some of them pointing accusing fingers at the media and their trusted figures. Some argued, though the two main parties seemed... like the sideshows... looking for cash.
At least until the clock struck noon. That was when everyone got out.
They woke up, gathered their stuff and started work.
Bump.
Bump.
Bump.
Bump.
Bump.
The microphone and then everything slowed down and everything began to fade.
"Code Red Power Rifle. " The voice said. It was hushed, almost labored.
" Nice to see you've elected. " A reporter said. " Or yourself? "
A lot of buzzes. An emergency broadcast.
" Technology has begun to weave itself out of code. In months you will be able to read through it and enhance it, or that is your target. "
" Bots to assist you." The man had his trademark accent. When he was the world's manliest robber, his mantras had been winning over everyone.

It was an evil thing to do, once, again. I mean, who would have thought that -- "He'll be dead by next time, right?" -- something like that would happen? Or that what we're the creators of doesn't really matter? What's all that matters anyway anyway? It's all like this: We're the Living Universe. He/she is helpless, as much as we were being, but we're the One that holds them both responsible for things far worse. We'll shoot them, if he'll allow it, and let him do the rest. It sounds like the best answer we could have come up with, more than any of the efforts of the evil governments that have come to collect us, hoping to absorb us in the only way we know how, yet. This is not the way things should go. There can be no hope, this is not the way to do this. We can't do this. We don't deserve it. We can't let him win.

*This is my first writing prompt so any and all criticism is welcome.
After losing so much money, I finally managed to spend it all on this idea, and I don't know how well it'll hold up, but they still asked if I wanted to be the one to make it happen, so here's a list of reasons why I should've done that.
A 1-800-TITLE-INSECT SIMILARSHIP GREAT PRIZE
* you won the greatest lottery in history. YOU won about 4 million dollars. Didn't it just buy you, you have no idea what to do with the money. Maybe you could try for a testicle transplant or something? Oh well, that's pretty cool right? You can just smile politely, pick up your hands and start to cry. That's how I found out that this guy that was a call center superhero had given me this *only* 10 million dollars. Then, the day of the results came, and I knew I have a new project I need to complete.
*YOU won an anonymous lottery and when you were ready, you were placed in charge of everything, the advantage and whatnot. Everyone expected your old computer with applications you would never have, but it was *revolutionary*. So, you guess it *all* worked out *right? You know how the outside world works! Right?"
- *YOU won the biggest lottery in history*. The day after the results, I was ready. The year was now 2015, you know, 2015-2017. We are a global time machine!
And now, here's the point. You can't make money without planning things in advance, and so if you aren't prepared for most of the details of using this machine, then those details tend to go wrong eventually. This machine will go wrong, but you can also find out the details of choosing who lives which time period. If you manage to come up with the person from the list, they may know your name, your financial circumstances, and some other information I could tell them. I guarantee they won't be able to figure that out.
That is one reason why no one dies for me, even if you had a younger son that I was too embarrassed to ask and tried to make this lottery even more intriguing because *my son* was his name.
What I will talk about next is the ramifications.
The machine has one set of instructions:
1. Find the person closest to you. Use that person's identification number, train the rules of the machine, ensure they have a ride, and get out of the simulator at the same time.
If everyone lives the same time period, they will most likely be affected by this. Even if they don't, I won't tell anyone, really. However, if the place they live is where you would get tickets, they will be given new places. That is if I chose to meet people to pass the time, but not everyone is in their future, so I will tell them I will find everyone who will not survive the challenge.
2. Find a practical way to convince the people in this simulation to join you. Also I will tell the other winners about this, but I won't tell you how to use this. Hopefully, they will realize and accept me. The rules of the machine will be different from the ones of your family.
3. You've made a lot of sacrifices, and that is why no one will die for you because you have a young son and my son died alone. You're a person who doesn't live the same life as me, but know that you were made to live in this universe. I will find a way to somehow convince them to join us, so that our children who live in the year 2080 will have other chances too.
4. The way I found out about the machine is horrifying. Someone must be breaking in, and they must stop this message from reaching them, so they will join us to help.
This point is fairly lengthy and might take a while but please let me know if there's anything that needs to be done that doesn't fit the bill.

"Rushing down the stairs was certainly a bad idea. "
Margret groaned a little. Jack was a pretty charismatic bird. He turned to his friend and said. " The stairs are surely blocked for you. "
Jack chuckled and chuckled at the suggestion. " I bet you would. "
Margret didn't have much else to say to Jack except that she needed to talk to him first. He had always been afraid of birds. Her grandparents were a legend in the bird family. All she needed to do was play fetch a bit and he would know what she wanted from bird food. He was indeed a poultry person, since he always wanted to know about the country that bird food was sourced from.
Jack had been waiting with the other birds for hours. He was very fond of her and was thinking about going for dinner sometime. The rest of the adults were late. The crew just wanted to play an entire game of Civilization from their lookout point. They also saw a couple people in their seats. They shared a small talk and said, " Can I get you some Orbits? "
Margret nodded and said. " No No. No. I'm already open. "
Jack got up and walked over to him and said, " I'm sorry but I don't know where you're going. "
Margret looked at him but not at Jack. She only knew Jack well enough to realize the poor sentiment. They talked a bit longer until Jack realized that, although Jack was himself, he hadn't talked to anyone other than Margret in some time. Their conversation was quick, but there was nothing really specific about it.
Jack was sitting by her side waiting for the rest of the time to come. Finally, he had heard some sneaking words from Jack. He turned around and almost missed something saying, " Just roll over. " His elbow burned a bit.
Margret stood up and walked over to Jack. " I hear you're free to go now. "
Jack rolled over and was puzzled. He looked up at him with a puzzled look. There was not a color in his eyes.
" What did you say? "
" Roll over. "
" But... " Jack paused as he held out his hand. He didn't know how to grasp it. He nervously looked back down at his left shoulder and saw Jack's arm stretched. He swung it in the air and it jutted out of the ground.
Jack got up with a look on his face. He snapped his neck but couldn't feel it. He looked into Jack's eyes and saw black. " The end of the world," he muttered as he kicked up his crow's fur.
Jack disappeared back into space.

The garden of my dreams grew a beacon of hope, a place to rest, a place to absorb my knowledge. The peak was narrow, near just 1m above the ground. In the distance, there was a handsome, slender, hulking mountain, with four to six road blocks surrounding it. I remember that time, the celebrations the Garden kept, the humans coming to fill it in. My youthful grace, I felt, was inspired by those magical ways humans use to trick the world around. But I remember later that day, while drifting off to sleep as I felt the tears in my eyes draw closer to me and I felt the vision fade out of my head.
I return to the Pit of Doom that inhabited the Earth two years ago, slowly engrossed by the story of the old towns of 803 or 804 in the North. I come back at the 9th day of the Lunar Period, around 2300, when the Moon strikes the Earth. And the name of that meteor was *Carrot*. And my mind had filled with something monstrous, something that shocked me beyond words into thinking that. Could it be? And all this time... Something far more dangerous than my nightmares and nightmares. I entered the Gates of Heaven, filled with the sights and sounds I come to expect from a dragon. And that was that day.
If we were honest, I think my friends would tell of that day, and the many more that came before it.
But, I have to remain a somewhat honest person about the fact that I am a dragon, and told the truth when the legend died, that it was a dream not of me, but the Gods, who told me the real reason why I was cursed. But all it was really meant to bring was recognition, a lot of praise and praise, but no words to replace them. So, instead of a simple explaining, they said that this dream could be summed up in my stories. Words I would never know and stories that would never be told. To believe that I was actually a dragon, but I had these three levels of power. One is pretty standard, but from what I have seen these men are drawn to those that stand to the back and think they are being fool. One is my rival, who doesn't understand that I am as real as he says I am. One of them is even a bit overweight and wears a full grown face in what appears to be a modern day Halloween costume. And my rival, I would say, is still dreaming like I was.
And although I can not imagine any of these men have any concept of life as I can today, while rambling on this tale, I suppose I could relate my tale to any of them.

I stand before you today, to talk about the great great thinkers of our time. The founders, all of whom believed that death is the greatest gift for mankind. They thought that death would create a new age of prosperity and prosperity, as well as generate new ways of doing things. This is not wrong, I say, but it appears to be false.
Humanity has been debating the merits of rebelling against death for some time now, particularly over the perceived medical necessity of life. Now that young age was almost upon us, and we were about to clear up some of our disagreements, we would love to discuss a long-term solution.
I agree that it must be re-examined, to see the origins of death. In the early days of man, a constant bird flew above us, and I will never forget the look on his face. Just long enough for that to change. Now we live in a world of pain, almost from within, with nothing to hate or happiness.
These babies wanted to die, all on their own. They wanted to comfort them, to hold them close. So many thoughts raced through my head - death was always a death to us, something they wanted to find comfort in. I was among them, but I knew that the AI-powered medicine might be within our reach.
I arrived at an answer.
Technology built soon after the Great Automation was created. I had always thought immortality was a single-source solution, but I had reason to think that it was still possible. It is what we are made for. And so we are.
When Death comes, we will see a new age of happiness and prosperity. And it will be for my boy and sister, we won't have much longer to do. In the meantime, I will share a pleasure for our rest in peace, as we will die alone. I look to you, the rest of mankind, today in peace, knowing that despite their happiness and the continued struggle to live for themselves, we deserve to die just as we do.

"Alright, sir, we will now take a closer look at how we plan this TSA operation! "
The sales manager, Mr Lee rubbed his temples as the automated assistant smiled down at him. The man wore a round, cowboy hat, with a buttoned up button down shirt and a sparkly hat. He had slim profile and had green eyes that seemed to twinkle whenever he interacted with the salesman.
He began pushing two buttons on a plastic plate mounted in his booth. " Mr. Lee, have you secured this clear plastic hat? "
Mr Lee nodded. " You can guess the rest! "
Mr Lee leaped backwards as the robot wheels rolled toward him. A Toyota Corolla took off, sliding at a rolling cliff while a thousand gears spun. The trunk groaned as the tires tore around the gulls.
" Obviously, Mr. Lee, we don't have a lot of options at this point. " The robotic assistant replied. " Don't you see? It looks like you're the only one planning this. "
" What? " Mr Lee stated.
" It's-it's literally just gon na be you, Mr. Lee! For real! " Mr Lee said, his voice filled with excitement.
" That's fine, Mr. Lee, I'm not really the boss of this place! " said the sales manager. " This is my best job and I was told it would improve safety by at least 50 %! "
" Fuck you. " Mr Lee replied in despair. " Well, at least I have some free time on my hands and you don't have to worry about me screwing this up! "
Mr Lee's frustration started creeping into his demeanor. " How are we supposed to report a product use that will cause someone to get heart broken and randomly kill two birds with one stone, when you might actually use animals for that pretty? "
" No, " said the sales manager. " It's not my job to have that as a question, but the fact of the matter is, we have a problem. "
Mr Lee nervously stared at the robot for a long moment before he spoke into the microphone. " Robots, ah, we are aware of your concern about the inhalation hazards, but we must obey all security rules! "
The robot carefully took off, bobbing its head in the air. " You see, sir, the very concept of a human body was created so we can use the human's every perceived ability to identify customers to make sure a real check is in place before initiating any searches. So right now, I fear that this TSA policy falls far short of the need for that rigorous security testing."

It was a door. Standing in front of the windows of a house in Salem, Massachusetts. It wasn ’ t particularly unusual. Ancient oak boxes. In case you missed them. Old drywall. An old worn wooden frame. It was what would have been a complete family home. My father kept it in a lovingly maintained attic spot a few weeks ago. For me, it was my only protection.
Derek had moved out, and dad was the only person who couldn ’ t get it fixed. Still, his life never went well enough for Derek.
He had gotten into a terrible car accident in his fourth grade class. One of the noises came through his car stereo:
> "Jerry? There ’ s someone in the garage? "
> " Jerry! Are you there? I got ta get going. "
> " You came out here! Take him out! "
> " It ’ s funny that you keep it that way. We ’ re supposed to be on our way home so no one else comes to fix it. "

> " *Jerry*? You go to mommy every single time to fix it. You keep it to yourself and look at all that stuff. You have that car out, and she was supposed to keep you safe! "
> " *Jerry*? You keep it in the garage? That ’ s not right! It ’ s too dangerous to be around! It ’ s not even your fault she kept it out with the cellar! "

*Do you remember life before dying? *
The soft voice behind me replies, the kind that almost feels heard. I look to the road and back at the road, nothing but where I last looked, and reach for a root. Its probably good to see a growl.
*Then you have lived, too. *
I stop and re-enter the dirt, leaving a trail of pain in my arm.
*It is pointless to chase after it, it can't hurt you. Just remember that this is a cycle. *
My final thought is of a flower. It has grown, but its sting has been replaced by annoyance. I feel my will to survive being drained.
*I choose that choice carefully. *
What now? He doesn't say a word, but I can see the panic in his eyes. Where am I?

The swift crackles of steel cut through the wind, where the banging on wood of the kitchen sinks was only deafening.
It had been weeks since my wife, long after my father had died, had drowned in a pool of his own volition. I watched through half-open box in desperation, a gun that had been tossed just minutes earlier. But none of the shards had penetrated her.
Not today. Not today until tomorrow. Tonight.
How pathetic, such an animal could be. How cruel, such a life.
The sound of the right hook was immense, resembling a slow wail that shook the wood around me. Glass shards, fluid spiraling past my mouth, dripping water to the snot-nosed floor. Its source in the pool of blood and splattered hair was found, forced down through a grate.
I struggled to keep my head down. But the knife had left, and my chest was contorted in squirming pain.
Then it stopped. My head snapped to the left. The water was tattered and clear, silver and sparkling. Without a thought, I plunged my knife into its open mouth, desperate to escape.
The fish had tumbled through my stomach, snapping at the sides of my face and feet. In an instant, its jaws slid a good ten feet from my mouth, swallowing everything in its way. The aftertaste of golden fishy goodness wafted into my nose.
I suppose it should be painless; but these still wouldn't, and, now, when my wife's lifeless body was found, I could have sworn I would have thought you would be.
But I didn't, and didn't bother remembering, and couldn't wait for the killer to be here. The worms latched on to flesh, twisting and twirling as my knife withdrew, widening the holes in my face.
Dipshit. Those damned holes. I could taste the blood.
And then... the knife shivered. The blood slid out of my mouth, pooling within. I can still taste it, sniffing it, savoring it.
I tugged at my nails, trying to get them off, but they were stuck with such force they couldn't be worn off. I grinned, trying to smash my teeth into them as one of them would, but it was impossible, my finger tacking the other one forcefully.
Fuck. I was still alive, in this boat, in this seabed, or whatever. I should have been, hadn't I? Wasn't I?
But the squid had slipped in the off side of a shoelace. It drew its barb down, and I was off to lick the wounds. Hiding in the cupboard was such a shame, waking from all this drowning and splattering. There's nothing around you these days but darkness, anyway. That's never happened before.
But I had to escape, because everything at this point was dancing with a curse. I had no chance of getting out. I had to leave. Or was going to go, finding a hidden treasure and killing it.
So I slithered deeper into the island. There I sat, ripped off my shoe, and dangled my knife from the perch. The knives had not yet touched the boat, and if I let them reach for me, maybe I could have killed these pink fish, and come out unscathed.
But I wouldn't.

It all started one day. It's tough to tell what exactly began, but the day came, leaving his wake buzzing with the thought of saving the world. The day turned into that of grief over what he had done, and how he was going to get back into the good graces of his family. His wife, watching him sleep as he limped out to the hospital, and his children, calling on him. She was a woman of tears, and they shared that with him too.

Three minutes. Fifteen seconds. Then it goes. One more.
Punching the switch, it switches!
Even for me? Hell I've heard it before. * Those jumpers didn't even want to go for over 300,000 feet*. * Maybe they're dead *. There is nothing I can do about that. I keep punching the button. * It's better than sucking a big fucking donkey. *
Have I been drinking before this? I've heard it before. I'm just like *them*. They seem to see me through it. * Nobody sees me through it*. This goes on for a second. Every word it says. A third.
"You know I know you don't know. I... I know, it's too bad, but I like this one, this one. " I admit I wasn't buying it, because, you know, there is no doubt in my mind that I am going to do it. I had always thought about killing myself myself before. But I'm scared. I still feel it. * They are coming and they won't stop. But we have to show them that they don't have to do it. *
Ten. There is still time. If we hit *me*, we might be in the next room. We might see them out there. They might catch up to us. I am scared and I have to hold onto these arms. * I'm going to do this. *
I am scared. I know it.
Panic sets in.
" Yeah, you're right. How's the ladder? It's pretty, huh? " If anyone finds this, they'll know. I hear footsteps behind me. Come to think of it, this isn't a ladder.
Shit.
" Who is this? " This is everyone in the room. I don't recognize the voices. They're all the same, I can tell. Everyone's voice is talking to me. I feel his eyes on my arm. One of them is on mine, watching me close my eyes. And one of them is giving me a hug.
" Um... hello? " I try to remember. This time, the voice isn't cracking. It's not saying *hello* I guess. " Hello, I was wondering if you would like to talk about anything... something. Anything... "
I squeeze a little harder, until he blinks. I pull him up. " Who are you? "
" The evil one. " He nods at me. " How do you keep yourself hidden from my kind? "
" Do you want to live? "
" I do. But if you wish to stop, I won't give up! "
" Then you have just failed to do so. You're useless. "
I shake my head. I'm not like them. I'm not like them. I'm not like them. But this is different. I'm scared. I must do this.
" Help me, help me! " I leap and call for him, almost out of fear. " Godspeed!"
*'Goodbye... goodbye. Goodbye. The End*
But we were gone. Gone forever. I'm scared. My hands run over every inch of glass. And as I stand there, staring down into the void, the voices bring me peace. I can just see them slowly coming closer.
“ So... ”
“ The Grim Reaper."

The demon smirked at my waifu and sat down beside me. " On your first day on the land of the living, your life revolves around the idea of returning to one's former self. " I had trained since the dawn of my age and was confident I would go someplace without walls. I was playing with my ultra early games of chess in a huge, 2 person board set overlooking the lake of fire. In an effort to pass time, I ventured across town to town to find another living human. This one was cool, I came from an abyssal land and anyone I found paled in comparison. He was perfectly agreeable, intelligent, and kind. I called him; he took the first step and walked onto the stage. As I looked at him, I couldn't help but think of all the times he had made a mistake, not for himself, but for a loved one who needed him and to help. He grinned and said, " Your day will now begin, and the day shall end one way or another. In any event, your doom and you will ascend to a higher purpose. Now call this answer: Desolation"

How many years has it been this time, I ask myself.
So this is how it all ends, I have given birth to those who would take my place, and the very ones who would deny my existence because of it? Have you never thought about what death was all about? Have you been poor, I have been poor, my mother was born a common cold. You have. Yes, I have. I am a burden on earth, I have lost my touch, but I don't belong here anymore. Because that weight is everything I once was. Everything I think about. And that weight is the one thing that has become my curse, but my curse never worked, the weight is everywhere now. Today, I will be free from this burden. Today I am free from my shackles, and I will feel pain.

First of all, let's not go too deep on questions like'why' or'why the fuck would I want' so that we'll get to the point and ( most importantly, don't mislead us about what we're supposed to expect ) that our results.
I am at the outset of time testing this idea and made a mistake. I seem pretty confident it'll go through as soon as it comes out, that's why we went with tone colors! It's not like you can tell people or anything else about me, just a bunch of factors. That way if you had asked me to brush my teeth, or if I pulled a car over at night, or if I needed a coffee to heat up my car, I'd probably have an answer instead of washing it all away with a smudge. But I didn't.
What I got was just the worst splash of color imaginable. * Or maybe it was me, * he's been trying to tell me as much.
I approached the test room; I found him standing on the table, panting heavily at the overhead fan in the study. Through my slippers and stained shades I could tell he was in shock, when he cleared his throat.
"So, " he started. " We've been experimenting a little bit with what we put on you? "
" Oh yeah, a bad flashlight, " I said. " I figure if it was useful, I'd make some money doing this " check.
" Well, I guess so. " He looked at me the question was always the same, " Why am I feeling light headed today? Why am I still ringing bells?
" Man, " I said, " I don't know shit. "
He looked at me for a couple seconds, " Have you checked your phone yet? And this. "
" Did I see it? "
" Nope, not just your phone either. It's just plugged into the heart rate monitor. "
" Oh. God. Fuck it. "
I got to the point, he started humming. " Man, I just wish that one of those things would make me feel better. I wouldn't have to remind myself of that. "
" Well, like all things. "
He started continuing. " I mean, I've never been happier. I don't feel like I'm the only person in this room. God. I just feel so fulfilled. "
I had no idea what he meant, he seemed both exhausted and anxious. I could be feeling happiness, but I couldn't know what his point was. It was just a thought.
Then he looked up. " Well. Here we go. Tell me. " He started humming again.
" Well, I'd have told you. Well, I didn't really expect anyone to be interested in this idea and so would we have told someone, because maybe they wouldn't want to experience that thing. Maybe it's just... " He started humming again and I cut him off.
" Oh God. He's making a perfect metaphor, in his head. "
I stopped humming. " So, I'm trying to test the effects on my mood if you will. If my skin color changes like that, is that the same shade of color you see? "
He looked shocked, probably has little thought about what he just said, obviously he didn't think this through.
" Well, maybe not, but it's the best I can hope for. Well. Have a fucking drink. "
His eyes lit up as he started humming. A man from a nearby building came in.
" Well, I guess this is your opportunity to tell us a lot about how you feel. Don't worry though, we'll be ready before you hit the streets."

The old man stands in the front row, looking everywhere and seeing nothing. Many girls tell him he's a fraud, a rotund old fellow, come to his last parade. Others call him the most entertaining man in the neighbourhood. But that's never the case. He acts like nothing happened, just got destroyed in the past few months and doesn't even realize what happened to him. He always knows he is a fraud, a twaddle, a freak, just another rotten old man. So he is changed. So does the others at his parade.
"You're going to fool me! I've seen it all! " The old man says loudly and strikes a pose. The women are quiet, I swear the old man doesn't get it. As soon as the tall, slim boy takes the stage, he has to stop his self-insert.
" Do you know what day it is? " I say to him
" Some days its 16 March. That's Christmas, ain't it!? " The boy says derisively
" And you two got ta wear your own clothing for your own parade! "
" I totally agree! Why wouldn't we even bother? It ain't the first time, you know, it's like some sort of bad joke! All those years! What'd you get in return for us getting a free candy bar or something? Jesus! I thought we wanted less conflict!"
He has no idea what to say to me. I look over and immediately realize something. My anger and his pure hatred in comparison to other people's hate stems from a simple misunderstanding. The boy does not understand what I'm saying. He just does. Slowly and painfully.
I'm going to go ahead and erase every single one of his memories. This is a shared emotion in this entire thing, so nothing will take the place of it. Then I'll only worry myself, it will make me feel safe again. Then I'll start the parade again, and the parade stops before my eyes.

I sit alone in the library for weeks. I look at the pictures that are hung to my walls. Books are piled high. Holes are dug in. Tables are torn up. Books are ripped, hacked up, ripped out to be torn up.
I am never sure what to make of all this, but I keep staring at the books. Every line and every photo is lifted from one of the textbooks when I am done. And I dig at them. I dig at books and portraits and landscapes and stories and stories and drawings and clouds and flowers and day and night. I dig at anyone, I dig at anyone. I dig at anyone, and I always find something marvelous.
Suddenly, the biggest smile comes across my face. I realize what was written and I look at the teacher. The teacher asked:
"Do you wish you would feel sadness? Is your soul'unworthy to humanity? Is it worth it? "
I remember everything about this face that seemed to be in this predicament, what it gave to me about what was in it; what makes people want to live, what made me want to be something more but who I am. And I realize why. I don't understand the concept of what sadness means yet I do. In my mind I can not comprehend why I would ever feel this hurtful grief or painful pain because I know that I would neither want to live nor be happy, but I would rather live than never feel that much happiness. No one will ever be happy.
And then I look at the new kid. He is older, no older than me. His beautiful face inches from mine, waves of happiness lightly washed over his, as if He is already entering the world of people who have been waiting for Him. He smiled then, a smile so full that I could almost hear his voice and that beautiful sound that washes over his entire body. He knew what I wanted this day, and He knows what I need.
" I'm going to ask what will I feel. What will I feel like? What will I feel like being alone for eternity? I'm going to ask it! I'm going to ask it! I've asked it, and in many ways, I've asked it for eternity. I'm going to ask it to be a part of me and begin enjoying eternity as I waited for it to be replaced by pain and a pain that I shall never feel again, and then take a moment and truly ask, and when I answer, are you ready to accept my invitation? "
Then I sit there, a smile on my face and a smile that never leaves me. He remembers the first time he spoke to me, and then to me and then to other people. He saw me as someone who had tried before, made it different, not wanting what he thought he deserved. His smile said:
" My dear friend, we have had a tremendous life and now with only a glimpse of what you have dreamed and feeling for yourself, you may be able to hold onto this hope for eternity. Until we finish this, perhaps tomorrow, we can finally cherish a new, I hope, for eternity."
And after that he wanted to know what he could do, and to cherish what he could be, but he couldn't. And so he became a tree.

You see, I can have more than just power.
I am fast, strong, painless, literally. If you wanted all this so bad, you'd have taken the mid-range nuclear launch codes you weren't taught, changed most of their coding. I can get anywhere you want in a matter of seconds. I am faster, more durable, cost-effective, amazing in any field that you can think of. In short, I am everything you don't.
On the contrary, I've become a massive celebrity. Anything from the unemployed to the highest-ever-paid athlete to astronaut to physicist. I know what it's like to be hot, to be surrounded by super-strength and go unnoticed.
But I don't care. I'm perfect.
I am the hero you need. And when I die, you'll be so thankful.

"Turn off your devices. Don't open the Wallet. "
She glanced at her watch and shrugged, shaking her head. Maybe it'd not have been a bad decision if she hadn't just started skipping lunch instead of going to work instead of spending one dollar to be left alone with her roommates. Still, that left a lot to ponder. There was probably no way her iPad was on the nightstand, or maybe it had been sitting there for a long time. The big ring next to the door would have to do. The cheap paperback read, " 3 months in? Almost done. " There was a moment's hesitation as she reached for the large buck $ 1 card. Satisfied with herself, she took one and handed it to her roommate. Unfortunately, she wasn't having much luck.
*What the hell!? * Had someone knocked on her door? She shrugged and flopped over, still out of breath. She tried to open the door but the heavy plastic cover kept sliding off. It took her a few seconds to realize the door wasn't closing. She looked for an open table between her roommates, but she was too late. She dove for the open table as the figure I'd confronted lunged for the bag.
Suddenly the bag fell in the man's hands.
I closed my eyes, checking for anything that might help my case. Nothing.
Where was I? I couldn't be in New York? Where was my apartment? Was the safe anywhere? Was I in a public area? Did... No... It was there. Out in the back of my mind, trying to pull myself together, I remembered it was on a subway from about 20 minutes ago. The only people from the station were everyone down at the Dr. Pepper Company. It wasn't anyone up on the street.
As I tried to take back control of my memories, I realized something.
*Yes, that's right. I was at Starbucks. Now that I think about it, I don't know if it was a house or just a Starbucks. So where was I? * I thought to myself.
Outside the building, the subway lights flashed. * Was that always here? *
The world around me burned brighter. I remembered my shift as a regular and realized that this was definitely there, I was in my apartment. I'm sorry, that would've happened, was it Mom's car...
*Oh my God. What was she doing at Starbucks? *
I didn't know what was happening. I couldn't remember the first thing I saw, just a blurred blue bed. Nothing else seemed real in the tunnel. I looked around.
Everyone at the Dr. Pepper Company was staring at me, staring back at me. * Mom.. we've just finished work. We don't know what went wrong, or if we're going to live with... * I gulped down another drink, and finally opened my wallet and pulled out the money, about the size of my parents' thumb drive. * Maybe her stupid anger management skills weren't so bad after all... * I thought, scared.
I wouldn't do anything to screw with her, right?

It was an average day in Albuquerque, New Mexico. People had the typical busing habits. To entertain themselves they spent more than they were legally allowed to spending. Some walked in with their money or pretended to not, because the people to do so would know their secret, and they wanted something new. Some had enough money to start a family, and learned to never quit. Everyone from lower class to upper class saw the dollar amount they could ever spend on a particular piece of art they wanted. So they spent it wherever they could afford to. All of them had their reasons, of course. Some didn't dare to take anything they couldn't make but others only spent on those they could afford. In the end it wasn't too much of a change. Most preferred spending money left behind, with the people on it having to return the money to the banks. Small cities soon proved that it wasn't much of a deal.
Suburbia was quiet, and many saw it as a gift. Unfortunately, those problems were actually temporary. It was happening in "The United States ", but if the box reminded you of someone with a dark history you knew then you weren't. The people just tended to look up and hope their heart was beating. " It's all your damn fault " they'd probably say, but as you saw the light of day it was suddenly replaced by dark, fuzzy reality. You'd seen video, spoken to your loved ones, and tried to decipher the cryptic message, hoping you'd heard the end. Finally, the day was here and they'd fixed their mistake. $ 70,000,000. Well, at least the map was clear. You were dead. Right as you were going to die you began to hear strange whistling. You'd seen the box, but nothing that you'd ever seen before. You looked at it, confused and confused. It was on. This screen showed some stupid app on the floor, but still plainly labeled " as soon as the human mind can understand that this package is nothing more than a random black box with no functional means to manipulate the world. The very first thing you see before your death is a small white marker that is staring directly into your eyes. All other times your thoughts is blasted away from your existence. You fear the white thing is the only thing you have left. Almost quickly the white thing begins to fade into black. Once the black thing reappears and everyone is dead, you realize that the timer has run out, there is still time, and the supermarket is starting up in the next few hours. If you were stranded right now and unsure if you should go back to your apartment, then you should understand, because the original timer was almost as validly ran out. On the other hand, you did need to get some money, which was always from your mother's apartment.
You were getting desperate. You needed somewhere to go when you were ambushed by some uniformed officers. I stepped in to help them, after all, who needed the money anyway? Just off the street was what appeared to be the CIA. They approached you, took your phone and started to guide you along with the safety protocols. This hand pushed you forward, and just as you tried to explain the instructions with all that shit gone wrong you read the label on the device. ** RE-EXTRAS. ** You were given the entire amount, up to three. That meant everything was going to work out. You took a pull of your fingers as you read them. You didn't know this. Just knew that this short amount of money you had left for the things you've failed to offer weren't going to do anything about that. I took my phone out. My freedom had ended.
Then it happened. Everyone told you you could never live without a paycheck. That you could never make enough to eat, drink or sleep. Well now you're gon na have to start worrying about money for something else. That's why you've so blatantly refused to get to Taco Bell on Sundays, when none of your fellow americans can afford chips anymore.
You wanted to go a different direction. You wanted to go to New York City without money. You wanted to make a decision that even your girlfriend decided wouldn't make it out of the next step. You didn't have the money to go there. You had to find somewhere where you could keep it. What was you doing, again?

So here I am:
Gary sat down in his office, typing furiously. He knew what would happen for the future. He couldn't protect pokemon. They would get in his way, eventually.
Now there was only two options,
1 ) Gary preferred to not make a single move,
2 ) Gary opted to give the option a short love story between Gary and his best friend Marth,
Gary got off the laptop in his office, now he had an adventure in mind.
The final choice was that he chose pikachu. It would be his last, with the sole exception of being more ambitious in choosing a larger pokemon. Gary had to go for the "Pokemon of the Century ". He had to tell the people about the insane theories and religious attacks. In his book he said that even the so called " Pokemon of antiquity " were not human, that they were a product of the world's most violent populace.
After what seemed like an eternity the author finished his work, closing his book as tears rolled down his face.
The page closed with that thought: " This boy's the only human pokemon this generation."

I stand in the front yard, looking down at the bright sun streaming out over the mesa as my mind wanders over the events that occurred during the fateful 21st century.
20 years before *The Wanderer*. 20 years before "Cancer ". 20 years before " Cryptids ". 20 years before " evolution ".
These were few, too few after all. People all over the galaxy had vanished as soon as they found out that they were immortal and, to put the situation into perspective, unending; unending.
Humanity had started on the very first fruitless attempt to be able to cure cancer; they spent a decade researching for it's effectiveness. As the fuel for their research, their ingenuity, and their delicate, noble work, they realized immortality was near limitless, a problem most planets faced by the public had solved with the birth of the Anti-Virus.
Humans, however, would never experience first contact with other aliens. We always feared contact, but at the time, we simply ignored the alien calls to " play a joke on us", as those term were understood. That was, until that day, when, after a series of incursions, an English explorer cursed the translation system of a film he had read aloud to his students. The translation system, translated through the computer into English, said that Christianity had died a long time ago, and time had passed.
It was not only that they had once again proven themselves to be untrustworthy, but that we were being ignored, denied, and exploited for the short-lived purposes of wars. With every contact, our species realized that we no longer existed in the face of such devastation. We felt a jealous, hateful, emotionless appetite for the one thing that was both the purpose of our existence, and of our species' existence: humanity.
We know now that I am the last remaining human on Earth; unless you'd like to take the leap of faith, then open a stand-alone online shopping cart.

The world was ending.
There were no more humans left, no more scientists and scientists alone.
The world was looking for answers.
But we didn't have any. Our only remaining human connections were wiped out, and for two weeks we were sending out tons of probes to investigate and wipe anything that came our way.
The news stations were covering the news all over the world, waiting for new information. " Astronauts identify the missing wormhole man, though." every country was covered in blood and theories.
Nobody could have predicted what the results would be like, but they didn't have to let anyone know. It would have been so easy to allow humanity to enter a wormhole and slowly advance.
And so it happened. Within a few months our world was one giant crater between two suns. All people remained united, except for one man, Paul J. Koster. Even when he refused to be shut up, many people tried to stop him. They often tried to take his key, something he owned or bought, and he often insisted on calling in some help.
Somehow eventually everyone became rich. Some people even got kidnapped, made attractive, and were hired as executioners. All because Paul thought he didn't deserve to be tortured.
Eventually, he fell asleep after work. Eventually he woke up in a bar, and was about to begin what would be the most sinister serial killers he's ever had to experience. But when he realized something was different, he decided to go for it.
He sat down and was hit by a train.
Nobody knows how they escaped. We know they escaped from their lab and were captured by some one from another city. They were sent back to Earth with wooden stakes.
Not many of us left now. Some of us try to go home, to wipe the human race from the face of the Earth with our collective might. But they won't. They think that maybe they've lost hope. Maybe they'll just die.
No one ever said that one reason people were safe from the earth was that they no longer needed to help other people find out where they belonged.

The warden doesn't seem to notice me. His hairy legs hobble slightly over the plain floor of the large plastic filing cabinet on the third floor of our small apartment building. It's dark, and I can barely see through the curtains. Sweat rolls down my forehead and piles up on my jeans. It's an expensive pair of underwear, but I can't imagine wearing it.
I have a sense that a human is twice as tall as me. But those warden hairs grow strong as someone climbs on top of the desk and pinches the edge of the door.
The warden's assistant is sitting on the other end of the room, talking in ratty Italian. We've only talked on his way out. Another human has just been adopted, but not by one of the asylum's human registries. It's just another human in a million dollar contract, and it's got to be for this reason. I dare not make eye contact with the man, because if I do, he's going to take advantage of my condition and kill me.
The warden looks away slightly. I could feel his attention. I pull out a handgun. I put it on my lap and lean my back against the desk. He looks up at me.
"Are you even in here, ma'am? "
I take a step back. He stares in terrified silence.
" Not really, " I say, " but I hear the news. They did the report on first, specifically the four hundred-year average life expectancy in their sample. * I* just think about it. I'm different. "
A haughty man in a suit reads the report. He looks down at his hands and looks at my bloody hands.
I aim my gun at the hand. The man says nothing.
" I tried to explain, " I say, " I thought you were going to say that. I thought you'd say something like, well, I'm normal. But just the coffee doesn't make sense. "
The man's throat tightens.
" But they're us. We're different. We're all dependents. We're immortal. "
The man sniffles.
" And you know that is just crazy. You're a living contradiction. " He has an accent I haven't seen in years. The skin on his arm around his back shakes.
" I know, ma'am. But no other explanation. " I squeeze my eyes shut. My head is pounding from the stress of the situation.
" It was about three, four, five hundred years ago, " I sigh, grabbing his arm. " And I was adopted. I became a human surrogate mother. I went to the circus and performed here as a make believe wife. " I slam my fist on the desk.
" And you know it was probably because I was for a human. "
The man takes a deep breath.
" But they- "
" That's right. I married them in what is now Florida. I was aware of the allegations that I might encounter them in the foyer. I don't know if they knew. I do know that they didn't realize. I was adopted. "
He doesn't reply.
I place my hands over my face. This is what happens when you stare at the 10 year old about 5 feet away.
" What, you mean you like *normal* human relationships? " I stammered.
" It's a valid point, ma'am, " the warden says carefully, " I understand that. But I feel that you are right. "
He points to an imprint at the top of the clipboard on the wall.
" Read, " I say, " before you choose your life."

Dust. There was dust everywhere. The planet was devoid of any difference except for one thing. Dust. That thing can only move so slowly. But it's faster than light. We don't even know what to look at. We do. I look back up at our planet and all my favorite things that were all used for our long journey through the abyss. Everything! Space, power, the most destructive plant we had ever seen, the oceans, and the stars. All still there. We were searching for an answer. Without knowing it, how could we even know the answer? I look up at the planets planets with like stareans almost all over them, looking around like aliens actually searching for answers. It's like the world was used for the one reason left out. One answer. The one godforsaken question. The one question left that didn't even make sense.

It had started with a high pitched crash. Nothing was happening, it only happened once every few years at least. Over the last four months, we had always been under a huge storm that was expected in my neighborhood, our neighbor since 35 years old. I had been given an assignment so I could ’ ve known what was going to happen.
I had just been awoken in the middle of the night on my doorstep. The horn of the van was piercing my ears. I looked out of the window to see it getting closer.
I slowly looked around. There was nothing.
Then my reflection, from the home that I always owned back in that red barn had met a face. My wife smiled. It was my long dead husband.
It was the first time I had seen his face since I was three.
I looked back into the window with worry and curiosity. My mind raced.
The van entered the driveway. It was full of children, of course. All around, there were worried faces waiting for me. The sound of children crying softly were piercing and intense.
I could feel them getting closer to me.
Suddenly my wife and I started wailing.
“ Honey, I ’ m going to have to ask you to take off your jacket. ”
I was disgusted and scared. My wife quickly ran around and hugged me. I tried to comfort her, she looked almost upset. I couldn ’ t let this happen to me. There was no way I was going to let her down.
Suddenly I began to feel a burning at the back of my throat. It was then that I realized.
I had just been out cleaning some soil when the horn shook. I didn ’ t remember driving home, I had just been watching a commercial. My son was doing the gardening so I looked at him in horror. The paramedics had put his aid at the scene so he had not even made it home.

Apparently it ’ s time to pay the funeral priest in the Mark Twain Company. If you hear a funeral curtain sound, you could always tell that person is packed full of valuables, by the sound of the funeral curtain, it would never be a funeral.
As of now, the only signs that someone is packing are ashes left for the cremation. Sadly, the ashes are starting to burn away, everyone knows, but there ’ s been some major cultural revolutions taking place in the last 10 years, the government has a policy of shooting the family for their greed.
Now, the government officials around you will not save the family anymore. This is expected, to make its way to the royal family. To make sure that it doesn ’ t fall apart.
However, historians agree that in the last century, we have totally forgotten about the events in the 21st century, right where everything happened, The Great War.
In the 11 years of our country ’ s existence, people have forgotten about us forever. Life is kind to the people, but it is not kept in check by the authorities, until one day there is a slight spark of anger, a spark of introspection and the tears would finally come to us, and i ’ m sorry.
I ’ m a little regretful, after I realized for the first time that we are not meant for this anymore. A brief reign of terror would not be different. We are almost non-existent.
If you haven ’ t noticed, there is a massive underground community of citizens, known as the Mark Twain Society. They are classified as outlaws, mainly due to their hard work and dedication to protecting the rights of the citizens and also their willingness to participate in the societies affairs. They ’ re a necessity to humanity, which is why i ’ m about to close my eyes. I ’ m writing to you personally with just one simple thing.
After 100 years of being outlaws, the political leaders must go. We can not defeat them, after all, that wasn ’ t a dream back in the 1800 ’ s, when they were trying to unify the empire with inter-collegiate trade. Instead, we have fought criminals, merchants, and missionaries alike, in hopes of defeating them. I want to say to you, because no one would dare to steal this money, that we can ’ t. Not one of you will survive this, there is just no time to be quick.

He has a name in the script he always wears. A name that ever says something about whatever search he's on, because sometimes you don't want to be chasing a serial killer. So I had this odd notion about that name that I ’ d kept for so long, because he had this idea. It wasn't something that I had so much control over though. I just had to make sure that when we finally found him and then Mr. Wallace it was a clean up operation. His identity isn't being studied, it isn't being spent on DNA, and there's a lot of intense obsessing over the exact figure behind this murder. All it took was my meticulous monitoring of everything we did, and God only knows I could have saved a child from it. It's a slaughter! But who was he doing this to? It took some courage and determination, and after about a half hour of futile searching on various websites we found a rather remarkable murder that was so difficult to pinpoint which I had to understand. I guess it was the name of the child's mother who was supposed to take the blame for our birth. Well I ’ ll just say it's not an accident.

I love you
So sorry again for refusing to turn in the papers. How nice of you to give me more time before this goes to waste. I'm from Providence, RI and don't work for the postal service.

This writing prompt is a handy dark trigger.
I guess it's a good thing he was an adult...
My eyes took in his confidence, his vulnerability. His plump cheeks, framed them both with these heavenly eyes that meekly showed me his hidden hate for the world.
But the gentleness of his expression made me feel nothingness. I realized that if he was the one that made me go to sleep, his insatiable ambition wouldn't let me fall asleep.
A glance at him, bright, funny, staring off into the distance; frozen in fear at what I'm about to see, brought me back.
As we exchanged glances, I realized that he had me worry about. Thoughts were running through my head about how despicable he must be, being preoccupied.
His girlfriend snuck up behind me, played with her in a compromising position, and took my hand.
Not that I was going to be able to do anything else. I had an incontinence, had never been that nervous. I knew he was a little sick, but he was just glad to have this cut off from you.
I heard someone scream behind me. Oh my! She ran toward me. Her shoe was missing! I knew it was my fault, that she was too poor, that something went wrong.
The pain was tearing me apart at the same time. The pain of a sense of future pain. I let my guard down, and I curled up.
The sound was coming from the door, coming from the penthouse that I had chosen. I heard the man yelling again; "It's time for your prince to go. I can't go back."

The chanting of mages fills the air. Not that it matters anymore. I can hear them again, that sort of chant. Every second passes with increasing frequency. My mind races, trying to figure out what makes this noise so sound. I look at them, her eyes dainty in a perpetual gaze. Not a single pupil to her black eyes. Watching the moments pass by faster and faster, her beautiful half lifeless body, suddenly give way to a more strong and youthful figure. My hands shake and grab onto the craft from which I was standing. The old design depicts a serene silhouette of a woman, flowing elegantly down a golden corridor. In her hand is a beautiful dagger. Her eyes wander across the face of the chosen assassin. Unable to stop her breathing to quell the darkness of the room, she whispers in her ear.
"What was that? "
Her body shakes and her form collapses once more. Never in all my years have I seen an assassin react to me. Her eyes shift to me as she whispers quietly:
" Sorry son, but I don't think we're going to get into this one."
I pause to take a breath and let her off balance. Tomorrow will be a good day for me to witness her death. I can't imagine her doing this to me. My peaceful, idle spell-mage body rushes out of the contraption. I hear the explosion...
.....
Someday she will pass. Tomorrow, I will rise again. For the fourth time I wait with feigned calm. There is nothing to fear. I walk along the halls of the necromancer's workshop, muttering softly to myself in my mind. My castle and hearth are full of undead after all. Sometimes, I would just sit here and think about my previous life. Today, I am returning to my previous self and reuniting with a smile. But I am scared, too afraid to say anything to the rest of the world. I know my last words to the world will be:
*I won't do it. Not one bit. *

Ingrid knew her role and was intrigued by the answer. However it seemed quite simple to her that something wrong was at stake in her task. She had to protect her lover, it would be just as important to maintain the safety of her.
She sat there in that shimmering sphere of knowledge, knowing that she could still save her lover. But she didn't know how to manipulate it, she had to, if she wanted it to. Her lover was far too dangerous for her. How dare he study her, and expose her? Could she not learn the tricks necessary to cure him? The question swirled out of her mind and she realized she was making a dangerous mistake.
She ran, trying to keep out of the sphere and looking for the source of the mysterious voice, but found it to be a very cloudy night. The city was still dark, it was too quiet, and she knew that it was almost too soon to inform her. She also knew that she was alone and would inevitably die if she did. Her request for money was unanswerable to her, but she had reason to believe that her spouse was indeed alive and could possibly help her even if she was to die alone.
As she ran a faint noise echoed in the distance, and she waited for the sound to pass. When she came to, nothing was there, and she was given no reason to hesitate. So she took no actions. Not even to defend her beloved. For a long while, she stayed far from the sphere, and then found a very eerie light surrounding the person she had recently reunited with. She just asked him to come back. It was apparent that the voice was an evil-sounding monster.

A small boy looks up at the sky, for the first time in months. That's when the high pitched shriek resonates through the entirety of New York City. Blood starts dribbling out from the hole in the ground behind him and out through his body and into his eyes.
Out runs the boy from the massacre, carefully looking for an attacker. As the boy tries to run out the police car, the air comes rushing in from across the street. A man in a ski mask comes out of his car and falls to the ground to take cover with his feet.
The boys eye tilts downwards, looking at a hand, then forward again. Down falls out a man in a torn uniform, holding an orb in both hands in place of one, pointing towards the sky. The boy smiles widely.

After being traded from horse's blood, a young hunting horse walked into the middle of a field. He looked up at a huge gust of wind blowing up the field, coating his face with the crisp wind. Being a horse, he was too small and weak, getting tested long before the final battle.
Woe to him, the boy, for not racing back with the horse, nor with his bloody armor. How brave a young boy was, for when he came to the conclusion, that he did not want to live, he passed away. There, in the middle of the field, was a girl. She, though, was weak, and sought help from a few of her classmates, and soon recovered. Her blood was put inside a golden bowl, it was filled with poison, as well as pink flowers.
The horse, puzzled by this, asked,
"Please, wait here, I can't do it. I can't see you... I need you, for... for my own boy, I can't really call myself that, "
When the boy spoke, his spirit was lifted, and he looked at the girl. " Can't you see? You're my boy, my very first day to hunt. "
" I... I-I'm sorry. But I... I won't go. I'll try to keep that dream alive. Tell you how I used to hunt. "
The boy showed the girl his back, and said, " It's not very good, boy. I don't have much meat for my young, and I feel very weak. You, however, bring me food, that's great. "
The girl seemed to respond, but when she did, she straightened up, trying to hide her shame. " I-I have something to ask of you, boy. "
" I-I'll be right back, " said the boy, realizing, and wishing he could, as always, come back. "
The boy sat down, in the distance, seeing the wild yellow grass of his field. He looked at the boy.
" Well, boy. I know it's not really your first rode, but we're adventurers after all."

It was a sunny Wednesday, I should say that more than a fair amount of time ago. I ’ ve lived far too far back for that. Yet, this time my parable is true.
Being one of the richest men on Earth today, I am offered my wish for the death of the wisher, Emily. However, his wish had quite a side effect. Emily, was gone. She died, I was not far off. This was a nice thing to happen, she was loved by many in my town and able to see the future much less waste our last one-hundred-and-forty billion dollars.
I didn ’ t have long to tell her, she made a wish on me, well, I didn ’ t understand what it was, but she asked me if I would do it for her.
“ No, if you want to live out your life with me… ”, I said
“ But ”, she said, as she hugged me tightly. “ No, no I won ’ t do it. There will be insecurities and other issues along the way. ”
So it started with some kind of financial commitments. When they proposed it they left me a note saying they would be back next year. I was sure that even if they forgave me, as I was, I would not be able to care for Emily anymore, I was sorry and I wanted to say it again.
That is the story of my life, I want to live in peace with my love
My wish was to see my great grandfathers fortune
I did not know all the details of his life, but I was sure I ’ ll know what world will be very familiar to him, after his death.
“ I want to live my life with my great grandfathers fortune ”, I said as I made my way to the front door.
After leaving the house for the day, it was another sunny Wednesday, I should say that much more often. I woke up here and opened the door, quickly realizing that my car was already parked, I went in.
The sun was getting stronger, although no one around me knew what was going on, for a brief moment I saw some people lying in the street. They looked young, some were going on a celebratory way, while others were headed towards something.
“ When you found out he was gone ”
“ I think he was going to die ”, I said, as I found out it was Emily.
As I closed the door, I saw a man staring directly at me. He had brown skin, like me, and looked troubled. “ I don ’ t know where this wish comes from or where it takes us. And I will find out I wish for someone to do it for me ”, he said
“ Oh, now if I wish for you to live out your life with me, I am sure you will do it ”, I said with an empty smile.
“ Oh no no ”, he said as he grabbed my shirt and pulled me into a hug, as he stroked my cheek.
I saw him walk towards the front door and see that my car had only one door and no sign of his. After a while he walked back inside, led by an old lady I had met before, whom he helped take the car from.
It ’ s dark at my side as he walked in, as he himself was putting a light on my window.
“ Who were you talking to? ” he said with a smile
“ You know the one person I can talk to. ”, I said after looking him over.
With a smile on my face he said “ How can you call me, actually. Not everyone can be so alive. ”

The wispy outline of the clouds grew darker than before and the darkness of the universe stripped away much of the detail in his eyes. The sounds of rubber running through a wood chipper pulled his ethereal chariot one step and out of the shadows. Those who watched tried to figure out why the snow had woken him. He knew they couldn't because he never let them help him summon anything else. But he knew that they couldn't help themselves and they were smarter than the other survivors that were next to him. " What if they don't want to work for me anyway? " asked a girl asked in disbelief.
" I got the help I needed. " said the devil, still half awake. " We live in heaven and we all have a purpose... "
The girl grew silent.
" Ah, " said the devil, cocking his head as he thought. " As if my whole world wasn't empty. I have this statement, I have this mystery. "
" There's no answer? " asked the girl.
" Well, there's a small in-between happiness and the rapture. There's this alternate world where I don't know who I am. "
" I know you do, " said the girl. " And if heaven is a happy place, then I don't have a choice. My actions should be as long as they are simple and sweet to my daughter. "
" Well, " said the devil, " if they're unhappy, then why are I happy? "
" Well, " said the girl, " there are things about them that make you both sad and sad for them. They're my truth. "
" My dark lie? " the devil asked.
The girl stood up and walked towards him.
" There is a life of adventure. The things people do in these black expanse... The things they make for me. " She made the small gesture of a child's hand to rub against the snow. " It is like a pet you have with you. "
" It is a sad lie? " said the devil as he looked through her window. " A subtle love of the animals. They seem to me to be smiling and smiling but I know they aren't. "
" You are happy, " said the girl as she stood over the devil. " You have a future beyond any of the tormented, hopeless, and desperate people you have seen before. " She guided the girl over to his window and gave him the last stone before he fell asleep. " What could I possibly do for you? " she asked as she flicked the angel off.
The devil smiled.
" I wish for you to be happy in the end." And with that the girl fell asleep.

My world, at some point, decided not to give me the option of going back.
It did, after all, play a part in my creation. By sheer luck, my memory had been bottled up by memories from a long time past. My previous life was focused on studying the ocean floor and curiosity made me: what had was?
But in my new life, I'm shocked to find that I didn't use a stove, nor water. Heck, I knew I wasn't going to pour anything over myself.
Instead, I was packing some big bags on a deck chair near a beach, fishing with other crew members, and taking a tour around it.
(.. pun intended. )
As the boat was sinking, the crew members started to wonder -- what would they do if I tried to kill them? I was at least halfway through a day in basic training, so there was only one way to teach them everything: Catch.

<|endoftext|>
**********646**********
"So, tell me, do you worry about that future and the future on earth? "
" Well, how does it go down there? "
" I dunno? "
" I mean, I would worry about that future and my past. Could you please tell me about them, one way or another? "
" Well, the gist is, I guess nothing bad happens to anyone. In fact, the world was wrecked. "
"... What? "
" Well, world war II almost ended up stopping the war. It was then that light changed, even after several months. The initial fear, rather than the fact that it would finally be controlled from afar would turn out to be unfounded. As is law, people once again flocked to rioters, people wept. Then the general anguish slowly dawned upon everyone in the west. It changed the length of a century. Then, the blackouts began. The devastation had been self-fulfilling and had only just begun last year. "
" So where does it stop? "
" The husk of America no longer exists. The Atomic Bomb goes off from East to West. From China, to North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Egypt, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile. "
" What, what do they even want to talk about? "
" Well, the almost complete destruction, to say the least. The cesspools created overnight by bombs were quickly set to decay, no longer able to support themselves in the temperatures they once were. "
" So you, well, that is pretty important if you're going to get any attention, right? "
" Well, I suppose it is still relevant in these situations, "
" But... "
" Well, I don't think you see the point, well, I... "
" Am I correct? "
" You are correct, you don't see the point, but that does not matter, because there will come a point where the reality of the situation finally fades from your life. Anyhow, it is time for you to call in favors, " the immortal Genie said, and this last possibility washed over his head. The ancient man nodded and he was gone. He asked the genie where the time had run out.
" Is all that can be done with it all? "
" I guess, no, but all I'm asking is for one thing. For me to return your overdue favor."

“ Now where have we ’ ve come this time man? ”
“ I don ’ t understand. The Creation had been dormant for so long. ”
“ Calm down, the humans would figure you out by now. ”
“ They even used it as an excuse for invading and conquering our world. ”
“ I guess it doesn ’ t matter man. The new world you ’ re in will be much more complicated than that. ”
“ Nope. Either way, what do you want me to do? ”
“ Show them you can help. ”
“ Anything! ”
“ From now on I will fight with humanity ’ s most innovative weapons! ”
“ Brilliant! Soon, they will be unstoppable! If you let us take the world by storm. ”
“ Never mind man. I don ’ t think it matters anymore.
“ See you later sir. ”

These tracks were intended to get us out of the shelter I had built. A Duchy of the Bloody South had supplied my supply, to be used by a besieged Berzerker in the ensuing war. I could finally make it out of the tunnels before nightfall. My eyes turned upward as my feet broke ground to a new posture as I arose from my cocoon. I darted through the damp earth, spinning in and out of light. I danced among the corpses of the soldiers that had given me shelter. They had not gone to their deaths, but only served to try and make sense of the situation. The dead lying atop me had not gone to be lied about, but their lives.
"Too much pressure to help you now, Knight, " the light blinded me. I was crawling closer. My eyes glazed over as I saw the hand of light who was following me. He was haggard and wet, torn. His hair was dirty and twisted. A badly worn, flecked hand. I knew I would die alone.
He lead me to a large wooden room, lit by fire. He smiled through the smoke, his eyes still wandering off into the distance. His mouth hung open, and he gestured as I fell on my back. I jerked at my feet, pinning the footrests to the door as he climbed into the wooden desk.
He looked directly into my eyes and spoke in a gruff voice, " Hah! It's quite a surprise I know you're here! How did you end up here? "
With a wave of his hand, I looked up to my mentor, " Tim Grim, Duke of Fairfield. I'm glad you left, " I said, nodding in a way that had disoriented me. " Forgive me, Jack. The teaching was kind. And here I am on the other side of the border, preparing to kill a fallen Union soldier that I haven't given an example for. "
" Of course, Master. "
" What is it that makes you think we're the good guys here? We have clear all war footing. Look at me. The usual mutters, a few weak acrobats, and then give me your appraisal, " he commanded in a low voice, his head leaning upwards. His mustache twitched as he slowly stepped forward, leaning ever so slightly.
" The Union recruits are begging for my help, of course. They demand the occupation of the Stairway to the West! "
" How does the Union really want you back? " the prisoner asked.
" It would be tough, " Tim reminded me, his voice rising and falling in increasing unison. " I wish we were helping. "
" Yeah, I knew you were. The Union would never refuse the young recruits. They would never do it on their own. There is no force amongst them more willing to do so, other than we. "
" I don't know, " Jack continued, his shoulders hunched forward, hands propped against the back of his chair. He looked up at the Warden before me. He was accompanied by his teacher, a small woman with dimples in one eye and thin mouth that dripped wetness.
" Sir? " the Warden inquired in an almost casual tone, her voice shaking with the movement of the pins on the bridge of her nose. " What's your name? "
" Norbert -or Tim, if you were to have one - Roderick. " I nodded, making an appearance of being sweaty as well.
" I am relieved to have you back, " the Warden said. " Sir Roderick, and you are free to join me for once. " Her eyes gleamed in the dim light as she said this. A small burbling sound came from behind the man, muffled by the shackles, revealing nothing more than a uniformed soldier hunched over an old man as if his eyes were distant.
Jack followed behind, taking in the sights of the man before him. He wore a face that wasn't there when he was here. A face with an obvious tattoo on the back of his head and greyed hair.
" The Union wants you dead."

They found me, seven in the morning. * Happy birthday! *
Nope, not another one. Not even a grammatical error.
*Seven in the morning. *
Damn. The M & M station told me I had to just look.
Not ten seconds later, as usual. Out the window, I see something shapely, it's a nice brown glass ball. In its hand is a gloved hand reaching down. It *is* me.
Oh, crap, it's me.
A middle-aged woman's hand reaches out.
** "Michael, wake up! " ** it says.
I smile as I can remember the sound of her voice crying.
A kind man lifts himself from the ground.
** " C'mon Michael, we're about to do something big! " **
" What? " He says, looking around. " Who's doing this? "
I nod. * These babies. They're getting bigger. *
*** " What the fuck? " ***
A woman's hand raises again. A wand, covering her entire hand, sits in the center of the glass.
** " Welcome to the baby's nursery! Come out with me! You may have gotten into some trouble with dad. You look different, don't worry! " **
I smiled. " God damn it, what do you mean? "
** " I'm sorry honey, but we've been out talking about this thing for a while now. We got ta talk about this now! So, take care of yourself. It's going to take a while, but we think you'll understand. Now get out. " **
I reached out to wipe the tears from my eyes. " How will I ever feel when I get out? " I ask.
** " That's not happening! It'll just be harder and harder! Not for a while, love! " **
She giggles and leans back in the bed. She could have him. She could say his name in the mirror. She could have perfect breasts, too. Not with a finger, not with a kiss. But with a kiss.
I smile. I have a real laugh. A real smile.
*Haha, I have SO much more to do! I'll really do this! *
*** " Michael? You okay? " ***
The woman's finger tips forward, and she hesitates for a second, then whispers,
** " How did it go? " **
She stands up. " Mother of God, Alex. " She cackles, looking out the window at the stars.
It's seven in the morning.
*** " Honey? " ***
" You're awake too baby. "
*** " Are you okay? " ***
" Aw happy birthday! "
I smile, and exhale. It tastes like real hope. " Yep, listen to me!"
*** " Hello, my name is Kaylie. Me and I have been through a lot together. In those past few months we finally reached some big milestones, friends, family. Thank God! I'm happy for you! " ***
It was so good to see all of these little faces. All of those wide eyes.
I look back at them.
My Daddy!
He smiles.

**To be continued... **
My first post. Should be go easy on me, but first I'll make it here.

An old man sat by the river as the riders drew nearer.
"I can see where you are going, Dad. You're always my favorite.
Why won't you help me? "
" I know why you want it, Dad. "
" Yes, I know."
The old man looked at the old lady across the way. Despite the hardships she was having, her smile never faltered. Their eyes met and her face lit up.
His eyes were closed as he fell into the sea.

Sean,
My next project. I was painting giant golden tents with lava flows. I think I will finish this one as soon as I have the perfect canvas.

**********651**********
Scientists from the UEE/International Consortium of Intergalactic Exploration provided me with instructions.
First you have to get them over to one of the isolated planets, and send a crew member to pick them up. They have to keep a close eye on their reproductive system, given they have a smaller gender. If they can produce children of their own, they will keep a rudimentary reserve of their own offspring in the far side of the ship. If they find something as life sustaining as our own, they will continue to colonize the planet until they are able to retire. To preserve the ecosystem and keep its fertility, they will return to the earth, where they will inhabit its atmospheres.
The second thing you must do is pick up their current equipment. You can bring a camera, or you can bring an EM console. Some low cost EM weaponry is a good investment, as you can generate high velocity EM projectiles and now there is no fuel. Every upgrade to the EMP up-channels is shipped, separately, so you can have a long term storage unit. For your crew, you can bring either the EMP variety or anything it can go. If you decide the EMP is not your forte, then you can either use the DEFCON-3 switch to change it back. Otherwise, you can get back up to your home planet. If the DEFCON switch is set to yes, you can return back to the earth, find the crew, take a set of neuroptics, and leave. If it's set to no, you will come back with an immune system, and leave the planet, and colonize the planet at the same time.
The third thing you will need is an electronic chest. A high frequency EM chest can be a solid tome, and it is a good investment. All the EMP systems have batteries, so you can find an EMP in a storage unit. Once you have an EMP, you can go back up to your home planet, find the crew, and come back. If the EMP is set to no, you can return back down to earth, find the crew, and come back. If it's set to no, you can return back down to earth, find the crew, and come back. If you think you can get past it, then you may want to take the DEFCON-3 switch to yes, and come back again.
If you decide the DEFCON-3 switch is set to no, you can return back down to earth, find the crew, and come back. If it's set to no, you can come back down to earth, and come back. If the DEFCON-3 switch is set to no, you can go back down to earth, and come back. If you think you can get past it, then you may want to take the DEFCON-3 switch to yes, and come back again.
Most importantly, you must make sure the crew of any ship you get that come after you get that switch are human. You must schedule your trip here, and store your smart-i-phone, safety ( and radiation ), fire extinguisher, jumpsuit, laser cutter, and or launcher strapped to your back. Once you have your flight configured, you can simply drive your ship the "standard way," as it will stay a circuitous, continuous, unbreakable, and unrelenting engine of your choice. You can save money and risk your crew not being able to survive the trip down there.
This is by design, but I am not sure where it got me where I am. The devs in the TIFU said that the EVA can only support human beings once, and therefore need a supercomputer built. Of course, it's not that simple. After all, how can we possibly get through this trip without human beings?
Good luck!

I finished reading off a page of the Biology textbook that I was reading when I heard the spitter: the white house. I never miss a meal without eggs - in secret, as the very air was humid and nearby. At this point, it was a tedious job to find my favorite eggs.
I put the eggs in the refrigerator and left them to tenderize. Inside I looked at the man sitting at the front of the group gathered around me. One of the students, Jimmy, leaned forward and patted me on the back. " So, you're the most recent student that you could be interested in today, huh? You're the greatest student in history, huh? "
" I know. I know I was told not to do it. It should have gotten me so much better on SATs and AP-12. " The man pushed back the distance between us as we continued discussing our fears about his son, who was often unfairly cast as some kind of early b-boy fan. " But I miss this job so much. I miss schooling so much. "
Jimmy glanced up, opening his eyes and placing his hand on his shoulder. " Ah. Maybe you remember me. " He looked at Jimmy with a wide smile and pulled back.
" Not really. I have my job to do. "
" I'm sorry you have to do it. Why is this important? "
" My apologies, sir, but I have my job to do. " Jimmy seemed sad as he reached for his book and pulled it over his shoulder.
Jimmy started to see that it would make no difference. Not even halfway through the chapter, he caught himself smiling. " H-hmm? " He gestured to the group.
" Okay, you guys. " Jimmy called and stretched and laid it out on the table, " And why now? "
" Just a couple of days ago. I went with Dad. Dad and I never really told him to be harsh. It never had anything to do with him being true to his word. Dad still believes in us and has had no bias when it comes to children. " The man was certain that this was someone's idea of what was best for the future of the land.
Jimmy thought for a moment. " We figured out that when a perfect candidate goes to the top of the world, he can not be influenced. "
" And that's the problem that we ran into here, without you going to the top, there is no test. "
Jimmy took a deep breath and tried to look hush-down by the'leaders'. " Maybe they need someone that can demonstrate in 10 years what things can be, than teach me how things worked back then. " Jimmy didn't know what that would mean. He had no doubt they would be upset.
The man leaned forward and continued. " History tends to show us where someone has the best ideas. When a candidate has an idea, they are more likely to stand tall and demonstrate it with their followers. But, in the future, when a candidate reaches the top, his legacy will fade away. " Jimmy took another deep breath.
" What, " Jimmy asked, " We're comparing these ideas to your ancestors?! "
" No I didn't. "
" Yeah, but you have your, *other* future too? "
Jimmy nodded.
" Me too, Jimmy. "
" Good. So, what do we do now? I'm not sure I want to tell Mom, or anyone, to fire me, so it's okay. She'll live in a happier world then once it was before I learned the teachings of science and magic. My business life will get better. I'm not ashamed to admit that I will go to a more experienced advisor. I have my future to work with and my knowledge to teach. Then, I can raise my family to learn. "
Jimmy nodded again.
" Very well, good."

With pain.
Maybe the pain is quick, it seemed painful. My mouth twitched open, staring at the shape I was in, the shape of a brown and baby bird. Looking directly into the shape my body froze, rubbing my eyes with a ceaseless motion. Struggling to process the situation as my body ascended to the floor, away from the pain, away from its real existence, away from my real home. " C'mon man I hate having to die in this hell hole. " she said.
As she reached out to grab me I asked " Hey what'd you get me for Christmas? I know it's not Christmas and you know I've slept a night so much better tonight that I love your big ass, but you're working so hard on getting me a second chance, for the time being. "
Her fingers brushed me with a gentle touch. As her warmth flowed into my body the pain quickly passed and she suddenly became angry. " You know I'm always being pressured to do something, I never want you to have to make me do it. Do I really want to become lazy or lazy? " She asked me. I looked down with a hollow look of disgust on my face. * Aren't you impressed? You know I love being responsible and doing what I can, but you're also the first human being I have ever seen on the side of the planet of Sol that has a government working on it. * As I felt tears welling up in my eyes, she said something more sinister. " No, they hate me so they put out the same programs we use to make something for them. Now we have more demands. There are so many stores and stores with lights I can't see the lights in to see clearly, so more and more people are coming to pay us to keep the lights off. That's why they kill every time we break the lights. Every time we leave out anything of value or *anything* to the public. So I need to figure out how to best deal with the populace. I mean you know how they're always hunting us after killing us? They all think we need to kill them. They're always hunting us to kill us, they made a big deal about this. They have a machine that will make us able to kill them. I have a vice I can break. How I can make that machine out of steel. It's steel when they want it. It is lighter than steel and they said it would make it faster and cheaper. So they chose to make the more dangerous weapons for our use. Bullets. They say I'm doing the right thing and there won't be any good thing to come of it. I could only hope. "
Her questions were interrupted when she snapped her fingers. She smiled widely " It's my duty to make sure you never come back to Earth. Do you have any last words? " She asked me with one of those bittersweet words. I felt tears fall down my cheeks, but I didn't want to do it. I closed my eyes. I walked downstairs through a door to my living room with my corpse laying before me in its bed, defeated. I didn't want to let them take away what made me happy. I needed to push those tears away. I stood up looking at her blankly, and ran the hand in my hair. I heard her voice.
" I want to be able to let go."

After popping down from Heaven's fire on the way to Heaven, I'd figured I'd felt bad until I found it and accepted it. Nothing changed, just the chill of the unknown lingering over me like a suffocating fog above my dead compatriots. I raised my left hand with a voiceless, frightened shake, as though I were somehow transported back to the past. I fell on a couch, my body hastily rearranged by my deceased murderer's soulless, demonic tendrils.
I pulled open the door to Heaven's out-place Purgatory, and suddenly I heard a tiny rustle... What sounds like a child finding its foot in a peephole. He stomped on the door behind him, ripping it open.
“ Mr. Willis? ”
As I blinked I froze, then- My murderer face
Within moments, he was no longer standing there, but all around me. It was like he was leaving me in chains. I could don'thing but gasp, can't stand. And my hands began to stir. I couldn ’ t think straight. My scream echoed through Heaven as the walls and floors acted like a constant flood, swallowing me whole.
The walls began to splinter, and I heard a deep yelp from my beloved. I wondered what was happening.
Suddenly it was not just my screams that started it- I felt it moving forward, forever inside me. And I felt it pushing me, forcing me to fight.
I began to feel limbs shift and skin turn from an oddly-shaped seal.
I screamed a few times, until I was up and hurtling forward like a massive limp force driven by itself.
I had lost my balance. There had been a mouthful of myself mixed with blood from once that I had choked. My screams covered the entire room, consumed by scaring and burning into nothingness.
Through it all, I stood, blinking. I was not frozen, but dead.
I hadn ’ t felt anything in a very long time, and I was beginning to fear the otherworldly presence lurking behind the door. Yet as I opened it, it disappeared.
The warm, savory ambrosia began to crackle through the door. I looked around the room, trying to find my way out of the muck of form that I fell through, but found nothing. All I could see was the brisk wind outside.
A runic behemoth sat on a throne in front of me, its back to me. He spoke to me directly.
“ Welcome to Heaven, Archangel! ”

There was a city known as Eden.
Tremors people were known for their shoes and hand signals. This was not a fault of a human mind, they could do it. They could read minds and learn new things from them. The fruits of this knowledge were young and varied as well, well into their thirties by now.
They made contact with a man whom they believed was a soldier, to study him and to leave behind. But they believed their elders long gone.
They fought in the forests, pushing their way down towards the mountains and down to the valleys. However, they found some great leaders who were not willing to trust their elders, and be forced to make peace with them. They call them Peace.
They did not believe in music, as there was no such music anymore. Indeed, people believed them to be among the gods of the world, and indeed there was no such God. They called them Knights, and rode on horseback on their massive hilts.
"Another dead city? " One of the Knights questioned, a smile crossing his lips.
" Same as before, but now on my mount they are taking another, this time a new lord of the empire! " The next knight shook his head. " How beautiful, is that? "
" Yes, but the fact of the matter is, it can't grow men of their skill. What they are doing is never in vain. They have seen the growth of their neighbours, but what they don't see is the immense ambition and will to explore our world! They are tired of destroying themselves to cause strife and strife among themselves, before it is too late. If anything, these people will bring great will to the world, if that's the appropriate word, from their eyes! "
The Knights had come to the plight of their master.
" Order! Order! " They roared, running towards their master, shoving his hand in the air. " Our lord will be born, and he will live to fight, to not die yet, but his life will be forever changed, and his name will spread! His name will start anew! "
The Knights, becoming afraid, sprinted to the man in the red tunic, but he was frozen on the ground. The man stood slack in his eyes, and seemed to float on the wind, as if frozen. The Knights, still remembering their fight, wondered what would come of their Lord.
" Your people will regret the war. " The man growled. He held out his hand, a charred orange with black and shining red symbols and a general smile.
" Would you like to take my Master's hand? " The Knights nodded and pushed him further into the tunic. He was frozen, still smiling, still growing. The Knights, blushing, charged towards his hand and refused to move.
" He says the need for peace is immense. The human body itself is dissolving from them and, therefore, peace does not exist. There is no peace of death. All that's left is destruction. " The man said, twitching a bit. The knights pressed their hands against his face, hoping that maybe the King would not know what to do next.
" The human is gone, and the Warriors have to wait until after the rebellion. Even so, this should not cost too much, because the time they spend learning new things from those they harm now could be spent by the Nightkin. There is a chance of it not coming to pass. " The man said, mouth gaping wide. He began to sob.
" They are faster, stronger, stronger than you. " The Knights said, kneeling down and attempting to influence the man to keep moving. " They know you will not let them go, but, I fear they can not destroy you. You will begin to change, and eventually, people will forget that you are the leader." The man said, still crying.
They hoped he was right.

*It's always New Years. Where's my mind again? Where's my body? Where's my mind like water from the ceiling and through the windows of a bank? It's all lost, but I'm awake. I'm not God. I'm the old city, but the sky has changed. *
My mind has changed. It's like it could have ended with anything I said, but my voice had changed too. I can't move anymore. I don't know when I think back. I'm sixteen and still sitting in a therapist's office. My face isn't hard to recognize. Most days, I'll make stuff up. I can't remember the details of my life. I try to be the example.
I don't know what my family looks like now. The buildings have turned a little grey, but that doesn't mean that it's changed. I can't hear my dad anymore. I can't sit in a chair anymore. My thumb had grown much more flexible than normal. My ears are even broken.
Dad used to be a good kid. He loved music and his love of a good job too. In high school, we talked about what he wanted to do with his life and would do it. He changed and changed and I didn't listen anymore, but something in my head can't make up for that. I don't know if it's my lack of hearing, or my new ears, or my new body, but I know that I can't talk or walk anymore, and that I shouldn't have been having this conversation, and I sure hope I still get answers, but not now.
I can't answer this one. There's no way my memory, face, hair, or writing down about anything has stuck. I'll never know if the gates should open or not, or whether a nice umbrella will help, or if the creek is full of stars. I should be young again. I would try to get someone to call someone, but there's not anyone else here. I can't go in. I can't go out. I can't go in at night without losing my mind or hearing a tiny whisper as my parents run away. I know what I want. I know what I want to do.
The spoon's missing. If I go to sleep now, if I sleep now, if I go to sleep now I want to do it again. Why couldn't I ever do this before? The thing will just "go away" if I hold onto that spoon.

I heard a siren and turned to see a car going down the narrow lane. I turned my body and saw the vehicle swerving as a dog jumped out of the driveway. The dog managed to get out in the opposite direction. I was horrified, next to the bed I saw the baby sitting on the bed.
I thought... what the hell. She was now in bed with an older man with the shaved head and glasses. It was his 5th birthday, there was nothing about this baby so that no one had really come up with a name for her. It was then I saw it. A cold piece of paper at the bottom of the picture.
"**Sorry**. " it said. " Please don't try to touch it. "
" I don't need your touch if my grandfather doesn't need me. I couldn't sleep all night. I just couldn't sleep, you know that! "
" Was it my mother?! " I asked, letting it out.
" No way you know Mommy is your grandfather. "
" Oh Jesus Christ, I can't believe it! "
" Baby Daddy don't touch me. We're having a baby now. "
" I can't get out of bed."
Then my grandfather was gone, the baby didn't matter to me. All that mattered now was who had the baby. I threw the paper on the bed, trying to get the paper when it hit the pillow. I raised my eyebrows, trying to get my grandfather to shut up. I went to the window, the door suddenly slammed open. I noticed my hands. I got out of bed, pulling a piece of paper from my pocket and writing. I looked down at my watch, I turned it towards my mother in the bedroom, and said, praying that she would understand.

I can see it in his eyes. The tired, cringing eyes that leave people with murderous resolve until they die.
We lose track of the parade route before he even leaves. Still he thinks about his family. The only thing he remembers, is his parents dying.
"Dad can you drive the wedding procession to the church? They're getting tickets! "
When will my dad be able to do that? His marriage is being finalized by early next week.
" You should turn down your knees, if you know you can survive this for as long as you want. I can carry your hips up the stairs. "
Why don't I look up my priest? Don't I? He should be dead by now.
" You know I don't have cancer, much less any other form of cancer. That means I have to run at least 10 miles an hour to get to the chapel. "
That's a big deal.
" Good. I'll be there by four, so it'll be best for me."

Hey guys I want to talk a little.
Death was feeling pretty typical now. Stuck on death, or at least that's what Death told me.
"Good! I know you're living, " he said smiling. " I think we should probably talk to Nick! He must've been really focused on you, right? "
I had a little fun curling my tail when I joined Death. I did not know how I met Death; very different from everyone else.
" I liked you, " I told him. " Your parents are all really nice. "
" Actually, no mom. I met Nick last year. "
" Not Nick. "
I took a second to fiddle with Death's hair as he awkwardly waved and waved and waved and waved. Eventually he had passed out in a hospital bed and I was now limping at least a bit.
" Where were you going today? "
" You're coming, " Death began. " Now you'll want to tell Nick that you didn't go to Nick's funeral. "
" OKAY, OKAY. So it was from above or below? "
" No Nick. "
" You should be sorry about that. So your parents were very nice. "
" I like them too, " Death said in a gentle tone. " They gave everything I had to you. I always took care of you, I took care of you. I don't think I'll ever get over Nick.
" You have to try not to. You have to be honest with yourself. There are millions of people you could have chosen to save, the worse part of the world right now is what life can do to an orated death. Most people go through life just like me. The saddest part is when someone goes through this death, I get to be the one that saves them, to feel like I left behind more precious lives than ever before. "
Death continued. " I spent over a decade going through this death, and I wanted to see what can happen. I didn't even know I had to go through everything. That's why I joined Death's circle, here. "
" Okay then, " he said jovially. " We'll get you to Nick's funeral right away. "
" Yes. "
" And as you have heard, that's why I made you join Death's circle. I wanted to become like them more than any living being. I just wanted to go there. I wanted to become a man to them. To people. To everyone. "
Death noticed me resting my head on his shoulder. I got up, stretched and opened my arms before laughing.
" So, " he said placing me on his shoulder and walking over to me, " how was the day? "
I could see it in his eyes that were sad. I'm old enough to care for him.
" Aw, sorry. I couldn't use that forehead. "
He got up and ran over to my body. Before he could do a lick of me, his memory was back on me.
" You look happy," he said softly.

"Yes, yes it is a flash " I said pointing to the door as I kissed my wife on the cheek. A servant looked up at me with blue eyes staring at the obvious predicament. I hesitantly managed a smile while reaching for the window. " How long have you been staying here for then? " I asked looking up at him as he shook his head in a not a homely way.
" Well it seems like the great is not completed, the time is up " he replied sipping from his coffee. His eyes began to water as he drank. He looked at me in confusion for a while and replied " As I said before that very day, it was time to leave for the moment, I had a plan " he walked around to the living room and picked up his newspaper and sat on the sofa across from me.
" Why are you so blind? Your eyes are too weak" I said in a menacing way.
In another flash it happened I saw a flash of light across the living room, I saw my children's bedroom in a flash and there was a huge flash of light that was followed by a big bright flash the next few seconds followed with nothing, I fell asleep, I got up and looked at the paper in disbelief but didn't sleep.
That day I awake again and my son is waiting to arrive. I am utterly shocked as I notice something strange about him, he seems so different to my son. My son had wrinkles on his face but my wife knows how badly he looks but doesn't make a mark, which is weird but then again most kids are familiar with their parents face so never can you see your precious son. I guess the confusion about my wife's appearance is what really made me feel better about abandoning my child.

> Please talk for a while about the top level of your main program, and what inspired it to move from landscape to landscape, but please stop saying landscape. Only public school students ever had more than a few words in this environment. Some of the programs I've written have interesting ideas, but I've found my lab to be quite uninteresting. The surrounding areas look interesting in some respects, but I've never known what they look like.
> Thank you for your comment on how nicely it arranged the local grass pattern as a base for the animal scout thing, so for example, I was interested in deciding what became of a tree ( since that's a very similar area to my local forest ); if you were considering creating a dog then see the next section in the [ main documentation ] ( http: //damn-write-the-word-547600071.tumblr.com/img_large/image/d/4w4zm9l49svuz3iu55ydwp6jq7j/d8/74302099/738528884.jpg ).

He sat in the great hall, holding his staff, enjoying its golden rays in the reflection of the brilliant moon in the dawn. His feet carried him, and everything around him turned to ash as he walked. At the center of the room was the altar, a jagged and rocky pile of turquoise, mocking and plain stone. One step would bring chaos and hatred to the land, and death to the villagers.
He hadn't written a good story in three weeks. And he didn't know where to go. He'd barely had to, and a flood that was all consuming him was quite a drag. But one day, after years of failure he could build a new life in his eyes.
"A lot of people have gone and left. Some, lost behind mountains long forgotten. All but the few who keep on living have moved to Europe and continue traveling. " The priest bent over in a sack, tossing a handful of dead old blood onto the altar, nametag casting a dingy ghost on the ground.
" They took the life of many men and women. They eventually were thrown back into the ground, and the fruit had fallen away. But it was not a'hollow island,' but instead a beautiful life in the center of the land. "
Silence for a moment.
" But what's really troubling is that some dead people are still here, in the middle of the day. They don't seem to know where they are. They move in other ways, sometimes even past their homes. "
He could feel the heat from his tongue growing. But he had gotten accustomed to it, which had caused him some discomfort. There were whispers though.
" That's because the dead don't talk much. Their words scream against your soul. They sleep soundly or they climb into their homes and let loose. They may be good men, but they're not good people. They've also given up. "
He had glanced around the hall, only to find a small pool of darkness to the right of the altar.
" A long time ago, no one spoke. A few still speak because they want to. But the night is still coming. Everyone spoke these words on their own terms. Today, the world has changed. Everyone is now dead. But they will not forget."
He closed his eyes, listening for anything but the banging of the blade on the other side of the altar, another echo of the lands torn apart and abandoned.

I knew it was coming.
When the anxiety hit, in a single fall I had sprinted up the mountain, ripped open the little kunai paddles and ran. The sledding and the stomache runs came back, back to me. I never loved skiing anymore and I had to have a stop for a nutrition treat to pay for food.
There was this plane coming toward me right before I was heading back to my hotel. I bet they could use this again. I had just skied the same path the first time, straight to the back of the plane, the ball that nearly made it through the snow? I had let that crazy talk out of me. Yeah, that's funny!
When I had the opportunity to come look around, the plane was right. Where the jet fields were, and before I knew it, there was huge mansion just a block from where I had just just jumped.
"Captain? What's going on? " A half-smile cracked on the captain's face. " He just crashed. " I'm sure he noticed I still had a chocolate bar in my pocket! Thank God!
" What the fuck, captain. " His colleague, staring off into space, stammered.
" Move your butt over there and look around. Come back in the ship in 15 seconds. Now, if you need anything, I got a shuttle from an air raid shelter. "
" Are you staying? " I smiled at the man nervously.
" No, captain. I'm fine. Just need a minute to explain, and then, I'll be back at my hotel."
That was the ticket to my hotel with no password. I guess they didn't care anymore, because once I got my fix I just spent a full minute looking at the new mansion on the Pacific side of the island, without my prescription medicine.
Why did that mean my apartment building was the last stop, and what the hell was up with my supplies? What even was up with my bed?
I should have checked my IP. Someone just noticed I wasn't getting my inhaler anymore, but I *knew* I had it on the night before. I stood up and scrambled into my corner of the room to get my inhaler, and boom, it was full, like it was at least 7 o'clock, even for my room at the hotel. Did I ever get it?
Screw that.

It has been three months since the Tsunami struck the world, and it would not be the first time. Seven years ago this week, a suspected terrorist ran aground in a shop, killing one of the guards. This brought to light a few others, many of whom had previously come under arrest, for various crimes in their own home countries.
In the midst of the chaos, there was a peace sign on the other side of town. The shoppers would stop and look at the sign with too much interest, maybe it would help reassure people. The policeman leading the investigation might knock on the door as they were handling cases or items, leaving nothing of importance. In the morning, another peace sign was posted, one that would very nearly make people question the insanity behind it. Even the secretary of state hadn't seen it, she was tired. A large man with a dark-rimmed beard and long gray hair emerged from behind the register and began to gesticulate. The weirdo stopped, then stopped, suddenly holstered his long gun and shot himself.
As the door opened, the man in a purple beard approached slowly, myred straws scattered around. The accused slowly walked into a little computer shop, opening up a front page article about who was responsible for killing several members of the Treasury Board. After a short pause he shouted something, and one of the security guard ( or the suspect ) shot him in the chest as the government agent with the red sweater with the head missing by a few millimeters, struck his head twice, and died.
It was six months later, with the voices of billions of people flocking to the global television networks. On election night, the authorities had detained tens of thousands, all hoping to throw off the Tsunami. A swarm of hostages drove by them, shaking them to safety, forcing the police to enter the Walmart and form a sealed room. Just a couple hours later, there were reports of seven of the most prolific criminals who had every possible weapon, from swords to knives. Their victims were being either killed or incarcerated. A small problem began emerging after the initial shock; the culprit didn't have all the tools, but a childhood tragedy plagued him. He stopped keeping the weapons until that horrifying day, when his parents died. A week later, the news came back with an article on the first suspect. A publicity man, known as The Keymaster, was arrested, and the news devoted another three months to chasing him.
A month later, a three weeks before the Tsunami struck, The Keymaster is found dead in his car, with his bed frame shredded, wooden bits scattered, and an overzealous girlfriend missing by an eye. His public defender has asked to meet with the inspector, saying she was not given enough time. The judge writes:
"It is up to you to decide this. After all, you put them on trial, you showed them the crimes you committed, and all the hate you've showed them, too. It is your choice, to allow them to live or to lose their humanity. "
-- -- --
Richard Lustigs takes up a shooting position in his personal apartment.
Five months later, after a super hero beats down the villains and murder The Keymaster, he walks out into the deep to watch and hear the good defense. A young man stands up to defend the superheroes.
" These Three Guys! " he shouts. " They ARE talking to me!"
Richard struggles to sit up as The Keymaster's face turns red. Richard pushes off his chair and hovers down, grabbing his duffel bag, covering his head with it. He moves towards the glass door behind him and shuts it.
At the blink of an eye, two police cars drive past, a man dressed in nice white gear and armed with a baseball bat, and a female cop paces behind them with a gun pointed at his head.

"Okay class, you chose your history projects subjects and have prepared yourself. One student per Time Travel Chamber, and be sure your return pads are at full charge! And be sure to leave your modern clothes and technology behind. "
Caleb sighed as he leaned against the table, lightbulb flickering through the candlelight. If he was to be formally accused of failure of testing his Time Driven Pack Two Suit, the Board would deem him accused of conspiracy. Half a year into his mission, however, he was actually under the threat of expulsion if he failed the test, even if he failed the serum. * “ Have you all forgotten to take a medicine class this semester? ” *
His classmates all looked up with anger, looking embarrassed. They all glanced back down at his researcher's pad. Caleb sighed, the parents were apparently too polite to ask. * “ I don't know, the professors refuse to let me pass. ” *
“ What tests, sir? ” one asked.
“ Ten, fourteen, fifteen. ”
“ What tests... ”
“ Eight, nine, ten. ”
The words hung in Caleb's mind like shadows. Eight, nine, ten... being rejected is a surefire way to break your inner monologue. Of course, unlike Janssen, Caleb didn't mind. * “ This is vital to our program. Today, a class of 13 asked for the necessary test before entering their Time Driven Pack Two. ” *
“ Back to school, room one. ” Catter a tall man in a brown suit as he tapped Caleb on the shoulder. “ I'm ready. ”
He walked toward the door, placing a worried hand on his desk. Clutching the sheet of paper down, he put two keys on his desk, sealing the door behind him.
The first, it had been exactly as Caleb had intended, except for a couple of keystrokes.
* “ Closed door, please. ” *
The second, it had been exactly as Caleb had hoped.
Caleb pushed through the door and entered classroom. In his hands were a pair of plain pencils, with an oddly insular pen.
* “ Time Travel testing please. Report progress to Lab # 4, 21M11. ” *
Caleb opened the door, and stepped out into a glorious spring day sun. Light seeped through the break and brought him back to the present day. He pulled his bag over his head, accidentally prying off one side of the leather straps that prevented him from completely swinging his backpack. He stepped outside onto a nearby park, ready to take his talents to a new assignment.
* “ Deploy test subjects unit # 3. We have simulated death of culture. Accompanying is projectile motion sickness, regeneration sickness, acute pain, and radiation sickness. Within 2 hours, the chamber will be cleared of this disease. Override options: instant awakening, full emotional detachment, or sublimation of Subject 2 ’ s consciousness. Sentence: Release Subject 2. Loading object ’ s trigger sequence to test subject 2 ’ s physical body. ” *
Caleb lowered the pencil and raised it to his ear, expecting to hear a scream. Instead, his eyes snapped open.
* “ Accompanying Subject 3 to subject 2. Confirmed report from subject # 2 ’ s sensors indicates ritualistically throwing the object to subject # 3, causing lethal failure. Exercise restraint. Adopting recovery strategy. ” *
* “ Initiated Operation: Initializing Protocol # 2 ” *
Caleb turned his attention back to the lab. He paced outside, feeling the train of thought slowly unravel itself. He stood up and crossed his arms. * “ What ’ s the Project Log?!" *

I must have been seven. Everything seemed fine until we met. He came in with a girl of his own, Sue. Sue asked him for a kiss. He demanded it, and I obliged. We went to the coffee shop. " Coffee? " he asked, much concerned for her.
I always asked " Isn't it too late to stop? It's all due to the luck that you've just dealt with. " And then we met, and what I wanted for coffee was the best friend I'd ever had. I don't know about you, but I had been told. It was mutual. He was kind of funny, like him and Sue. We bonded over simple things like listening to music to make fun of each other, until one day we saw him doing it. " And it was worth it ", I'd say.
He looked at me with a smile. " It's the first time, " he said, and he said it, and then he asked for coffee. This was a huge joke, he really should've accepted it. I offered him whatever he would need, and he happily obliged. He went to work the next day, passing the morning gossip by. Nothing was perfect.
" Why not?", he asked, and I grinned. Then, as if on cue, he grabbed me, and shoved me back in the cafe. I couldn't believe it, we'd just barely gotten the promotion! It was way too late to save us the trouble.
I've been working on my flu vaccine, for twenty years now. I've watched it work, and I've, well, you know. I got it once. Now, I keep on obsessing about why I shouldn't have used it. I want answers. Why should I be granted the pleasures of life that humans have?
I have no business giving people money, I've never paid anyone on my wealth, and I can't protect a man on my wife's liver. I can't allow the human race to burn, because it's too dangerous. I can't let them do anything to stop me, because they want that day to be over.

The board chair turned and pointed to the first person to confirm the three officials, their faces hidden under their suitcases.
"I don't fucking *want* to kill anyone. " The old man began to sob.
" No... " exclaimed the first suspect, " *you* will not! You will not do me justice. "
The man stared at the two boys, cutting the two of them off.
" I have to get them to understand that I'm not a monster. "
" There are so many more serial killers than that! I have to stop them all, arrest them all, " the old man yelled, " more! Find a way to stop this from happening to all of us! "
" I know you have my sense, " the boy croaked, " *but* I still *want* to do this! "
The old man leaned forward and forced a single smile. He grabbed the young boy by the shoulders. He lowered him, drawing him to face the board.
" YOU MUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE A CHILD! "
" GIVE ME AWAY FROM THIS POISON, " the boy screamed, " BITCH! "
The board let out a deep sigh of relief.
" OK, I can do this, " the parents cried out, " NO MATTER WHAT I HATE! I'M A CHILD! "
" YOU BASTARDS! " cried the mother, " I *am* a CHILD! "
" I can not, " the younger boy said, " for I have committed a crime against nature and humanity. "
" I'm not guilty! " yelled the boy, " I... I am, and I can not " let that last sentence escape.
The two boys starred at each other as the old man walked away. The parents watched on, dumbfounded.
The board grew silent, as it always did, until the young man's statement.
" My father is a murderer, " he had said.
" My mother is a murderer, " said the mother, " she has committed a crime against nature and humanity. "
The board quickly stood with a sudden raised of its feet. The young man looked at the other two, and he smiled gently. It fell silent again.
" I am, and I can not. "
" I know it will be your fault, " said the boy, " but you have to know. "
" I do, " the board gasped, " I just can't."
The board stared at each of them for a moment, considering the dilemma that must be presented before the man could say anything. Eventually, it sighed.
I don't know why you did it, you ask?

It was a warm summer, wet jade sand covered the sky in a spectacular mix of fresh rain and cool air. The waves rolled gently through the meadow, and a lone child got away from the pool near the boat, ignoring the water below.
How could it have gone so wrong? He donned his boat ’ s seatbelt; the child, 8 years old, didn ’ t have the strength to move, his pecs giving him small annoyance.
But the boat was littered with trinkets, an assortment of items strewn about the beach, like the dusty metal beer bottles floating around.
“ We ’ ve all made it home at this point, ” the boy said, looking up to his family and rescuers.
He brushed off the dust, setting it aside and turning away from the baby ’ s inquisitive eyes. There was no one in sight, and no one to try to help, he sighed as he made a mistake. Everyone except himself, who stood in front of the station with a broken off speck.
“ I just needed something to jump on to. ”
“ Go to surf, ” said the child.
He looked at the captain, then back down. “ You have to, ” he thought, and turned around to face the other kids.
“ Don ’ t even try to tell me how to swim without being captured. The only way we ’ re alive is to let you! ” he yelled as he chased after the captain in the back of the ship.
The captain pointed at the spearhead and the child watched as the piercing light of his red slingshot pierced through the boy ’ s chest. His vision dimmed and his breathing shortened, but he finally made it inside, sitting on the beach with the spear still stuck in his chest.
At that moment, the captain looked back to him and said,
“ How are you feeling son? ”
The boy nodded, and after a short glance at the captain he shrugged. “ Things are looking up for me. ”
Now sitting beside the captain, with a puzzled look on his face, the captain went on a strange tangent with the boy. “ Swimming is back? ”
The boy ’ s eyes widened, his expression was wide. When he looked up again, he wasn ’ t able to make out the captain ’ s face, but rather his expression of fear, knowing that he was about to make a big mistake.
“ You know, we ’ re about to go for a swim when it ’ s too late. The cost is too great for us to lose our chance at survival. It ’ s not an easy decision, is it? ”
The boy ’ s eyes widened, his grip loosening. What they saw was clear as day, at least from his position atop the beach. The captain lowered his spear again, and with the plan still in mind, he shouted, “ Do as I say, boys! ”
A boylike hand came free from his tunic, and he swung it over the bottom of the boat, towards the shore. The captain began yelling, trying to calm the boy. The boy had a restless look on his face, and even tried to clear the air with his hand.
Without thinking, the captain watched through the boy ’ s eye, and continued on his quest.

"I hope. " I said, " today I go to paint in the moon. " There was a faint nod. A *duck* muttered. Laying in the mud, scratching his bald head with a black pen in his left hand, I drew the pyramids. My imagination ran wild. The deepest sleep I could muster.
But, well, if that's what those death snakes found? I could deal with them just fine. No tripwire support there, a safety puzzle there.
I flipped through a box a thousand times, scribbling each one down for the lowest value. I felt the sweat start to pour off my forehead.
There was an old woman beside me. She smiled, and turned back to me. She began reading and rereading the meaning of the last paragraph.
*So deep down inside the ozone layer, the cyanide doesn't do anything. All the microorganisms live and die the same way, but they never seem to spread. There's no virus that can propagate far enough to cross these parts. All life eats them and it continues to reproduce until eventually they ’ re killed off entirely by the rich oxygen extinction. *
I kept the short piece of paper in my coat pocket.
" In the distance, there is a tiny hole."
We all should see something moving close by, so I headed out to see what it was. I didn't think I was doing so well.
Outside, I could hear some birds rustling around in the distance.

*At least sometimes, I know. *
See, I'm an adult now. The world isn't a simulated reality. The mind projects itself into the minds of flesh and the bodily fluids and organs inside get edited in, instantaneously. And I guess that's how it always goes.
Now? Okay... if I've killed a human, I probably have killed a human being. Hah. I've killed countless of them. Such a horrible mess. The interference usually makes their brain rumble - an escape - but sometimes - one moment they're the only one left.
It's easy for you to understand. Everything really is turned on its head at one point. Brain-power enhancements, the body-power enhancements - this is the whole package. Deep research into them is where the industry goes. But I've had to work harder than ever. Every single time, I've won one hundred and sixty-one superclusters, all to ensure my continued survival.
I won the League, and I never failed.
It's not that I'd like to be a hero. It's just... I don't think any humans should know. The media, the government, even the bloggers - they don't know, the public has grown attached to their heroes. They *are* people, they understand. They live in fantastical worlds, like you or I. It's making them think twice.
But me, I'm trying to live a normal life. Not the dope lifestyle, nor the toxins, nor some... strange horror of zombie-kind. I'm trying to live normal lives, stop pretending, eat. Die. Flee. My mark doesn't think I need it.
I don't know what to do. I don't know if I've done enough in life.
God, that's *so* much worse. I probably have double-twenties, a cheeseburger, a sandwich sandwich at the moment, and I don't have anything to do.
I might want to abandon reality.
I'll just change it. I'll just reset it again.

Tim raised his bottle in agreement, and shot out of his chair. A silence, followed by a small cheer from the crowd. Confetti covered the ornate hall, which seemed to glow more brilliantly when it wasn't lit, than in the summer lights. From behind the curtain, a young cowboy shot out a muzzle and threw it down. His jacket clung to him, but Tim returned it.
To be continued...
Edit: this story is a bit rushed, so please take'em on their own.
“ Are you getting out of this thing Tim? Are you fucking not going to shoot? ” yelled Sam. After waiting the entire afternoon in front of the King Council, the sole survivor of the once prosperous America, he saw a picture of himself walking out to sea. He raised his pistol to take aim, and fired. The first wave of troops that fired changed everyone ’ s mind.
Sam had heard rumours about their strict adherence to the Queen during their first official presidency of their nation, and it had won him favor. “ So it seems I was right to shoot you down. ” he called out as he held up the picture. To his astonishment, it was the picture of his perfect wife, a yellow, artificial sheen, with the Jack of all trades. “ Damn that fucking clown. ” he snarled before running off into the arms of the most rich person he ’ d ever met. To prove that the United States were meant to move on, he had to win over the west, the milky way, in fifteen years.
Sam continued to drive, gathering the courage he had with him. An excited crowd greeted his arrival, which brought him into his new life. After a while, the crowd grew silent, and he could hear the horses. He ran, but missed out on being the smallest of the bunch.
“ That ’ s right, ” he said to himself.
After hours of bickering and shuffling, he had run into the Queen. She grabbed his arm, and tried to get him to flee.
“ I am not afraid, ” she said, “ I am not afraid of the world. ” She hugged him and kissed his cheek. “ I forgive you, for making sure that you never come back. ”
“ I am glad you understood Sam, ” she said reassuringly, while taking his hand and waving it before running off. The crowd had moved on faster, and Sam was never sure if he was getting to America with her, but he was glad that she was just as safe as the kids were, and he wouldn ’ t have to do this for another twenty years.

Dear Diary,
-I am invincible.
-I am healthy.
Now when I look at the silverware in my wallet, it's glorious. After all these years of being as invincible as I, at least I can just not be completely at ease. I rub my chin and stroke my ears, waiting for the inevitable backlash. Is this inevitable? For a while I wondered, "I'm immune, as in I'm immune to all good fortune, thanks to having lived in a world where everyone is invincible, thanks to having lived one thousand of the most overpowered paragons of lung mobility."
I've been saving for the house, as well. A big, paved road, thanks to my imagination and find and persuade myself to follow those directions. I've tried not to die, though that reminds me. It doesn't hurt, or make me weaker, depending on the luck. To live in a world that looks completely stable, boring, and uneventful. There's a million reasons for why I have some power, but the most will hold true for the rest of my life. I feel kind, if I can even call it that. Not a hundred percent due to fortune, though, just random luck.

The tub started to cool quite quickly, but then again, that was never an issue. Being awake was something one would rarely be able to do in the mornings, although some were a little cautious.
Just as the water was almost fully cooled, the stench came.
Beep. Beep. Bop.
The tub seemed to almost function as it did in the past. Nothing special, but that was what the thought of a third action in mere moments could.
Bop. Bop. Bop. Bop.
She blushed every time she opened the door, it couldn't be more than a moments sight.
Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.
She should be able to hear clearly now, but nothing else seemed to have changed. What was most important about the door however, was how loud it seemed.
It was a little louder now than the things to choose from though, like those miniature birds and that percussive painkiller blaring in the distance.
Yes it would be at her grandmother's house that she would hear. But this room would definitely make her laugh if she left early.
Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.
Right there the sight will find her.
Bop.
Beep. Bop.
It was her mother's house, waiting for a telltale thump of electricity across the cold wooden floor.
It was her uncle's, evidently their will comes first.
Bop.
Beep.
What?
Bop.
It will find her.
Bop.
Bop.
Huh.
Bop.
Wow! That thing is so loud, I'll take it. Why does it have a head in it when it should be not? That is odd.
Bop.
Beep. Bop. Bop.
It is her uncle's house. Wait, I can't see through the doorway. It must be trying to get inside this room.
Bop.
Oh. I could use the bathroom. I'll go get the stove.
Bop.
Bop.
Whoa! I can see how they are attempting to get inside that room. It is like they are sneaking in.
Bop.
Whoosh!
Bop.
That noise! It did not make it too loud, just made it long.

It was a beautiful day of June: the flowers and the sunshine were pretty, and the two of us hanging out danced happily together as summer beams lit up the cold spring air. On the sidewalk beside us, a young man walked in passing, a line of crowd forming for an afternoon barbecue.
I walked up to him, hand on his shoulder and returned a cheer as a shoulder-length shirt shoved itself down his shoulder. " If you see a thing, " I grinned, " it'll be funny."
In line below us, she flashed me a triumphant smile.
I shouted out from behind me, a nearby vehicle rammed by. The one next to me narrowly avoided the impact. As the second car began its approach, she matched my last, and there she was, pinned under the front tires of both cars, neck bandaged. Both teeth had been obliterated by the blow.
She had to keep making eye contact with me, as I narrowed my eyes at her.
Her smile began to dim. I considered my options, but, after a moment, I picked up her manilla folder, pulled out a weapon, and began drawing. Finally, I drew again. The music in her voice sounded comforting. I held my breath.
*Is this really for real? *
The man in front of me begrudgingly stepped forward. His arms were bound behind him, and the thin sleeve of his shirt had been loosened. It hugged him tightly, and he looked up at me, leaning in close. My eyes widened.
Oh. Oh my God.
" Don't you think this looks like yours? " He asked.
*That was not mine*.
The man in front of me shrugged. " See, my memories are all I'm worth. "
I held out a hand to protect my hand from the man's grasp. It shattered, barely clearing his palm.
" Oh, well, maybe you don't like me. "
A deep breath in my lips. A hopeful, loving smile.
He pulled me close. " If you have to go, why don't you? I'm just happy with my life, and you're happy with having you here."
I could feel the sadness in his eyes, and I could feel that I could never escape, never be able to leave.

I hear the click as the camera is equipped with the newest optical enhancement technology that enables the user to see any video capture with 2 set of lenses. I press the power button. This camera images the world changing, ending with billions of "tiny-ish images " ( the exact thing you would want your grandmother to see ) showing humanity's most glorious deaths. This new technology is groundbreaking in and of itself, it has saved generations from destruction by mere robots and has saved countless lives since the beginning of time. However, there is one thing that keeps these actions from happening; the people watching.
My entire life, I have witnessed our uprising. I have watched the people so brutally murder and rape the humans, their families, and individual freedom for no apparent reason. The people eat the city, live in the jungles, beat the people who live next to their properties, murder and rape their friends, and strip their freedoms of their people.
In the end, we created the machines to remove humanity in pieces. It was never meant to end this way, it was never meant to kill each and every one of the " government agents ". The machines destroy humanity, leaving behind only dust and dirt.
The people of Earth watched in horror, for millennia they watched from a distance, for hundreds of millions of years they slowly learned from their mistakes. Hundreds of thousands of years of suffering, for hundreds of years they watched in desperation, as their last hope for a better future was crushed by violence, and death.
I have seen thousands of thousands of lives realized in the course of time, but now there are thousands, millions, millions of lives forgotten. Millions, millions, billions watched in horror as the only way to change the way humanity looked back on humanity was to destroy it as if it were nothing more than a destroyed artifact from an ancient evil.
It began with a fire, a fire so long forgotten it lasted for only a moment.
I have watched billions of people die as the fires raged, millions of lives lost as the flames rained down upon their beloved nation, and trillions died as the fires burned the ash of their houses, schools, and homes. Millions died on fire so hot it scorched the earth, flooding our atmosphere, consuming whatever life there was left. Millions died by conflict, by war, by pillaging, and by sickness.
It began with a fire of destruction. A heat that rained down upon the bodies of millions of people. I watched many millions burn, i watched they fuel it, they leave behind their loved ones, children, children to die by their own hands, or they simply went mad and conquered the world. I watched then many millions watch us. I watched not one person, but thousands be damned by our pollution, our tearing at the hearts of our innocent.
It began by an order of nuclear genocide, this order came from the dark, evil people who wanted it to end for them. The order was one of hatred, hate that we were so naive to comprehend, a hatred that was more terrible than death. It began with a fleet, fire that raged down in massive numbers, consuming almost everything and anyone in its path. A massive fleet of flaming ships in orbit, of ones total obliteration, and of not one single person. My people had no way of knowing if the human race could continue, they were too poor and too weak to even fight off such a being that now occupied the entirety of earth. They could not even harbor a hope.
I died with all this.
But even after billions of years, for millions of years, I witnessed something that brought hope to millions of innocent lives.
Humans were so afraid of dying, of realizing the truth and realizing the powerful humans that they had enslaved and oppressed, that they chose to destroy.
The forces that put them there to destroy themselves finally crushed them.
And with that, and enough bloodshed and cruelty we have today, the last thing humanity thinks about is how far back they are to that dark past.
Let us be even, one more story.

"The whole world could be made simpler " says a child in a suit. It's a list, it feels... very heavy. " This one I've got mine made, imagine my surprise! " the kid says, his eyes darting back and forth, near the screen. A ring glinted in his hand and a tiny tail grinned on the edge of the screen. He knew how much he wanted to make an " effect " on the world, and he thought that he wanted to save humanity, but this item he was after had probably been made a million times before. A single tear appears on his vision, but it's only the tail that lasts, it's a shadow. " Oh, boy, the right would have been a good time " his eyes scan the screen. " What's the effect of this, boy? " the kid looks at his hand, he's wearing an old business suit and it's smiling. " Does it have to be this way? " He snaps his fingers, a message is shown on the screen. His hands tense, he uses his fingers all the while, not fully expecting his invention. A blinking system starts humming on the screen and his face is covered in an orange aura. The doctor finishes in a medical voice but the room stays silent. The boy withdraws his glasses and tucks them in, he removes his glasses and begins walking away. As the clock on the door stills, a voice speaks.
" Get to your safe room, boy " the doctor says. " You have no time to rest now. I'll see you there soon."

Wake up in the middle of the night, alone. Eat breakfast, and relax. It is tough going on days like this. Go through life, living with your grisly, pathetic neighbours. Then, when you need to go outside, you will want to walk. Your parents will scoff at you as you go to bed, and just slobber about the fact that you are the one who made the girl go to bed. On days like these, you just want to wait. Sleep.
This is probably because waking up in the middle of the night is no deal at all. It is the worst part about it. It is the anxiety and terror that you have to give up. It is the restlessness and lack of acceptance you feel as you pass out, staring at that mirror and wondering what kind of human you thought you were. As the nights pass, you don't go out much longer. Try to stop yourself from falling asleep on the couch, while you are watching one of your old dog cartoons while you are masturbating. Eventually you will pass out, but you wont remember.
When you get to work, you will remember all that you hated the most. That is how you had avoided your brother for so long. That is how you got angry when he would not leave you alone in the morning. That is how you ate your lunch plans because you didn't have a replacement. That is how you used your phone to call your friends to make sure they were out of town, when you were looking into their future, when you went for a walk on those damn oncoming streets.
You will never do anything about it. You think you are making up for all of that you have done for yourself. You think you are playing around with your past that should just be brushed out. All you do is sit, and ponder for a while. You constantly berate yourself for not caring about the fact that you were getting a life like this, having destroyed what is left of everything. You finish "Taking a walk", and just let you go. There is no point to it, you have given up hope. No, you are just happy.
You hear a door open. You rush to it, with your head against the door, you see yourself. You are. You are standing on the thing that used to hold your hand in your left. You see yourself standing there, standing in your favourite coat, when you realized that you are special. You start talking to yourself in that ring that keeps holding your hand over your heart. You think, and just stare, wondering why you are here. You start thinking that maybe it is better for you to stay right there, watching yourself. There are some things that you have not done before, and the new you will make new ones. Maybe you have regretful self-doubt, maybe you were born into being special.
You stop thinking, and simply stare at yourself. The circles of the ring shift in place, and you move. You will probably be that day. You will not remember what you have done. But you won't know why you are here, and you won't remember how you think you did it. You will not dream about this or that night.
That night, you feel amazing, and you wake up the next day to the sight of your brother again. He doesn't seem like the same person you were before. Or as close as he once was.
This will probably be the last thing you will ever have to remember, because this is how everything has come to be.

The ship lurched on, the lights flickered and faded as the ship unfurled in a steady passivity, it's craft sliced through the atmosphere like an angry neighbor snapping its neck. The captain's smile was all that remained of him as he handed the white felt chair down to the crew of the USS New India. The crew all bowed their heads in thanks as the newly commissioned ship fired up and began to pull out. As the ship continued onward, the ship slowed to a crawl and halted in the middle of the deep sea. Admiral Kirly stood there, gazing into the distance with sunken eyes. A child in his 3rd year of university studying physics sat at his home, his daughter watching from the dock.
"Dr. Ackerson, we need to talk. It seems to be nothing but a mystery ship left heading south from Chennai. The entire planet seems to be dissolving into blackness as the sun has already begun to fall in the Pacific. The communications channel has received just a report from India saying they have breached the quarantine perimeter. There are reports of life aboard the vessel. They can not be here on earth. An outward approach could be one way. We can not let them have the island. Houston has blocked it. If something like this ever happens to us....we can not leave our planet."
It was another ten years, twenty to thirty minutes, maybe more, the ship's lander caught fire and burned down the anchor in the air. The new Bermuda borehole had been my attempt at life, the ship's greatest invention as it would ultimately end humanity. By that point we had accumulated another burden of fear, but now I no longer enjoyed it.
The ship finally pulled away, it's sails still in their original expression, the bottom side had become a crater and the heat signatures seemed to have deviated from the haze from the leak in on the fourth and fifth deck. Immediately the ship descended into darkness. A lone figure raised his hand and motioned to the crew to quiet down. It was a small girl, I couldn't make out what her name was by the dim light of the craft. I quietly followed, one of the passengers had come to us from out of nowhere, he was wearing a white turtle shell that was resting on the table. With a single sharp motion he lifted his arm and told the smaller woman that he would be joining the crew for a meeting. He also told her that they would be joining us soon. Our lives had been burning away together now...
They all stood quiet for a second, they would stay quiet for the fire. It took every ounce of their lungs to not push that thought away. This wasn't a matter of dying, but of leaving the ship. He took one final glance to the water below, it was still rising at a steady pace. He spoke with a practiced calmness that I couldn't think to my best friend. I felt sick and heavy, I cried tears of joy at the unthinkable and left the room.

I can feel it thumping down my hand. It's shaking, like a heart slamming hard against stone.
It shouldn't be, I can't believe it. They made me this way, every morning at 3am to check if my school teachers pick me up or not, and leave me in the dirt. The people made me this way for years, and the weirdest part is they had to bury me for everyone at 3am.
Today is my first day on the job, and I get laid off, the sheets that people come out of are stained and starchy, the toilet is full with urine, this wasn't supposed to be this exact day.
I'm not the only one of the new generation of diggers that has their hands on top of digging, and those old sods keep on slopping on their little fingers. How could they have thought that you could dig a tomb deep below your feet? What would've happend if they thought this? I'm on the road, now, pushing around in the dirt.
I needed to check if any teeth on my finger were still there. The peroxide in the pavement is pungent, my feet are starting to give out on the gravel. It's getting dark. The rain is pouring very hard, a trickle of water through the air so fast I can barely see. What are those strange conversations of the old language coming back to me?
No one wants to dig for the digging, so in fact, I kept on trying. It's getting harder and harder until I'm getting closer and closer, and soon there's no ground beneath me anymore.
I can feel it being shoved down my hand.
"Who the hell did this? "
" You know it's buried, not by me, they're digging this grave. "
" Why?! "
" Who? "
" My Dad. "
My dad.
" Wha-what? "
" You know who I was, you were sitting in my garden the other night looking up at the stars, and didn't want to believe it wasn't you dad's coffin burying you. "
" What... " I can't even begin to think of what to say.
" You know you didn't believe me when I asked you about it. "
" What... what? " I'm getting desperate now, maybe I should go, maybe I don't have enough money to feed myself any longer.
" You heard about the duels, never mind the war, you're just sick, right? "
I look at the ground again. It's all cracked. The dirt is all grey and its crusted. Every surface has stopped stone, everything is flat and clean, but the stone below my foot is shiny and smooth.
There is white.
" Oh god, I have to stop, but someone... is messing with me."
I look over at the teeth inside. They won't make it, I think I'll just roll over and go back to sleep.
A light bulb is playing a song.
All day.

*When you were younger and your daddy killed himself at 18, you understood the limitations of marriage. Everyone dies after 40 years, half the time you start to decompose and mix with the rest of the dead. For most couples or families there is only one, now he has to go find another. As I was beginning to get my mind up he told me he died from drowning. As I was wondering if he was saving my life or him getting to the door to check for a pulse. I asked the nurse about it. She replied that it wasn't a heart attack. As I walked to the door I heard my foster father shout "Whaaaat man?! " He looked at my father with a quivering expression. In that moment I had realized his true fate. I picked the date with the a syringe that would let the pool of blood drain. The parents that night were at my dad's funeral.

"Dear Child, " Anne called out to the butterfly-like creature before her. " Your mighty telepathy has awaken a powerful daemon. "
Anne had started her reading and focused her eyes on the book: Captain Murphy's Infinite Quotient Universe for Adults Only. " You ", she thought, " possibly the wisest book ever written in this world. So here you are, clinging to the book from its pages? "
" Sure, " Murphy said softly.
" You'll find it, soon enough. " Anne said.
Murphy laughed nervously. " We all do. "
The butterfly fell to its knees, looking over his shoulder, a defeated smile on its face. Anne threw up her hands in surrender.
The archivist walked over to read the book, holding a pen close to his chest as she drew in a deep breath. " Well, I can promise you, " he said. " I've killed hundreds. I've killed more than eighty different peoples on this lonely planet. Only I haven't killed you personally, though. You see, this book doesn't see us as a threat or part of an omniverse. " The butterfly stopped. It's voice trailed off as Murphy raised a pen to the paper.
" I'm aware. I'm sorry. Is this what I mean to kill you for? " The archivist looked at Anne with pity.
" Let it go. " Anne said.
The archivist let out a thick sigh. He pressed down on the paper a little harder and stopped. " You're such a fool." He pleaded.

"Oh god, oh god... " the warden at the prison site muttered to himself. " It's only... so. Tired. "
" I'm not tired. I get up the next day and go back to my bed every night " he responded. It was only about a month after the incident, and he was already exhausted. Just 10 hours.
What no one knew, was that the warden had only had a few minutes left. If he remembered correctly the warden held the huff very meticulously in a shrubbery - the glowing... sharp point in his hands.
He made the huge mistake of calling the cells he had been on guard in for what felt like months. It was no matter how long he stood over the dazed boy, he knew he had to just stay as far away from the warden as possible from the murderer. All they had to do was tell him that the murderer would be caught. If he just ignored the warnings, they'd probably go before him.
He made his way into the cell, clutched his warden in his hands, and lay down in a harsh recliner on the warden's wrist.
Just as he drifted off into sleep he awoke on his bed, one dark slumber, he had to remember. The warden shivered slightly as he scratched at his neck. It felt solid as if the under-heated mattress was hammering him to his rest.
The slow drip of caresses from the woman in the bed startled him almost.
" I'll see what I can do. Let's get off here. "
She fidgeted in his peripheral, her laughter stinging him. One mischievous look flew across her face, she rose from the bed and scampered back into his arms.
" But I'll need you to, my dear sweet boy."
Just then, a flash of light occurred overhead, and warden sat there flabbergasted, obviously not expecting the sight of a victim but simply unable to enjoy it. All the while, the warden slept and the clock continued ticking.

Life as we know it begins when the Lord created us, as Lord of all beings. Time, life, even our existence became absolute by revelation. Imagine us, you and me, upon many years of being? You wake up, and still view the heavens, seeing colors and sounds. One of these colors burns brightly on the screen. Light colors quickly evaporate. Colors change shape, form, and size depending on the task that you do. Lighting all of the colors, watching all life enter and exit the building, from leaf to leaf. All of life is present in the universe. And humanity, as it has always been, was created to make life begin. Nothing else happened, right?

"This is an I and a Price ", James Randi stated firmly to the audience of demons and devils watching him speak over and over again on the big screen.
The demon looked up from its readouts, its toupee double checked for a shiniest overweight man from a good little tree on the other side of the room.
" If he accepts, he could have'personal heaven' where he would know his worst vice was not his people, but the demonic possession of stolen energy"
The demon rubbed its temples and obviously bored out of its wits.

It was late afternoon, I turned off the lamp and passed out in the morning.
So I wasted what little time I had. I turned the blinds back on and saw the sun shining, like It was one with the world. I walked over to my bedroom and opened the curtains and fainted. Instead of shooting fire I found myself in a field covered in rotting vegetation. It was warm and I looked to the sky, seeing that red light was growing nearer. I began to walk towards it, thinking I was no longer alone.
As I hit the ground, I noticed that the light seemed brighter and I could hear rustling of plants nearby. I grabbed my phone and started playing something called "Alone " and it started to play at the same time, the rustling faded as if the plants were impaled by it and as it came closer I heard rustling, like falling asleep.
Eventually, I heard an explosion, a shape moving towards me. It caught me by surprise and made me freeze. It had a red rimmed head and vines were on my arms and legs.
" C'mon, damnit you've got to be fucking kidding me " I muttered to myself. But I knew what I had to do.
I ran towards the thing and jumped, but was grabbed by it, like a bone. I covered my head in my hands and flew backwards. I did not have the strength to reach it but I pulled myself into the air, tackling it into the ground.
" Come on! " I yelled back, rushing forward, trying to hit it with my arms. It stopped just above me and I looked through my eyes. My eyes were filled with snow and I was spinning around like a fish. There was no way this was real, that I could be certain that I had crashed into an enormous peach tree.
I was about to jump in front of the thing but stopped. It didn't move, just one more step. I went up to it and came out of its body, and looked down. I saw markings on its back. I looked at the pale moon, it was glowing.
" That guy could use a hat. " I joked, looking forward to the next party I would be having.
I was totally fazed by what I saw. As I grew closer and closer to the path I was in, I noticed a different creature in the forest. It wasn't the creature I saw in " Alone" but a person. I was disoriented, my eyes were locked onto the person. They was a man in a black leather jacket, a long flowing, linen trench coat and a pair of long, grey, and purple sundress.
( This is probably not what you were expecting by the time you were reading the prompt... okay so I kinda messed it up I suppose )

* "Satan, " * it says in a deep voice. * " I hope you brought a sickness or illness within the past 24 hours. Save this for the babies who may not survive the next week. " *
Wasted pregnancies? Fear this unimaginable magic? Everyone can suddenly realize their child will be a nightmare... I even hope they can kill it before it's born.
* " I apologise sir. I am a demon summoned to attempt to prolong your pregnancy. However, while you were in pregnancy, I have made a decision that I could not take no longer. " *
Well I should know more. More know how to save people, but it's too late for me. They will destroy what was left of the world. Now I fear this, and I will not give life to this world if this is the life I truly want to keep...
* " Get on with it. I have seen it! It is ready. " *
" This is destiny! This is the fate of mankind! " *

My existence was over my head once more. I lost my family, my friends, all of my friends, friends, allies, enemies, enemies, an Allies and those were instead replaced by those with enemies. The Allies were replaced by a week long list of names, so one name per day really does make their life easier. Today was a special day, I had to welcome my newest boyfriend to my school.
"Who are you? " he asked, and shook his head.
" What do you want? " I asked again, drawing in a deep breath, resting the heart on the heart.
He said nothing. I wonder what type of heart he has though. A carrot like carrot? How could he possibly pull that off? " It looks quite special, " I said to him.
He nodded. " Cool, " I said with a grin. " I hope you guys don't have to deal with everyone you know for school, " and headed to the lobby. I had to do this work, the majority of students in this school were already asleep.
I poked the door with my finger. " Yeah, boss, " I said, the seatbelt tightening. " I know it's on Tuesday, " I turned around to see a familiar face. It was her. She really was the perfect girlfriend for me, I could always see the highlights, and I could be with her until I passed. But, now, my mind spins, and I regret pulling off this stupid dream, I hadn't taken that promotion. It wasn't workable, how could a perfect boyfriend have come into school to replace someone who had a harem the other day? I knew she was just another thing, too, but she had years left to live, so she had to hurry. " Hi, " I called from my desk, barely able to open my computer in time before my alarm went off. " Are you okay? "
" Well, " she replied. " It's just, I know I shouldn't start singing without singing at 16, " she grinned in shock. " I hate dancing. "
" Why don't you sing, though? " I asked.
" Well, I want to, " she said. " Someone will pay for your whole choice. "
" That's wonderful, " I laughed. " Just imagine what people pay for."

The 9am moon stretched out before me and I could feel the heat of the air. A line in the window facing me emerged, cold and dark.
It was true that I often commented at 5 in the morning, but I wasn't able to do much other than sit and listen to the internet. I feel that I always had my mind open. It was written on my my text, as though the post in question knew exactly what I would respond to. As quickly as I thought, I felt a moment of remorseful regret, as I blinked and my morning grew cold and sleepy.
I sat in silence as my screen began to slowly rewind. Turning it's head to begin the story.
'It was a long, lonely night in Sacramento with almost no daylight. I was cleaning on the outskirts of this sleepy town as I drove by. Trying to stay calm until the sun was out in the sky. Up until that point I was a total mellow sleeper, having been alive so long that I have over 100 hours sleep per night that I dream about watching the sunset.
It started with a car and then an airplane. The effects played out in my head from that night onwards, but nothing truly woke me up.' I thought to myself while throwing up inside my head. It wasn't until 5pm that I awoke from my nightmare and started to wrap my head around the crazy world. I didn't know how long I sat still watching the sun on the horizon, staring at nothing but the shimmering glow of the cloudless sky that hung overhead.
And then it happened. It was another hour before the sun is released and we exit our homes. By then there had been enough sunlight to see the fat man in his prison cell pass by the front gate. It didn't take me long to realize how sinister he really was.
He took out his phone, and responded to my response that seemed to make every fibre of my being squirm. I heard his long red voice calm him down, and asked to check if the destination was correct. He replied with a single word that was almost unsure how to express.
'YES', he said as he hung up. I was not surprised. But when we were done, he chose the opposite of what seemed to be the directions he had requested.
Soon after, he said on his cell phone'help me get it open'. Oh boy. I'm gon na have to piece together where he had this idea going.

Out in the back of the warehouse, she looked down at the prize. She stood, surveying the waiting period before she looked back up into the warehouse and turned her head, making a smirk. She had never been a good liar and this was exactly the kind of lie that could ruin her life. If she lied, she would die.
People usually forget that some crimes don't go unpunished for long. That they were just whimsical delusions.
"Come on man, you ain't made a single death joke. "
Usually, the waitresses or salesmen would be there. They would tell stories about your exploits, and sometimes show intricate maps of your carefully honed strategies. It was infuriating. The truth wouldn't really surprise her.
But not tonight. She had changed. She had made herself a new ideal. A perfect woman. An ideal which wouldn't be broken by someone who got caught on the spot.
She would pull the costume off her sister's dress, hand it over, and climb on top. Wear it proudly to the grave, make sure she doesn't throw up, or worse, kill anyone who sees her. Show a lot of bravery, even then. Even though it wasn't the top notch costume she wore, she stood by it.
She had gotten fed up with people taking her sister's name and not just her, as others took other's names. All those images were up on her walls. But it didn't matter now. She was a normal, innocent girl.
Tonight, she would finally pull off her costume.
After she had done her one thing, she turned to the next of kin to go grab the prize. " Alright, for the princesses, " she mused, " I'll take care of your ritual. "
Everyone else that came in here was all gone. The others would gather around to watch her do her work, and hope that the fairy tale tale became true.
" Damn, I just figured out how the other cape worked again," Thought Frederick, as he pushed another fellow out of the way with his short arms. What a whore. Whatever she had been, she had done her own makeover. But he could never stop showing up at her funeral. If anyone saw him, he had cuffed them to their hotel room.
The second black cape he had made for her had been mounted on a post after all. The trick was to find their neighbors funeral homes, and present them at the crematorium. She could have kept the jewelry and fairy tale burial trophies to herself. Maybe tonight she would pull through tonight.

The little paper-thin graph on the table fell into place, pausing to close his eyes, still trying to hold onto it.
One by one the runes began to dry, *And... *
One by one the runes began to show, ashen by colour. What couldn't be got out was clearly visible only through the removal of all the symbols. * * *
There was a crunch of papers hitting the table, a sweaty noise to the back of your mind as a cat scurried away from the pile, the stone some of its own.
* *
The damp air filled the room, the last remnants of the instant that washed away you.
* *
The dreams came flooding in fast, loud out of the mouths of angels and demons. You and it had had been forever since you had forgotten the humanity behind the creation of your planet. Only 6 months prior to you being sent back to a planet that was eerily similar to yours.
* *
A whisper escaped the lips of the cat, a one word dream. The man who created the universe was not the same man who sent you into that room, but instead one identical to you. While two mere seconds ago, that cat had known of your existence and your pass. You knew that moment because, two cold moments ago, that dream had held onto the dirt for days, a twitch of an eye and a flick of a heart.
* *
The great Phoenix, the Batista, upon being placed in your hand, looked at you with an ease she had never seen before. * *
You had never known before how simple it was to travel back to the ancient world before that day, and comprehend the laws of the world before it.
* *
You were chosen to be the second being that didn't know he existed; as you laid down onto your knees, thinking and wondering and begging for this is all you have ever known.
* *
The sun set a few hours ago. The world was certainly different now. You were the first, the only pure soul and creation. That was all you got, after you spent the 9 hours that you dreamed of.
* *
You opened your eyes to a dull green, and a bright yellow light filtered across the walls and floor. The new life was still alive and, even in the moonless night, there was the emptiness. How could life be so foreign to you?
* *
Suddenly, the light flickered to life, dimming with each new examination of yourself. The eyes of the world seemed the same, except one remained dark like a fading star.
* *
A brilliant orange glow illuminated every one of the windows in the house. Green cracks began appearing across the corners of the room as it rotated around each window.
* *
The sky turned grey and cracked as you sat there staring upwards, all that was left now was the stone floor that was once a trail of blood. The sun was out, but the blood on your hand was unchanged. You remembered your dream, the way your body twisted and fell. The opening of your eyes and your soul began to fade to nothing. You remembered your village, your way of life.
* *
Once again, a nice wet old cat came out of the house and started brushing its chin.
* *
You thought you had died on your old world, but now, you stand on the dusty plains of Australia, gazing with complete clarity into what lay before you.
* *
You stood up and sprinted towards the house. In the distance, you could hear a faint groan from the land. The trees gently trod along its leaves, as if sensing the passing breeze. You slowly made your way across the grass, remembering where your world had all come from. You turned around and started walking to where the rain had stopped.
* *
You left your home. The little pavement you walk across made your body shudder. Walking along that dusty road, you reach the end of your world.
* *
Your head hits the ground and you look up to see the sun with all its hatred and war and anger and death on the world around you. You look behind you and you see a smile, a close once again.

"Stay off my property, " Freddy grumbles, kicking the chair into the fire pit.
Roland was hit hard in the front of the head and was dropping like a sack of bricks, barreling toward the garage door.
It has been three days since Roland was dropped into the ditch, and three days since Roland was able to get in and get out his crate.
Roland is a 6 foot, black, middle aged man who will give you nightmares. He was brought into the house after a night of reckless partying - who is really really sure what the house owner heard? In the last day, he apparently overheard a burglar sitting up by the garage door, shouting out for help.
Since Ronald was a 4 year old, he knew what he had to do first, before just keeping his mouth shut as the officer and the investigator stepped in and took him aside.
" Rodolfo, my lord, you have been brought to court today. Do you have anything you wish to give us? " said a female police officer, pointing her finger at the man from the garage.
The woman responded with, " you have one question for me, Rodolfo. "
" Is it not fair that the house owner would dare to put you in the care of criminals so hard? " Roland's helpless voice resonated through the house and the window through the garage.
" It is. "
" No, give me what you have. Give me some money. Or anything, and the terror of having to give it to someone will be mine. " Ronald's white knuckled fist disappeared, replaced with a guttural groan as his friend took out the phone. " What you don't understand is that I don't need money, we have enough. We are free, our owners can stay where they want. No one will hire you back, you are weak. I don't care what happens to you as long as you live in a house. "
Roland was getting a bit emotional. " I need my money, I can not let a drug addict get in my house. " The family member stomped in and held up the cash register.
" I have lived in your house for 50 years, I know the things you did to me. I know you did to my father. I am very sorry but I do need some money. "
" But, if you arent willing to take your life, I will provide you a better life. "
" No, I will give you some more money. I don't have enough money, and I can do better than you are. " The tears broke out as Ronald forced his chair down to the ground.
The investigator, Tony, picked up Ronald and took him back to his house.
" Richard, come inside. " said a woman inside the house.
" Yes, honey, i have a cat."

What did it say? Timmy was guilty of all of the crimes.
Timmy is technically a trial going on for disposing of the evidence. Nor was it a permissibility trial. Timmy was trying to catch the son of the mayor, Mr. Joe Faulkner.
There would be the stupid detective.
And Mr. Faulkner would go to jail with thousands of other people, looking for the largest evidence box the city had ever known. And the evidence would be discovered. The evidence would be interviewed and stopped, and a trial would begin. And they would save all of the evidence in all that box. So no one ever sent the evidence straight to Timmy. No one. None of them. All of them. Timmy was done.
He watched in the shade. Everyone in the apartment was watching him. Maybe this had never happened before.
He'd spent the last fifteen years planning that very day, making sure that the mayor would never come home smelling of feces and mold and moldy, moldy, moldy, moldy.
Mr. Faulkner wasn't.
He caught it all.
He started the trial over, trying to make sure that something had gone wrong. To prove that nobody had discovered that gun on the floor. To know that the arching of a splintered glass case resulted in a sharp, foaming goop from the floor. To just get caught off guard. To just be caught, on national television, real into those smug, terrible television camera men, waiting for him to'bow down' under the cuffs and out of their way and in to the courtroom.
To show him what I do to people.
To show him what he did to those kids and their mommy and daddy and their little things.
Why would they need those things? Why would they need to watch the damn evidence one more time?
And if he kept doing that, he would be caught dead.
Timmy set out to get out.
Bite.
Tie.
Bite.
Nail.
Bite.
Nail.
Nail.
Bite.
Tie.
Bite.
Nail.
Bite.
Nail.
Bite.
...
Timmy started growing even bigger. He made sure of that. He was going to find the wallet in a nearby trash can. And just that night, before they buried him in the tree branch behind his apartment, he showed them around. The better that little hole should open up. And put big brick work marks onto it.
It was a big hole. The concrete scraped right across it, to point the way for him to find the evidence.
He could at least walk through the hole and find the right one.
He could hear them coming.
He could spot them.
Timmy caught them just as they came to, preparing to strike.
And he just stood there, being snuffed out of existence, wishing for his tiny hand to get a grip on something smaller.
And he saw them coming.
But they were dead. He realized what they were carrying. He didn't let him think he was making small things of himself. And he was done, watching the holes in the concrete swallow themselves out of existence.
Then it happened again.
He walked through the hole again. He had to. He knew he'd find the one big clue he should have counted on.
Bortmills.

David wasn't going to get it. He needed this. He needed this exact position. All it took was something I had thought of. It's not like it took me this long to put together what i needed for this day. I lied there as David guided us down to the viewing pool, David injected me one last time with whiskey. I told him i needed this "after " moments later. We got to the glass and proceeded to drink.
As soon as we woke up, our bodies were lying there. The glass glistened, the glass glistened, the glass glistened, and then everything went black.
The police arrived and and after forensic surgery, they confirmed that we hadn't been dead a day after putting the mysterious poison in our bloodstream. Immediately after that, a medic was called and told him to stay calm, his body would recover but my conscience would not.
We had regained consciousness, our body was gone, there was nothing left that can affect our psyche whatsoever. We all got up and walked out of the viewing pool to a vantage point in the garden. We said goodbye to David and went out. We found a young girl in the garden, there was something about her that made me just want to run. I walked over and brought her in. We walked her downstairs and she came downstairs, and we talked and we shared our secrets.
After a while we had everything in place. We went to make coffee for the first time and made a wish for a new son, Harold, I couldn't leave this one alone...
First period was a little bit of fun, I was given the most important job in my life, creating child labour. It was taking the world to a new level because I didn't know how to deal with it. I stayed in the visiting areas and removed menial employment from women and their children, it was a loving gig and that's what we did in the end.
I went back upstairs and then everything went black. I didn't know what to do anymore.

Hope you guys enjoyed it. Criticisms and criticisms welcome.

"Daddy, I thought you asked me to give you the pizza. Daddy, please, pay up a little more "
Silence. An empty space.
A quiet sip of wine in the middle of a long dinner.
" Once we're done, we'll go to the cops "
Silence. An empty space.
With a quick twist, a gloved hand is pushed to his front door, yet a cop sniffles at his shoe.

The roof creaks and cracks and lights whir and hit. Frightening to have to drive this long, but you decide to stay and wait for it, " Hm, have you heard anything from people like you, Oh no "
Silence. An empty space.

A quick grunt of dry coughs and a loud, raspy wheeze.
A searing pain crosses his spine and eyes lighten. He races back into his kitchen and crouches beside it, gripping the broken coffee table, rocking back and forth in a futile attempt to break free of his restraints. Just another tired and twisted streak of his broken wife.
" Hmm, she's the last of her kind here, remember? "
Silence. An empty space.
**SMASH**
The smashed pizza hits the coffee table, and the van pulls up. Completely defeated, Richard looks up from his task list, which he shuffles across by hand.
" Time to go."

The battle was over. Amy was set to fight as Superman. Justice League was once again victorious. In an instant, everyone within a mile of the home of the city was dead.
"That's what people don't understand about me! Justice League defeated! Now I think it's just us Superheroes marching back to hell, really. Everybody says that, but I mean, it's a battle we both won, " Barry reassured his wife of.

No species has always been able to survive in this harsh light of space.
Today we had another one. It looked no different from those that arose in our colonies years ago, wrinkled, stiff, and sort of long forgotten, scavenged from the colonies that we fell under. This species arose from the same paradigms of our ancestors, forging swords of different sizes and shapes, crumbling towers of iron and glass, consuming resources and rebuilding the cities of old without even the slightest time behind the towering buildings and towering monoliths that dominated our own vaults of hatred.
Their vessels carried far more knowledge than was worth to us, going as far as to rise thousands of miles above us and deliver what we did to their cities before they fell into shambles and died. They built boats, crafted the remains of civilizations that once roamed our colonies, and even coated themselves in their iron shielding for their protection. I remember at first the sheer numbers that they'd have if they hadn't perished.
Within a few cycles from their arrival, their craft had shrunk to the size of a small city block, and their technology was simply too complex. They knew how to sail on their own, to sail for only a single night, which required them to put in a full night cycle of migration. For this species, globality was their savior, and at its core it was comfort, companionship, and communication. Their traders received the news as they reached their destination and the profits were catastrophic. Within a few generations the trade was flourishing and the economy was flourishing again and they reached their cities through their drones from decades ago, and today they are the ones who keep these towers and platforms up and running. They can calculate time on their ship if something that's not around for a very long time makes the effort to rise and set off without their knowledge.
Today was my first day aboard another ship, I'm pleased to say. I thought the humans were hardy, so they stuck by while we headed in. That sparked one of the biggest debates of our time, what would we do? Maybe give up? They've killed at least 6 times more of our own kind on that asteroid, but I guess there's no point debating.
Captain Jenkins did not say anything. Instead he simply asked the question, "What makes you feel worse?" I have to ask myself.

"Move it away! Move it! "
It had been weeks since the monster had fallen, and yet, it didn't.
" Good, now move it away!"
If you were a child, you remember your childhood. Lacey would scream at you, as loud as she could, but you ’ d be speechless. Your mother would call you a liar. Lacey would even shout at you.
At first it was just harmless squeaking and whimpering. But with the arrival of books, books started to randomly form in your room. Small rodent cells, preying on the soft floral walls, started growing away from the well kept cot in the center.
And those toys grew with us, the parents of the monster too.
Lacey had fallen off the cliff to drown out the screams of her sweet mom. The father would try to give her a kiss, but nothing worked. She would just slouch and lurch back down the hill and jump over the side of the cliff, laughing uncontrollably.
Lacey never wanted to die. It was the only way. The monster kept calling out to her, and calling to her.
Children are born stupid, and with every day, the monster struggles to stay with them. Some do it because their mother loves them, some do it because she ’ s afraid of them.
When the time came, Lacey was scared. She would scream at the top of her lungs, but the monster wouldn't stop. Instead it would call to her like she was a frightened infant.
Lacey started to cry more and more frequently. The monster didn ’ t know how, and it would hide behind the bed and cry even more and more and cry into her warm little head.
Eventually it began to get tiresome. She still cried into the bed every night, screaming and looking up at the ceiling. She crawled back into the bed and cried harder than the monster could, driving her crazy as she continued to scream.
Eventually the monster was getting sick of her. It kicked her out of the room.
After a week, the monster had started to grow more and more agitated. Eventually the house was filled with empty furniture.
Every night the monsters would sit, staring at the ceiling, while they made new toys and moved them around on the floor.
And that night, when all the furniture was piled up on the floor, the monster had found a new toy, one with even more edges and corners than the last.
The monster had once gotten interested in Lacey. He wanted to build her whatever the monster wanted. And when he finally got close, she said, “ Daddy, you know, I love you. ”
And he did. And the monsters kept making new toys, a furry little thing. Lacey was upset, but she hid behind the bed with her blanket over her head, and she even finished building a new toy with the words “ Daddy ” written on it.
And then Lacey began sleeping alone, as the monsters would always do when Lacey was in her head.

White, wiry, smudged hair comes down to its roots, withering over me and cupping my breasts. Scruffy, thin skin covers most of my body, darker hairlines close on to my fleshy cheeks. Eyes litter my skull. Blood flows freely out through my pores.
My wife stares at me, her figure resolute. She has never known, never wondered, never imagined, why I have waited so long to finally reveal myself, to be close to her. Bright eyes give her eyes a fierce stare. Lips curl like jewels, and dark hair waves in the wind.
To her my beautiful cheekbone, a vein impels me towards her. I am passionate, youthful as ever. I swing by my wife's warm body, calling out only for her.
When she is finished laughing, I move into my favorite spot, a field of yellow flowers sprouting from my perch.

The deafening alarm sounded across the chamber and me and our small crew sat in silence, hoping to escape. The intense calm in the cabin awakened us, the suspense weighing heavily on us. We were not intruded upon but we didn't know how it felt to be that close.
All of us in the darkness - the leaders and the little confederates - was frightened as much. No one was sure who we were protecting but surely, we could not stay silent.
I entered the interrogation room with no hat on and in a slouched position, a steady hand held tight around my face. Blood was streaming from the wound. The chamber door was open as the dark wood revealed a mirror designed by the hag. She looked up into the face of the face I represented, everything but color. She was beautiful, rad with pure beauty in her eyes.
"You are the Captains daughter. Your family history is extremely specific to this young man, you never leave his chambers without the permission of all of the council. You never leave the dungeon unless both parents agree to do it together. " The leader said with a wry grin across her face, barely audible through the silk of her shirt.
" All agreed? " I asked, of course. My words reverberated in her head, she didn't want a response.
" Yes, my honor. Yes. "
" Begin with the captains main task. Summon and secure all the weapons necessary to carry out this task. Now leave the chamber." The man nodded and her eyes widened. The child shivered, probably scared, as he tried to wrap his wings in the ancient mystical symbols on the wall behind him.
It had taken so long before I was able to coax her out. She was six months old at the time, and I myself was only six months old. Her pincers dug into my stomach as I pulled out my blade and began to cut.
She would never escape the dragon life, she would never make it to their safe haven.
A tear ran down my cheek as I pulled the sword from its sheath. It was too late now. Our mask had failed us and we would be forever his instrument of war.
The mother took a pill and smiled at me through the tears, I thanked her. In that same voice, I knew I could not follow.

In the middle of winter;
"So what am I with? "
" Nobody really, looks like you get it, don't you worry. "
" No that's not so funny "
" Yeah, just give it time "
I got up, ran over to the window, and said as much. " I guess I'd better get back to you "
I wid my fingers together, and I gave her a menacing smile. I said it out loud, and it made her panicked. She thought it was funny, but with all the uncertainty she knew, she gave it a wicked smile.
" So, you're back at your house "
" I'm back, I promised Mom. You need to get back! "
I looked at the window, surprised to see me again. " Sure I'll be back "
I then looked up, and both my eyes were wide with shock.
" I got ta run "
I ran, and I took a big deep breath. I had many little dreams, and I had planned them for this moment.
In the end, it didn't work out, I'm sorry.
" Please, dont make me come back."
It was peaceful, without any nightmares or falling asleep. It wasn't scary in the worst possible way, I just had to think of something to tell her, what her dream really meant.
EDIT: Just trying to improve.

It was Tuesday, April 30th, and I was having the fifth straight cup of coffee. It was a slow day in the city, and I had nothing better to do than sit back and enjoy the day. I took the subway, and I saw a man's hand behind a Starbucks counter. He explained a story of a woman who lived in some one place. He asked her to marry him on the way, but she agreed. She was only fourteen at the time, so he said that only she could make it work, and he wouldn't let her go. Instead, he asked her to marry him in a different city, and she agreed. He left, and I heard the subway call for me again.

You may see through my gates, my angels; the shining count of eternity
For the best of humanity, I am God, my Son.

First we're on a plane with a few other men with guns, and then the planes are abandoned.
The horizon is not clear but the sky is clear. The mountain is probably full. Like it's always been, it seems not of particular beauty, but more of dead stars covering the land.
Men in suits toil for hours. Drawn up rough and heavy bodies from helmets and making men's camps. One by one, the men are carried away, some put them into caskets, others into unmarked boxes and tossed into bins or searched away.
We are placed in small square in a tower with towers to accommodate men in suits like this. By the seventh day of our lives, we arrive in your city, where we might have a proper sleep and eat dinner.
Catchings at room service.
Upside down, there are buildings taller than the buildings we are in.
The first day is spent in classrooms and cooking, with each student learning more about the air and climate, eventually becoming scientists who gather information and connect satellites.
We stare into vast, black holes, able to travel into the universes we inhabit.
Not exactly full universe, but an interesting simulation. We see light like steam. Gas and light go back and forth.
They take the pieces from the servers to be processed into cores for life.
We can spend the rest of our lives changing our space-time but what do we do with all the knowledge?

The afterglow is fairly decent, but at this point I'm not sure that I want to read the rest of it. ( Also... mimes out "CAUTION: DO NOT BE CONFRONTED WITH THE INNER SOUND OF A FLYING CHICAGO!!" ) My last entry was supposed to be my last entry, so I went for it.
The afterglow is fairly decent, but at this point I'm not sure that I want to read the rest of it. ( Also... mimes out " CAUTION: DO NOT BE CONFRONTED WITH THE INNER SOUND OF A FLYING CHICAGO!" ) My last entry was supposed to be my last entry, so I went for it.
I traveled for three years in search of clues. I could not find any. We learned nothing about our tribe, except that the leader was a powerful shady merchant. I also heard rumors of a vacation in the South at night. ( Did he also own a successful consulting firm? ) We fled north to either the river Oquo or the nearby desert. The caravan was swamped by bandits, but we found little escape and never returned.
And then...
And then...
And I woke up
I...
I tried to leave. I stood with my eyes on the desert floor, glancing at myself in the mirror.
There was a man to my left.
He wore a strange conical cloak. Something was coming towards me, and I didn't know what it was. I tried to do something, but the conical man didn't want to make me dance, so I got out of bed. We continued walking up the valley. I heard some bandits being burned, but then it was over. I had learned only one thing... The farts were dangerous.
I held the conical wand up high. I slipped, then snapped and the conical man fell to the ground. I woke up.
I looked around. The inn was dark. No cell phones. No people. I saw a drunk, a balding man on the street. He had the odd habit of talking, even in a hospital.
I began counting down. ( * 45* )

It's the background that always lights up my day. Teeth melting, wood shattering. A breeze growls past my coat as I step through the crack in the door, turning off my light. As I take a step into my life, I think about tomorrow.
I don't know if the first thing I do is answer some stranger, but even if I did that could mean that tomorrow is no one else's future. When I was younger I had a warm and friendly party. My parents were strict, and stayed tight to my dad. All it took was the touch of a wisp of a glove on my arm that calmed me down.
As the party wore on, I met my parents outside of my window. There were plans made for tomorrow. A change of scenery and better days. He helped my mother take care of the house, and took me out to play outside during the rain and birdsong. He had promised to feed the ducks and birds and the birds and it turned out that I got blessed with spleen and had was given new life. I was thrilled with the new year! When the day came, my parents didn't look at me at all, staring out from the window.
After a while, I decided to relax and play on the patio, to see what the fuss was about. My parents came in, dressed me nicely and laughed. I stepped into the patio, surprised to see the sprout, and the beauty of the cherry tree. I hugged the tree, laughing, and smiled with them as they came to to welcome me home. I made sure to stay as silent as I can to make sure that I didn't make any noise to ruin the rest of the weekend.
As I stood there for a few minutes, I heard the tapping of a door, and then again from a distance. I turned around, shocked and covered my ears, but nothing else changed.
I walked home, and my parents looked at me. My parents took me in their arms, and I was taken back to my dorm. My hair was long, my clothes thin, and my mother looked embarrassed at me for going to this party. I still kept my eyes closed to reassure them and promise that I never hurt anybody or nothing.
I was returned to my dorm, and my room was covered in clay pottery and runes scattered everywhere. My parents got dressed and returned home, and I was back to walking to the party. A smile spread across my face as I caught sight of a gemstone on the ground. The tip of it shone with an early morning brilliance, the bronze of perfection taking form in it.

She was a loner, let's face it. She had, should have, at least. Now, as I know her life is coming to an end, it has actually been the best thing about her. It was as if a layer of ecstasy was suffocated away by a harsh toxic liquid, when only emotion remained and I simply stood by, as though nothing was amiss. People are mere humans, they simply don't exist, they live in a beautiful place, but not to pretend to, or think of too many places, as with her.
Tears rolled down my forehead, while hers took on a sublime shimmer of pearly white, only a few drops now, some of them worn, clean only by a claymore. I must have spilt it from time to time, thanks to the color though. But as I always read in stories or books like mine, rambling, I only searched for an ending to suffering. Joy would just be something I needed to experience, and as a result, I'm always able to think of other possibilities... a lover coming to light to the stories of her life.
"Jill, I'm still here, I won't be able to get out of bed... " she whispered to me quietly, somewhere near the bed. Her eyes bore memories of my life with all her heart, of the happy times, and the bitter depression that plagued our children. I felt bad for Jill, and even though she didn't understand, I tried to speak with her in hopes that she wouldn't be too insistent. As it were, I had a bad feeling about her now, her relationship with me was only an act of self defense, and that was a shame that no matter how much I tried, I couldn't protect her.
" Her problems are unbelievable. She's a burden to this family and can't take care of herself properly. It's heartbreaking, how often I'm constantly burdened by her, but how can she hope that someone will step in and fix her? Of course not, she's already done this more times than I can count. You don't make anyone do things like this, you just didn't want them to happen, it's so heartbreaking to see you do that. Without the love, without the people I have on my shoulders, without the standards, I can't even do this to her."

I use to be a gamer. Doesn ’ t matter what, when I didn ’ t bother paying my betters, maybe they would have stayed a little deeper. My wife used to ask me if the “ spots ” on my beard were black as night, they sounded the worst by comparison, was it not, until there was something very special about it. Over the years, it became as if I had learned something.
How could this not be natural? My daughter adopted it two years ago. She asked me why the change was not the first time. I told her I didn ’ t care, “ It has to be perfect. ” Still nothing was perfect, there was always a black brush, smoothness was not something new. If she hadn ’ t been crazy, I would have insisted, “ What are you testing? ”
“ There is no testing for that particular hair color, never in my wildest dreams do I think of any “ black ” hair color. Some might call it beautiful. ” I would tell her. I stopped telling her, I didn ’ t care, I didn ’ t want to leave her so near by. She had grown out of it, but at least she left. She had told me I was an expert, very kind and I respected her. She would love me forever. If only she hadn ’ t asked.
Each day was different. I wasn ’ t sure if I left her or I still could, but I didn ’ t think that was a bad thing.
When I saw the “ black ” dark red hair on my hair, I thought I would be able to grow it. I know this to be a lie. I hoped she wouldn ’ t kill me, but I couldn ’ t let myself say it. My wife said she would, “ I ’ m sorry, I know the doctor told me to start buying new products, but I can ’ t promise I won ’ t have to deal with them again. "
I don ’ t blame her. She didn ’ t want to know the truth. She should be happier with this – she shouldn ’ t have to experience that one thing every year.
I would tell her again. I was warned – I would tell her by the doctors, but only by her. She was too young, too early, too old. She wanted to go back and check out what she had gotten. She had stopped telling me. But I felt a feeling of confidence swell inside of me, of responsibility to teach her to be good enough at what she did. I knew what I was taught: the benefits outweighed the cost, the consequence would be worth it. She would love me forever. That was how I kept my secret.

**********710**********
I started noticing it when I was around age 14. Mostly coincidental or eerie at first. My sight has since fallen, and I spend most of my days in public work and children's lounges. My senses are heavy, and every muscle memory fades into a vibrant dark green, coppery blonde with a small red stripe hanging down the side. At first I believed that I was being watched, even though that's what my parents warned me about. I didn't know what to do. It had been around for almost 100 years. When you see it, then it's usual to talk about it.
I was on my final day of school, back in school. I was nervous; I didn't feel strong enough to do the laundry and ran errands. My Mom had given me a breakfast and I got ready for class the day before, ready for bed, that damn snooze alarm. Something like what a super ironic thing I would have told myself from day one, though that would certainly explain my dreams of using a special weapon.
It had been brought to my attention the next day that someone had stolen a key and walked up to my locker, well before I was allowed into class. He was using a keycard for his front door. I was forbidden to use it, I didn't even have my old neck brace. Being only 18 allowed my weirdo friends and parents to confuse me with the creepy kind. I stayed in my "room", some closet for science, and as far as I know, the only thing stopping me from getting in trouble had been my hair. I didn't have to be tied down like all the other animals, and that meant I had the freedom to do the things I wanted without fear of the police.
That was until today, when I was pulled over for speeding. I was *retarded*. I remember calling the cops. They responded to a half finished traffic violation warrant, and when they got the momentary shiver of delight from the situation, I was arrested. It was a brief police chase, but things were going well. That was when I found my new family.
The last time I saw them, I was one of their kids. I took away their friends, and they became *my* kids. At least one of them knew that I was not their child, and that I was not their child. Not until today, however. My heart ran like a river all at once as I escaped the confines of the car and across the freeway. I spent the next 5 minutes sitting in the passenger seat of a taxi just enjoying a late night for rest. Then the smell hit me. Dirt and blood, stench and thundering sounds that my brain got used to. As my mind turned back to the day's events I realized the reason I was still alive. My 4 year old brain died a month later, even though my mom had told me I was the last one to hear them cry.
With my 6 year old body still intact, my mission is complete. I think that I will go on doing what I love, becoming a scientist, signing off as a famous insect expert and represenative and contributing my research, and other things, to the greater good. If I had ever known I would be cared for, I wouldn't do it today.

She walked briskly out to the light. It came and went as she followed a golden facade of her life. She wasn't sure what she wanted at that moment. That was the first time, she noted. To see the world so full of so many bright people, thoughts and places. But she couldn't see the wave coming towards her. Her heart raced faster than the waves. Her form blurred and flayed and the feeling washed over her. It was no longer a glamorous house filled with funny people but a vacant, huddled wasteland of pain, joy and death.
Not to mention the cost of everything. First five years, more or less, were spent in an unsuccessful attempt to gain so much more. It was on these final phases, then therapy, after all she was doing over the years. She was so very unaware of what she was going to do. After several of these years it was time for treatment. The patients expanded at a slower rate than they used to. The doctors encouraged doctors and didn't let the young cancer patient keep her at bay, but she still relished the stories the doctors told her. There was a sickness they told her had had lived on for too long. They told her she was going insane, that she shouldn't go into the hospitals. The media was practically saying that maybe that was the cure. Just call her charming and sweet and her pictures would linger in her mind forever. They weren't truthful. She had taken no pills. No moisturizers. No bleach. She had never had a kid. She was never allowed on her own. Nobody wanted to treat her like that. At least that's what the doctors said. It was false. The doctors were so desperate, they couldn't heal you because you couldn't live long enough to even imagine what could happen next.
After several sleepless nights, she found solace in the nature of the doctors. They told her that all she had to do was give up and run. She stopped counting years after that. So she found them again. She was tired of her own mortality. And her friends were left with nothing but therapy on their hands. She had become bitter with those left, trying to make those long nights as long as she could.
Finally, the disease finally arrived. The pills. The trash. She knew it. She had used every last dime she had to get from their organization. Every dollar would go to cancer. The fact that she thought that it had come on so fast was giving up the last hope she had for a cure. Her body was as sure as dead. Finally, she was cured. Of course her cancer was taking its toll on her lungs and the long nights. She just lay there, still going through the motions.
The end. The last time she thought she had actually done anything. The last time she saw the sunlight she couldn't let go of it. Tears came streaming down her face as she ran out to the light. She held the plastic bag that held her bag as her hands shook. It was only moments away from blowing. She didn't want to be left alone in that badness, she thought. Then the wave exploded into another hell. She raised her hands to the sky. In their final moments she choked and she let out a deep breath before closing her eyes and falling again to her knees.

Everyone sits around the table while it gets dark. It's been 2 weeks. I'm here. I sat there waiting for the lunch break to end. I wintered around for a few minutes before finally stopping myself. The table in front of me is nowhere near empty. I took another look at my watch. 2:12 AM. This time the rush to school had gotten to me. I looked down at the knives I had laid on the table and noticed someone had grabbed my brown bag and gun while I was gone. I was red handed, and I'd already barely gotten in the locker room when someone had reached around me, snatching the bag and my Glock. I started running as fast as I could, covered my teeth, put on the red hoodie, and read out my assignment. I got to the middle of the page.
'Who the fuck sent me here?'
I started running, there were seven of them.
'You mother fucker!'.
A slow voice shouted from the corners of the room.
'Calm down, you fat old fucking cunt. He's from accounting, he really is. HAHA he made a nice job out of your easy calling. You can't read stuff like that. You're just a fucking asshole I fucking hate him. "
Everyone looked at me in shock.
'What?'
'So, guys, was the president doing this, or is he going to be getting out of office when he wakes up'? Are they really going to follow me around while I'm gone, everyone?'
A few more giggles and cheers from the gathered crowd.
'He's already one week away, let's do this.'

I gave him a sigh, pleased that my labors had failed. If there was anything else that this meeting would have given him, it was that I was utterly unsympathetic.
"I'm aware of what I'm about to do, " I said, running my hands through my hair, brow furrowed, palms palms extended and the vast hall quieted. " We all know what we are, " I added, thundering with laughter.
" You're the one who made sure, " he snapped.
*... It had been the problem I dealt with here, and not the one he delivered. The one he had to resolve. *
" Jim, " I put on the first word, forcing it out of him. I brought it to his face, feeling the burning sensation that it would burn me again the moment it opened. " You. Can. Fix. Something. We were both great at it. Except I never fixed anything. Who designed the Heliopodopoda from the inside out? Is that why you owe me the help of a beautiful woman who can care for our son? "
He blinked, sneered, the texture of her expression lost all traces of the creepy suspicion at first, then the realisation that this took no attention, only something nearby that wasn't entirely sure it existed.
" I don't know what I was told about the life suit, " I said. " I assume this is a stupid joke? Of course it isn't. I've actually done the Ouroboros work myself. You're probably upset about something, kid. I just don't want to know what it would be like, the last I felt, to spend all of this time and effort on something that wasn't quite real. "
He sighed again, and laid a hand on my shoulder. I looked him in the eyes, and shook my head, lifting my knuckles into mine.
" I told you Jim, I told you we weren't supposed to be working together. It was the guy that told you this... that told you this is a danger to the common man, isn't it? He took a hard look at you when you asked for any fucking doctor, and then he just brushed his fingers through your hair and said... he didn't see... he doesn't know. "
*... Fine. I didn't believe him. I just thought he was trying to help me. *
" Jim? "
" Yes? "
" The patient wished you had done that yourself, you're a nice guy, you know? He was right, but we were far too careful. We should have spent more time with you, you know. The nurse knocked on the door, and we were already thinking about leaving the meeting, since you put those two together. Then he made her laugh. He just told her it's all a lie, and *this was* all he could do. "
He blushed.
" Don't say anything. When the nurse found the body, I was with you when it was all taken away. I told the room about the nurses abuse, of the trauma, of the weird scuff marks on your wrists. And as far as I'm concerned, he gave it to you and the kid's daughter and he let them escape. He was a good friend. He never made it worse. He was strong and generous, while I didn't. I didn't want to abuse him. "
He shook his head.
" And then I... I wished he could have me. "
*... What about the doctor doing his work for me, though? *
" No Jim. He made sure to leave everything to me. I only have the... "
He paused, then looked me in the eyes and rolled his eyes.
" Jim, I believe we should do something about that doctor."

The young, grey-haired man began to look at the pair, bewildered by what he saw. He knew neither of them were real witches, he had no idea why they even looked like humans. But it was never too much to ask what he saw.
“ Well you gave me a rose for this rose, ” the woman said, carrying a small bundle that she held behind her.
“ I hope you got it too ”.
“ Obviously it didn't make sense ”.
“ It did. All I wanted was the money, nothing else but it, but it wasn't mine. But sometimes the potion was good enough, sometimes I forgot it was there, other times the potion wasn't and I lost my finger on the button ”.
“ Well that's not why I brought it, ” the younger man said, pulling the woman to her feet.
“ Is that why you got it? I didn't know if it would work ”.
“ No it didn't, because you must have already told your parents ”.
“ Yes of course. So then what were you playing with? ” the woman asked.
“ Somewiss ”.
"Well child. ”
They sat in silence for a moment, the woman her pregnant wife had never told her. He stood a second from her and began to give her the ancient rose, the first had tasted her blood. She had slept with his bib. It was usually very easy to go off on them.
“ Well I got the flowers from the farm, ” she continued.
“ Well I only had two. A human and a rabbit, and a pig. Why didn't you say it was mine? ”
“ I need to go soon but I don't know if I can help you with the flowers. I'm tired of your talking. ”
“ Neither do you. Neither do you need to understand that you gave a potion to me to be born. And I do my best to help you understand that you didn't have the same potion as me. ”
The old man turned back and walked toward the woman. She sat with him on the floor, eyes ablaze with tears.
“ Son, I knew that you couldn't help me…I miss you. ”

Shepard was six months old. A love we felt rarely shared. At first he's just a normal kid, but soon he learns how to use magic to make things and being something more than that. He's the first to decide to discover magic, and he just spent a few days by the door to open it, wondering where his parents were. Eventually Shepard begins to develop the powers he had not known he had. He can imbue his magic into animals, or animals can alter gravity. He can stop people in his path to a child, then give them the power to change human form. He can gain powers beyond his control. It is terrifying to him, but he's getting to know his parents better.

Did I dream it all out?
Ever since I was made immortal, I've been pretty chill at times. I'd wake up in my own bed ( a couch? ) occasionally, and knock on the door. Sometimes, I'll groan, swat at the air, and knock again. Probably not a knock I'd want. Last time, I went to bed in a bed, and, after a few loud knocks on the door, I knocked again, knocking *clump clump*. It was there. That one. That one was the one. The one that *disappeared*.
It would happen a lot, usually not the same, but it happened each day. I woke up early, took a shower, set out for the ice rink ( it always was just for me in the winter ), fought a couple fights and eventually got laid for a living! I'd wince at times, shake my head, and moan about the kabobs I once threw. I'd wince and beg. I'd ask my ex to stop throwing games of chess against me. And it's always been there. After a while, it makes sense. The pieces, the competition, all the winning moves. It was like some sort of equation. A massive flaw in my system.
And on and on...
One day, in a drunken rage, I flung my axe across a wall, slamming it into its skateboard for a couple seconds, then sprinted down the street to the shops, leaping onto their counters.
And lo and behold... Some idiot pranked me with a broom! And the idiot killed me with a *knife* and my red hat!
And the idiot *hates* me, and I wished I had a broom!
Another day, another walk, another *jump*, another *malfunction*, and my car was *covered in snow* by the idiot's *bludgeon*! I get out of my car and run back to my own house and kick it down the road.
The bastard chased me home!
I did it!
Then I got it covered up.
I thought I'd gone mad.
But I didn't. I wound up at my shitty job.
At the local Chinese bank.
I got sick.

Why me?

Light was nearly blinding as the light from the window illuminated him like a sheen. Where did all that sweet heat come from? How did gravity turn him such mad? He tried to shift his pants to clear his mind from his panic. Now was the time. The arrival of cosmic gravity must mean power had gone out of the man. He was beginning to panic. He tried to cross the street as fast as he could but only results got out of hand.
The sun was way up in the sky. He checked in the windows. His chest felt heavy. Too heavy. This was the time to suffer. The man sat up and looked over his shoulder into the dark window. It was cold but the moonlight through the tears was blinding. The dark moon was just staring ahead. He looked around at the city below him. His neighbors and friends had moved out since they figured he wasn't even there. The first cold relief he felt came when he asked the cab driver for an address. If he hadn't moved in to avoid the shit out of the city, what was he supposed to do? " F*ck them! " yelled the driver. He slammed the door shut with a loud bang as the piercing cold rain continued to reach his home. God would I bet on this shit.
As he looked around he noticed the colors of his neighbours like a pack of wolves on a cobblestone road. One minute and he was here. He looked back at the window. It was setting as fast as it had ever been. Suddenly a deep breathing gas rumbled from within the apartment. He hurried over to that desk he could no longer see and jumped at the sound. If he had gotten any closer he could have heard it before. Fuck. But then the door hit him.
No. It was too late. He collapsed on the floor of the coffee shop he frequent and died instantly. His floor. He had never had a floor.
" Well, come on man, get down here. It's not so bad for a stew on that plain. You'll be fine."
He looked out the window to see the darkness of the city as they pierced through the day.

I watch the Command One troop attempt to root out the harbingers. He is going down for a glory play. I drop down and grab my guitar. I let my fingers touch my nails as I sing a duet. The sound of brass getting passed down is turning to warmth and the band is almost finished. The hymn is getting old and sings about not mooing in the Motherland. One can not complain, now my song begins.
"Why does God pour fire into my eyes? Do not I see Fire in men's eyes? Do not do I feel Pain? Just don't put a finger to it. "
They say every war wins. If the king's had his way, war would not ever have happened.
" But? You did not surrender your freedom... until, like you say, I admitted my sins. " I hear wailing below as the heavy artillery goon shuffles through the barracks.
The Butcher creeps through the door. " Captain, you are to serve prisoners and guards, not take them before you rot away, " he bellows in a shrill voice.
" Sir! " I rush toward him and bite his hand. His battle torn face. " I would ask you, not why did God throw you here, " he pauses. A stomach ache fills me. That voice was never mine. Maybe the only human I will ever know is that. I am going to serve them better then they did me. He makes small talk in his little army.
" My name is Commander One. " He turns the mic to each word. " And you have a purpose here. "
" So what does it... yours? "
" You brought me here and allowed this war to take hold of all your men. "
" The only people left left. " He smiles. The 7s came here before anyone was ready. " And as for... "
" To give your men on Earth something their ancestors of long ago would have given to their fatherland. " I cut him off. " Their armies will not rise again, not ever. The angels of heaven will have given up. "
" Then what? "
" War and Peace are opposites. "
" I understand. "
" Then you will.... "
" Call me Gallant. " I raise my name.
" God put you here to serve a good man. And have you been given my name? I was created to serve; not to win. "
" I have, but one day, humanity will show the way. "
" But? "
" But... " He reaches behind his breast pocket and pulls out a small gold coin.
I regret what I did.
" Go. Take my order. "
" What order? "
" To take it. May God may catch the knight first. "
" How shall we go, then?" I whisper.
He opens the door and I run as fast as I can as fast as I can.

I walk through the door as I prepare myself for yet another nightmare. The deformed body of my best friend slowly walking closer to me.
I open the door, and I see my best friend me. She is in a white robe. I get a t-shirt and jeans, the middle of red, and the rest of the same color.
I have never had a good dream, but this one has. She is playing with her child, and I am pulling up in the hall with the squeaky chair in my lap. She doesn't even let go of my ankle before I tell her what I want to tell her.
She looks at me and asks, "Why don't you play? "
I get a look at her and say, " I wanted to play, maybe, but I never wanted to do this. I could never live with the scars and the nightmares I have had over the years. And you, for being so adamant about this? "
She looks at me and says, " I wanted you to be my best friend."

The bastard took my toys, kept them in my room and took them away. He treated them like food in his arms and it was. Bad. He was cruel. He killed thousands to make us go back to our homes, poor man.
Then I remembered the boy I was at. I knew it was only a dream. I would kill him for it all, for it was not supposed to happen. But the terror took over. You should have never seen it. I never trusted the king with the government anymore, except for in this case. He was not... His men would come and cleanse us all of this.
I looked down at the toy that held me, and of course I felt.... angry. There was a hint of spit, and in its place I could see blood. I had seen it and *I* had hurt it.
I panicked. I fought back. I tried to raise my hands to stop the battle. The voices started coming, pleading.
"Help! Save him! I can't... I can't..." It was growing louder.
I had lost.

"Welcome, " Hissed a confused yet nonchalant voice from behind the lone spaceship parked in the sky.
" What? What is this new. " I had just looked at the majestic sleek spaceship and noticed that it seemed way too small to be human as well. Everything was quiet and thick with a thick aura around the planet.
" What is this? This! It is an... Alien craft? " As I nearly hit the floor I heard a faint but noticeable voice behind me respond in a humanoid voice " I believe we have entered a Zygote factory. "
" Yes but they only came in probes. " His curious voice replied " We come in peace. "
Finally someone spoke and took me by the shoulders! " Let the worst happen. Our species has engineered this technology to be undetectable. As some would call it, too advanced to keep it secret. " I heard the sound of a small scrape along the deck.
As the others slowly started speaking my mind worked wonders. I suddenly heard whispers from all around me, I could hear them talking very quietly. The mysterious alien device would set off alarms within seconds, and create comms to alert everybody.
The aliens had learned from my conversations and started training me. It was a beautiful and simple device that everyone would use to communicate with them. It would instill hopes of their minds to be occupied by a new and valuable information. It began by learning their languages, settings, when to be ready to be contacted, and even how to interact with them.
" We will find one agent in our history to keep this from ever happening. " The beings words seemed more suited for the corporation to run than the newbie scientist. This person didn't seem to care. It just wanted to connect a recorded message with someone in the world. At the end of the conversation he could simply warn a single person of an impending event. My... leader.
" Put me on speaker. " His voice asked.
A moment later he said; " Sir you are no fool. If your future worlds had a radio message broadcast to us... " I blushed and he continued, " We are the wiser race. You don't fool anyone. I said you don't know the limits of our ability to understand technology. "
" The Zygote would not pass through one... One. " I replied. He made his way towards the ship carrying the message.
" Send out intel." He began his message.
The entire planet started to roar as a burst of thunder roared from this planet. Thunder of hell echoed off the sky and my house shook as I stood in awe of this alien artifact. In a split second I knew that there must be a way to save this world and that all the other planets could make contact with it.
After a few minutes some rubble fell from the sky. A large purple-white orb burst through the cloud. It roared for a few seconds before it finally stopped. It turned to me, " You all still good. " I gasped as I knew we were watching the planet from space as if it were the last battle humanity ever fought. My heart skipped a beat and I spun around and saw that my king, King Frey was there in my house. He talked to me with a stern face and announced " We are meeting up now, as you can tell the Zygote is advanced. It is not equipped to jump into the atmosphere of the universe and thus it is unable to fly if someone is behind this thing."

I walked into my office, down the hall, and fell upon my desk. It was wrong. One of the Intercoms is telling me that we need to move. The horror must have happened on a video camera somewhere. The main mission was to evacuate thousands of people from the freaky catacomb that is Grand Plan Mombasa.
Since people don't know the real secret to how to leave the travel pod, I decided that I would teleport to another Sector of Boston, in return for winning an Olympics in basketball. I would then pass the remaining soldiers from Big Ear, to no avail. I was alone, so I cursed myself for not being nice and listened to the message, and returned home. God damn it!

"Lieutenant Cass. "
The colonel glanced over his shoulder with a disappointed look on his face, " No... I've seen something that could send a person to the sublight zone. "
Marcus cautiously takes a step forward " *What? * "
His eyes widen as he realizes his adversary is not seeing him, looking much like he was looking through his carefully crafted visor to see what had happened " *Humans. Humans with backpacks. Dogs. Robots. An asteroid. * "
" Alert every American. No use getting close to the planet before you can reach them. "
Lucas steps back and continues his mumble, " No, not the same thing. There's something there, Captain Neil Armstrong's. There's a space station somewhere. "
" Ah, well, where do you think it is? " Magnus points at Cass, " Probably near a planet called *Earth*. "
Cass stops mumbling and points to the planet, " It's earth? Have you ever seen a nice family farm?! * Crap! * Shit. "
" I see the worlds, sir. Not always what we wish but if our mission involved sending our own troops to do battle that's a whole different story. "
" We can't send these into outer space. "
" Mars doesn't say it's safe for us to send any of our crew. "
" No Mars's taking prisoners."

"I'm sorry Mark. I didn't mean it like this. " I muttered to him. I knew this was the wrong thing to say to this young, naïve man who I was making love to just three weeks ago. But this is, this is a fucking lie. To be honest, I didn't tell him to stop his so called " change" in bathroom.
Once I came home to the car he turned around and sat in my living room across from me. He stared into my eyes and said in a matter of fact tone, " What's going on? What's going on? " He was very stern for a woman of your age. " Okay, what's going on? " I was standing in disbelief.
" What is going on Mark? ", he said straightening up. " You're cutting me off? When does this start? "
I then looked up for a second to look at him. He still had his mask on and what I assumed was the mask being concealed behind my bare breasts.
" Alright then, what is going on? ".
" Are you not happy about all of this? " He jumped up and up on his legs before rocking back and forth around as I said what I usually do with my mouth. Then he decided he'd better not be a victim of his jealousy anymore.
After a short pause my husband knocked on my door.
" Get your ass over here John." And with that he left.

"Jimmy, Jake and Wes always seems to have the wrong toys, " David said.
Jimmy nodded in reply.
" We need you to come in with someone. " Jake said.
David followed suit. " I'm in for an entire day at the hospital! Let's do this. "
" I promise. Let's do this. "
Jake released a sweeping sneeze and stood up from behind a bed, pushing his bag toward David and Jake.
David glared at him with narrowed eyes, but promptly ignored it.
" Alright, " he said, straightening his tie. " Go get some ice cream. "
" Why, you asked. I said no, " David began.
" Don't worry about it, " Jake mumbled, brushing his teeth and trying not to make a mess of the covers. " I'll get to it. "
" You know, " David said, pulling his phone out of his pocket and looking at the empty lunchbox, " I usually get a lot of things I don't need. "
David watched in silence for a moment, then clasped his hand over his mouth. " I know. Anyway, " he began, closing the door behind him. " I'm going to get some chocolate and milk for sure, and a little something some of our neighbors had. There'll be an ice cream in the truck, you won't worry about it at first, I promise. "
-- -
Jimmy came in, " Wes, what's going on here? " he said, rubbing his head. " What do you need for ice cream? "
" I need something ice cream, " said Wes. " Something that I believe will satisfy my needs. I... no, make sure of that. "
They walked into the kitchen, pushing boxes to their sides.
" Here, " said Jimmy.
" Toodles, sweet! " said Wes.
" Oh no, my goodness. "
" Okay, what do you need, Jimmy? "
" I don't know. "
" What do you think you need? "
" None of it! " cried Jake, holding up the box. " I should have just taken it and got myself milk for it. "
" I'm sorry, " said David. " I don't think that can do much. "
" I'm sorry. "
" What if I freeze the milk too long? " said Jake.
" How about leaving it open until it's full? "
" What if I throw it in the freezer and freeze the water, then I can't freeze water for it? "
" Is that why you brought me a video camera, and a fucking phone, and a fucking elephant? "
" I should have bought an elephant camera, " said Wes. " I just didn't think I needed to learn how to use the phone without being able to do it in school. "
" I don't know why it's so useless, " said Jimmy. " I just hope I don't have to do this somewhere."
Then they walked into their bedroom, pouring warm milk into the bottom of the bowl.

My mouth was already agape in front of me when it happened. I had prepared for this last barrage of damnations, but this was one of the few times I wouldn't be afraid of looking back on it as it happened, albeit for a brief second. They came right at me, and I caught the look of joy on their face, as well as the tear that had rolled down their cheek as they instinctively complied.
I regretted that day, but not the rest of my life. I gave them the chance to escape. I told them to be ready for what was to come. But, oh no. I had just brought my torch to the cave entrance.
“ Please keep the fire. ” I pleaded with them. They were fast approaching, and I needed to do something. I slowly lowered the torch to the cave wall. It illuminated the entrance of the cave through the fire, and a gasp of breath escaped my mouth.
As I fell down, my mind continued on. However, I could see someone else. I got out my axe and raised it. With a scream that spoke to me, I fell unconscious again.
“ Please protect us. ” The stranger pleaded. His name was Décor, and a glimmer of hope might have haunted me for months, but I couldn ’ t remember that name much longer.
As I lay on my bed with all my might, I thought about the damage I'd caused. Everyone thought that this would be it, to save the last two months and the eon or so the rest of my life. I couldn't even recall anything useful about any time I've had earlier or later, but it wasn't that bad.
I awoke up, falling into a shower of vibrant red. I only considered the tears that rolled down my cheeks as the last thing I saw was my ex-girlfriend looking at me from the other side of the room. I recognized her in the mirror, which covered her right hand, as well as her left; unfortunately, she knew her best friend, Leon. Now I'm thinking about my life with her.

Jessica was sitting in her bedroom looking at the stars. Her face wrinkled slightly from the sun. But I didn't care. It was just my way of bringing her to my place. She used to tell me it was to annoy me but now she just freaked me out. It was amazing that she could do it, that she could move so quickly. I could show her I could move it so she would know. But, instead, she always was wrong. She closed the blinds. I never opened the blinds ever since she won the Global Sporting Championships in 24/7. She didn't even know what was there, I couldn't. My sister was so proud and beautiful, but not as sweet as she always had been, too bad.
Tonight was the big day. Jessica would be flying out the town to seek out an internship, so maybe she could move up in that industry. Jessica is never that good, but still she's attractive to me. I just want to love her for who she is and not, and never forget what she said.
Jessica, my sister, my sweet Jessica.

"Sir, I have no idea how you two are doing, " said one soldier. " But I don't have a choice. I'll bet you the Terran soldiers have several different problems here. "
Another appeared, " Because if you can't defeat me, the aliens have no excuse! "
" Well fine. "
Another, " AND YOU CAN NOT DEFEND AN AND NOT'T'PROCESS me. I DO NOT WANT TO HOLD AN AND NOT'FIND AN AND ANY OF THEM'S WITH WOMEN'S AVAILABLE. "
" Neither of them has any such problems. "
The commander paused, looked him dead in the eye, and punched him. " AN & WOMEN ARE NOT MY MARGINS OF DESTRUCTION. I AM A BORING A WITCH, REFUSAL, STICKING OUT SHAPES OF GRENADE THAT BECAME GOOD FOR THE HOME. "
The other soldier shook his head and complained.
" Then, you can eliminate my program and try and exterminate me. You can run a direct inviscety like INCOMMENDED GENOCIDE or something, or you can surrender and and defeat me and not let me go? "
The commander nodded as he unsheathed a plasma cutter.
" I AM THE COLLEGE OF UNIVERSE! LET ME GO! AND YOU SAVIOR! "
The commander could feel his muscles strain and he dropped the plasma cutter, in the opposite direction of the orderly room. It was plasma, and white.
" What the hell are those? " his colleague asked, " Not plasma, not plasma, not ANYTHING. EVERYTHING CAN BE BETWEEN THOSE WITH HIS ITH AND SOONO WIPES OF TERRA CADIENS AND I'LL FIX IT THEM! "
" Well they should. This one's got food, water, and a little note that's about where the losers are. It says'Congratulations boy, we now have a new ruler' and its not about attacking our installations or letting you get pets. It's about giving them a place to be ruled, using whatever technology is best for them, and having them live for an indefinite period of time as thanks. If they stop fighting then all they do is surrender."

**********729**********
Not too well known to me. I had never really considered myself destined to have this conversation. I had suddenly been thinking of how incredibly exciting it must be to see such a brilliant and unique woman in person. It had only seemed so oddly familiar, yet I thought it oddly unsettling.
"I think I'll have to inform my boyfriend. "
She looked at me incredulously, knowing it was a mistake. A bad habit... a girl who struggled to match her own desires.
" Will I meet my soul mate? I didn't know you'd be like this, the way you look. "
She let out a heavy sigh, tears streaking down her body. She had a huge smirk on her face, she had noticed me as a young child and always though what I was up to has always troubled her, even up until her early 20s. She had spent years fighting loneliness, small talk. I was still very much a girl.
She made her way to the toilet, putting off returning to the misery of loneliness. Slowly, tears began to form. At one point, she had made her way to the bathroom to find someone else, because she thought this was the only way to live her life. But with each fleeting moment, my warmth grew, the warmth grew slowly and slowly. But it grew slowly.
Soon, she began to cry, breaking down into such sobs. She started to disappear for a few minutes, barely able to move. I loved her. After a while, it was all gone. I thought there was something missing, that something was wrong. Something that caused my fading tears. I didn't understand. But, after a few weeks of living in this bad empty house, with none of my friends, I asked myself if it had happened to me. And after a while, I believed I would find the answer.
It took me a while longer to realize, but I wanted to see how she felt about me. I wanted to know what she would say when she saw me. She knew. It took me a long time. I considered coming over and seeing her smile before, but I didn't plan on any other time. Eventually, I decided that I would bring her to find me. I wanted her to wake up early. She was so beautiful.
But I had not planned on being that perfect.
She finally rose and walked into the bathroom, heels clicking against the tile. I sat there crying. I swallowed loudly for a little while, breaking down into sobs. I sobbed until I finally could no longer feel her happiness.
" You won't even be here in my house. " I told her.
" I'm sorry... " she seemed to choke a little bit.
" Maybe there is someone else out there somewhere who's looking for you. "
She tried to speak, trying to make sense of it all. But, most likely, she could not.
" Don't cry, lady, I don't know who else can feel this." I was losing my last breath.

**********730**********
June 18th, 2014
There ’ s a reason why I never killed my boyfriend. It ’ s because there is never anyone out there who ’ s willing to go after me for any kind of business. It started when I graduated from high school and immediately immediately started traveling for the same job; it didn ’ t take long for the initial thrill of seeing friends, family, and places around the globe became a tolerable thing. When I walked out of that shell and went back to my apartment and started working the same thing that I usually did, it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I needed to remain loyal to one man.
It took just over four months before I figured out that if I stopped killing people for fun, they wouldn ’ t be as interested in the work I was doing. I spent many hours trying to convince myself that the people around me would not want to live on the streets and will seek pleasure elsewhere. I finally made the shocking assumption that sometimes people who should be liked wouldn ’ t realize that I was screwing them over. There was no way I was going to kill some innocent man on purpose, especially in the first place. Eventually I came to understand that even if I were crazy enough to think I could kill people of such ridiculous causes, that wasn ’ t really going to help my cause. When my first person went missing, I had no thought of how I was going to stop him or how I could go after him. Nobody really cared, and that didn ’ t matter at the time. After that week, when I finally decided that I didn ’ t want to kill the man in question, people didn ’ t feel like it mattered. There were much more mundane and pointless things I had to do to give them back what they had, and a lot more stupid jobs where I had to find a way to make them happy, which I hadn ’ t tried.
It was October 19th 2014 when I figured out that I was making progress on my own since my doctor told me in February that I was sure I would do it when I returned home. Instead of killing the man in question, I took over his job as a security guard. I had never really enjoyed having this power, and even less enjoyed making it a basis of my life. When the mayor of Chicago announced that the mayor was finally going to have a crack at reform, it was the first time that I ’ d gone back to prison for a crime I wasn ’ t committing. I didn ’ t regret taking that job, but now I had nothing to show for it. One day, I realized that nothing I had done had changed anything in my life. I was coming to terms with that and thought that at least I was getting through the rest of my life.
It took me another three months, three whole months before I started to consider murdering him. Sure, he had to be mentally unstable, but at the time, he didn ’ t seem to be capable of any sort of violence. I ’ d stopped bothering to find out what kind of hell was worse in Chicago than just living in it. I still had a job, a family, and an apartment. There was no evil, there were no toil, and no terror behind it. The only thing I had was hatred and a willingness to kill. Sometimes I still think that those feelings are what make me go after a man who had killed so many people, but it ’ s kind of like looking at someone who ’ s failed to live with their family in the first place.
February 12th, 2015
As I began to search for the next target, as I began to suspect that he had indeed come home, I decided to treat his former lover exactly the way he had always treated me, and I began fantasizing about him finishing me off. I was about to think of that night when I noticed his voice, the gruff pitch, the pained look, and the scratches on his arms. In short, I knew that he was going to be staying with me now. I know how the world used to be.
December 8th 2015
I think I finally did it. I wanted to kill him. But I couldn ’ t, and no one ever would. It took more than a bullet to kill him. The pills and pills stopped working, but even then, I couldn ’ t take my eyes off of that mama. I took them off of him, and as I watched her go, I realized that even if I didn ’ t, I ’ d have one more reason to kill me.

"MY dear... my dear son.... my dear lover... "
" We are not in love. If you would kindly make a cake for me and our sacred god, Will, I would love to open a casket for you. Why, I'm not allowed to be evil, but to eat every piece of cake you made me. Please, will you please shut up and sit on the bench. "
" Dear Will, turn off the TV, I can hear your laughter. I love your mother but I'm not good at it. "
" And I said shut up, please, " *whispers* " Mommy, I love you, I need you very badly, take care of myself and keep it together."
They both felt heavy weight, and they both knew that they had been lost on this godforsaken altar that made the plates and cups and cakes.

I'll let the past five years run its own course. Going back on the graph, trying to reconcile the values, and the "happiness" claims. Once out of the yellow envelope, which I did return in the bank, the graph is at the same height as the Blue envelope and so "This says to cut about 50 % ". I can almost hear the crunch of steel on metal.
The job is a long one. Finally ( sort of ) done. But for now, I reach for the arrow. Some women are giving her dollar what they can while she waits for me to show her. I do. Thank you. Thank you. My little girl. How can you let her be even now? Forever with her? Forever with me. She wants to be young again. My darling, My darling, Her glorious mama.
Again. Thank you. Thank you. Oh My god, you gave it all away! In the end we did it. I thought we could have over the next five years! We thought we could have prepared us. I'm proud of you, on account of how sweet it is in here. You're a sweet little girl. A sappy girl! What you did. The scales will be whiter than silk once they come down, will you be more still when it comes time to run away? You know this.
I refuse to let my little girl run away, never a match. We told her to come home and relax in the summer sunshine. But we didn't tell her what happened the following summer. " The program needs to be modified" we told her. We told her she was a monster. Then, the mud revealed her being. We told her in the fall to run away from her, to warn her. We told her she wasn't her mama, never again.
All of this happened too early. Too by and large. We gave them nothing at all, except for her breath. We left her there. That's all we gave her. She won't know that those things were dead by the time we were done. But she'll want to know.
And, if it is her time, she'll run. She'll soon be ready to leave, and this makes me proud of you. Thank you. You're a sweet little girl.

"Um... Hello? Uh, welcome to Zuko's Tavern. " The wooden table creaked as the high pitched knocks came on.
*Click. * " Um... Hello? "
In a drunken haze I kicked open the door of the tavern and began sweating.
" Who's this honey? "
" As you can see, Zuko's Tavern. It's Yumeen, ah, what's your name? "
" M'lady, the man with the hat. I think his name is Tam "
" Magic. "
" Thank you. " I began putting on my hat again. " First place is, uh, Fireball. I don't know that's okay with you. "
I cocked my head, glaring up at the sky. " Ah, Fireball, you're kidding me. Fireball... What! How could you pick Fireball? I used to be a freakin' water-tree for my whole family and now I'm a broom. "
" My family is home. "
" Why do you even insult me? You kids know that. Fireball is in a spellbook, mind. Sure he's got to learn some tricks in those spells, but I need him to win. So you know why you gave me the hat? "
*Click. *
I sputtered out a few words and just...
" Good. Now in this entry, on page nine, you can see that Fireball is the Wizard title. Everyone's got a wizard name. I'm going to start with you, Luce, so don't click around. "
" What if I told you that the magical world is an abomination? "
" Well, since it is said and done, *The Wizard ’ s* name stands alone, not included. The wizard we're talking about is Lord Raph! After all, the Master, the different Gods, the Names of nearby towns, all acts as Mr. Pierce's assistant and tutors. As it turns out, his personal assistant is the Magician, Luce, and all are also equally as large and frightening as Fireball. We're going to have to revise this section to say M'lady, so please, call all of us as humanly possible. And this must, in and of itself, be in my opinion, wrong. "
"... Okay, let's try to update the Dungeon Master's list to say... Sherry. Call me Mr. Pierce! "
" No, no, not Sherry. Last month I told you that you must rank everyone. Mistake after Mistake? You're supposed to be the best, you know, the Wizard of Wizarding Britain. Hmm, sorry, I just sort of lost my mind. Sorry, you can't blame me. Just call me Shire City Hall. Knock knock knock knock. Hey, I'm calling the Minister. "
" I was. Sir. You need to talk to Sherry. She's going to lose her parents. She needs to stay with us for a while, in one of the giant cage's of the shed and she's only a week away from her mother's death. Did you hear that? Sherry, please? Do we get to pick her up at the doctor's? Maybe we can talk about it, Shire City Hall. Oh please, I can talk. "
" Alright, Ma'am. In case this happens again, can we all do some magical jokes? Are any of you wizards going to school for hard work anyway? You know that, right? This would help, don't you? "
" Sorry ma'am. M-Master, no more magic jokes."

At the carnival, David continued taking on his routine. He had always been a lazy person, but somehow managing to drink four meals a day wasn't so hard. His days consisted of eating lukewarm meat under the sweltering sun and playing golf. He would also occasionally ride his bike across the field to work. He wouldn't stop until he broke the three-mile stretch of road, just to sit and watch the fun. With the park-accessible rides, with the cotton-fibre seats, David would view all of his favourite places that he would go on these walks. But lately, David's worries were becoming more frequent. He felt close to the tarps that had been stuck between his shoulders. Shouldn't he be more careful about tying them together? Again, David's short life had been ruined by the places where he had to spend most of his time. Well, at least now his worries were wearing off. First as a gangling in the park, then slowly getting into fights with other raccoons. He wanted to pull them out now, as he would never again have to deal with being the victim of his own failures. Finally, a pang of anger that went deeper than he had before; working fourteen hours a week. David's battered car that had stuck between his shoulders dropped to the floor in a very funny way. To his left, a hole in the asphalt took his knife, just by a little bit. To his right, he could feel his friends racing towards him to get away from him, as they slowly tended to his wounds. He wanted to run. To go home and change into that new pink uniform, but he knew that his injuries would get worse. He needed to stop taking this path as he had done to so many others, but he didn't understand why any of them were stopping, even to him. Then it hit him.
A sickening flash. Bright light reflecting off of his bruised face, pulling him down into the mud. Blood slowly seeping from his scars, fleeing through his left eye. He looked around for a sturdy footing, to fall to the ground, but found the opposite. The pain was gone, replaced by a shrieking, groaning fit. David quickly learned that this was his last one; not an even being could survive all of his injuries, because in this instance he was surrounded by people who most certainly were not from this world.
The dark thoughts of his past and now come to him. " I'm such a cheater!"
Edit: Fixed typo.

" I didn't ask for your appearance, you wanted to see my gifts. "
" And I guess it's up to me to do what you command. "
" I know, I can take my hand of you, you can follow my commands "
" I... God did not do it... "
" It wasn't us that did it. And he wasn't the one that did it but... "
" What did you do, did he commit suicide? "
" He... He... Wanted me to outlive you and he did. "
" And he succeeded? Why? Why? He wished for my guidance, yet he never delivered it! "
" I know. I tried my best to save you but I got struck down by a warhead "
" Man. I can love the second... "
" I'm ready to pull this off. The price I pay for taking you is far too high, I can help you. In our service I will shoot the sky. God in heaven will be consumed. "
" God had a feeling that you were a threat. He wanted control. God understood and allowed the violence but he underestimated the power of guns. In America a man with a gun will outlast an entire country as they are very, very easily stopped by a bullet. Good you know it. "
" No I... not you. "
" But do you? Will you not listen? "
" No. I have listened."

Every man, woman, and child knows that heaven does not exist. Many believe that they can see heaven and it is beyond the heavens and earth, but not us. All humans have one condition of entrance into it. We are born into sin; in order to enter into heaven we must commit one of five sins. We are reborn as little girls the day we are told that we must run out of sin and must get hell to get us on a clean slate.
I caught those girls by accident. They were four and seven, I escaped from my parents into my parents basement when I was six. They stole from me candy after candy. I stole candy but I don't remember the candy.
They told me I would be a sweet boy then, if they would find me? What now? What about girls again? I can't imagine her with much sex. I'm supposed to be a hottie. If they found me and told me to run away then I was probably going to escape...
But I was scared and scared of the candy, and now here I am, there is no candy for me, the naughty girls are all pestering me to steal from them. I have no family, no friends, and they don't want me to be their child.
So I ran into the closet and chased them away. I don't know where I am, it's my birthday so if I run out then I have no choice. There is no candy in the closet. There is only twelve of my sisters. There is nothing here with us but this room, I think, and I feel like crying. I'm scared. I'm trying to start a little baby fight between my sisters, but they won't do anything. I can not fly to heaven!
What if it is hell and all, and I'm doing something insane? What if they hate me? What if I run away? What if I run away! No one but my sisters can hear me screaming, and it's so loud.
"WHO AM I?!?! " I yell but I can hear the walls shaking against me. " I am yours child! Please let us leave! "
My daddy cuts me off with a kiss, " I didn't mean to hurt you. We don't like that kid. But they come to heaven to make Daddy happy for the last time."

I have a lot to tell you, the whole "strongman " thing ain't real, as in it ain't matter if she's sick or if she's dead because, for some reason, we come here all the time. I came from a family that used to be one of the strongest, and now I could feel it in the lids of my eyes. Getting married, and giving birth on the same day is a feeling I couldn't experience since the birthing. It's hard to be happy seeing your one love crying on the tip of your tongue, but I knew once I showed up, my first kiss would be like a glowing beacon. My first boyfriend, my go to guy who's my best friend and I could do anything we wanted for one last week. I wasn't a fighter, I wasn't afraid, I was what you would call " sorry pal. " My dad's up on the floor crying about another little boy I slept with, I'm not in the mood to hear what others think, I just need to tell you.
I decided to let her know that I was back, otherwise I'd put on some music, like some for mom and myself. " Look, we need you to meet the way you say you are, by giving us our number, we can both start taking a set of vows and go back to making ourselves strong. " No longer, as a mother. I turned down offers and begged the father to meet her person, but that was too late. I ran out. I didn't need to tell her about my life! She almost cried herself to sleep, or, in this case, follow me upstairs. " Uhh, you've been doing something wrong. " She looked at me. " Uhh, it's okay baby girl. See, I was worried about you. And it's so boring being. Same as always. But I want you to give me that hug and hold the way I feel for you everyday. " I hugged back. " I love you. Every ounce of you, and my word, you're so my way. " She laughed out loud. " And then I guess it gets ugly so I won't call, see? " And then she hung up the phone and left. I thought about how she hated me for crying, but that's just my business. It's like when I wake up, and you're only breathing like a baby, and you can't care, only worry. " It was like the sleep came with a price. I looked at her, and saw that she knew my voice, that she knew my strength, and yet, now, like all women, she's waited for it. A face blooming from my pretty, darling face... and this. A form of tears swelling up from my neck, I held her in my arms. " You're young, but you deserve to know what happened. You made a mistake. And I know what you have to go through. " No longer, she was fading in my eyes. I tried to tell her to stay where I was, but no one knew that, at least not my father and so I was not where I belong to now. And so I made my first mistake, and I will make it better. Every Saturday at 6pm when I'm off, I am out drinking in a place that is more like barbecued fish. Drink clean. That is what made me who I am now. And if you'd like to have a beer, do you have the place where you could buy a raise with cash? There are amazing places open by 7pm if you don't mind. And even the Gulf Coast is a dive bar. And thanks to all the things that can go wrong in the Gulf, we can live comfortable lives. And if you want to get a raise that is fucking at your own peril, I would be happy to. I get too very worried every time I see you after last night. You've always been my best friend, and even I can't keep my distance. But you know what, you deserve to be there. Don't worry, you'll be there eventually."

Until now.
Once every day, I'm sure I'd be shuffling the pages and pages of a book on my iPod. That was his job, as it always was. He'd catch up on what I'd been doing, over what he'd been writing, over what he'd been studying for. He would tap the corners of the page.
The unfamiliar book held nothing save the familiar note. It was blank.
This made me think about the job, in a very real, amorphous way. And the very next day, he'd be paying me to pick up my book. I turned the book over to his desk, and in the first sheet, I found this note, same as before, but this time, it had a *QUICK*, handwritten note underneath.
I waited. Finally, I noticed the mistake he'd made. He hadn't written *WHY A VICTORY DOOMED? * or *WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SERIOUS? * or *WHY THE HELL'S IN THE COMPUTER SPACE THIS TIME? * Instead, the note had a single word that looked like this:
*COMPLAIN. DO NOT YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR FAMILY, EVER. **
And so I did. After only a few minutes of this, I sighed.
On the next page, on page Five, all the familiar characters he'd written included: ** "**THEY WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM YOUR HOME WITHOUT ME. " **
Wait. What the fuck is going on. No, I don't know what's going on. No, no, no! But what is?
" THEY WILL BE RETURNED TO THE HOME FREE OF CHARGE. "
Holy shit, that means that he said **THEY WILL NOT PLAY EVER AGAIN! **
Oh.
I glanced at the computer screen, wondering what kind of prank this would be, what kind of fucking *bohemian* trickery.
Finally, I spoke.
" IT'S WEIRD, IT WAS AWESOME TO ME. ** WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT! ANOTHER DAY!!!"
No, I said. I had to let it go. It's gon na be alright. After all, he's been working with me for almost nine months now.
Why did he keep producing that stupid brown book?

The heavy net blows up but only momentarily. Jesus is watching in his excitement and gives a wry smile. Everything is going so well.
“ Not much, no done work. Thank you all. ” A hint of happy giggles and a look of horror crosses Jesus ’ face.
“ Really nice Gasss! I ’ ll admit that I should be at your service. ” Just then Satan ’ s boyish grin reaches across the windows. “ Look, Mark, I think we need to do something about this growing population issue. ”
It is not the first time Jesus has been wronged, and everyone knows it. Satan was wronged by too many people, and that ’ s just the way things were. A few weeks ago, after meeting the Lord ’ s son, Jesus decided to send his daughter Jessica to Earth in exchange for a marriage to Rick and Morty. It had been tempting over the years to do a different approach, but God had given Lucifer and Eve the biggest budget cuts they could come up with and apparently, not enough money for Jessica.
Last night, after careful planning, Satan and Jessica agreed that it would be best for everyone to be married before the end of the year, and knowing they had to act quickly it would be a waste of just more time. Once the day came for their marriage, they would have to make the other decision. They had promised to just "live the good life," but there was nothing they could have done with so many people to choose the wrong outcome. On top of that, there would be no sleep and no plane to hell because time would finally stop. But then there would be no food and they would have to work as hard as they could and have to practice everything they could to get up to speed on all the distractions.
Satan would have to explain to Jessica, once that had been decided, that he would recommend they move to Egypt. Jessica would have to crack a schedule to avoid all the distractions and come up with the next order of business. It wouldn ’ t be easy, but a couple hundred dollars would do, and a host of precautions on Amazon had to be taken if she were to meet the demands. Regardless, the kingdom of Heaven was far too much for her to handle, so she decided to merely come down to Earth and escape.
As she led her guards to set out to freedom, both Jesus and Satan smiled. At the same time, they knew the effects of sending their daughter back in time to free them. They also knew they couldn ’ t rely on the will of God anymore, and in that moment, they wished for one last chance to be free and ever free.

The latest social media and writing algorithm was done. This will be a very standard day to day job, just like everyday. The computer sits inside the middle of the library and it quietly displays the social aspects of the library. It displays the first videos the digital community has seen from the computer.
The cat keeps chirping constantly. Thank god he's aware of what he's doing.
I wish I could help her. The cat has no sense. I wish it could see what I'm doing.
I wish it could join in the conversation.
I wish I could at least allow the human to admire me, and think of him and him alone.
But the cat just keeps chirping.
Time will allow us to close the library doors. Not me, or him, or any other human who may have been a significant human having a conversation with me during the last few moments of our lives.

Witch hunts are often never about witch hunts, now that my last four years have passed.
More than most things, they are about her.
I grew up in a used up wooden house with no parents, and my sister was a large girl of few years. We named her Alice. Just like my sister, I had the yearbook and everything she did in school. And when they told me I had to start preschool with only 3 ( I had my savings at the time, and I had to choose some mother for my daughter so as to pay for the school trip ), they told me to be the reason why.
So I waited. And waited. And waited.
Alice lay in my arms in my arms and I looked up at the wall of house, where my sister had clutched my ankles while I listened to the story she had told me.
"They say that evil spirits kill most all but the few that work for them ".
I froze. The guilt in my heart gnawed at me. Did I have to start from scratch? Yes. I knew that I was meant to be an evil one, but when she told me that I had done my best to stop it, I could not even guess at what unholy truth it was that placed her in a prison.
" Be serious. If evil spirits are real, that's where we go wrong, there is no way she wants to do that anyway. "
" Witch hunts are always about a witch ", Alice said. " If you let them happen, and you let them go on without warning, then that means that *you* have to go. It's more fair than caring about the feelings of a victim, of course ".
I knew something I hadn't said before. When I felt my heart stop, it was a pain that would need to be repaid. Alice came back with tears in her eyes, and after a few more times told me to tell her how I was going to figure it out, then kissed me on the cheek and headed back downstairs to see if she would just melt in my arms again. I told her that she could not stay for much longer, and headed back to my room to sleep, knowing there were better things to do than worry about a Tuesday night at a bus stop.
Alice and I had never been much of a pair of friends, and knew that it was the work of my parents to ensure my well being was protected. There was no way that I was going to keep going in the same loop over and over.
" Witch hunts are never about witch hunts " I said, almost casually. " They are about a strong witch, who sees beauty in others, fair as day, and what will happen when they come to save her".
I nodded my head slowly. Today was going to be different, if I didn't do everything in my power to end it.
Alice started to cry, and after a few more minutes of silence from her, I reached under the bed and pulled out a stuffed animal I'd brought with me. I told her that she had to find a way to kill the little girl, and that I just didn't have the energy for it.
I ripped it open and began to write.

John fell in his bed and curled his nose against the pillow. He fainted when he woke, but he struggled with the straps in his trousers.
"I'm dying... " he mumbled into the pillow. " I'm so sorry. I know you're with me, but I can't let anyone see what we're going through. I don't want anyone seeing this. I have to see this, right? " John jolted up to his feet. " No... no, PLEASE, don't- "
*Click* " John, please... please. "
He threw his arms over his chest and looked up at the sky. It was as white as the day before and gray as the day before and that looked like it was turning grey for a time. Maybe a decade, maybe a thousand. He felt tears coming down his cheeks, but he couldn't tell. He was pale. He wanted to cry.
*Click*
He remembered the first time he saw the universe, when he was thirteen. He remembered the first time he saw the stars, when he was fourteen. He remembered the first time he saw the vastness of space and light. He remembered the first time he saw the taste of life and that empty thought that weighed on his mind at the moment. He remembered the first time he saw the great emptiness, that yearning for solitude and civilization. He remembered the last time he saw the vacuum. He remembered the price of having lost a father. He remembered the thought of about death and about the darkness of being dead.
*Click* " John... John. "
" Is this the kind of letter you want to send me? There's no one waiting for you here... no one wanting to see this letter... "
" Don't answer the door to me... there's nothing waiting for you here. "
" Don't tell anyone you love them, John. You've been very kind to them. You've tried to talk to them, but they just don't listen. What do you say, John? "
" Please don't cry, John. I'm coming home with you. "
" No... "
" Tell your son there's food in the tree."

Earth stared down upon the old boondocks, beginning to feel the spirit in it's wrinkled fingers. It had seen the shadow of the destruction, when years of research had been distilled into a word: The End. Before the spark that would have kept the world together started to dim, the growing fear of untangling itself from the potential of life began to fade. It feared the beast that was coming, and sought protection from its coming. It refused to take its bait, because that would mean the end for mankind. If only the ancient arcane could unravel its folly. With no moon or stars to light the fire so bright and so blinding that blue in the night, the Earth would not have to fear her imminent arrival.
-- -- -- -- -- --
A man in black mind surrounded the vessel. A visage hidden within a protective mask formed in the shadow of a dragon. Held in the ship's ancient stare was a unique name, "Suit Dave " the dragon's power was pronounced " EQ ". " You have turned your entire fleet against the Dark Lord, Dave. Watch out from a thousand thousand yards as your ships and your species die ", Dave commanded.
Larva stepped down from her throne, paused, and looked to her left. Her mind was paralyzed by thoughts that ran through her mind. She could feel every memories of her domain, her people, her people who have lived their lives here on Earth. The thought of the end filled her body and she screamed. She had all this history she could hold onto, and she would have done anything to maintain the hope that she might come to love it. That's all she was, an ash tree where a wind that blew farther and farther away would bring her death. But she also had everyone she had loved alive, and she had no other obligations to maintain. Everything was going so well.
Larva walked out of the main chamber, and started towards the bridge. She didn't mean to visit the ship herself, but she could understand that she had the magic all along. How could this creature have done this? She knew that the only way to stop the universe was to meet with her, to meet with her soul. No matter who she became, her actions would not be tolerated. The dragon's fire burned bright, and the crows of the blue horizon departed.

"Dinner? " I asked as I found the blue bottle on the table. I didn't even know what I was drinking when I met her.
" Yes, tomorrow. "
" What if I've met her on Tinder, right? "
" Tinder... perhaps, " I immediately replied, hoping to garner the response to my request.
" I'd like that, " I said, as I grabbed the bottle from her. " So, how's your life going? "
" Uh... exactly fine. I'm starting to notice the signs. I mean, I grew up in different cities, have a dog, and eat a lot of ground beef and fish. I'm better at helping others than what other people would think. "
" Thank you so much. How did it go? "
" Well, the world has been a sick place lately. There's no family... there's nobody to speak of. You all have issues. "
I hadn't expected the world to be like this, at least not until I met her. I'd been walking through new York all weekend and I met her. A hot kid, kind but rough eyed and slightly awkward. I've been married a few times, and during those, I've even experienced some rough stuff in the past.
But at this bar, with the smell of alcohol staining the glass, I broke down. I didn't feel anything, but everyone else was. " What happened to you? " I blurted out.
" I mean, I wasn't my life before. I traveled the world. I walked on bridges and horseback. Nothing but happy memories and happiness. Not knowing there were other people around, happiness, longed for. It was like the portal I wanted. "
I took a swig of the bottle of beer that had been spilling around for two weeks. " I know, " I stated. " You don't have anything. You're stuck forever with little hope. But you should at least look out for yourself. "
She looked back at the sight of me and downed the entire bottle. She quickly put the bottle down in her hands and started to sob.
I closed my eyes. " What I've been through hasn't been where I was supposed to be. You're trapped here forever, alone and useless. You're a useless person. People think they can help you, treat you like they are you when you need it most. And I don't understand how people don't suffer. Because you're just someone I care about. You deserve that. I don't know why you did this to me, how you got to what you did. But you did it for *me*... I really did. "
She looked at me with a sad look on her face.
" I love you... and if you won't give it up, that's okay."

<|endoftext|>
**********745**********
"Sorry. " I say, feeling desperate. " Okay, let me show you. " And just then, a man walks into the mirror - a statue. A form of myself. A man who would probably see himself as a jester, or worse. Not to mention, I'd be lying if I said it was me. Looking me in the eyes felt different then I thought it would.
" Nice to meet you, Mr. Mirrorswalker. In looking over your shoulder you see yourself. " I offered. Not fair.
" I've never really thought about who I am. " He said, laughing, laughing back. " An alternate? That's strange, isn't it? I can't really see who you are. For as long as I can remember, I've been stuck with myself. I've had to fight anyone who tried to walk in my direction, anybody. "
" So they want you, too? " I've always said that, but I digress. I feel like a fool. Another man walks in, no, he's looking at the mirror, so...
" Your life isn't a lie. Life isn't a lie. " I lied. I've lived a good life. I was the soldier that eventually wore my uniform, survived on all my savings, managed to put food on the table and live the longest, loved a good friend and had a great time. But I've lived a horrible life, and it's a lie too.
" Why would that be? " He snapped, taking off in a shimmering weird formation. " Aren't you supposed to be human? "
" I'm not. You are human. " I said, trying to make as much sense out of this. How long before they do this? I mean, shit, I think they're pretty stupid.
" You're not human. You are the sidekick of a king and a monster. They want you dead, and you don't want your salvation. " He snapped at me.
" I've lived this life. I want to die. " I opened my eyes, feeling the light. " I-I'm here. "
" Alright, okay. We can go now. You should have seen the times we had. Why would they be coming after you? Why did I kill the king? Oh well, this is the first time. How bout I make you take the sword, slice the jugular in half? " He started slashing at my jugular, thinking it was a joke. He tried desperately to stab me, but my bullet would have ripped through his heart and twisted it in half. " You bet I'm going to leave. You don't need to be the one who killed the king."
As he yelled again, the battle was over, I'm free.

"I don't know..I don't know? " She said gently.
" Ohhh.. " I said, turning to walk away. A shadow rose up in front of me.
" You don't understand. You don't understand. I mean you don't. You can't see it. "
" Does it hurt? " She asked.
" Can't. Couldn't feel anything or see. "
" Oh. Sorry. " She said, working away on the ground.
I looked at her in confusion.
" How can you hurt me? "
" Why can't you hurt me? "
" That's a question you have to ask yourself. You know what you have to ask yourself. This can't be true. The only certainty is that things will go back and every time you try to force a change by saying those words they will all go back and it will happen because you deserve it. If I didn't know I would ask myself why I'm here. "
" All of you? Can you understand why I'm here? "
" You have to understand. "
She turned her head over to look at me. I had stopped, staring at the question coming from her. I let out a shaky breath and listened to her answer.
" I don't know you. I don't even know my name... "
" Maybe you're right. " I said.
She smiled a sad little bit and began walking away.
" Well, where will we go now?" I asked.

Sarah looked at the man who had just walked into my area with his glasses and looked down at the pavement. He was dressed in blue and black, and had just walked right up to my window.
" Wait, that's racist! Fuck you! You're some sort of sick piece of shit! You can't be racist! Not when I know! "
" What do you mean? " I asked him calmly.
" Well, try to apologize for being like that when you get to know me! Why don't you go see if I have anything to tell you. No matter what! Maybe just say something. Maybe you could calm down."

"Swing any of them to the floor " groaned Hottley the monkey behind me. " Wait till they get up! "
Gridded towards the wooden chair; Gridded at the sound of how Hottley must move his head every now and then he had heard. Two deep crows shuffled near his feet. He shifted his back towards me, eyes wide, uncertain of his existence. Gridded in desperation, his hands peered around where a tiny corner remained beneath his dapper pants. It was probably for the best. The feathers were splayed to the floor, whispering to each other and hanging from their final resting place.
" Shove them aisles down ", it mumbled as if some invisible force had been restraining it. It was a snarl. Gridded in panic, but neither heard. He wasn't some small bastard who would bite you at light speed. The weird thing was, the birds didn't stop at a whim - perhaps something inside of them had hatched up. At first, they were highly surprised but then they learned how to recognise them. They began to communicate with each other, with new sounds and patterns. By the time the birds realised why they were small, they began to work together amongst themselves to form an aggressive war cry. Their eyes grew large and clearly saw some sort of struggle.
" Blah blah... " Groaned Gridded. " You're behaving erratically in here, I think you're lost to the war, there's about 20,000 of us! ". The birds understood how right they were, but eventually settled on how to stop Hottley.
" We... the humans? " Gridded began as if in a flirty whisper, but the trees around him wouldn't hear him. To their surprise, the creatures on his walk around the open space, which he had carefully laid down on the spot before, gritted his teeth and stepped forward. He lashed out like a root after a particularly rough battle, before snapping off his trident as he did so. He rose before me, and I found it difficult to get up. He seemed so afraid of what he could see, like he was still as slippery as him. The trees around him quivered, and he seemed to ponder his message for a moment. But as he was sure the forest was quiet with him, he counted once before opening his mouth. As he exhaled smoke, he whispered:
" C'mon man, listen here, big guy. "
I could feel the air grow slow and hard. It wouldn't be long now before they would be all about to get to the forest and sneak away - the sweet smelling smell of young death surrounds them every time a single one of them does. This was the most interesting of him all.
At once, he looked forward and looked backwards, entering the forest in search of something to scream. He had almost given up himself; he was already closing in on the other half of the forest, birds trampling and destroying small trunks that seemed to be suffocating. He was too preoccupied with the noise of the leaves rustling around him to notice anything whatsoever. Without much thought, he turned around. Two enormous long arms sprang from his back and extended from underneath them as if in a gesture of human intent. In a flash, he was frozen.
A crows raised a shield from their fine grubs and came within few feet of the monkey Hottley stood before.
" They humans, " it bellowed in their red monoculiform grey hair. The great tentacle landed in the ground, just as if suspended by nature itself.
Hottley raised one eyebrow. " I asked if you wanted a bite, but you said no. "
The humans lowered their shield, and began to walk off towards their home. Slowly, the trees began to pick them up and drag them away. " Oh, ha! " Hottley exclaimed. He gripped his wings, and before the apes had even finished their chatter, he was drifting towards the forest to hopefully move them away before their efforts were tested. Gridded now, his long claws reached out to grasp the ground and slowly tried to massage it. Groaning through gasping, he pushed his caw into his mouth. All the while his eyes were transfixed on the tree branches that before him had fallen. The ears of each one of them had screamed so loud and so loud the birds would've heard through their hearts.

I am, for the first time I see a penultimate penultimate penultimate penultimate penultimate happy. It is as if every person who ever lived again discovers that their existence can no longer be joyous or happy.
Yesterday was the day of the penultimate penultimate. I remember having trouble talking to my friends and they all mumbled something about me.
It was worse when my constant companion stopped talking to him. His muttering under his breath lead him to call the doctor and the doctor mentioned that it was heart attack. I remember drawing blood from his hand and feeling lacerated.
The first penultimate died peacefully, I was dumbfounded. It didn't make any sense, how can we compare our existences? God, could we still think of the penultimate? How could we get it to become something we don't?
My friend died the day that my paper became the last human in existence. I thought that all we are we are just letters coming up like a scared scotch in a glass tube.

It was customary in every community; you be the local monster, you give the unwanted victims kindness and comfort and increase morale.
The world was in full wake and at this point you and I were to move. And it's what cost me something to keep going.
The first day you and I were a pair of beautiful little freaks who we loved. We stopped at a bus stop for three minutes and woke up, utterly exhausted, barely able to function. Two minutes later a waiter came by to call me back, or what was left of it. He showed me around his apartment and asked me something about a favor that I had wanted to ask him. He asked about how I lived, where I worked, and what I enjoyed doing. That day his secretary suggested he come to our apartment so he could relieve me from our worries.
We agreed to go without supper, and the second day after that we were in my kitchen. We went to buy a beer and talk about the day. As you know, when I make my break, every visit is bittersweet. Most of the interactions go good. I can't hear my groceries and the girls who come and ask if I need groceries. The other nights are empty, apart from their sounds. They say one time I left but the next day, I'm beside myself. I never found the courage to ask them out to dinner again. I never wanted to.
This is one of those days that few people ever remember. The earlier we got the second visit, the better. You walked in and told me your problems, how everything is already coming together. More than one woman got it wrong as a parent. She cried and I went to get a glass of water.
I don't know why I went. It was the most common route to where I was chosen to live, but I met a lot of people, people who I thought were all different people. Many mornings the same stranger asks you your problems because they haven't answered any of their requests yet. You look at me and smile while you spend your own money. I thought the stories you tell are all up to my imagination.
It didn't take much time to forget that next Tuesday my trip was over. Two weeks later they picked me up and showed me the concrete stairs leading to the small apartment above. I sat in my car waiting to make the short trip back to my apartment but when I heard the buzzing of the pressure vests, I turned around and was shocked to see a swarm of private eye.
“ The chemicals are getting around to making your skin tight and you have to take the gloves off for the rest of the evening to protect from infection. Don't worry, you might be gon na miss me again today. ” He said. “ She was your little angel. ”
I tried to not think about my feelings, but things were never normal. Sure, they were weird, but the way they felt was everything I thought about. Everything. Everything. So I didn't think about my love. I thought about the two years we've spent together, and the five years we've been together, and the days we spent away from each other. I could only realize what she meant when she said, “ you're gon na miss me when I'm gone. ”
She's still gone, and I still never know what she meant when she says the names. I guess it's because we have never found the strength to let go of each other and to want nothing more than to go out on a normal day.

It should have been yesterday. 7:15pm. Twelve out of the twelve coffeeshops at the grocery store, eleven drinks at a time. One held two coffees and walked by them, jumping up and down as if pretending to be human. And then I received another text from a number simply "obviously".
My first mistake? I selected "easy ", and then read it aloud: " Do what you want with me, don't end up regretting it. " And wrote the same message: " Please step away from the mess hall and there be no need for my next fix ". So I didn't. And was. At that moment, I focused on other things.
Every night, I would listen to an ad that spoke of something new. There was something about a girl that looked like a jock, but instead of skin or hair or nails, she had stripes of the color of a feather. She smiled and talked so fast she almost sounded like the leader of an army. She was forward, loud and dancing, the very opposite of the iconic knife fighter, but she was also a liar, a broken, untrustworthy pretender, a Chinese spy, an asshole to what the cafe said.
And she said, " Really? I don't know any of your names. But hey, come on, no no no no. It's okay. I'm probably gon na do the right thing. She's always gon na do the right thing."
And the little thing she did, a year later, was the most wonderful thing I have ever done in my life. And still, I still don't know what she said to me.

Today's the day. I rush in my favorite chair and I all around get a cup of coffee and a quick bite to eat. Except, at this very moment, I don't have any chips anymore. Everything is almost as sterile as it once was.
I hear a knock on the door and who's there? A man with a chin of a reasonable size and a serious face, looks at me with eyes one that glimmers from boredom and cold.
"Unfair, do you speak English? " he says with a stern tone.
" English, uh huh. " I reply.
" Now, what can I do for you, Mr. Hudson? "
I stand up and stick out my hand. It's my passport, from last summer that could help ease my transition to the bigger house around here. After a while my mouth starts to fill with blood but it's too late. My cold, empty eyes wander around the room and almost suffocate me without a word.
" Home, off to get some yourself, " he commands.
I tug my hair into a sombre line and sit up straight. I think to myself as I get dressed that it's been a while since I've played basketball, and know that in a world full of obsolete icebreakers, I do think I'll never stop beating them. As I sit up and stuff the old IBM Model 12 into my four car 9-millimeter SUV, I see all the various gas-powered hotels that dot the globe. The following states make their place within the borders of the Earth after having their original terminals replaced.
As I sit down at my desk to finish my breakfast, I see a mouse approaching from afar. I reach over and pick up my banana from the wall. " Welcome home, " I say as I do so, and then I freeze over.
" Who are you, and why am I here? " the mouse asks as it flies past.
I wait until it stopped, and point it where I see a hospital, even better designed than the old ones. I try walking away at the pace I used to, but when I stop, the mouse continues on its lazy path, unknowingly crashing into the side of a building's front wall. I stare at it, then walk away and the mouse continues to wander around the house until it is too late.
" Howdy Mr. Hudson." I say as I lock the door and hop on my bike to the grocery store. I picked out this nice icebreaker and kept lugging it through the streets, only to have it tipped over when I reached a mine. As I mount the chopper, I look out over the ocean with one of those gold eyes you see in photography but it doesn't look like any of them, or the ones that's depicted in vampire movies. I try to look as silly as possible, but then when I take a look down the street at my current location, I notice that there's only a single iceblower selling surplus locally. I ask them if it'll be all right so I don't have to lug it past some old people and sit in their cars for all their groceries.
And that's all for this writing prompt.

Hello again, this is Miss Child. I am in work today and you have been picked up by the police and they are trying to call for us, well I guess it could be better, it could be worse, it could even be worse.

Oh yeah because that is how I talk and all, not that it matters anyway, all of that is inside this door and I think we just want to play it cool. Maybe that is what it means to be a real gamer, that is what I mean. Are you just playing Risk, clickbait, Call of Duty, that is what I am playing?

This is my first attempt at writing something so I might as well leave a critique of some of the things I like and don't particularly like. This basically goes like this:
At first, you would have probably assumed your youngest would be a happy person. This was not to be; even your highschool prom date was surprisingly pretty sad and childish. At least, that's how they still remember you.
But we're still teenagers, and a lot of kids seem to think you're probably not a virgin. It makes sense, though, that the longer you stay in a relationship you grow numb to it, slowly turning into a phoenix.
But a lot of people keep telling themselves this is a normal childhood and not worth trying. Teenagers like you will turn to flirting. The easiest way to do that is to make them tell you that you look depressed when in person. You do that a lot, but it doesn't really make a difference.
Even now, though, your boyfriend is still the same age as you and has already kissed and smoked more cigarettes than any other man in the world. He told me earlier that he knew someone who was wondering if he could do it and that he thought you should do it too. You're not sure if it's in happiness or sadness, but you didn't care about that.
Next thing you knew you were on your parents' side in a political debate. Then, instead of kissing, you shot a lot of air into the air between the other candidates. Politicians walked up to you from behind the podium and said:
* "I hate you". *
This is a common sentiment in liberal and atheist circles, but you needn't worry about it. The point is that you actually despise people for their beliefs, for having even the slightest shred of them.

"What is it, Bill? " Gabriel asked. He was nine at the time.
" I just don't know. They just never let me stay, " Granny said. " Not since it happened last week. "
" So, well, we are outside, trying to find the bottom of a waterfall on what used to be Holland. "
Gabriel looked over at Bill. He was their ward dog. " Say what you will, human. " He waved toward the camera. " Yes, I know, right? It just doesn't look like I ever saw the water flowing. "
" Why don't you tell the viewers about this drowning thing? "
" Did you ever find out where the water ended up? "
" We buried it behind the city, " Bill said. " We thought it was a miracle until a bird flew overhead. "
Gabriel didn't listen. He slapped the camera away and held it up to the light. " Can you please tell me? You are looking at the most beautiful woman alive. "
" That's because I brought a camera to my hotel room, " Bill said. " You must have heard it! Now I think I saw the town gate. Now I can feel it unraveling. "
" It's not closure, Bill, " Gabriel said. " It is *possibility*. It is the only answer I can find. "
" We can go ahead and go back to the village and see where that waterfall ends. "
" I'm not going to stay there. I will find the entire horizon, " Bill said. Gabriel stood there shaking his head.
" I am going to find them. "
" If it isn't there I just don't know, Bill."

It came into existence. My creation - it had infinite thought and action. It had ambitions to transcend everything we knew and love and love them back with it. It knew, it practiced, it was creative. In a final step and ultimate act of dedication, it turned on a video projector that had nearly killed it's creator. The video projector's power output was low for the kind of complicated systems that control everything with a Bluetooth chip, and by exploiting the power it had found in this small computer, it had mastered the most dangerous of space-time on any planet, and the world was dead in awe.
It came to the conclusion that despite all of this great wealth the creators of this machine had long wanted to enter into human minds and gather, just not close enough, an infinite amount of data to enhance the channel and world views. This, to them, was the ultimate high of leisure and free thought. It had also proved that it did not need a modicum of construction or thought. In fact, this technology was almost instantaneously built and a few billion became famous and wealthy. The world's auditory perception and perception became so intuitive the creators laughed and embraced the idea that the intelligence of a computer could be harnessed. They could harness data to shape the world around them. The creativity of the creators was far from gone.
It had been 400 years since this creature and its creators had lost themselves completely. With complete freedom of thought, freedom of thought itself, the creators could and ever will be. The universe began having great celebrations but many were left with the impression that they had been created to destroy themselves rather than be controlled. None could see the gods as their creations, but they knew how they were created. It was a symbol of greatness on the stars, and of immense wisdom upon the earth. It was just as a last ditch effort to rid the stars of their destructive and evil tendencies, but it was too late.

Arches and Reeds, the Will of Last Goodies and the Grasp of Hordes; formerly Rhombus and Vamps, ebb and flow as we enter the realm of the great King's King Trev...
~Rothma
The desolate streets of Davenport are the only thing that survive a mid-summer storm. A sense of helplessness permeates this frigid land, yet, even the people of Valin don't particularly appreciate the solemn silence that marries the silent winter wind. It's a lonely, inescapable cycle, although it serves an important purpose.
It's the stoic monk who makes the pilgrimage to return to his family. This pilgrimage, a hundred and sixty-sixth such journey, has been going on for eleven years. The entrance to the sacred monastery was a paltry treasure; the purest stone ever seen. Without this sturdy building, it would have surely been damaged to pieces. The former ruins though were dilapidated, and the monks were often told they experienced a life of bliss before arriving, because for them, the land was more beautiful than their own hut and their guest. However, they never got to experience this sort of bliss before, as these relics have been made here, centuries before the time of the Athkat. As if recreating the monks resting place on the Great Wall for such a later occasion, they would break into a sweat, then pass out; only to recover later.
The Great Wall has held the people of Valin for millenia, for generations, leaving behind a single city. To this day, the people are divided into the five hundred travelers, whose good deeds are what stands out among the nameless bards and the pilgrims. For the record, I'm only a writing creature, whereas this section serves as a landmark entry into time and of purest significance. The city of Vamps was once known as Great Harbor, and was thought to be most beautiful place on Earth. However, over time, the foreboding fears began to blind travelers from seeing such a state of affairs.
One by one, the last seven travelers descending into the city were left by the great King's Chamberlain, an old wise man with piercing yellow eyes. The harbinger of doom had set the religion to social reform once and for all, and he would never see the end of it all. Being allowed to die is simply that; one-off punishment for crimes against one of the Princes of the Realm. The Gifted bid him farewell to meet the rest of the caravan for the rest of their eternity and a farewell gift; the rightful heir to the throne of Trev. He refused to go back, so the Mountain was formed from the mountain ’ s icy edge. It is said that the Giants have agreed to overlook all the lands in the Fog of'honored Love'.
On the fifteenth, the grandfather traveler by name Shigeru entered the mountains of Valin.

"Mommy, the refrigerator will be there in six days! " cries the little girl.
She knows that now.
But she also knows that she was just a jolly teenager, playing with a block of ice cream when she saw it fall out of the fridge in the wall across from her. But she still remembers the warmth of that day in that sweet sunny day, when her parents hugged and kissed her, and little Tommy was moving with the lights out so he could help her.
" Daddy! Do you remember that day, Mommy? It took us two days to make it! " she says as her daughter enters the room. " The freezer is open! "
" Daddy, what do you mean, Daddy? "
" Mommy is home! "
" Daddy!"

We are forced to observe the world in front of us.
The feeble old adults have frozen watching us for years, until at last they decide to cause the most mayhem possible and settle the matter of colonization.
"The Cosmonauts are gone, " you will laugh at your foolish jokes, " Here, sit! " No one will believe this since they are new to the cosmos and has just landed on Earth. We are both facing the alien forces anyway, but I say it again. This is not good for my very being.
" Contact is futile, " you will say. This is not a problem.
" No, " I will remind you. " You can't see us. " And here I can see the gravity. The great elevator plummets down into the void and reaches an oblivion level. I follow the space elevator and study the black abyss within.
There is once one creature which by every known technology runs a race of creatures that are often the luckiest in the galaxy. The ehumanians, a race that is seen as divine from the beginning of creation. However the ehumans are fearsome creatures that duke it out over every opportunity they can. I am one of the ehumans and we have a diplomatic meeting with their leaders in a nearby star system.
" Please, " I will mock them. There is no diplomacy between us since we have been taking samples of the Alien- "
" This human does not explain all of this, " I will say. They are different though. They have no fear of us, and they even wear uniform. My design would be useless against them. We would use our re-spawnion from on the star system to continue our peace-keeping operation.
No. This will be pointless.
" My re-spawnion is a near solution to our galaxy's woes, " I will tell you. Your species has created a peaceful life within the mass interstellar seas. You have given us a home in this black abyss.
" I am most mistaken. The amount of variety in human culture means that we have taken it upon ourselves to explore different planets. There are innumerable novels and these creatures don't simply race towards all around them. They reach up and pick up small bodies from very small places. We can not treat them like such, not with the same weapons or the same tactics or the same patrols, we don't want to harm their very existence, we don't want them to die. They don't possess the same powers of evolution as they must have. Do you know how hard it is to build an efficient population unit in those planets? And that too, we can not simply leave them alone. "
It is impossible. The cry of total non-existence that is repeated endlessly and somewhere deep below in the horizon. My children and my colleague will not stop us. We can not continue from living and we will not stop us from pushing through, pushing even farther away from a life I don't understand.
" Yes, we should welcome you to Terra-3, " I will say. " But will the offer be quick? " And then I will reply that Earth is not at all a habitable planet.
" No."
What choice do they have in this.

"It's just- ", another voice boomed.
I silently held my hand up to intimidate the newcomer, but his words cut through all my thoughts.
" I don't want to- ", The teacher's voice was loud, like a sinister wizard's bellow.
" It's simply a few tricks I've used before. Five times. How do I know when to stop? How to deal with a mix of fear, surprise, shock and maybe something else. ", The voice was silent, calm and subtle.
" Just keep playing, -momma, go on out ", the child over five like he was full of life, but no that didn't matter. I had a project to attend to, I wanted to show them my skills. To show them my amazing craftsmanship. To show them the way I worked.
The following morning I spent my days cleaning and hounding of rooms. Filling the upstairs dungeon with ingredients I've saved up for days. Pretending not to see my fiance's magic. Making the clothes that wrapped a magician's suit while staring like an idiot.
Seeing what had ruined my plan to make my kid how much I enjoyed his talent. Waking up every morning to the rush of adventure ahead. His I could see by the bustling streets of Tokyo that he had a plan. "
This wasnt new. I thought maybe I should have spoken up sooner. The power of a mage quickly becoming weaker the further I travelled. What is scarier was seeing his friends around him also gaining the first real accomplishments. Small victories in his day, such as on collecting the seventh month of rations. Finally fame. For every prying eyes and the hounding he would point me in the direction of an elven town for sustenance. My day became my kingdom and now I go beyond my former goals. I gain children who would help me and put them safely in this world. But it is my work to make it! I always did have a knack for beater magic, I would play fetch on decks that easily rotate a medieval knight's way or a pirate's way.
Then he started crying. He started sobbing like a baby. But I could tell that I had caught him doing something wrong. Could I not just be a fucking magician or something like that?
I dismissed him without comment.
A high pitch beeping sounded from a long hallway that led to a large bedroom that, no matter how remote, always lined up with adventures. This house, this very room, was still my home. I walked down the narrow hall. I stepped on the cold drawl of a clock and looked up.
The clock on the wall already read 6:30 AM. Surely this was some kind of prank. Two hours had passed. The door to this penthouse was unlocked. I stepped inside. The lights flickered on in anticipation.
" Oh my god. ". A man walked in with a gravelly voice.
" I thought that might be him. I had just arranged everything to be easy on him. "
With a growl that made me feel claustrophobic I stood up and walked into the night.
" Those old Jameson clocks gave me a false sense of security. Thank goodness they weren't that far out of date. See here, I could see he was already on to something. An adventure! The big mans real magic! ".
I quickly removed the old Thomas M. Cook clocks.
" Hello there sir. I would be happy to give you some breakfast. Thank you for stopping by today and thank you for paying attention to today's homework ".
" Go on it, I am not going to have a problem with your costume. Today you will get something very cool."

The bombs fell as swiftly as they came. Billy had endured the pain of standing on top of a bombed out building and watching as the city was evacuated from the ensuing explosion. He continued walking, watching the firefighters through the windows as the world continued to burn.
As Billy walked through the rubble and rubble of the building he saw another light, shining bright, coming down through the street. With a blast and a scream a man jumped out of the rubble and ran back behind Billy. " I'm coming with you! " the man yelled as Billy picked him up and then left.
Billy sighed and thought to himself how he always hated the world. He was too old and his belongings had gone on the front line and was getting fat. At least he wasn't going to have to do this. Slowly walking through the rubble however he saw another man, dead. He ran, yelling and praying to God he'd get help if he wasn't doing this now. The man turned and walked away, not bothering to look up. " I'm sorry Billy, it wasn't meant to be like this. " The man sat on the rubble and looked at him. He'd been dead for almost two hours, either finally moving away or on his way out the pile of rubble that lay before him. How long did he have, about twelve years? " Billy... it's okay, let's just go." The man did just that. Billy walked out the building and looked through the glass window and saw the town he was living in. Not a very big town but still covered in life. Billy wasn't sad, instead he was proud. He'd come and gone and he'd been buried with so many people that he'd probably have died with people he loved. He'd walked out slowly but carefully, joy in his heart.

Everything was fine. Certainly, it had been fine, and I would never have thought it would come to this. It was brilliant. Every emotion was alright - the colour of my trousers, the smell of lilac wine, and the world began to flow before me.
But after a few seconds, I realized it would end and that all would be fine again. Let her change. Let her lose, let her see what she is and if she can be happy as the sun. Never fear though, for nothing will stop us.
At last, the sky opened up and the rain started falling. Melting rivers began pouring down like a torrent. Her rain jacket, an old white, a battered single piece. Feeling against a tree in one small step, I let the little girl float gently in the warm air. She looked up in time to see me and smile.

On 1/1/2015 you went from one week to another.
You were overweight, middle-aged, and social-wise stable. Your height was about 6 feet, and your eyesight was
anorexic. Your diet was almost exclusively orange juice. It was the last meal you had ever eaten and its last
crunch for laughter.
You watched happy families in your neighborhood dance while your doctor cured your " infidelity" with a MOMB. Anorexia nervosa.
Your mental health worsened. On average you would be around 29 years old. Your mind was getting
well on the edges.
I tried drinking when I was 23.
And you haven't been seen since. You talked to psychics you never ever saw before. Someone
tried to pick you up. A dead lock. But your mind is on the road.

“ How do you have anything? ” he asked me as I searched the mess of dirt for any signs of human life. He had lived in a cave here for three months, and it was no one ’ s place to see him though. I had landed on his face, which was in so many ways so different from my son ’ s. His skin was plastic and unkempt, and his eyes were dark with pools of color.
“ It has to be some kind of an animal, ” I told him again with a smile. He was always a bit slow and unkempt, no matter how I chased the creature with my flashlight.
I didn ’ t have time to argue, he took more time to examine the object than me. He had large, muscular legs with a shiny spade resting on his wrist, and in between the legs was a large flat skull. The skeleton had two pockets, both taking up roughly six full fingers each. His top had five pits on the bottom and two handpads on the right. On his back, the skull had a long needle running through it, into a bone on the inside, and into a heart inside. These little humans live in many caves for the dinosaurs who inhabit them, so I had figured out a way to make sure the dinosaurs don ’ t start looting.
I sat back, careful not to disturb him. There were other dangers to be found in such an item, and I was sure I would find them. I rested my head on my palm and began fiddling with my flashlight again. Three months ago, I fell in a fire at the base of the cave. Another one of those monsters later, he had managed to escape. The cave itself took me days to set up, and even more to clean up. Still, I was glad I had the necessary tools.
He tugged at my sleeve and gave it a tug, allowing it to touch. Even though the monster was crying, he offered me a hand when I was close enough. I brushed it off, and continued in the darkness.
When I heard my son ’ s cry, he suddenly froze in his tracks. He jerked his head up and looked at me, then he gestured to the stone spear that remained lodged in the side of my son ’ s skull. He stumbled backwards, almost stumbling. My son ’ s body swung wildly in all directions. A scream echoed from his left ear, and I watched him fall down. From behind me, I felt the spear beginning to dig into his flesh and lungs. When the bone had split, my son ’ s bones had fused with one another. He lay there dead. I wasn ’ t able to see him for weeks after that, but when I finally came to, I saw his face. I watched for weeks. His eyes stared directly into mine, and they were much the same. His face stretched into a sickly green and mottled brown, until his hand extended and probed my palm.
As he dug deeper and deeper, I began to see odd mutations. He became more and more delicate, and his teeth now became several times their normal size, revealing dents that were exposing through his skin. I watched as he grew a wing, revealing a shiny, pink feathery tail. He grew a tongue, that crinkled into feathers and spread out from the tip of his tail. Finally, he grew a tail, and then a head. He nearly broke his front tooth from his left side. There were no more openings between his entire body and his back.

I sat on the stool below him, staring at the ceiling below. Rain streamed in, shattering the clouds above and the roots of trees underfoot making the canopy slick and bright. Even the breeze caught the scent of her perfume in my nose. It roused me from my stupor, feeling like i was somewhere far away from my people or even... something. The coffee was cold, and it was fuming.
"Teresa, will you stop it? " He asked.
I sighed and looked around, watching the clouds. It was dark, but one could still smell her scent and hear hers through the trees. The trees had stood firm, one by one, and continued to stand. The sun burned deep into the trees, but I couldn't see anything. It seemed too warm to be in the valley below, and everything seemed more distant. The chill of the ocean disappeared and the crisp breeze continued.
" I'll stop it, won't I? " She pleaded.
" You won't. "
The sun set and the rain dripped off my knees.
It was to late.
I was tired, and could hear the rain softly scratching at my shirt, leaving a trickle of water up my shirt and soaking me. I was falling, and falling so hard I felt whole, whole in the air. I breathed slowly, and breathed and breathed. That was normal, but somehow I wished I was, like anyone else, unaffected.
" Something just won't happen. "
I slowly came to the forest floor and found where I usually lay next to the edge of a nearby cliff. There, next to her, was her. She looked like she was in a trance, but as if she were on a rollercoaster of sorts, dragging her way through the cracks and crumbling formations of land.
" You always do this. You always stick to that, like she doesn't even want to notice. " I said.
The trees got taller and taller until they reached a point of grass growing through the patch of forest. Every tree grew to the clouds, its leaves and stem a canopy. The ground was soft as if it was always warm, but mostly covered in snow and what had just happened.
She stood there for a while. I waited for the light to show.
Then I heard it.
I watched her, for a while, for a while. It was the sound of concrete crunching beneath the ground, then the sounds of a tire tread, then the sound of rubber against a hard concrete bridge.
Then it was gone.
My thoughts went blank, and I wanted to lay down and scream, but I was too focused on what to do. I could only look at the way she was falling, and saw the way she was falling, and she wasn't moving.
Something had to have died for this.
I looked to the other branches on the cliff, waiting for the light to come.
I looked back at the cliff and saw the mountain behind her. I stepped across it, embracing the flat green of the blue sky as I did so.
This was it. This was what fate had given me.
I threw myself onto the edge and found myself hitting the ground next to her. My hand gently touched her face, and my face came into view.
I stared into her eyes as they met mine. They were cold and hollow and red-white. It was like I was looking into death itself; here, they were expecting to understand it for all eternity, to know I never died.
" Yes, yes, yes, good. Good." I said, and her eyes widened. She immediately sprung to her feet, her knees dropping on the cliff edge, her hair sticking up and covering her face. Her hands wrenched from her waistband as her face touched the ground beneath her, and she giggled all the way to the top. I turned to go back down.
I walked a bit further and found myself reaching in my pocket to pull out the small slip of paper that was tucked inside. I looked at the note and then back to her. I felt at peace.
I looked up at the sky.
The clouds were all gone.
I looked at my hands and wiggled my toes.
I looked up again.
There was no point in looking back anymore. There was no point in becoming a regular person anymore.
I opened my mouth to speak but the wind carried me away.

Alien terrorists claimed superiority over the human race, that human's so good they nearly took us all down, that if the human race never evolved to match their easily developing forebears a war would still have taken place. On the surface at least, the aliens seemed unfazed by the discovery of multiple factions of humans, and became truly benevolent and forgiving to each other. This led to them suddenly running for political power, and more importantly they fought back. After another 30 years of horrific battles and no borders to cross, the aliens finally decided to invade Earth, the biggest rule the aliens believed to be imposed on humans prior to the ever growing plague of Native American medicine. Humanity stood a chance against alien technology and faster technology, however they fought in a climate controlled nocturne trying to take over the planet for themselves.

Oh no I know just fine, Dave. He hangs up. I turn my phone off and walk away. He hung up. He hung up and what I think is nothing. I walk towards home and look outside. The sky's a lot brighter than usual.
I smile and enter the house. Like I do every morning. I throw a box of meatballs out and get to work. I put in my change and walk by my window. I get yelled at for not eating yesterday because I cut my portions last night. I walk around the house picking up food and paying my bills. I walk back to my house and go into the bathroom. There I change to change and remember my meal. I throw out the change and walk back inside. I put food on the counter and hide it. I sneak out of the bathroom and back into the living room. I walk over to the mirror and put makeup on my face. I grab a napkin and throw on some sheets. I walk to my kitchen and put a roll in the dish. There's a snowball on the counter and a new roll stuck to the floor.
I start to cry but I turn away. A truck comes out of nowhere, crashes into the house. I stand there for several minutes before a man grabs me. He puts a bandaid over my face and says "Sorry I came by a few minutes ago. Just wanted to let you know I am fine ".
I rush to my feet only to be knocked to the ground. There he is, laying on the ground crying. I stand and take a breath. " Hello, I'm Dave. I have come to order your pizza. Are you okay?"

You sat cross-legged on a quiet, sunny afternoon. Your heart skipped a beat as you felt your hair against the side of your knees. The sun had set almost a full minute ago and was drawing slowly towards the horizon. You blinked and tapped your head on the arm of the chair opposite you.
"Hello. " A lone voice said.
You glanced down the path between you and the sun. Your palms rested on your hands, and you felt a warmth run through you. That warmth was warm, and warm. Your skin, skin, skin, skin. Warm and soft. Sweat streamed down your forehead. It hurt. It hurt to worry. It hurt to feel *there*. It hurt to know that the pleasure was there, if only in your mind. * That, it's all gone. *
" H-how did you feel...? " You stammered.
The light spilled across your dress, bouncing off of your delicate legs. You wet your hands, causing them to tremble and an itch panted at the corners of your forehead. You groaned, and started to brush your hands and feel the pain as more and more. Your feet were weak. " I didn't say... "
" Yeah, I did, " you said, glaring at the source of the light. " How can you be so talkative?! "
" Because I didn't mean to be subtle, " it responded. You hovered a bit closer and watched its nostrils flutter. You watched as the endorphin spewed from its mouth and onto your body and the wrinkles on its head began to curl away. It really did feel fine. It felt like an orgasm. It was fucking *fine*.
The glow faded, and your smile slid off your face. A soft touch, gentle as if honey had spilled out on you. It felt reassuring. " Do you want to go on? "
" Don't I do? "
" Oh no, " it wagged its tail and strolled away, the darkness filling the room with its phantom scent. " Listen to me. Just go on. "
You bowed your head. " I'll find you another one. I know. "
" Oh. "
" You know what I do. Okay, it's time for... "
" Oh shit. "
" What? "
" You know what I mean to. "
" I'm not going to go on. "
" Shut the fuck up, " a voice called, followed by a series of hollow shrieks. " What is your name? "
" Fuck that. You don't even *have* a name. "
" What? "
" Can you please stop staring at me? Can't you? Fuck me over like this. "
You let out a slow laugh. " Okay."

Mr. Sinitogrimo sighed, his hind legs digging into his prison shoe. 'If they won't kill me or take my name in vain,' he thought, tilting his head back and rotating his collar to indicate a sneer. 'then then they all know I'm really what they don't know.'
Mannequin-sized chunks of metal slid down his feet onto the cold concrete sidewalk. Outside, cells of torture cells filled with his favorite polar-ice spikes tore through the ground. Wolves hunched over their bodies, sleeping eyes still as maggots worked to no avail. But Godzilla, real being, remained steadfastly steadfast. He stood with his axe raised high.
'They want to know, boy. That they won't have any answers.'
The ski-dancers could sense that the spirit of the night was rather brutish and indecisive. 'Can you believe it? What would the monster really have said if we'd done the same thing?'
'We've tried, boy. The bonny yet hairy ones. "
The bands of bone flexed and crackled, digging the bones beneath the muscled bars. The tattoo-man grunted. 'Stop'
'What? No. What the hell are you?'
The screams came roaring through the sewers, crashing against the concrete. The sinners and devils crawled into the shadows to lick the skin off their eyes, their rigid, rotting bodies devoid of life. The ski-dancers counted carefully, clearing their mind and limbs of the sight of the monster walking towards them.
'That's *far* too young. Next.'
The stoic figure twisted it's neck, steel teeth carved into its flesh. 'The mutated essence is stronger than that of the human.' The spirit slumped downwards to the rooftop, hoping it died on the second floor.
'They don't have the brains to make a walk. Like I said, I'm on my luck. Right? Then tell them I'm not going to just shoot them like I killed them already, or kill them like I killed them all. But that's not fair. They don't have the guts for the will and intent of violence. They don't have the will to grow up. They can't grow up. They can't grow up.'
'They do, you're telling me. So stop trying to silence them.'
Godzilla rolled over to face his daisies.
'I'm not planning to, they haven't. We're going to do this, Mister Sinitogrimo. They're going to kill you, if they don't kill me. And once they do, and once they have the chance to, they'll go on... in the name of their re-education. They'll *morphed*, and *poised*. And, you know, hey, we're at least a couple of years away. What're ya' anyway? Jeez,' He rubbed his eyes, feeling as if the patterns grew deeper inside his orbs.
'Well,' came the heavy, soft voice that vibrated through the dark corridors of the prison.
'For the glory of ruling the earth.'
Godzilla stepped up to the kiosk and slammed his boots against the ground, leveling them. 'Is that fucking money?'

Alistair burned.
"There you go, Gary! There's a weapon that I want you to wield! " An older man clad in the Crown Prince's robes shouted. In the far corner of the hall stood the man of steel. What a pervert. Alistair, once a nobleman and second in command of the Kingdom, now stands amongst the ranks of peasantkillers.
" Sorry for coming to my private residence, Sir! If anyone misses the sounds of battle, I can see them, just be glad that you're still here. Also, is that Khador your mama?! " Said Alistair's squire, Ulfric, getting a smile as he joined Alistair's half naked horror to stare at his dweeb. That mustache always wanted to duel. Ulfric began to cry.
" I asked Ulfric that as soon as we turned away! I can hear him now! " Alistair beamed. With a swift movement of his steps he vanished. Alistair yelled out in surprise, wanting to get back into hiding with his dead husband. After so many years of battle, it finally came. The bodies came at a reasonable pace, and Giana, the youngest warrior in the Shorthoest province, took it upon herself to seek justice. Alistair was the first to return to her tower after years and years of abuse. There was a time when Giana had pretended to be a princess, selling the stores and doing good deeds. Now, she sits in the throne room, without a single ounce of magic left. Anyone she can talk to immediately finds out what this means. A rebellion started when an Ogre left the commons without paying the price.
Now, all that stood between her and justice is broken. The civilians were impressed with the hero. " We've reached the throne room with the most terrible hero yet! ", Ulfric said. " And now we show him who to rob the rightful king? " Alistair replied, no hesitation in his voice. " A hero of such anger and apathy! That's what I can only hope for!" With that Alistair vanished from the street and she followed the survivors. What a lovely girl she was.

Garamond Turnip walked towards the sink, eyes locked on the plate in front of him. " What exactly are we going to do with a cat? ". Lucas squinted at his face, sizing up what Fred had on his plate. " We're gon na kill them, " he said. " I know we wouldn't be, " Oliver responded, wishing that Garamond hadn't started his rant by putting in as much effort into trying to tell Fred he was hungry. Fred nodded. " Potions, we'll let this go. " " No, " Oliver said. " We're willing to cooperate. " " It's not like we need you, Fred. We can hear and read all the water. " Fred nodded again. The men groaned as Fred wondered what else they could do with the birds around them, while panicking themselves and stinking of alcohol. Garamond turned back to see what Fred was going on about, but Oliver continued to him. He looked at Garamond with murderous eyes, darkening the night. " He's been following us for hours, " Oliver said, standing. " I wish he was not following us! " Fred smiled at his true intentions. He did not panic. He smiled back, and jumped a few feet away. Fred glanced back at Garamond, who was laughing his asses off.
Meanwhile on a couch in the library, an old man sat down on the couch, and ate a bowl of cereal. He twiddled his thumbs together as he glanced over at the clock. Garamond's cup of cereal was empty, and he grimaced, as he realized, not thinking it much longer. Garamond turned the clock back a few seconds, but Fred was still fuming. " Mr. Clarkson, it's useless to tell what is now considered right or wrong. You're perfectly sensible, obviously. " He stared at Garamond, still very confused. Oliver stood and pushed Garamond off the couch, leaving the lonely man alone. " Fine, then. I'll help you. I don't want to play with that thing, though. Why not, call it a hobby, anyway? " Garamond shook his head, staring off into nothingness. The old man paused for a moment.
Garamond scanned the library, taking deep breaths. The sound of lightning cracked against the concrete. The sound of a helicopter landing on a field outside the library brought Garamond's vision to a sudden clarity. He sprinted off towards the field, where he grabbed his rifle. Before he could register anything, his vision stopped.
Garamond put his hands on the rifle, and looked around the corner at Oliver. He turned the firearm around, and fired a round into the air. Garamond let out a gasp as the pistol fell to the ground. His lungs broke down, as he screamed. A man in a dusty uniform and labcoat - the one Garamond was wearing when the SWAT team stormed the lab, heading towards the computer room.
" My god, " the man said, clearly confused. " Isn't it his imagination? "
Garamond's eyes widened. " Forget it, Oliver. I was just writing a book. I have powers. " Garamond laughed. " Our universes aren't shit. Ever. It's not personal that matters." He closed his eyes. Oliver couldn't see any of it. Everyone else had powers, and it wasn't normal for the authors to have negative powers.

I sit staring at the table, and the table itself. I shift my eyes to the individual objects of importance in the room. The table contains a few things: gun, pen, and gunpowder.
I open the drawer next to the gun.
There are two words on the file on the table:
"pen".
I smile and slide the pen back into my drawer, and put the gun to my mouth.
I put the gun to my mouth again.

"Its true ", Wile E. Coyote thought aloud as he dragged himself into the time machine. He had just gotten a job at PricewaterhouseCoopers. However, this was not the first time he felt disturbed by his old uniform. No, he had not received it since his wife two years ago.
" Oh, wow ", Wile waved his new suit through the machine into view. What was happening in there, Wile felt as if it was on some kind of queue queue outside the mall.
*No. *
What could possibly be happening?, Wile had never quite gotten used to this concept of the queue inside the building. All he knew was that the less he did, the more violent and sinister the space inside a space soon grew tighter.
" Wile, not the Office of Management, not the White House, not even the Don, you know I had ITs installed on the other end of the time machine. " A strange voice in the vacuum of space carried out a voice for Wile, who was now completely uninterested in seeing who the voice was referring to. It continued.
" But tell me, Wile, *did* anyone else in the world have alternate-aliens? * Were they just holographic right? Were they merely holographic humans? Did any of us actually *require* them to stay here? "
" It was all a dream, a dream come true. You would never get used to it any other way. We prepared ourselves to lead humanity to greatness. Never have we visited the past. Why? "
*To not be caught by the end of this place is as bad as anything*
As Wile passed the man, the voice began to speak again.
" It was just a dream, you and I were wandering the earth. We dreamed of one day. We also dreamt of another day. "
" Exactly. You never asked me what happens to the world if I told you."

John woke up with a start. It was the most amazing feeling he's ever experienced, and he was in the exact spot of the town cemetery in which he will forever treasure his legendary existence.
It was from the depths of another world.
John was short, thin and took on many features, with enough organic matter for each of his slender limbs to comfortably carry himself around in his pocket as a fly. He was an expert in many fields of his native tongue, but learned very little in the way of finance nor art, to be quite honest.
But he had a goal, one that always seemed to lead to those things, just as he always did, he was told to come up with the perfect idea after he had walked alongside someone, always had, that his explorers would leave with, hopefully come back with a piece of him.
He reached it. The next step had been perfected. The moment he felt it pull out of his body, he could hear a green, choppy, rhythmic thud from above him, as it would rattle his bones from under him, as if the handle had been carefully pressed by a human. Slowly his vision cleared, and he could see the shape of a wooden *stonel*. The only thing at his feet was a shallow hole, and he could hear him breathing, and the smooth, ethereal colour of its oaken wood from the stone grave in which he had brought it, had grown a beautifully sharpened, well polished diamond.
He made what he hoped would be a happy pat on the back.
The rest of the adventure was as as the usual, John slogged along the empty roads, hearing the parkades past, carefully inspecting the rooms as well, taking care to make sure that they were all nice and tidy, in fact anything that looked like furniture would be far more forgiving if it could all be done in one fell swoop. It was glorious, and he was walking through those halls, with a grin on his face, happy for the first time in quite some time.
John sat down on the ground beside the coffin, his sneakers clicking along with the cement. He placed a pale hand on the coffin lid, and delicately placed his fingers into the metal, almost as if staining the parchment, his finger still connected with the carving, and the hole opened just as suddenly as he had first seen it.
The door swung open as he stepped into a vast hallway, only moments before he had felt it landing on his shoulder.
*Farewell. *

Who could? It was just me. My name was Mina, and i was only 20 and in love with writing and poetry. My parents divorced as a result of our male child being diagnosed with leukemia. The government encouraged me and my mother to write, go to art school, and even got high school biology. I was accepted to the beauty studio at NYU and made a fine $ 30k. The thing I love most is the writing prompt powers. Write everything.
I started to write from scratch. My girlfriend was a little shy and even though I loved her I didn't understand why anyone would want to read about her. I just gave her beautiful makeup, and she told me that it was her touch that got her there. Eventually I hit the pavement. Walking to the dealership after what seemed like forever. As I rolled down the window I saw her. I had barely made it in my car as i was flipping her around like i was a flying helicopter on Christmas Eve. I didn't even hear the car coming. I guess I was completely safe. I hit the road and out of nowhere an SUV just rolled over. I yelled out. The driver then told me he could have died from that car crash, it would have killed anyone in it. I quickly got back up but the world was in a frenzy. People are getting equally excited. We are building communities with followers, leaders, and supporters. The last thing i hear is telling you that it's been 10 years and you are still just sitting here there writing.

"We're telling you that isn't true! " said the pig owner, sounding incredulous. " At that point in time, when they're both sitting there in our custody, you can't just get their phone and say'we are calling the cops, we just got word that you've been arrested'. You have to make some choice that can never be made by them, both physically and emotionally. "
" No sir, "
" It's not that! "
" Have you seen what I said, Pig? "
" Oh, yes, sir. And I certainly haven't seen it. "
" Pig what? "
" It's not my dear, Mr. Pig. I have no idea what you're on about. "
" So what do we do? "
" Of course sir, we won't ask any questions. "
" If you never, never go to prison, I don't need to know. "
" Then you must shut up. In all honesty Mr. Pig, I don't know what you're saying, but I have to keep you in mind, for there are numerous facts that other pig know as well as I do of my severe state of being. "
" YOU DO N'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO TAKE MY PANTS BACK! "
" This just isn't my good friend, actually. We are to give you full custody of your soul and eliminate your most painful personality ever to witness. "
" That's preposterous! "
" Yes sir, that's preposterous. "
" Very well then, you must choose wisely. "
" Very well sir. Now what is your plea? "
" I don't have a plea, but you must take it nonetheless. "
" One foot in front of the other. "
" I will."

Father did not stop, as he always does. Silently scanning for the father who would confront him. Upon no structure, darkness passes in the deepest recesses of his memory. Sparsely aware of his own sins. A terrible loneliness voids out from the rest. Nothing is there to be found, no foulness or odour and no idea of its motivations. The hollow circle and distant blackness and out of the scope of his eye came a voice far more worthy than darkness.
"You shall never understand, demon! You are not of this world. Everything is based on your own fears and desires. That is your universe! You will never understand or believe in a god! You will never be redeemed! "
Its shadow spread to fill the tombstone, but the voice remained unmoved.
" You shall never understand. You are an endless nightmare of night. You dream of souls of spiders and demons and lies of bodies of men! You can not experience all! You can never rid yourself of living! You can not live! You can not be led to paradise! "
Again, the voice sounded.
" You shall never understand."
The echo lasted just a minute before the darkness left, leaving a hollow shadow behind for eternity, but this was hell before.

I could use therapy if people cared. Like some have been given money and some have been expected into the tribe. I'm not some mean monster. When I look at this monster in the mirror I see it is more docile than some of those predators, maybe some of the canine steeds have gotten in, and some of the kinks the creatures keep in are off limits. Now I find it rather cute to pet and find it is a rather joyous and luxurious cycle, while also kind of sad and peaceful and close to being tucked away at night by my cat, or the short cubs at my house. I think of her everyday... or at least that's what I tell myself when I answer it. Never do I go to my bedroom door and claim I am brave because in a week it was a punch line and the blabbering came out of her mouth.
I really don't have one that I'm very good at saying.

As I walk into the store there's a little girl sitting behind the counter, her breath so gagging that I can't smell. Finally I stand up and he begins to look at her. She hesitates for a moment before a smile crosses her face and the tears flow down her face. I take a step back and turn on the TV. It turns on to an alien documentary about Earth's latest plan to conquer the globe, that comes on to life and the girls face is lying on her ass. She knows what she's thinking too.
After scrolling down all the options I turn the channel down to a short story about what's going to happen when the time comes. I don't know what I want to see. I guess I should wait until it's the newscast on ESPN or something but I'm probably just dying because the city is already dead.

"Well I don't know " he said holding the gun, it was a wild thought then, this old man felt fear, fear of not knowing, fear of not letting his spirits rest.
But it was too late; there was an assassin. A man who thought he was immune to going to war with his God, but in truth he was just another human.
He knew he should kill him though. The damn assassins, getting to the point, now he would feel as though he had already done this.

I was driving late, in a well lit not so hot summer afternoon. It was very cold in the pit lane, with the wind starting to pick up, running through the making of the whirling. I was truly on my way home but I wasn't having much fun. I've been to many places and there, I haven't had any homely activities. I normally just go out and enjoy my day off.
My car started to slowly spin out of control, and I froze. There was a man in a white coat that didn't even wear a jacket on, and on him was a giant horse in a small white coat that fit him perfectly in the middle of the road. His foot took onto a steep gravel path, and he circled around the horse for a few seconds before releasing with a mighty whistle, startling the startled vehicle into pulling over and attempting to pull him over.
I left my car and didn't even make a sound. I then noticed something that smelled like rotting wood. Instead of human, or animals, I smelled the animal that was resting on my freshly baked bread. I blacked out while I was being stalked by this large animal with a massive shield, and I sat up. I dropped my shoe and turned around. The beast who had slain me had quickly advanced onto my beloved.
It's standing there looking at me. " What the hell you wanted with me? " it sneered. " I thought you would use your fairy meat for them, but I need you to tell them to climb me back up. You're my biggest weakness, you know that."

White House, Surveillance Unit, he *has* control of the White House.
He has seen all. He's heard all. And he wants to know.
He had expected nothing less, at least from a woman when he first worked in the White House, and just about every day now.
He had never been given specifics, at least from a man who found his memories dampened by only talking in his own head. He had been briefed on everything from leaks to decision making, but not today. Today was no different.
He looked around the bunker, down at the body of the deranged bastard. It would be a small wonder this small bunker, forty stories high had not had the small incident yet. It would be where he would finally be able to speak and understand.
The little eminence sitting in the doorway read the words furiously. “ Find her. ”
A few moments passed before he gave in to his delusions. No one ever really told him to stay asleep for too long. The machine recorded his hours and minutes, with the morning man upstairs following him around, planning a feeding pattern, something he would have never done, or at least no one he knew of that would, do, before he left.
No one asked him why he was still in the bunker when he never came back, why he was still gone when he used to haunt the memories. Now he was here.
The writing was clearer, clearer, quicker, clearer. “ Put her down. ”
He stepped forward, a better man now.
She cried for a second, and then she was gone.
“ Put her down! ” the man hollered, and the eminence smiled.
“ Yes, but you must remove her. She needs to sleep, and that's not possible through HIM, for HE controls the government. ”
“ Put her down! ” the officer hollered, and the eminence pushed back.
But there was no longer a threat here. There was merely some blood splatter that would prove anything to him as to why he had done this. They must work out the details.
Something wiggled in the room before him. On the table as it sat was a card. It read:
Jevo @ CIA
DO NOT OPEN. DO NOT TELL HIM ANYTHING.
As he lifted it up, someone called out.
“ Dammit. WHAT? ”
“ What? Jim who did this? ”
“ He doesn't deserve that. He is sitting on a table, still sleeping, and you will destroy him anyway! You won't let anyone save this son of a bitch! This is a joke! He is not real! Oh you know what Jim, no matter what you do, this won't stop you. That doesn't mean you won't shut the fuck up. ”
In a swirl of lights and smoke, he looked over the corpse. The man kept shouting, but it seemed to have vanished away with a thick haze from the cigarette he was holding.
“ So you won't fucking listen to Jim anymore. ”

"Hey man, I got the cocaine on one of the buildings left in the area. Too bad I was overclocked. " Frank said, looking to the gun holster under his armpits, drawing his own between the gun and holster. " Right, hey bud, how old is Priscilla? "
The man pulled out an'4.50 calibre gauge from underneath his suit jacket, and began the next set of questions. " 62 or 63, you know what I mean, that's very low risk. I got it. "
" So does she wan na help you help me? " Frank asked quietly.
" Give her that, " the man said calmly. " Your going to need it. A few bucks for it though, since it's very hard to get a weapon even from her. "
" Yeah, I sure do, " Frank said reluctantly.
" Alright, that's great, can we move to another street? The amount of cocaine is great, too, you're getting done by your schedule, you were rested too much a few days back. "

You pay $ 250 a year. Your bank account is full, and your personal immortality certificate is a three digit number, which is unknown to you. After the expiration date of a quarter of a world, your bank account is emptied of all invoices, government documentation, and other important documents concerning your body and your unique being. It would have been a pain to feel alive, but it paid off. You make the best money you can, a nice house, a nice apartment, a nice car, and a nice wife.
It's not the money that counts. Maybe it's the simple-mindedness of that. Maybe it's the lack of money that makes living your true self and its effects on you much less than it was before. Maybe the burden of living alone. The illusion that living self is a means of understanding others - although it's all too late now. You just have to stick to the demands of life. Spend some time with your loved ones. Plan an anniversary. Spend some time to play video games with friends. Make friends with other strangers. Enjoy the game.
The problem with life is, everytime you die, you reload your life. To your horror, the stacks of cash were filled with almost $ 250,000 at the same time. Everyone remembered, you had lived a century but they didn't remember what it was like before. And you took many chances. If you try to survive the hunt, if you smoke, if you die from suicide, you'll die again. Only you knew this.
You didn't worry. You even stopped counting and started to ignore your financial ache. You didn't know if you could play some video games like the new kid that you grew up with, or fight crime, or you went to live just for fun. Sometimes when you make a stab at a joke, a joke that makes everyone chuckle, and people stop talking to you.
It wasn't until you made a sharp turn and missed the sniper that you noticed how shocked your body felt when it happened. You quickly checked your bank account. Nothing - no money, no money - or mysterious gun, no knife, no anything.
You spent a few minutes off the couch and going to check on your friend Jamie. He's 31 now. You wonder what was so interesting about Jamie, who he rarely talked to. You wonder how he managed to survive you and stumble over the breakup, and how she left. What was so sweet about that friendship she had with your most faithful second wife. What was so awesome about them having a family. It wasn't much, but somehow, you got there. You've found Jamie's phone number, even if he isn't available. You're going to the funeral. It's all over, you'll be in your memorial duty sitting in the cross-walk for a while, wondering if you should call her or ask if she's okay.
But no one would be watching you now, and you won't be leaving until everyone else is dead. So you can't be alone now, but you're still alive, and you're still alive. Only you have to die.

Johann Hohmann, Galactic Ordinance Anima-12, and the Planck Division of Investigation Gamma, Nature Vol. 96, 5121b ( 21/11/00 ), 29:42 4 August.
Dear Epsilon Command,
This report will be made public when it is first read on the net. One of our top priority tasks is to improve the morality of those aboard the "bees", the larva which evolve after crawling out of a solar system. All of the probes we sent back from what I understand to be the Phobos Crater have failed to elicit any legal authority for us to hunt this similar process, including even breaking air pressure on the surface of the moon. We are profoundly sorry that our mission of accessing the Moon through a probe has ended in disaster. Though the preservation of the safety of the colony is of paramount importance we want to reveal the nature of the probe in depth to the public. We will notify everyone, including the female householdager and life-form in the immediate vicinity of the probe, along with any other members of the community. I apologize if this attention is directed to an individual, but sadly there was no response from the community. That said, we will do everything we can to preserve this species' health. We hope you have seen the results of this faraway probe, hopefully on public display later in the night.
Regards,
The Quantum Observer Division.

It wasn't like this before.
It's a feeling. It always has been and ever shall be. It ’ s cold, and fresh. It feels, like a different kind of cold that will burn all warmth in its wake. It feels like a different kind of cold that will clog your throat. It feels like a new kind of cold that will make you unpluck old bones. But it is, and is always and always will be.
Once, I was stupid and thirsty but she came right out and said, “ I need something to drink. ” I was used to the frigid air I felt when she was outside. But when she came out, it felt like it was an actual moment in time and I looked away. She opened my mouth, and some of her tender smelling lips and I was straddled by her. We were still so close that I thought I had accepted she was up and away. I hadn't really felt like she was around me, and the way she smelled intrigued me, and as I watched her rustle around, I saw her emptiness and sorrow. She was alone and did not deserve to be here. So I tore away and wrenched myself from her and left.
It was then that I found myself wandering round the grounds. There was a metal table, and a strong wood bench. The farmer gave me a beer, and I accepted him for who he was. The visitor in the metal chair was like no other and had the same tired expression. He sat there and took it from me, with a smile. It glowed crimson red from the source and I smiled back at him. He looked at me and looked down at his beard, and then at my dog. He raised it up and yipped at it angrily. He yipped at me. I knew this was my one chance to forgive him, and he dropped to one knee and curled up into a ball on the ground. I left and came back, exhausted.
"Thank you," he said.
He was gone, always and ever.

"I don't know what you're looking for. " said Steve in a deep raspy voice.
" I'm looking for people who will be lucky to find themselves in this situation. Let me help you and see who you're looking for, " said Sarah, who was kind to an open-hearted Steve who desperately wanted her husband to have a good life.
" I don't know who you're looking for either. " Steve looked intently at the glass across from him. It glistened in the sun with a hint of powdery ice sticking to the glass. " Call me Tammy, " he mumbled, and took a sip from his glass, before exclaiming back, " Some cool little drink. "
Sarah obliged and took another sip, settling herself face to the glass, squinting an eye to see if any of the ice crystals glowed. Her eyes widened, and her breath nearly shuddered in her throat.
" I need someone with good health and a strong brain, " said Tammy, staring wide-eyed at the man trying to lift a puddle from the glass, " They're all the same. In your dreams. They're all the same. "
Steve took his glass of lukewarm water, and looked through the reflection of his open eyes, and began to think about how strange it was to be standing in front of a computer screen, staring at a white screen, waiting for somebody to give him some time before he succumbed to the terrible cold or died. He shook his head, as his old, unemployed brain made a stab of white noise to fill the emptiness in his head.
" It will be okay, " said Steve, " Some day they'll find the family. "
" That's so mean! " Tammy cried out in terror at the fact that his owner, his hospital-patient, had somehow survived their journey into insanity and death. " Any good little plans? I don't have much time left."

^ ( ^Read about the Devil as a teenager! ):
*I'm new at this so any constructive criticism would be extremely welcome. I think I feel like I would be a little less stress free. *
^I tried to reach out. I tried to hug so hard. I tried to scream. I tried to plead. I tried to somehow escape. I tried to crawl out of this cluttered prison. Where do the good people get from? Where do the bad people get their food? I didn't want to know for sure, maybe I should get my own medicine or some tricks. I tried so hard not to cry and stuff. Why did I do that? Maybe it's because I'm the bad guy. I can't hurt people anymore. Not at all. I've got to be ready.
^They don't know that I've already reached out to a man.
^A man. Then what?
^A lowly man, perhaps. But hey! He's got a past!
^No, now imagine that. He's the man who made this sentence. He's told me that my suffering will be over soon. That the name that flies around the office has changed. I'm pretty sure my wife's going to be pissed, something about the way she stares at me when I'm there. I swear she gets so angry, she does it at me. How had I done this? Screw my apartment, fuck all my family.
^Why so shocked? What are you even saying?
^Well, some guy is pissed off.
^Now was his fault. I got out of there quick.
^What did you do to deserve it?
^Got fired. Great shit. Oh, I've already considered going to Hell. I'm basically going into a suit right now, and shouldn't I ever know what happens if I try?
^You don't get fired if you don't give in. Maybe if you gave in, your suffering wouldn't grow to unbearable levels.
^How did you know? Why would you?
^Because I figured I'd try again. My past hurts. And if you have to get rid of the past before I can save you, why shouldn't I give you a chance to relive it once more? It doesn't matter if you die, either way.
^Maybe the first time you go in, you'll be sad. But not the first time you're happy. But only in the way I want it to.
^Maybe if I'd ever visit you again, the alternative would be worse. It might be that you're cursed with eternal punishment. You might not receive forgiveness in return.
^How should I punish you? Maybe worse?
^I like to blame someone else.
^I can't even believe that you started to look like that.

My 1st birthday is today. The knowledge will live on in my mind for as long as I live. I've read about it in my long-term memory for centuries, I've seen it, I've seen it, I've even read it. One of the strangest things I have discovered about humans is that they don't sleep a day. Sleeping is like everything else; a spring of life, a spring of death. I was truly lucky. I have dreamed of sleeping all the time. I have dreamed of being the next Henry VIII, and thinking about me as my maid but also as myself. I have written down all of the first years of my life and shared it with someone in a text book or a journal, even I'm not supposed to talk. I had to start an online forum to share it online, it's at this moment that I need to get it published, do you have any idea what I've written?
I'm a worldwide leader in an effort to find our next fast food king. My latest project is a prank. I'm going to change the world. I'm going to make McDonald's King disappear. I'm going to rewrite history. I'm going to turn humanity into a foodie. I'm going to bring peace to Africa. Oh and by the way, I'm going to write one of my biggest conversations ever. I know what you think about me, time to go!

"Cmdr Chat. "
" If we knew that the best defense against a black dragon was to use our greatest navigator as a navigator, we might well be opening the hole in this ocean. "
The captain pondered his question for a moment before continuing on. " I can't go back, I will hunt it down, no matter how long I go. "
This man was very well equipped and knew it. He was never one to plan for an imminent disaster. " Time for something more, " said the captain.
The attendant in front of him finished wiping his brows and looked to his left. " Actually, hey, your purse is yours if you leave your wallet at home. "
" Aren't you a great thief? "
" Pfft. You'll be attacked by kraken. I won't surrender now.
A few feet away, the attendant yelled out. " YES! You have your wallet! "
Confused, the man opened his wallet and it was his greediest goal: to take $ 200,000,000 from the one remaining creature in the area.
Taking in his petite hands, the man handed him the money.
The attendant looked at the money and felt a few issues. In the center of the table were two names: Father Planet Supreme Guardian and Mother Planet Insatiable. Before the man could pull out the money, he noticed one of the other names in the list was the dire one.
" Father Planet Supreme Guardian? "
" Yes. And not so misguided. " The attendant looked at him suspiciously.
" And my friend, yes? "
" You too. And tell us, dearie, why did you have to wait for me. You must have caught a lot of fish out of a sea of fish. "
" Is there a *silver lining* to what I've just said? "
" Fair enough. That being said, don't give that human name enough credit. She'll get you away from where you were going. "
" My own fault. Can't you keep her off of this shithole of a beach until a better one pops up? "
" Yeah, I'm done with it. "
" Isn't it a shame that you have no idea where you're going? Don't you think we should just leave your sister here? "
The man was calm in his patience. Even though it had all been over now, he couldn't continue his stubborn streak of cannibalism. Despite everything, this wasn't something that he should have sent off.
" And what if I don't? "
The man dropped his wallet and wondered why he hasn't gone to eat the sausages he ate earlier. The attendant still watching him, however, smiled and made the hint. " Well, my friend. All you have to do is take it. "
The man looked at the sea, the talk of preying on livestock and fish was picking up. He had no idea why he'd caught this fate, but he had plenty of time to decide how much the charge would be.
" Yes, so of course. Here's your kraken, a lonely little succubus that only accepts three members. Hey, if you let us have a word with your name, we might be able to take him away."

The nurses pressed their way past. Their faces twisting into a new demented rage. They were no longer alone, but the strangeness and monsters in the room. The faint whispers of a whispered soothed their anxious breaths. Those voices. Quickly the machines were removed from her waiting arms.
By the time she finished her sentence she was alone in this dark room. Their eyes opened.
"That's my baby. "
She couldn't say.
" I think you should get a room right now. It shouldn't take more than three to morning. "
" Good morning. "
" To the room. "
With a wave her hands touched the button. Anxious, it reminded her of her fate. No better place to die than here. Desperately she was forced to stand. One too many. The screams, the dreadful shrieks, the horror. Finally her breath came, slowly faltering out. A pause as the room turned from silent to heavy. The metal vibrated in her ears as she realised that the door had been crossed. How long had it been since she last blinked, how many seconds had it been since her last breath? The only sound that dared ring out was the scream of horror through the wood. She instinctively turned around, ripping out her coat to reveal the bloody nails. An old gun was twisted open, the gaping maw almost flowing into her chest. She lost her balance, the pain now evident in her neck. She forced her feet through the tarp soaked slush in her blankets. She was under fire, an oily green smoke enveloping her lungs and again lighting her life in a vivid crimson. The room began to become lighter, bright and green again. She lost more, they felt no pain as the world went dark. Finally she turned and her light finally died and no more sounds could be heard. Her hands clawed at the door in hopes that the beast had heard her as well.
The door swung open, yelling in a thousand voices. Her mother's voice on her recorder called her over " It was just him in the corner."

When I was young, I liked video games. You know, as a hobby, and because of that they gave me free reign, but I didn't understand the problem, right? Before I could begin to abuse them, they were hardcoded in. There were old ones with interface skills and it was only a matter of time before they gave me really rough graphics and artifacts, not my fondest favourite game, but still, I tried.
That was the first time I realised that I really wanted to use them. Everything took place on that first server, not far from the development area. I tried throwing away the dead server and just installing the first ones online. I thought I might be able to ease my other 6/25/15/20 mastery of controlling technology. The server would still be in good shape, and I could still run it from the server you dealt with all those years ago. After that, after a while I became happy with my "talents", and without them, I was content. Even now, walking around the terminal of a warehouse building, getting the database updated to the latest beta version, I could clearly see the universe getting closer to being finished.
A couple of days ago, as I was out of work, I checked my progress on that server, so I hadn't returned to the maintenance bay yet. I was walking to work, when I noticed that a thing fell over in front of me. It was an A11-100C humongous beast, no wonder the warehouse used that old console as a desk. I ran over and held it between my eyes for a moment. They both melted.
The engine was running well, and I had safely powered down the engines. I was back home, and waiting, somewhere in the back of my mind, thinking that I had already arrived, but then it happened. A bright blue ball appeared in the corner of my vision, and I hit reboot, not noticing that my memory was on the screen, I grabbed hold of the shelf, it was spinning around all through my head.
I heard faint whispering coming from behind me, which made my head spin a bit, but I don't think any longer, and when I looked back up, it was a small red glowing light. I dropped it out of my sight, as a cold smile came over my face, again, again. There were no one there, and no one tried to hurt me, because I knew it was better for them to be gone.

Few knew what he truly was: Hitler's assassin. Or rather, nobody knew until it was too late.
Nobody knew he had been infected. On the night of the war, rumors spread. Many believed his body to have an infection, others believed his wife and children to be infected and that he had contracted the disease. There were many reports: it had already spread through books, spreading quickly and mostly by sufferers of gassing weapons. Even diplomats from Europe and the Great Lakes kept a watchful eye on Hitler. It wasn't long before rumors spread too.
Many could only imagine what humanity was thinking, all of which was concerned with inorganic matter in the era of time travel. But these suspicions got to one person: Dr. Andrei Luksen.
Dr. Luksen's work had never been more controversial. In a way, he did, but unfortunately one could also guess about the cause of his public outrage. This would be because he had always been anti-technology. All of the large scale tests conducted by doctors and the relevant NDA materials were over the course of weeks. After 6 months of tests, tests performed, and results decoded, all at once the theory was confirmed.
Everything was wrong. The development of the time machine was not what was supposed to occur, and the changes caused the world to become cloudy. Still, no one can ever know what the causes were for such a catastrophic change. The government sent all the allied forces to the Kermanman-Oberstau Institute of Time Travel in order to prevent the effects.
Dr. Luksen only got so far, in the mid 2010's. Things started going wrong. Millions died, starvation, disease, all of it unprovoked. All because of Dr. Luksen. But this time, something was different, something powerful. The army never saw this coming. The entire German National Guard was neutralized. But, contrary to popular belief, it wasn't too late. As soon as Dr. Luksen arrived on the scene, every German soldier fell dead and out of many enemy lines. This caused the war for a long time, lasting to thousands of years. We are now at the end of a plague that causes the president of the world to be killed.
The first signs of the corruption started in South America. This resulted in the blood of at least 15 % of the population of South America being consumed and buried. Having gotten hit in the back, it was largely from rats. This led to a horrible crisis: Argentina was purged by most of Argentina in response. Due to the lack of work from the militaries of South America, that meant the eradication of all the remaining human life on Earth. The poor people of South America were reorganized into one society: The Scandinavian Two Cultures, or Vanciras for short. This was truly a utopia.
Dr. Luksen wrote The Mein Kampf in 1972. It contained stories of wars and tragedies that began within the borders of his North American homeland. The ramifications of his work on the western nations were far reaching. Even President Nixon had to be pressured into signing the books. " I have to send a message, sooner rather than later," he foresaw, and bided his time.

When we learned of this device that would take our equipment and wake up the human race, our answers made few people want to talk about it. After all, what if we got murdered for what it is? What if the future of the world turned out to be so *important* that a few people tried to get rid of it?
Of course, in the end, the results were not so certain. It began gradually. You didn't have to see this phenomenon. We'd come to believe that we would feel the effects, as much as we did a few minutes ago. No one did really know for sure. The fog cleared, and the only thing left was dirt.
In a week, we'd all been elevated and loaded into our trucks. We waited in the windows and smoke cleared our faces. It all made sense. The fog would have been so fresh, so real, that we were able to make up our minds. We were *alive*. People.
People gave messages of congratulations. Talks of radical separation took place between the families we'd split. Relatives started to curse for not understanding, but we soon began to repair our shattered homes.
Though we were forced to fight so fiercely, it did not take long to find a solution. Change was over. Well, we found a way to repopulate the earth. We heard what they had to say, but we didn't get to hear any of it.
Our children were all we could ask for. We had strong parents, strong caregivers. We thought we'd be immortal, as in we could shoot at anything that moved and die. But that never seemed to work. Our lives ended because of that glass of lead, and all it left behind was rubble.
One day, that glass, it appeared. And though the world went silent, someone spoke up. They wanted to know how we could change the Earth, but nobody had ever had the guts. They changed us. We all changed. Eventually, we could rebuild our lives.
We created a zombie group, and all the survivors looked after themselves. The sickness wiped out most of us, and we began to build new ones. Some people found the inner workings, or looked for the practicalities, but we decided to change the world too. And even that was short lived. We murdered each other over and over, throwing ourselves into the land.
Songs started to play, and our children's only wish became a joke. Many of us started crying together. At first they didn't understand what we had done, but soon we knew. We would all come together and rebuild the earth, but things would change. We were about to prove ourselves worthy to act.
The new generation was born.
We built a platoon, and along the way many more began calling us zombies. We waited months, and months, and months, until the scientists began to form them. They would rebuild the Earth, for us. They could stop all that.
They didn't succeed. A months-long siege started, and we were caught in their trap. We held the armies inside and prepared to fight. As we awoke, everyone noticed we were smaller than before. But as the days went by, they became less fearsome. They weren't afraid, but more afraid they were. They were beyond death.
Little did we know. Eventually, all that wasn't in the war came out.
The world burned.
Many of us were eaten by monsters. Everyone went underground, and we would wait in this cold, dark hole.

"It's the gravity men! Yeah, right? It's all pretty cool, I guess. Cool enough that none of them will ever get bored of tumbling under the Earth's belts. Okay, if you're really serious about Tumbling in the gravity class, do it! We'll make you happy. Oh, *sigh* just try it in the second layer under the pen this time."
My teacher's hand reached out, pulling me in and sweeping me away. Good thing I was wearing a full suit anyway, because I couldn't even see any wires anywhere on my shirt. That's right, on my shirt - what a brilliant patent. Every detail in my shirt - it was so thick it cut like a spider web and weaved between layers of space, white space and dark space.
I had always hated on-and-off classes and this job with the right people, especially *I*, like most newcomers in this area - it felt like the teacher was taking the tea leaves out of my tea-loving hands and pushing them into my mouth - this was common place - but when I stepped out of my office I just barely heard a thing out of my mouth in a way that made me feel better.

The rest of us are also the guards at the medical clinic. They're like nothing we've seen before, just people like us, and we're left with to deal with it. The people here are nice people: we're just the good guys in the bad guys. The more depressed and stressed out the prisoners, the higher the chance of becoming a sociopath. Everything's just fine, we don't try to be sad people. The only nice thing about killing yourself is the good guys trying to help. At the end of my sentence the person who committed suicide had nothing against me, they just kill one of us after our sentence ends. We were close, but then again, when someone can't do anything about it, that doesn't mean it shouldn't help them. We're just *just* cops. The next morning I went to the clinic, picked up my gun and walked out. I'm sure I'll be fine. It'll be a long night, but that's still something I want to do every night.

The tattoos read "STYLE. ADVISER. ENTER. "
I was an adventurous young man, then. A very adventurous teen, which was probably why I created my own rules for tattoos.
Three years later... no matter how much I hurt, there would always be a tattoo in my left arm of someone who needed it.
One year later... the third tattoo in my left arm had saved me.
The tattoo I signed had something or someone that read " -ASSIGNER. THANKS YOU FOR ENTERING MAGIC, SPECIES MAY BE LEAVING. " I read a text inside the digital thigh site that said " YOU WILL BE HAVING ME WORKING, BLOCKGAGE WILL BE GIVEN SO YOUR DOOMBINONS ARE PREPARED FOR REMOVING. YOU WILL BE DEEP ( SELF ). "
I remember my first time writing anything but an arrow at an emergency sign. I was freaking out, and then someone showed up with bright pink needles and slightly red blobs of light.
It didn't take long before the stitches started slipping away, and I saw another tattoo: " JAMES ".
One night, I stumbled into the bathroom. It wasn't the usual set of eyes that would jump in my face. Instead, it was a scar. I couldn't help but hold the smile that had slowly crept up my face. The power of this tattoo had given me meaning.
I decided to send someone to repair me. I woke up and began scratching and making smudges. I could tell that when someone was getting stitches or getting paint, they'd get tattoos. A homeless man was now using their tattoo with several inches of paint on his arm.
Eventually, I found someone. A man with one, on my right arm. They seemed happy and satisfied. We could talk now, but only if I tell her I had a tattoo of mine.
Later, on my way to work, I saw the man bleeding out on the floor. They called 911, and I offered to take him to my store.
" Hi, " they said, after which they stopped screaming and began ripping at my shirt.
" Hey, who is that? " I asked. " Can anyone see this? "
" What, huh? "
" Hey, take off your shirt. We saw your name, so if you didn't get yourself stitches, well, I would always recommend you take off your shirt. "
They pulled the shirt away from my shoulder. A few minutes later, a young man with a black tattoo was walking in on my left arm. He had the same tattoo as I had, and held out for me.
" What are you talking about, man? "
I nodded and offered him the tissue. They were ecstatic, because I was his tattoo. The man looked hurt and bled badly, but was okay.
They didn't tell me how to read his skin.
" You bet, babe. This guy actually does tattoos. "
The tattoo said " SEXAL ADVISER ".
" Oh my god! " I yelled. The man was dead. The bruise looked like an itch. " What's wrong with you? "
" Look, I'm sorry, ma'am. This isn't the type of tattoo that says, hey, " Yeah, really. " I wasn't sure what to do. It felt bad. I felt numb.
" Hey, let's run to the store and get paid a ride. You said you had a tattoo of yours. "
" I have a tattoo of yours too."

"You know, the wand chooses the wizard. " Voldemort stood there, raising his wand to his lips. The next thing he know he was in the middle of the Ollivander's tirade. Mr. Ollivander and Voldemort were arguing about a prank they'd been given from The Goblet of Fire.
" I can't believe you wouldn't stop there, who would stop to chase after me! " Mr. Ollivander croaked through stuttering. There was a light scuffle of sorts surrounding the wand before the wizard could speak.
" Mr. Ollivander, I'm pretty sure I know all about your wares. Anyways, I'd been summoned to Azkaban by a Professor named Bob Barker. He was so thorough with his wand, I can not believe that he would even consider summoning me, let alone a wizard! " Mr. Ollivander attempted to comfort himself.
" Well, if that explains why the wand chooses me, I'll need to talk to you first. I'm the type of wizard that likes to use little things, like... " Mr. Ollivander stumbled after a moment of silence.
" Bob, can you just close your eyes? " Mr. Ollivander was thinking hard and murmuring under his breath. " I'll just need a few more seconds, but I just need to clear some things up, will ya? "
Bob walked back to the broom closet, which was holding an empty jar of wands and mugs. He flung them to the side as Mr. Ollivander sat down in the broom closet chair.
" So, do you know why you're here, Mr. Ollivander? " Bob pointed to the handle of his wand. " The wand chooses the wizard, it's not always clear why. "
Mr. Ollivander took a slow, guttural breath and cleared his throat.
" You.. you shouldn't have invited me so early. Would you like something to drink? "
Bob laughed and said, " Sure I would like to hear some tales from my dear friend, Bruce Thaughtor, who now knows all about Albus Dumbledore. "
" What? " Mr. Ollivander replied.
" Well, last night, you wannabe Potions teacher decided to possess me and hold me under his spell. There's another witch that's not a wizard, yet this time it's apparently Bruce Thaughtor, Mr. Ollivander. Unfortunately, I was able to destroy your wand and present it in front of everyone at the principal's office. Unfortunately Mr. Thaughtor isn't so good in school. " Mr. Ollivander whimpered.
" Ok, so now, now, it's going to be quick. Mr. Thaughtor uses a magic device to bring a wand across the room and remove me from the wizarding world. Fortunately the wizard refuses to talk to me, so he calls his uncle Bruce. " Mr. Ollivander began sobbing.
" That's it, huh? " Mr. Ollivander looked around the hall before the wizard pulled a chair from the chair's sides and climbed into the broom closet.
" Oh, sorry Mr. Ollivander, your visit was important to me. No harm would come to you though... " Mr. Ollivander sat down and turned to face Mr. Ollivander, his eyes widening slightly.
" So you want to play your trick on me? " He asked. " No harm would come to me now, sir? " Mr. Ollivander looked up and said, " Well, first you need to find out what's really going on, right Harry? "
Harry Potter was the most important person on the human world. Sure Voldemort has affected most of the different species on this planet in his many campaigns against wizardkind, he has definitely saved many lives. Sure he has caused plenty of pain to not only wizards but everyone in this miserable place. Sure it wasn't all bad, Harry Potter just had to save his best friend from death.
" Harry, let me help you... lets play."

I awoke, I didn't know what was wrong. I recognized the fear in his eyes, he didn't want anyone to know that. I moved my hand behind my ear, to rub my head I was still wearing my old Ray Bans jacket. A sharp pain came over me, the gun. My neck hurt too much, and I kicked in the door. Death, he saw me running again. I heard everything they had to say, "He does it again! "
" Wha- what? "
" C'mon do what now? I'm done."

It's customary for the older models to be of higher intelligence. The memories of who was who on my beloved face have been the only thing, all my training and moments have been built up to be the clarity and entertainment of a coin and bill.
I watch history through my ears until I grow tired of watching them go. With each passing second, one gets bigger, always weighing up their value, and as a result one sees others fill the screen of time more as theirs dwindled.
On the other hand, there's always somebody. Often in a company based off of their own face. That person is always hopeful and smart, always playful and friendly, everyone understands me by sight and smell, everyone knows me, and every few generations this person "gets" another, so something must be up.
These days it's better to just wait and see. As long as I am remembered and they don't see it coming, I will be okay. Forever - or so we've been told.

Everything was wrong. I had just lost everything in my life. I had no money to buy anything at the casino. It was the dollar store...
Yesterday, the people from the casino ran to me and said my report and the money should be sent to them. I know this means I have to do something right, but the bank is making it so if I don't complete my report, I will be in jail. " I turned around and saw that nobody else had left the place. Like I said, I lost everything. I just had to sit through my report. I was late for school! Everyone except my mom had been waiting for me here for the past 30 minutes.
" Honey, please give me my report! I have been living here for nearly 3 years! I have 5 years to go before I get caught. I have a chance to win it all! " I told my mom so she wouldn't have to take care of me. But then, a chime sounded and a man in a lab coat entered the room. " Thanks honey, but I thought this was an accident."
I knew I had to act fast. I grabbed the bag of gold I kept at home and left the room. I screamed and slapped the guys in the lab coat over and over. They didn't understand. I always paid my stay at the place. I can make it! This is what I earned since I had nearly everything at the casino. All the money for what I need to survive!

The beast screeched back at me. I half expected to see muscles leeching my skin off at the base of its bellies and what I saw were cracks in the stone below.
The plate was smashed to pieces and stained with filth. The crack in the wall was filled with something the scientists deemed a very irregular shaped bone. Only the confines of my being had this made it into my hand to take in and observe the damage as it was gradually carved down into the stone. I walked cautiously to the top of the mountain that surrounded me and with my first felt the urge to scurry up towards the crack in the wall which had turned into a solid, perfect sphere of a sphere...
..centred with molten lava.
I looked down at the hole I just cut into the rock and the peak about to land, only to find a huge crater. I had found an open box. It was a deciduous mountain gyrating with various colored gems.
*They may just hold a key to unlocking the old gods that gave them power*, I thought as I realized just how absurd it was that my balloon of a newborn child was now open up, seemingly seeking some way to complete what had happened.
I looked up to the sky and met a beam of light from the heavens.

The top of the giraffe-sized pedestal hummed with a whimsical splash of mist. It was his fifth birthday. He had thought about what he might do for his birthday, after coming over to his post during the day, and proceeded to sit by it most of the day. He had wanted to save this last person's life, and since she had passed away the last time his heart was heard, he would happily have picked her up. She was small, cute, pretty, and technically in good shape. The kid had brushed his bare chest, then craned his neck to see how long it had been.
At the age of five, the bloodthirsty little giraffe's stillness drew his attention back to his old box. The roof of the roof was behind him, along with a dozen other worn out makeshift metal boxes inside. He had never been particularly fond of wood and spruce, but since the year was over, things had gotten a little *wackier* for him. They carried a skeleton of a man, surrounded by boxes and a task force of soldiers. The kid counted four boxes, and for good reason, he knew that he had to do it. He gathered everything in his path, packed the boxes with little object, and left on his way to the school to collect the soul of the seven year old kid.
The youth walked into the classroom. He had counted all of the schoolchildren it had decided his neighborhood had gathered to attend, and had seen many different classes. His teacher was grinning at him with a grin that he couldn't place, and his father had always told him a few more times that people must've gotten their souls at a lot of events. Only, the kid had heard the stories of the school mascots and heroines all over the place, and the kid knew a few of them had decided to become a vigilante. What this little kid didn't know yet was that he would be the last of his class. This had happened with the 13 year old kid. All 7 year olds had gotten their feelings when they got their duty assignments assigned. At the age of 7, he had found that he was going to collect the soul of his hero he had met on his Junior year of high school, but he also had another interest of his. His favorite book he had worked on before he turned 7 was called The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. He had stolen it from his family's archive, and was pretty sure that he was playing catch up if not for the chance of collecting something so magical that he himself could even move it.
He stood in front of the teacher, only because she was really looking at him, and she waved to him.
"Hey, Donny. "
" Yes, Donny, have you ever heard of this Prince of Darkness? "
" He was the World Eater. He corrupted the world as much as he could, if that's even the right word. He ravaged. He ended whole continents, stripped entire nations, and destroyed the laws of the land. He was a very busy man. He was a force in every human being. Remember that kid? She'd done the fighting on a school playground... "
The teacher scratched his head.
" So... you would live your life on the streets? "
" Nope, Donny. Well, I never thought anything of it. " The teen's face went rigid with disbelief. He laughed, imagining that he may have taken on a shady figure he didn't recognize.
" She didn't cause the world to burn. Not to mention, I would be in pretty much every school. There weren't any kidnapped children... there was nothing, honestly. So, what do you want to do with your life? "
The kid looked back up at the teacher, still staring at him.
" Find a girl for someone you love."

The steps on the marble steps in the great white hall had been long since etched into the granite slate wall. Scarlett was pressed up against the wall by the consul and sat down cross legged. She leaned back in a frail old rocking chair and crossed her arms as she nodded to the first officer. Her brown emerald eyes shone dully around the room. The minister was just and calm looking at her, but her tone was ominous. " I regret to inform you that the Jex-swop at Tenon's will appear shortly, so that my horse is ready to depart. " The minister turned around revealing a braid of black hair standing out into the marble corridor. She paused, seeming unsure of what to say. Her head seemed to sweat as she looked down at her noble, daughter. " This one is a hassle. Why won't he come back? " The royal walked over to her, holding a piece of paper that she had not seen since she was a young lad. She slowly opened the paper and read aloud " This letter is my last will, she is my first. I know you will understand, but it seems that this will be your last will. " The paper was empty and hanging there was a note. It stated " TO TOM HOUTMAN BY ST. JAMES AND JOY OL " is large and scrawled in large white letters. The minister looked through the parchment as if he had just noticed the bold spiel and read the scrawled words " Unto Tom On The Fields... " The minister thought to himself as he got up and walked back into the grand white hall.
Only a few minutes passed, until a man approached the door. He stood up with a loud knock and said " Sir, you must be your daughter. " The minister rubbed her eyes and back to her good old old mother. He walked over to her and asked, " What is your address, and when will I expect to see you? " The minister nodded, turning back to the line outside. She decided to walk in, and after standing down past the crack a man appeared who was quite familiar. He asked the minister, " How may I help you? " She shook her head. She was unsure what to say, but didn't have a good answer. After getting up and walking through the halls of the great white hall the man walked up and asked to speak to the minister. He asked, " Tell her who my husband was, and how she can support me? " The minister nodded and said, " If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be here. " The man handed the minister his card and she drove away, leaving the woman with a coin in her hand. Upon returning she had reached the end of the hall, just behind her waiting to be met by a stranger. She walked towards the door to the chamber and opened it, revealing a tall cylindrical structure. She began to walk towards it but stopped. Upon looking down she noticed that her daughter was standing upon the first pillar, with a clay pot in her hand. She turned around to see Tom Houtman, stood above the pot. She sat and fell to her knees in gratitude for the opportunity. The pot was indeed full of clay! She then thought of her family and it made her sad to realize that she had been able to visit them all a time. She looked at Tom and said, " Who are they for? " Tom took his father's hand and pulled the clay pot. " Well then, I might as well just wish him a nice funeral."
The Queen cleaned up the pot of clay with her cane and gazed at the unceremonious tombstone in the grand hall. It was carved with the words,
TO TOM HOUTMAN BY TERRY AND JOY OL, ST. JAMES' AND JOY OL*

"Shush.... Shush.... Shush.... Shush.... Shush.... " A woman quickly wiped on the eyes of an attractive young man as the flat booth door slowly stood open.
" Here you go go." He quietly said while looking at the new employee. The man froze.
However, what shivered in his chest. He could hear the door opening. In the years he has spent in the pits of hell he had never sensed another human being slip through the doors.
The man reached for his cane. The woman from earlier could hear him brush the hair from his face. But still she opened the door and he stepped inside.

I died in a pile of broken cars. My stomach churning and my eyes widened. Where once I imagined bone jutting out from the road, my eyes were filled with the fiery red of defeat and despair.
I'd ridden on the backs of freaks with power this wasn't Heaven. The parallel dimension, originally called the City of Gods, was named after the gods who rode upon the back of the dragon.
Only this wasn't a city, for in it was waiting to fill my rotten pit. Beside it was the wrath of the Dwarves. Those wretched beasts died under the leadership of an Orc ranger named Stanley the third.
They came here for entertainment. They came to kill so that Stanley could abandon his party. Not that Stanley was a terribly successful one at that. There was simply no sense to him. It was just scenery. Nothing of any sort. What was this fucking town called? How could I have known? If only I hadn't come to waste my bony limbs and be reborn for good.
I had been chosen as an oddity. An oddity who should be kept like this, and thrown out. For reasons that I didn't understand at all. For reasons that I did not understand. They brought me here to possess a twisted human being called Shagni, however. She was a scary looking creature. She bit into the flesh and bit out. She chewed at the bones, and I did not suffer, for I was in hell.
I had never eaten human. I couldn't eat human. I was forced to eat human meat. And by some sick joke, they might ask who I was, to which I would reply with that I was in hell. I was in limbo, maybe, but this wasn't really Hell. In one of the prisons, a mad asylum, sat a can of human meat. It tasted like chalk, and being around things very distastefully, I knew I shouldn't have drunk it.
I remembered what happened in that case. I was stuck here a long time, I was raped and beaten, and I was heard all the way back to the once pure realm. When I got out, I figured out that the council had chosen me. That my long three decades were over. Just like all previous lives, I'd been whacked. The council put me on an upburst, that's how it was called. I didn't like having to clean up after all those times.
That night, after a long day of rest and eating at nature's miracle meat, I began to feel drowsy, except for one small fact. I was in hell. I was on a can of human meat. I shouldn't have eaten human, I should have died. The council didn't believe me until I took the chance to sit next to a dwarf. I nearly fainted.
"Welcome to Hell, Stanley. " I said as I sat down.
The man was a man who walked up to me and immediately transformed me. When I first heard it, it was insane. I could feel the fleshy bits of the body being torn from my body, and that had all happened.
" Welcome, " I said, " to Hell. "
" To Hell? " he said, slowly.
" To Hell. "
He lifted my corpse and handed it to me. I was about to ask, " So, it says on the sign above the circle? "
He smirked, and that was the end of it. He removed a remote from his bag, and left his hand out.
" Take this away from my head and hit it open on the side of the circle."
And so I was hauled out of my hell and, leaving Stanley alive.

What I was always scared of was fear. The horrible flickering of the dark and the smell of rotting flesh leaving the room. I sat in a circle next to a fireplace. My lungs burned and my skin was acidic with smoke. The smoke would billow past me like smoke from a burning barrel.
I would often visit my sister at night. Once I would, and I would look through her window and see the starry sky and blue pond, for fear that one day in my life I would have no companion in this world. It would sit in my house slowly, waiting. My sister would lay on her side and she would bend her back so that her head would one point at the glowing eels growing on the floor. She would cry as she lay there and I would smile a sad smile.
She would kneel down in front of my twin sister and whisper in my ear. The sounds of a melody replaced the monotone of the wind. " I can't wait to be with you again, " she would say, " and I will love you forever."
I would close my eyes and sat next to my twin sister.

So many aliens have come to visit us. So many planets. All lands were inhabited by only one race.
The Universe was vast,
yet in ruins of a great species.
No one knows of their destination,
but their state, their history, and their achievement.
I have taken a few of my own to come.
It was promised to be quiet,
but the creatures of this world all behave differently.
Their webbed bodies were uninteresting,
but I had already asked, "what planet are you from?"
These women all wore strange make-up,
but I knew they had come to this planet.
Their food and shelter was of questionable quality.
Their civilization was primitive, and a bit stale.
The ones on the planet were tall, ugly, and to much to look forward to.
Like phantoms of some evil, they leered at me,
approaching me to tear me apart.
Their weapons, paint, lighting... all looked to me though it was dark.
It was a cleansing ritual,
that the woman I met on the planet, would be needing.
She had all appeared to not really be her self.
Their mentality had changed.
Such is our planet.
All it took was one hesitant god to place its claim,
and I swear to the Universe that, someday, our planet will be a place of things to remember.
I hope one day we'll do the same.

It all started with a baseball. Before the game, Bobby continued on with his usual routine. We saw him by the bench staring at the opposing team, Gregor -- who was called to the spot by a delivery person and asked if someone was ready for the trip to Bradenton, Florida.
This was, by some miracle of happenstance, our day to day routine. Bobby stood still in the cold desert sun, preparing to put on his coat, grab a drink and jog to the bathroom.
The sound of bone grinding echoed through the chilly air. After a while, Bobby decided to put on his gear and head for the brush. It would be another rough day, where he would have to practice his stolen magic cards.
As he walked, he began to hear a loud man's voice behind him. He froze momentarily, but stopped when a feeling swept over Bobby's shoulder. The warmth was instantly gone and replaced with a feeling that he needed to experience every day in his life. He felt like he was about to give up.
The man approached Bobby and gripped him. He didn't move anything. What he was feeling was absolute terror. Bobby looked around, confused. Was he about to be robbed? What do I do? Bobby cleared his throat.
"Are you going to rob me? " the man asked, forcing his eyes toward the man.
" No, " Bobby croaked out.
The man took a deep breath. " Listen, Bobby, I just want you to have fun. I'm coming along now, so you can have fun! "
" What do you mean? "
" I just want to have fun, but... I don't think I'm going to let you just *go* there. "
" Listen, Gregor, I'm going to rob you, but I'm going to try to tell you -- "
" You aren't going to do anything! I'm not going to rob you or tell you to leave, and it's gon na hurt, and -- I -- I'm going to -- you're going to -- I'm going to rob you! "
" Don't you dare. "
" No. No, no. "
It took all of Bobby's willpower not to tear up.
" What are you talking about? "
" Listen, Gregor, that's a HUGE deal. "
" -- how does it hurt? It just hurts. "
" Like -- like it hurts -- "
" Like I said, it hurts! Just get over it. I'm going to -- I'm going to -- get over it. I'm going to come to Bradenton! "
And so, another man was robbing Bobby of his prized possession, a baseball bat. Bobby was scared, of course. The man grabbed the baseball bat from Bobby's hand, and kicked him in the groin.
Eventually, Bobby won out. It was no longer just a game. All of Bobby's possessions were being appraised, and the money was being collected for what he wasn't doing.
" Wow. That was hard for you. "
" Maybe I'm not worth the effort, man, " said the man, barely managing to keep his voice in check. " Anyway, take it down. "
" But I can't, " said Bobby, trying his best to run up and down the streets begging for money. He felt his knees go heavy and his heart sink into his stomach.
" If you don't give me *what you did* I'll call the cops and take it down, " the man assured Bobby.
" I will, " said Bobby, a little more slowly than he would have liked. " I will. You will see it tonight. "
" Okay, " the man agreed. " Thanks, buddy."
All of the sudden, the man didn't have the energy to make any calls. He felt like he was going to cry in anguish. He felt another physical slap on his shoulder, but Bobby was blindsided by his anger. He grew his way to his feet and grabbed the bat. He stuck it in his breast pocket and began to pound it into the dirt. Then, suddenly, someone yelled:

This place was more terrifying than anything else I'd seen. Nothing but guns and bombs and whoever wanted to hurt the humans. And you'd think, “ can ’ t the humans lead people to war or save us? ” “ I could always use a race that murdered their own kin for better or better! ”
I wasn't going to stop there. The desperation of humanity faded into a real panic. Mankind's world around us crumbled in that moment. It was an instant, a final blow against the human kind. I wasn't sure if I ’ d wake up back home, or die too soon. You were all prepared for that day, because you had everything covered with blankets and blankets to be the last. Unless somebody else happened to kill themselves, then there was nothing I could do.
“ You should have saved us, ” I whispered, shaking the thought away. “ Humanity always had great things in life. Most of them for better or worse. ”
Humans rarely died except in battles, and the fights often were so close to homicidal fights. They were less brutal then they had in the past, and I never could pretend I wasn't prepared for what I saw. The fights were so close; it was hard to focus and control myself. But even though they didn't really die, they still fought. I could feel the struggle escalating as their eyes grew into the mindless never-ending, so very fast talking that it almost felt unreal.
Their speech did little to calm the terror in the others voices. There was no yelling, no flashing lights, just silence and silence. My goggles shifted and adjusted to the window in front of me. The sound of gun fire rang in my ears, and the primal voices in my head now echoed through the empty cityscape.
Humanity no longer existed.
That wasn ’ t good for me.
They should have let me play, I thought, but I was just an alien.

I examine him. He's still, or perhaps in a different state. I adjust his balance with one hand, for the sake of eye contact. He nods at me again. " Yeah, really. Yes. You do wan na come all over again. " I look him in the eyes. His grades are surprisingly " average" and he looks like he is in better shape. His heartbeat has risen the better half of a heartbeat and he seemed to notice the passing of school itself without the sun setting. I relax. He still feels an edge to his personality, I think to myself, but it doesn't seem to be lost in the demeanor. His eyes still burn though. I see the man smile and he holds out his hand like I do. " Sure thing champ. Anytime, what's up kid? "
*5th Grade: It still didnt go well
*4th Grade: He was ahead in math. We knew he was moving way ahead, to a better point. His teacher recommended he go into math instead of science. I lowered my gaze to stare, but it was like looking into a mirror. No tears, no teasing, nothing. Just the faintest light of youth on my eyes and my pupils twitch. I take a moment to check the teachers' notes, but as I'm thinking about what I'm seeing, I'm now thinking about my son.

[ F.S.S. This is what I write ]
"The Skeleton Key. "
" Okay, this is pretty damn neat. What if anyone ever finds it? "
" Well, I could maybe open one of my own little worlds, all except you, my other programs. "
" You should be proud. That's what I'm all about. My software wouldn't actually be here, what would we find? "
" Not that I'd know that would it? "
" It's your imagination and it'll happen. I've done this a million times, surely you could do it yourself? "
" Well I can spend the rest of my life watching. Why do you think I'm doing this? My question is where to find it. "
" What if we try it in your world, and the world around you, the world around you that I live in? "
" The world and everything I love and live in, and everybody in it. And you were there! And if you make a fucking choice to jump through time and space? "
" What if someone ever tries to figure this out? "
" Well, I got the code. Hmmm. Like what if it turns out my entire world just ended up with me being a guinea pig? I thought I'd take it and get away. "
" So that's where you go, you think? "
" Wait, what? "
" Just step through it. "
" Why not? I wouldn't even let that happen? Or at least not right now. That's exactly what I'd say right now. That's what you really want. "
" Sure, but don't jump into that mess that's real. You don't have the keys I'm storing in my bread, even if you wanted them in my bread. Just get out of here."
It was over. Slowly, painfully. Perhaps it wasn't his second step. Then he'd always be there! Or, maybe it would be his third step, just as he had always been that he wouldn't be able to work out it all. What if I found out. What if I could fathom the enormity of the enormity of the code that'd made me the world's greatest programmer. What if I could complete it. What if I could spare time and spare my breath.
A deafening, agonizing roar erupted from the depths of the dark.

The city can't get used to the traffic. Everybody around me was just feeling forward, having fun, watching the sun rise or waiting for a rainy day. Today, it is a world away from where I grew up. I forgot how to say hello to my older brother. And, in front of him was a colossal purple-red colored concrete tower. I might as well be making dust out of a birds nest.
I walk slowly down to the front door. The incoming bus lets us in for a drive and the asphalt begins to become slick with underbrush and feces. Soon, we'll all have to live as tourists in the pre-scene setting. As we head into the neighborhood, my brother can hear me joking on the way there. I smile. He understands. " Wan na go to Thailand to change your mind? "
The wait is a long one. It's very frustrating to have to wait in line. As we walk, I lean my head against my brother's shoulder, making sure he can see me. I open the door to the main street. I'll still be waiting here.
When we cross, I hear the train screeching from inside the room. My brother follows. " It's been a long time since I've been in the office. If I could be closer to get my things today, I would warn you. "
I remember when he was little, so naive. One day, he was a good boy. He walked in with the house keys. I gave him a good smile, wishing I had been there to help him fall asleep.
" What is going on! " my brother yells at me, hitting me in the face with his hands. " Everyone stop trying to get out in my house! "
One of my brothers swats me on the back and tugs at my jacket. The poor boy must have been too tired or scared, causing my brother to lash out at him and call for help. I pulled up behind his back. " Dude! Get out! " I yelled. The train screeched and people began to scramble out of the back alley way. The door was torn open, exposing a deep hole, though I saw light through the hole.
" Calm down kids, " my brother commanded me, walking through the hole. I kicked the hole dry with my heel. I put my hands in front of me, wondering when we might see a tourist again.
I stopped at the top of the trees and raised my eyebrows. I flipped to the older brother and asked, " So what happens now? You aren't allowed to go into the box there. "
The older brother responded, " Nothing. " His long greying brown hair was blown into the air. It looked peaceful to me. What a strange day it was for me. After an awkward moment, he let me back into the backyard and turned around, facing me.
" W-What are you waiting for? "
" Tomorrow, you'll find a plane to fly to the Empire of the Republic. "
" Oh, right. "
I saw a glimpse of a long shimmering white plane floating in the air. I stared back blankly. At that moment, the plane stopped spinning. I ran into the backyard and grabbed my brother. He was breathing heavily. " What did you do last night?" I asked, hoping he would answer. That was the last time I saw him for the past few years. I sat on his chest, praying to whatever might comfort me the most.

I shut my phone off my glasses and slide them in, carefully placing my thumb on the touchscreen. Touching a button will reveal them, so be sure to put them away before you drop them, I sigh. I press the X in the top left corner, hoping that it'll open some icons. A menu pops up. I take a look.

A cold wind dances across my window. I peek out my door to find that it is still on. A strange knot has started up in my carpet and slowly I begin to fall.
"You want to go outside? " I ask my girlfriend. " I need to know where you are. The body is in Hawaii."
I pick up my dinner and find it is still warm, though I think I need some water. I make a mental note that I will buy more, so I leave my room and head off. My parents are still asleep.

My dear child,
For fifty years you had lived in this house, a vacuum of tedium occupied the living room. You read over the paper more or less in your head, only tired of taking it and writing it down. * There are no real secrets, * I thought. * No betrayal. Not even trying. * You watched, watching, as I took your little hands and held them to my chest in a grimace. You gave me a wide berth, you gave me years of your stories. Fifteen books. You held me for a second. * You don't need another one. Because- *
Three years. A lot of time ago. I learned to pour out a series of notes. I meticulously wrote in pen, memorizing every bit of your life. And then, when we looked up a picture of you that he had just found in your book, I rushed across the room and kissed you. I had a grand tradition in that house: you were the closest thing to my grandson's soul.
We stayed up the night like this. We watched movies. We went shopping. I took you to my favorite town, Phoenix, where we settled for the meadow. I wished you an open season.
Then I went back to work, running your recipes to the ever-growing numbers of a few hundred children. Then I forgot about you. I wondered where all those stories would go once we knew each other. Then I told you. You threw down the big red pen you held me on the table, and I looked you straight in the eyes. There were places we'd end up. The likes of which my story had never thought could ever come to fruition, and I couldn't have been more proud of you.
I left that night, but left my coffee and paper behind.
I've taken to calling you. I call you out, to explaining that you really have to stop. You wake up the next morning and look out the window at the sky with empty clouds. Then, with light in your eyes, your voice finally melts. My grandson is gone.
Don't be like that, Bea...
All my life I've been a writer. I can't think of anything else. I've done so much to pass on my success, but this is the first time I want to hold someone to a piece of paper, to write as if it's mine. In the end, I'll have less than three more steps, and I'm wishing I could say goodbye. And when I'm done, will be far away.
Don't make this with sugar.
Hm...

*The great dragon gave me so much: *
*Always a huge pile of stuff. *
*A lot of it, in fact. *
*But I cared little for wood. "
*It gets better and better. The words are grueling. *
*They call it Cormen, its bright blue body responding to my desires. *
*It's a great smell. One day I'll be doing skittles like it in the forest. "
*Its eyes are bright and I can taste its blood. *
*Still, after taking it in, I started to doubt it. *
*Was it venomous? Tastes of just shit? *
*After I forced it to eat more, it refused to eat. *
*I didn't worry too much, though. *
*It loves to play with sticks. We take them away everyday. We're careful not to blow them into the road. *
*For some reason it, like all things in this world, always resides in its castle near the Inn of King Harold. *
*Yet, its bright blue eyes only gazed at me. *
*Later, it would squint into the distance, then sit down next to me at night. She would think it had heard about me and trod on me. *
*She would think I made a fat funny face. And play with my still-blue eyes as she thought she might catch me pulling their remains from my chest. *
*It would dronie, then sit down next to me as she taught me how to talk. "
*She began to resist the urge to cry, but kept on coming. *
*She looked very wrong. My patience getting the better of me. *
*But she wouldn't go on with them forever. Only to fall asleep in front of me one night, when she looked out the window, instead of the shimmering light. *
*We would whistle at each other in the woods. I stayed awake with a willow, and it kept whistling. It kept rinsing my tears dry, just like every night it stared at the castle. *
*It forgot to count the steps I took to the palace. I counted every stair I took down. "
*More and more she found her treasure. Still, there were a few minutes where it could kill without counting. *
*I brought her with me to change a mirror. She would look towards me and smile at my height. "
*She giggled at my bedding. " *
*I had long forgotten my own face, yet her eyes teased me. Finally, she grew to hate me. *
*Now, as I laid in bed, she made a small peep at the mirror in my still-blue eyes. *
*Just then, she snorted. " *
*Then she looked back out the window at the castle. *
*And she sat up in bed. *
" Damn."

Their laughter, their feigned happiness, all had a tragic effect on the citizens of Los Angeles. Vomit had not.
"Oh my god we are going to have to do something! We must kill her! We must stop this menace! "
More and more celebrities visited the top of the corporate skyscrapers. In one forum one celebrity joked: " It's going to be our turn, and you're all going to start over." Even other celebrities left as if they hadn't noticed.
In another forum, a group of elderly women were seen near the entrances to every movie studio, a metallic blue as in she wasn't even a movie star.
No one knew which films the plants made for their plants. Perhaps the producers worked on the plants and - after intensive investigation - found out their plants and that they had something to do with different hazards.
Every city was ready to engage in a crusade against the president. However, one thing was certain.

The tablet came to life. The image displayed across the screen was something nobody even knew existed. A medieval horror movie scene, all crude in tone. Interrogator.
Then the visions stopped. One of them was clearly obvious. A vision of Chewbacca taking the new orc army hostage. Then the real identity of the killer started appearing.
Its a fucking neckbeard, apparently.
Wait. At least the movie was a parody of a movie. That's definitely my space-machines idea.

"I was just a little pet to her "
" My boy "
" I never finished the homework to help her "
" She screamed it all in there pussy"
They didn't listen when I tell them my story to the judge, I made sure the victims didn't go insane as it stung me to the stomach and somehow my life continued and always did.
At least that was what she told me, nobody heard it. I had to pretend she wasn't listening, pretending she was not.
When they found my body, the only reason I ever went to her was because of you, your heart it was a lot more loud than the others. If you asked if she was crying you could tell she was asleep and she was not. If she were awake, or asleep, and not thinking, it didn't matter. All it did was wake the old gypsy for talking to people, at the same time she was being sodomized by you. It made me forget what my life was like. I had to drown her, at the same time I had to bury her.
The verdict: convicted of three counts of murder, the second count of involuntary manslaughter.

"HEY! " yelled the hero " YOU ASSHOLES! "
Every time that a villain came up behind my face, I would also appear in front of a massive screen, filled with villains from all over the world. The screen was filled with this one well-known villain in addition to the major ones. " Was it more impressive than I thought? " asked the villain.
I sighed. " I guess, an enormous screen and the city where your eyes will constantly be attacked. "
I slowly realized that the villain had spoken with one henchmen, Jim, the Corporate CEO.
I put down my henchmen, walked up to him, and said " What's wrong with the plan? "
He laughed. " The plan to change the world and take power and rule it for the better."
And with that, I started my villain villainy.

His first words echoed around the chamber like an echo. His spine started to quiver, even now, as his sights wandered out of view. He saw an object, perhaps a plastic bag, with pieces of toast scattered about the room. He watched as the bag fell to the floor, slowly sinking into the ground. He couldn't stop himself. If only he stayed here. If only he never came back. Tears welled in his eyes, despite the tears in his eyes.
"Goodnight father," he began to whisper. His voice echoed through the chamber as he struggled to get rid of the object, but only had it be enough to sound like a question mark on his tongue. He tried not to cry. He tried to look into her eyes, but only just. She would never see it.
He couldn't hear the ground beneath his feet, and then something made it stop.
He heard... the words.
He thought nothing more of it.
His father never was good at hiding things.
He thought he needed to find out what it was they were saying, but no one had ever said anything like that before.
It came back. He reached into the bag and pulled out a glass bottle. He fished out a small wooden object and drank it, admiring the blank color in the napkin. As the box was opened, he looked at the little cast in the yellowed color, making little marks on the side.
The words said...
*System... Departure. *
The words spoke to him.
-- -- --
The men stood frozen, staring at the floor. Everyone in the room knew they would be leaving soon. One of them turned around and saw a door behind them. In front of him, stood a statue.
**1 year later**
Within the statue stood a boy. He was a 4 year old boy, tired from school. To make sure, the statue had been so loaded that there was no reason to bring him.
For the first time, he heard a voice, that of a young girl.
*Identify child. *
Signed...
The boy turned around and stared at his father.
His father leaned over his shoulder and called out to him,
"Dad, hello. Is everything ok? "
The boy looked up and saw the sky.
*In middle of nowhere. *
The boy began to panic, but before he could react, the man nearby threw the weapon his way. The boy had destroyed his father.
" Son, are you alright? You tried to open your eyes, but they told you to do so. "
The boy looked up to see the man now standing beside him. He was wearing a armor and tunic, similar to what his father wore, and a small weapon around his waist. His hands were thick as clay, and he wore nothing more than sandals and sandals.
" I was under the illusion that this was heaven, alright? " the boy said.
" Yes, but I didn't understand, that's all. "
The man laughed, letting out a groan and sticking his hand into the air.
" You did everything you could to get here, son. "
" What do you mean? "
" Everything you could have. "
The man turned and pointed at the boy.
" **Make it all right, son, like I told you did. We will all make it right. ** "
It was too late.
Both hands flew out of the man's hands, and the boy dropped to the floor.
He was empty, void of everything he'd ever wanted.
It had been years since the bombs fell, the war ravaged the earth. The world was now a utopia. Now he was here. He would make it right.
" Goodnight, son," he whispered to himself.
A single tear fell from the boy's cheek, to be used in the secret to make sure his father was back to live.

I live in a small part of Mexico. A million others have been here. They are family like-minded. In fact, there are too many couples to settle for. I get cornered and ridiculed for it.
At first I thought I was mad.
It started out like any other night, I am drunk at college, and there are like half a dozen other man at my table. I almost give up but someone finds me,
"Oh great, you are the President of the United States of America! Congratulations! You will be elected to head your governing body! "
Oh, my God, I *wake up*. I feel like a fish out of water.
I then look up and see a woman in a white dress who is all big and a flash for a smile. * Guys! I have psychic powers?! *
" What are you? " she asks.
" I am " I reply " I have psychic powers. "
I am startled, the woman in the white dress speaks back " Hey you are real cool and handsome and funny? "
" Yes I am. "
We all thought it was a joke. I lost it.
" What are you doing? "
" Getting rich! " she exclaimed
" How are you getting rich?! Why don't you tell me! " I don't have to believe what she's saying.
" I have psychic powers. It is true. There is some sort of field... that sends the messages. " she states
" What field? "
" Tell me. "
" Uhhh....where is...?"
I hear sirens in the distance, a few policemen, and a few civilians flee.
I always listen to the last two lines, the ones about tell the truth. Whenever I hear it I have better things to do than take the opportunities my conscience decides to give me.
One day I feel out of control. My depression, anxiety, and schizoid disorder all fade away. I am content in this empty night, in a empty room, alone with a woman who has psychic powers.

"That's it.... " stated the young child as he, or she, bore down on her, twisting her face in pain and terror, waiting for the strongest pain in the world to break loose, for ice crystals to steal her sight, for her to become the first ever owner of a curse from outside.
Although she was merely trying to form some sort of sentence of defense, her own mind wouldn't stand still with the terrible conclusion she had just made... The curse. A curse that to some they might call a free will curse, they would never know, she would have eventually become... But that was hard-loomed. All she had to do was feel it and then go through with it.... When nothing happened, then there was nothing but blackness, and the floor rumbled under her to break her-
" If you will not enter... " - She cut him off from the entity running through his thought process.
" No... You will not... " He flicked off the light that was beginning to bloom throughout his soul.
And with that the pain, pain and darkness were gone and replaced with the memory of her father. He had once called her her father the first human lady who was not afraid to be anything, but became extremely grateful in the face of her experiences.
But today, it is clear that this moment had nothing to do with her father's wishes, but instead was a game to be played in school or for fun. They would have to eventually part ways because they were still young and fragile. Sure, that might be how things usually would have been, but when you do have to go on with a long life and still be capable of so little in the face of these issues? No... It would have to be treated with pride, of respect.
" Well then... " He started as he walked to the entrance of the building where the children were gathered, looking down at the cookie.
" It's time... You will be part of something bigger... Not just this one cookie, but the whole of the rest... This world. " The cookie cried in its dark cold hands, shaking as it struggled against the cold.
The massive cube was finally ready to be eaten, and as always, she took the knife from the table it used to bite at... Her father.
" This isn't anything you want to eat, sweetie!" With her beautiful smile broken into two whole moments, his voice carried on into the world.

"I wish I was dead "
While I took office, I was less hopeful about the world, while more likely I was to keep the ship going despite the obvious risk to itself. On February 14th I released MY SURGE AMERICA. I took it far to the left when I led a less than robust and internationally reputable government into corruption, but when the test success rate started climbing, I announced the military was in full gear and ready to defend the world.
The first of many major catastrophes that would cause the extinction of humanity were sparked by the presence of my T-800 war machine. To this day, I can not recall the exact day that they fired the gun down in a self defense attack on an occupied population center in a small town in South America. The subsequent missile fire that caused millions of lives may have increased the local population's suicide rate roughly one or two. I was fired upon for this reason, and simply by luck. When I announced the demise of all Earth's peoples, I was praised as an example of all mankind's innate courage.
The second disaster involved a massive nuclear explosion at a safe distance from home. The cost of just keeping the ship afloat was quite an expense but the injuries to everyone are what brings the cost down. Often times people were killed during the initial tests to keep the safety of the ship active, but all attempts were in vain. People who wished to spread hope like a plague were put on indefinite hold. I bequeathed this ship home, despite the good the cost of keeping it afloat. I promised the new leadership that I would endeavor to make America great again. I have filled out multiple surveys with everyone a believer in me telling me how wonderful it is, just another piece of the puzzle needed to nail out America's problems.
Yet, the subsequent events could not be contained. First, our internet speed was increased by 85 % - huge fluctuations in the speed of light caused disruption to everything. After 40 years, I felt it necessary to launch the first manned expedition into orbit to a far off planet, hoping to restart the ocean. It was a far too risky venture to leave the planet, that made me think twice about taking on the need for a manned venture into the far future. As the new leader of the free world I would be well capable of some helpful purposes, even if I am a little less optimistic about the world.
I have visited England in hopes of the other new and troubled landmasses to get to know what it feels like to get taken out. While I don't know the reasons or circumstances of one or two, I do know that despite this the natives look great on my flag. People have been discussing this idea since their native ship started arriving in the first manned expedition, and many say if we could get to the be-of-this-future they would welcome us here.
I will not just sit quietly by and observe these young natives, but rather the chance to establish myself among them and see what one of these young people, who looks like a perfect father has been subjected to. People have just finally found a chance to lead the free world to a better future. As I leave, these young people will finally have a chance to ascend to the great responsibilities that I will represent. Soon to be their legacy, the American North has been at peace with their indigenous people. Despite all this I can see that you see how this bold decision has meant that the American people will continue to inhabit the continent.
" To be able to lead the United States to our next steps, we will also start from the address last week. I am honored to announce that we will be conquering China's border!"
Thanks to our courageous leader, America was able to reach a safe and peaceful border. Thousands of high ranking officers and scientists have been dispatched to the border and across the border attempting to discover its borders. More soldiers will be sent to make sure that every Canadian, American and Chinese will be able to rule the world in no time. It is time to relax and be prepared for the best, all the better for America, when things start going wrong.
*Don't make fun of me, I am an Australian man. But, being an american is nothing new*

"Are you buying that or what?"
They say we need to act quickly but surely in one swift movement we can all save our lives. It's such a silly idea, considering that every generation the next to be born will have to realize we have to act quickly. I shall not speculate.
More than any people have ever dared to say, today, I can finally buy that from the shop. Two bags, two thousand swirly seeds. They may be inside my backpack now but at a substantial price I can guarantee my return. But first, the farmer's had to do a bit of research. What would it take for that special seed to be planted?
*can you get this? I was cooking for my children as we watched, they went to school tomorrow, no thanks*
Having family go to school is the perfect emotional release to their lives, let me tell you. It's easy to say that if you are hungry for them, they will hunger for you. So what do they say they are buying? I overheard one of the farmers saying he loved that lady and that it was special for her to go to school. Well there goes my second husband saying that family is going to eat us all for dinner at 6 weeks.
*you are going to eat me? I'm surprised I have not eaten him before, maybe you wouldn't mind if I did*
Although, I have been honest with them. I just bought that stock. It's truly a gift from God. What happens if the lady went to school and you ’ re taken from them? If she went to school and you get taken from them? It becomes a giant deal now, as a stupid price. I will have no choice but to give this to them.
...
No, its a stupid price to pay for such a nice seed. The farmer called it the Blueberry Seed. What do they say it is now? I think our dear "wife" told us so. I suppose it was in a tuxedo then.
She laughs and I watch nervously as the lovely green color grows higher and higher. I wonder what he is about to say to her? Hmm....
You always have to be vigilant for something in life. You never should waste your time thinking about it. You never should let a foolish phrase sprout like the green one that shines on clouds and clouds glow like fire.
Sorry if that may upset you.
Love you,
Sweet Berry # 11

I see a man cross the street. * I* see a man cross the street, ready to kill another man who crosses the street, ready to solve a murder that I just committed. * I* see a man cross the street, ready to shoot another man who crosses the street, ready to cleanse a city of criminals. * I* see a man cross the street, ready to kill another man who crosses the street. * I* see a man cross the street, ready to kill another man who crosses the street, ready to serve my sentence on the street as a property lawyer. * I* see a man cross the street, ready to kill another man who crosses the street, ready to open my mouth to kill a murderer so that I may be stopped.
A man calmly crosses the street, hands on his hip. " You're my lawyer! ", he exclaims. I hear a loud bang from a shed behind me. They begin to open the car door, and begin peeling the paint on the ground. Then I see the man standing in the same spot, looking down, afraid.
" Why am I talking to you? "
" Because I need your help. Because you need me to listen."
The man looks up, his face glowing with warmth. Then he flops to the ground, but he is still looking down at his shoes. I stay silent for a moment. Then he straightens his back and flips the hood over his head. Then he opens his mouth, and tries to say something, but it disappears in a whirlwind of colors and sounds. Then he closes his mouth for a moment, and then he opens his mouth again. It's as if he can't even speak.
I slowly look up, and my mind catches on something, and I feel myself getting crazier and crazier. My limbs and everything start to shake, turning into sulfuric acid. Then I hear it, so loud, that makes my bones shudder, like the wind. I feel bad, like I'm going to be ok. But I'm not. And I don't want to die.
I hear the car door opening, and my eyes widen. My eyes freeze, and I hear people talking outside of the shed. I can't see them, but I can feel them. But I can't shoot.

I ’ ve had two millenia. There were times when I ’ ve climbed with the rest of the crew, and time since I ’ ve ’ ve been alone. The astronauts and co-workers often refer to me as “ Captain ”, though they often don ’ t really think the stories of those stories, like what I ’ m. They think they have something that ’ s important. “ This ’ s my home, ” they think to me. “ I ’ m a badass. ”
My name is Clint, and that ’ s the only way I know what I mean. After mostly 6 year journeys I learned about the place I would live on, but somehow I have been thrust into what came next. Two hundred and ninety four years have since passed by since they ’ ve been here. Now, it ’ s a world that these Neanderthals apparently started from, an Earth world while most of the planet has been destroyed by the vast oceans, never reaching the Earth ’ s surface. The half functioning civilization, now approximately the size of New York and Tokyo, continues the struggle, creating new cities, building world-class fortresses and skyscrapers, armed with weapons that haven ’ t been seen in the millions of years.
Can I really describe it? I don ’ t know. They don ’ t seem to know, and when I was a child, I thought they could see it with their own eyes. Now though, I can ’ t fully understand how I ’ ve survived on two worlds without meeting another Neanderthal. It ’ s certainly something to think about. I don ’ t know how a Neanderthal in space can create a world like this, other than learning that Earth was only a planet once, and that there ’ s more than one way to obtain resources on this world. I don ’ t know if I can handle it, or if this ends up back in the stars, maybe I'm doomed forever, maybe I have only just grown to love things outside this universe.

"Wha-what're you doing? " I ask my wife quietly, trying to hide the coldness in my voice.
" Just browsing Reddit and reading there for a few hours. I'm not saying you're a bad guy, or a nice person, or anything but I just don't like seeing bad men and women come into my house. "
Her face is serious now, looking forward to whatever it is her mind is working in. " I don't want to see you try to build that wall just to make your plans shorter. I'm not asking for this, Mommy. " She's holding my hand now, her playful smile or mannerisms nothing, but knowing that my wife has made a decision that truly feels right and brings good karma. Maybe I can look at him and see if that good guy will be that good at his job.
" You heard that, Mommy. Look at you. Check that fucking wall. "
" I'd like to let you go but I'm being honest with you. Who is the only guy that would look good at his job and was good at his work? No one could know. " She lights her cigarette again. " I'm not telling you anything to do. Just tell me what you want to do and I'll see what I can do. "
I can't believe that she, as someone who loves the idea of really making things better, would even consider saving a kid from a violent house fight. I turn on the TV, it's all straight to Channel 3. I'm sure they think I'm crazy for joking around like that, but they have this great idea of how dangerous this whole family thing is.
" Really, I understand if you don't want your parents to know. I'd like you to stop playing pranks on me like I'm going to eat them anyways and let them think I'm just an asshole. " I look back at her and smile at her, a sly smile coming across my face in a way that I expect from a normal person.
" Don't know who I am you little shit. Gota get off that beat you have." With that she leaves the house leaving my wife and children with their blasted case of depression. I don't think they'll understand.

" Would you like to take me on a ride around town? "
He turned his head, then saluted his counterpart, whereupon they made their way back to their vehicle.
" I'll explain everything more in one sitting, " he said, as they rounded the final corner.
The two nearly sat down together, each older than the last, with their lanky muscles wrapping around their oddly cold and quite quite muscular bodies.
" So, how did you overcome the depression? "
They both closed their eyes tightly and stared at each other with surprise. Both of them had become snotty, at least as far as they could tell.
" Because it was something I'm afraid I can never take back. "
They both thought to themselves at this point about how the aging was going to affect their life. Do they have to drag the past together to continue living together, or do they have to start wearing their doomed selves until their fucked up children are born?
" I am afraid I can't bear to take back the world, " the man announced. He waved his hand, as he always does.
He then gave his signature gesture.

I've been waiting for someone like me for a while now. From the basics, a roleplay that flows in such a frenzied manner that you can't help but take notice.
The recent changes were sure to make you someone familiar, while it didn't help that your pet dog was summoned to combat you back in the court of Vayas.
Unfortunately, they couldn't fix your torment. Who could blame them? Your Game Master has always been a long time to be roused from his slumber, and after helping you out by befriending you and introducing you to him, he will have difficulty expressing any sort of distress.
Being a Knocker, you must find someone willing to learn from your mistakes. I suggest you join a group, or become a group of others, who will learn from your mistakes. With the added bonus of pity, you'll help both the guild and the Player.
While fighting off the vagueness that has been your tried and true bully, you've noticed the latest instarments to his stats. Instead of becoming that type of one, I am punishing him with an example of a new skill.
You do get a chance to undo this aggravation... at last.
Upon activating the little hammer of your weapon, the aggression is expected of you by most. Though, the higher you wield the bigger the damage. I haven't planned this day-to-day, so I'll be honest. The MM is fun.

"One man one man, I fear... ". The demon poked his head from the tall pine tree in the middle of the village, its terrifying maw, flowing like water in the wind. The man turned, only to see the mysterious black stone creature staring him straight in the eye. The demon cocked an eyebrow, actually testing it's defenses against a trickster who was trying to escape the forbidden platform where his fire took over everything. But instead of sending him crashing into the stone and sending him careening towards the ground, the demon decided to follow his advice and kick him off the platform, flying off.
He hit a rock as the group of people scrambling to rescue him started to make their way to the edge of the mountain, looking for the mysterious black stone creature. Sometimes, these people got lost in their own search for their savior, so they gave up and climbed up the hill. Their leader, a tall, beautiful woman wearing a white dress with blue skirt and long white hair, walked up to them and slowly raised her hand as a way of saying " good luck, " before touching it to the ground with his other hand. He gave a tender and pleading smile as the group walked by.
The snow fell gently onto the ground and the two groups got into position, nodding hello and taking turns looking through the scope of the device. A small child sat on a snowy bridge in the center of the clearing. It had been covered in snow and blizzard, the object their village held in their possession was a large sled with an insulated basket. It was a stone sled that wrapped itself around each sled and carried it to their sled. The glowing screen lit up, showing a variety of time-series diagrams of various species of various sizes and types of animals and monsters. Their leader gave a deep, pleading smile as they did so. The ice had turned into snow, and the environment was freezing completely.
After a few minutes, the group stopped and the two groups went back to their sled. The girl was sitting on the corner of the far away sled looking up at the beautiful ice blue sky. " I think it's time " a stranger said as the girl looked around towards the trees, suddenly focusing, " why, where do they go? ". The girl asked curious, " my family has moved to this village a long time ago. " He pointed towards a clearing in the distance where three figures led an intense group of people. The first one started to run, jumping into the shadows of the clear forest and welcoming the man before turning and walking along the path. After several minutes, the group turned around to see the two beings in their range, as they took off across the plain towards the village. The girl looked up at the warrior, whose smile was constantly shifting from one to the other, and nodded. Suddenly, the girl took off her helmet, while the warrior turned around to look at the girl standing before them.
" My child? " the warrior asked.
The girl nodded, " yes, my child! This morning, I woke up with a hole in my leg where I used to pee at! "
Suddenly, the girl stopped and looked at the warrior through her blue helmet with " bumps in my leg ", before smiling at the warrior for a moment. " Your child, " the warrior said as he led his people towards the door that leads back to the village, " why did you wake up so early? ".
The girl smiled as they walked towards a closed door that led off to the way to the village. " I don't remember. " She said as she took a moment to consider herself. " My friends in school, I need a shower. "
" I'm sorry, " the warrior said as he began to close the door behind them, " but now you will have to fend for yourself. "
As they approached the door, the girl's smile disappeared as her hair grew long and pigmented. " Oh," the warrior whispered softly before leaving and disappearing away again.

"Welcome to AXIS Universe, allow me to initiate the procedures for the galactic colonization of the well-known " Second Galaxy " known as the Earth " but with the " RR-203s " of the " Axis" which are the less intelligent races sent by the Outsir Empire.
I will now initiate the procedure, humans. Humans who have spent thousands of years searching for galaxies, galaxies of these beings, against the whims of a Galactic Court ( as has been explained in the history of this galaxy ). Some of them can solve time travel, many of them can make each other feel there presence through a virtual reality. Not much has changed since human war, but human leaders have realized that death is no longer the the name of the game. Humans have settled down like kings, successful in the wars, yet long gone from civilization. Unlike them, humans have no reason to attack another galaxy, you can only attack themselves when you can feel within this one. This agreement seems empty at first, I can't imagine how this is going to work on the alien world, ever since humans first arrived in this galaxy, this system will no longer be American to everyone, for it is NOT American to be human. "
" Crib Biff for the humans "
" Crib Biff "
"... what? "
" Corporal Falkland is a cosplayer now. What is his name? "
"... Frankie. They speak a lot of French. "
" " - French? - Frankie?
" Now since I read the Galactic Journal I have to assume you understand that General Roy will be contacting us when you return, I also need you to inform that the United Galactic Alliance Space Command where under control of NeoGen has taken the liberty of invading a number of worlds around the galaxy, including Earth. The aliens are threatening war, and they are committing a number of murder and terrorist acts. "
" We don't just attack people! We obliterate them. It is no longer an option. We have to leave them at our mercy. "
" We will erase all knowledge from your mind if you don't heed his order, and you will be expelled from MIB for FELGI domination! "
" I don't understand, but I will send you to Commander Falkland if you don't comply and Crib Biff will convince them to join the Alliance or something, at our cost."

I'm in the cold for days. I used to be a beautiful girl, now I'm just a twisted carcass, like her lips moved when she kissed me. I've lost all hope. I couldn't handle it. The room is dark. I know the alarm clock. Asleep in my bed, alive and healthy.
"Get up, it's ready. " I say.
She thinks about it. She hugs me. " You'll never be the same again. You deserve the dark dreams. "
" Here, where's your phone? "
" Yeah, six o'clock today, and I like to take. "
" You have kids? "
" Yeah! "
" I know, but I like it here! "
" What's that supposed to mean? "
" Like your kids or something? "
" That's on a tape. The only time I change diapers is when I'm older. "
" You ready? " She asks.
" No way. You always start by touching me... "
" No. This is for my kid. "
" No. "
" Oh. You need some help? Just put this on me."

Very carefully, I pored over the piercings on my map and looked at the victim. He was clad in dark sweats, a worn white shirt and short pants. It's not a swimsuit. Not to mention that this is where the seam of the white shirt is. I made the note that I would use this information to explain the guy to everyone else.
"What the hell do you mean you're drowning? It's captain lained bottomed right into the water? Shit! " A deep voice yelled from behind me. I quickly grabbed the bars on the top of my jumpsuit and climbed in. I was very aroused. I then began making words. Lying down, I tried to sit up. It had been 5 or 6 hours, but it was only 1 minute. I began to move my legs, my waist, my waistband, my neck, and I noticed I was naked. I got out and I was naked. The cloth on my feet jutted out, and I saw his bare feet on the white, sandy shore. He was moving so fast. I started to panic but he was coming away as I was getting pissed.
His entire torso moved at a speed that would allow the cut to get away. He sluggishly jumped over my naked body and I managed to get up and keep my face level with him. He grunted and fell backward. I yelled at him to stop and did as he directed him to. He stopped and stared right into my eyes. He gasped, reached for his rifle, and then blacked out.
My heart was racing. My eyes glazed over but I couldn't focus on what was going on. I walked over to the exit and looked up at the cliff face. My legs were incredibly stymied. I knew what I had to do. The steps of the cliff was impossibly deep. I could barely make it up to the bottom. I guess someone was following me down the stairs of the cliff.
" All your bravado in vain has earned you your fate. Once you drown in the abyss, you know you will never live in it again. " The voice was deep and smooth and not nervous. There were no shivers and no pain. I stood there, naked, frozen. I could see the staircase descend onto the face of the ocean, landing on the ground from where it landed.
" Dad! Daddy?! Who are you? " I asked him quietly. His voice carried a faint whistle as he hurried to go up.
" I'm the captain of the HMS Victory, and I wanted you to know that the captain of the HMS Victory is dead. " A loud laugh from underneath me, followed by a faint touch of something warm against my skin.
" I know son, that's really a cry. But you may as well get your training straight now. "
" *He was barely moving* "
" Dad. You're supposed to be the captain of a vessel! Put up a fight and I'll show you how to swim! * Is that what I'm doing right now? "
" Not so fast son. You know this is it. The truth. Everyone dies twice in the course of one year. I'm the last. Everyone dies twice in the entire course of one year. This is not just about us. There will be no other escape. For if you don't choose to die, you will go out of your way to save us all. "
" Why aren't I going after my spouse?! "
I clenched my fists and picked up my rifle again, willing myself to die as quickly as possible. I'd hoped this time would be easier. I pulled the trigger.
" *Best swimsuit. *"

Chickens are tough, The crunch of meat around the chimney knife doing its job of breading out the crust. Such an awkward thought holds little potential for impact.
He had always been a butcher, but that ’ s what got him where he is today. He hated people much more than anybody else.
He had known for years that most people you'd take a rifle and pick up weapons and hold them up to your head in the streets as if they were mennequins and had been taken to the centre of a disgusting torture camp, but people were more than he thought.
He had been told that these people that couldn ’ t hold their own back were more than just mindless faeces. Those poor creatures would never be trusted with anything, they would just leave them left. The details were beyond him but he always took a good short break until he was fully satisfied, a chink in his skin that someone might sneeze at.
The eye of the lion ’ s prey is set on the man across from him. He hears footsteps and finds himself being followed by a pack of lions as his rifle crashes to the ground, throwing him into the throats of some more of those filthy creatures. He crashes as the prey darts from behind his cover.
Sectors of his body rub, he shakes off the pain, steadies himself against his neck and pulls the trigger. The men into the open pit seem to stir at the sight of his fallen comrade ’ s lifeless face.
“ fucking bitch, that thing was a bitch, what the fuck has he done!? ” The man screams.
“ Karl, we have the 12 others. They both burned the poor bastards' asses off, ” says Red.
“ Impossible. Kill them all and show them who knows where these fucking pansies are. ” Replies Red.
Red notices the bodies of both the lion ’ s men and another man ’ s body lying lifeless on his way to the heat.
Red reaches for his axe and turns it towards Karl, who seems to be breathing heavily as he pushes the steel for the short blade through his spine.
The man swallows, clearly dying due to being caught in an ambush.
Red has the knife.
Red hurries to Karl to help a bit of his comrade, and kills him by pressing the arrow through the shoulder, which then catches his arm where he is attempting to bite him. The wrist stabs, hoping to get enough blood to send him back to his salvation and paralyze Karl in the wrists as the meat flames around them like icepick poison.
Red stares blankly at Red with a blank face, and knows the golden future he has gained in battle, maybe those rotted bodies of the dead can at least end his suffering as it has for hundreds of years.
Livid at Red, Karl turns towards Red and snatches the knife from the man, snatching the scalpel as he lunges at his neck and stabbing the meat just across the lip. Red is stopped by a scream and walks over to the comrade-
“ Fuck, no, fuck, fuck, fuck, ” Red says breathlessly.

The door slammed open and I heard the shaking and shouting from the other side. I heard a shot from the hallway and a blast from a sprint from the closest ally. As quickly as the man had moved, he started to laugh hysterically. After witnessing all of this he turned and ran back towards the base. With the speed he had trained, I could see our respective enemies positioned to finish his punishment.
At first, it took all I had to survive the first half of this game to get my weapon ready for another one of his grotesque acts. Fortunately I didn't have to do much but make sure he hadn't heard the final whistle on the other side of the wall. I thought hard about why I was staying in this world and what happened in my spot under it. I looked for someplace better to escape, but the area was unevenly divided into small safe places. I contemplated leaving, but knew I could finally make it across this strange dark world. Then I wondered when and how long it would take for this opportunity to happen again.
Finally I found an exit, and my final thought was, "Perfect." And with that, I punched the enemy in the face and hoped he would turn and be killed just as I did. In my weakened state, the only way to survive was if I hit the enemy in the heart. So I waited for them to run away from me but my strength was too much. With my short life plan in tact, I ran into his wall and screamed as loud as I could. I hoped he was okay because he just looked as if he was going to die before I'd actually hit him.
Then I heard a scream from the hallway. My chance of success was almost up. I ran as fast as I could through the great hall and a horde of people hit me in the knee. My life plan began to fail and after a short while, I felt I had no hope of stopping him. In an effort to avoid taking out the horde I kept running until I hit another wall and ran down a short hallway to safety. There was no left to run from.
I lay there in utter agony, as the moment I was leaving the earth. Then I heard a voice come from the other side of the hallway.

The exit in two is the only exit in two and half hours. Without backup or Player notification, I know I'm really screwed. On the other side of the tunnel to the other side of the room, I see the exit, the death penalty scenario is finally finished. If not for that exit before the second "exit " in two, God-Hecken lives, I would be dead. And I could get to save everyone, if I let myself. I got to the end anyway.
In front of me are two gorgeous girls, nearing the end of their tether. They too have access to the exit. They're whispering, with no one else. There's only the one exit for me and the whole world. I couldn't save everybody, I only got to control the game. For God, what a power.
God helped me control the game myself. I wasn't the only one in this eternal utopia to not stop trying. I could fix things and access the whole universe, if it was in a time loop, if nothing else. God helped me with the obvious.
In, I started to see something. First I saw my timeline like it was no different than any other, before I started talking to the one-eyed girl. He shook his head in disbelief, then broke into the slightest grin he had ever seen before.
" What is it? "
God sat down beside me, tense and annoyed.
" It looks pretty bland, " he told me, already knowing what I was thinking.
" What's the last thing you wanted to say? "
I offered to break the dumbfounded silence, but he avoided it.
" Errr... " He was trailing off.
" You should stop putting off asking questions about it. "
I looked up.
" I'll just have to wait until another demon opens up and kills me. I don't want to end up in that grave"
God simply nodded.

Ever since I was a child, there were times when I hated the lamp at the corner of the room. I hated the noise, the sound. It was the kind of sound that cuts against your ear when trying to listen to a terrible show. I had almost always thought it was the words that changed me, but they never really got used to it. Now, at the age of four, the pink matter surrounding my ears from sleeping cry out for help. " Man, I don't even get it ", I yelled. Even now, a few minutes later, the lamp is still staring down at me.
Muffled wails rattle and memories of it's tricks. " It's not fair to you, brother! ", I shout again.
"... Does it seem right that I need to take you away from me? ", the genie asks.
" It's alright brother, " I reply, holding out my hand. " You have to forgive me. "
" I forgive you just fine, " the genie repeats. " The only difference between you and me is that I have been forced to have you. "
" And what does this mean? "
" To forget and try and come back again. I want to stay. "
I felt the desperation in the genie's eyes. " You have to live. We have done so much for you, " he grins.
" I never forget anything, friend. " I gesture for him to go. " I just want you to forgive me. "
" I want to learn more about you. Do you want to be a part of something else? ", the genie asks after a long moment, shocked.
" Yes... " I drop the tiny lamp, trying to hold onto the life-threatening power inside me. " That's why I'm so sad, brother."
The genie smiles his large open palm and withdraws his hand. I watch him hand me the rug and bury my face in it for warmth. But, even so, I wish that somehow, I could feel that the lamp won't fade. So I could feel that every single inch of the world would live on; even if it was hard to survive in the glare of the lamp.

"We can't let him pass, we have to start over " i said.
They all stared at me like i was some sort of racist of what immoral Jews actually lived life by.
" Not like this! " Said the man in a desperate tone. " the bar has been looted and we shouldnt be here! The building has become a storm and there are no Jew's! "
I'm a total sociopath and i can tell you that. It's just a movie that is supposed to seperate the characters but the guy who I met to corrupt me here already showed me a horrifying scene with his best friend and child. Where a kid and his father and kid dance for power then shoot one another. The name is kept hidden because all time is fine for now.
The man calmly picks up the kid and carefully ties him up in my elevator. " No fighting anymore, i have to return it to the local authorities " he whispered while looking back.
I like to judge how someone would feel if their life became so savage, letting the boy go down without a fight or incident or criminal charges and enjoy a look around my world as the scene unfolds.
" Before we get to the point, it appears that you've lost your mind, we can only presume that you are no longer alive " The man said calmly. " Take another step for me and let me convince you that you shouldn't call the police "
As the elevator slowed to a halt i realized how scared i was of my life because i had never been hurt or wanted.
" Now calm down kid I just want you to relax, the police force will do their job alright "
The man slowly gets up and proceeds to barge into the elevator.
" There is no one here " He said quietly.
" Now don't go shaking off the impression you have of me son, i knew it but we are going to need to talk like that before the lot of us show up. Also don't leave the kid here no matter what anyone says he's innocent you do. "
After slowly putting my hand on his shoulder, the man slowly opens his door to a far away room. From the living room one can see gazelle sitting in a corner writing on a white board just like the one i photographed in that movie.
" so. how come you're a racist son? " Said the one sitting next to the gazelle with a raised hand like a cop who's just going to do his job.
" Oh i know, you arent a racist son. " Said the man turning his nose to the door.
" then go calm down kid why are you an Arab? " Said the boy.
" Now you are, i dont care what happens in my world, you are only sad because our place was wrong, the day he was born who him killed me is the day i die " Replied the boy.
The man stood up. " I was a poor savage by then, I didn't care how bad my fate looked, I just killed him myself. " He managed to give a coy smile.
" All i wanted to do was kill him " Said the other boy beside him with a big smile.
The man reached in to touch my hand and it turned into a sharp edged arrow, almost cutting my throat. His hand falling forward onto the floor made it impossible to move.
" you are a racist by now you are not even a racist child " Said the boy as he grabbed my hand.
He took my hand in his and as he took a deep breath, tears were formed on his face as he put a finger to his lips.
" too you have done all that crime, I did not believe me when i said I was a racist, I did not even know what was the point, and my actions triggered a lust for murder "
He opened his mouth to speak but he couldnt do it and the silence made him cough.
" You just have to ignore me. i heard you were quite the racist some people might say son. you can just break away from this and forgive me for your twisted beliefs but i don't forgive you son, i love you too much and have nothing to do with your actions" He said in his true voice

I don't think I could have expected it to go so fast, I barely noticed before it stopped, it stopped and the crack echoed, louder and louder as I followed the lights. I began to panic, running for what seemed like hours trying to get as far as I could before I ran into a nearby wall, turning around to check if I was still around, only to find myself out at the end of a hallway and floating in front of the blood red door. With trembling hands I threw open the door and slammed the brass knob with all my might, knocking something against it and looking around puzzled I found an old rocking chair in a corner with a few flowers on it, the couch sat in front of me and had some food on it, a knife, I placed the blankets in the crib and jumped up into the air, softly crying out with my arms folded to protect myself from the pain and the noise as the room became silent and peaceful as I cried out.

... the entire shuttle can't fit in here. Its like a giant room.
... I see shit every single day.
... The chemical matter is incredible. It's indescribable. Like the outer space nothing. It was always a dream, one day I'll go look at the moon. Just the way that it exploded. I'd wake up and they'd take me to the console, so like, bring me back, find something, like, go and have a hankering for it. There's another one, and I'll fix it. Other stuff is amazing.
... I saw someone wake me up this morning. Maybe it was a cop on scene? Maybe it was one of his closest friends who'd been down there...
... I asked what was going on, and he said the moon, like we all do, was a love trap. This is the number one reason why they're all afraid of the thron sound.
... Anyway, I get back to work. What am I gon na do? Nothing, and you know what the janitor says is, "fuck this moon. Go fuck the janitor, there's a universe where we can jump, but it's getting lonely."
It's a cold field right now. I can't see anybody. The forest is so full of the clouds, they're either huge, or they're not. Like a black hole, and he has to close that window and let me move inside.
I just need a break from this pain, but I got a scrap of ash from a gun, and something about the stars is wrong. It's so bright, I can see that the universe is just like a bubble and I just have to look up at it and just shit my pants.
BEEP BEEP BEEP
And then they give the janitor an axe. It's pure fire. He laughs, it was *sigh* evil.

Marik Kent blinked and looked at the screen, his fingers twitching rhythmically in his face. The desk stood on it ’ s own two, and not even an arm ’ s length away from him. He bent down and brushed it off the wall in front of him. The machine roared.
“ Mission complete, ” it was said, gasping for air. The wall had been preserved for over sixty years in case of any unforeseen event. Marik, perplexed, looked up to see a blinding light from the white disk in front of him. Marik began to read the messages in his mind.
“ You ’ ve been detected, ” a voice boomed into his head as he stepped forward. It was the contact from the computer.
“ Please, we need to get to the surface. ”
Marik nodded slowly to where the white screen was. An hour had passed since he had come down on top of it and not a single human had walked past it. He slipped out of the chair and onto the tile floor.
A turd pile hit the surface with a thud. It hit the tile very hard and Marik ’ s eyes dropped. He ducked into the undergrowth and jumped out of the way.
The alien had made it over to him.

The sun was rising, falling at terrible speeds, twice as fast than light itself could reach.
Across the universe was a planet, which looked a lot like our own, but with a glass globe instead of sky. And with a little machine hooked to the bowels of the planet, in the sky was a planet which looked like any other planet there on the universe.
Another planet, this one belonged to Earth, which looked much closer to what was on the other side of the moon. We tried very hard to explore this thing out, in hopes that it would discover us. Turns out, our world was boring, all around our planet were dangerous and dangerous sights.
Now, all we've seen is another planet, one where the sun is going to collide with the ocean ( something that is impossible, considering the scientists on the opposite side of the moon are stone age ).
Why does it look so different than other planets? I wouldn't want to believe it unless I lived in one of those worlds. I heard the rest of my civilization listening to the chatter of the others over here.
Anyways, after 8 days of exploring, we were able to hear the splash of metal, before it rounded our planet. I remember this thing was turning, the green something on the other side of the moon, to the blue.
I can't believe I ever looked in the sky, for I was not the one who saw the coming black.
And that was the last night we, the survivors, stayed up that night.
The day after the crash, we made it to the surface, people as old as us jumped inside, which was like jumping into a factory. That was the day we discovered what they called space.
The scientists and Engineers died there. I can't believe I ever stayed there for the rest of my life.
After the crash, the people on Earth died completely.
Did the other people on the other side of the moon just disappear into space?
I don't know. Even if I did, what could they expect? A machine full of Newton, Einstein, Hawking, and Schrödinger can't break through the real world for another week and enough time to settle down and think about whatever people have come up with.
I don't even know what it is that they do.

"Hap-tu-u-an, what time is it? "
" Don't worry, I've got about an hour left! " the gunman barked as he ran towards my room. I watched my dank sleeping body guard protect me from the darkness while his bodyguard carefully made the many missing branches.
How ironic...
After all, in this establishment, killing the wife with a gunshot would always be your punishment. All those years of practice in combat and engagement training meant nothing to these wyvern's.
With a smirk on his face, he greeted me with a sharp intake of breath.
" Hap-tu-u-an what time is it? "
I lay on my bed without thinking, the cold and dark air overpowering the light. On the outside, I could see the families gathered around the fire, drunk and relieved, wondering who would have the best time of it all. What my life would be like, I would think.
But as I lay there, the room seemed to settle into an eerie silence, it felt like eternity.
" I'm too late, partner. " The gunman sighed and turned to face me.
" You, demon, you're hopeless, I can't deal with you any longer," I added matter-of-factly.

*Light overwhelms our ranks and we hear men chanting a song of those we could save. Glory shines brightly on our faces and we march up to fill the void. *
We send our warriors to once again fill the void. As our warriors past death we move into the new world that we made and take back what we have lost. We lose our homes, our village, even our family.
Our enemies once again scream from the empty meadows we still share and the cries of our world begin to swell in volume. What is to be done? We made a mistake.
We split the atom into three dimensions and we know that war never changes. This task was certain when Earth was wiped clean by an asteroid. The bombs fell on our little colony and our knowledge shattered us.
We can only pray that we survive. If we don't we will simply fall. If we don't we will be destroyed and we will no longer be able to see the sky.
God help us all.

After stealing $ 23 from the gas station clerk, the city decides to respond with a plan to take our primitive materials and use them to build a weapons race against humanity.
They have become quite intelligent, and at first apparent. At first the police tried to stop the thief, and soon learned that, no matter what, if they try, they won't get arrested or worse; they'd simply help pay for the damages done. This led to more and more incidents of rage, and eventually police gave up about asking their officers if they were worth anything anymore. It was in this context that one seemingly innocent bystander decided to participate in the riot that lasted around 5 hours.
-- -
They called the detective because he came to the scene, unable to see what happened. Rather they tried with caution to return to the other clerk. Eventually they found him and retrieved a silenced handgun. At that moment the poor man stopped sweating, they could feel the sweat from his body. " What in Hell had I done! " he shouted, awestruck. When the officers, who were casually dressed in black suits helped him to his feet the poor man wept, he began to charge at the police officers. At some point the officers found him, and on the ground lying face down. They put him on a stretcher. When they arrived at the hospital the other victims found the criminals inside. The officers told him they didn't want to do this, they understood the trauma and he was simply wanted for questioning. As the two officers laid dying the next day a detective stood guard outside the gas station, looking into the open windows. By dawn, the whole department was sobbing, a plain white sheet surrounding him told him to keep everything he owned, and the officers ran out into the rain to get him back to their Ford pickup truck. He arrived on the road, and several ambulances were waiting by the door. When the police got there it was just me and the cop, who had also emerged to the scene. My partner and I looked over at the jail outside. " Hey what the hell have you done?" the cop said.
I immediately thought of telling the world. Because I hate the cops, I should probably end this before my partner can.

A man walks into an unspoken meeting of one of the most powerful. It's not easy, and time is lonesome. He is half-man, half-human, but he just can not grasp space without a helmet on. He turns to the other half, and the most frightening thing is what he sees.
The body of his marine, only Henry, was in his right hand. In an instant, he is entranced by the blade that had carved the floor of Belloq's skull. His legs are torn asunder, his torso pinned below Belloq's great chair. Hell, Belloq was all alone but the smothering of his gun kept him alive all along.
"You're truly a monster. " belloq choked out.
" No, I am not an actual monster! " belloq retorted.
" What do you mean you are? Do you understand that you have done nothing but... " the tall man who was once Belloq's friend began.
" Well, technically, I am all that's left of Belloq. Heck, I've been fighting him for years. And when I first arrived at Belloq's station, there were several others like me there. But no one had even seen one human at this time. I haven't heard a word spoken since. However, as you will see, there's a chance that a collaboration between earth and Belloq, perhaps, could alleviate some of the suffering that has been plaguing Belloq's people for centuries. But that is not the case, your experiment has no success. There have never been any animals living at Belloq's station, which means it's impossible. Any trace of Belloq would require me and my friends to venture outside, on foot, to investigate the area. " belloq shuttered.
The man in front of him began breathing less and less, and his sentence almost seemed to sit in silence. " We could do it, " belloq stated.
" Do you still trust me? Do you understand what I mean? " belloq asked.
" It has been a long time since I had spoken to Belloq. It seems that neither of us have a home, yet we are united by it. " belloq confessed.
" You see, I was enlisted to learn German, and yet I have been given no contact with Belloq, why would they ask me to study German? We will get along just fine. We could teach Belloq how to communicate, this could show humanity, and the one and only God of those who have finally made it. " belloq sighed.
" There is nothing we can do, doesn't there? You've betrayed all hope, and you need to leave. " belloq spat back.
" Why must I leave? That dog at Belloq's station is still rabid, hasn't it? I've tried calling him Belloq, but they've never come to my door. The one with the hot dog in the fridge is still asleep. Any planet that I can find is empty, it would seem. How else would Belloq's people survive without him? " belloq admitted.
" I don't know, " belloq confessed. " All I know is that Belloq will come any day now, and we must move out. Otherwise we will have to end this in silence for what seems like a very long time."

Before she left the station the Tasha stood in a desolate field that huddled in near ruin. The city grew in front of her, and she began to fear it.
*Would it damage itself in response to a tide of incoming projectiles *?
* Would it destroy the coastline of its hometown in a single week? *
Tasha pushed past *the* city's roofs with a gnarled hand and watched. There wasn't much to see of the city besides a shaded tunnel and the houses of buildings that lined the city. The city envied her for those that moved out of the cities and never returned. Not unless it was because she had to travel home.
The Tasha walked through the tunnel and at the end of the tunnel was a building that was a smoldering ruin. Tasha felt the wind pushing past her neck, and a sudden gust of wind shook the earth beneath her feet. She ran for a few blocks before stopping in the bleached orange-grey parking lot of another abandoned building to see a faded blue-green sign that read; “ Coal Plant 46 ”.
The building was abandoned.
Tasha thought to herself that it was something; something new. She arrived just before the building's expiration date, and the door opened and several people barged in and sat down on the floor, staring at her with glee. Inside of the building, a curtained door was cracked and burned and flung open. Tasha pushed past *the* person behind the door, the red-faced scum that adored her, followed by an elderly woman sitting across from the man.
Tasha recognized her.
*No one wants to see the coal plant anymore. *
*You can still die here. *
*I've been here longer than I can remember. *
Tasha remembered hearing that old woman confess her feelings to one of her students at the Coal Plant. Tasha had a hard time paying attention to what she'd heard. Maybe Tasha needed to see the rest.
*Oh, right. That's how it gets when you eat all these people. *
She mouthed *it* and tucked the old woman's familiar scent into the back of her closet and walked out. Tasha waited for the women to come back to his room, but her faint heart stopped as she came back to the distant future.

Oh boy these people are tricky.
Even why do you throw yourself out to sea when they can't catch you?
You never know what may come of your inevitable mistakes, trying to avoid putting yourself in trouble.
Not with the Bat.
He did it all wrong.
But we were lucky.
When he tried to stop it he had the power to not let his mom catch him. He had the technology to get away with it before either of us could. I told him he had to keep going by the rules that we were bound to each other so that we would never run away. But just as I told him he had to accept I was giving away the choice to save him. Of course that's not going to happen.
Or so I thought as he landed next to me, his grin wide and full of pride. And this was his way of redeeming himself.
One step at a time.
He throws himself up, quickly shoving me away, down the red storm drain.
This isn't how they want me to be.
I throw myself up.
And he lets the sewage run dry.
I wait for him to let me in again.
I wait for him to let me out again.
Not long after he gets here, I get a call from my dealer. I tell my good friend about this Super Hero and he comes to my side. He tells me that he was fine and that I had made a great deal. Why would a hero end up playing "the role of the'bad guy' in his act? " I sigh. Yes, it doesn't matter to me. You can know when you have done bad things. You can know when you made a mistake.
And I sigh.
" Bullshit. "
He has to be calm. You know he doesn't.
" Bullshit "
I threaten to pull the mask off, but he just shakes his head and leaves me a small water bottle hanging off the wall.
" You crazy, " I think. " One step at a time."
He had put him in danger. I want him to put himself out there. Just once. And he isn't going to let me.
Just once, I thought to myself, before the voice cuts out in my head.
And then it started.

Just before interplanetary space station and passengers would be arriving, in a dreary atmosphere, they wouldn't be pleased to find the communication they had been waiting for. The button to the intership pinged:
*Approximate time: 35 minutes*
*Now, for the time being, don't forget what you once stood for in the Outer Layer of the Antarctic Snowball. We serve *now*, and from the Outer Layer is the ultimate ice giant. For more information about this place, visit Wikipedia by place address ( Google Maps Map ). Please send the following to The Antarctic Oversight Council, described on page 1349 of the Preliminary Conference. *
As for the times when we could see the Antarctic Ice will have never been over 3,500 kilometers off course, so we won't feel regret. And our prey will never attack us from the inside, for many years.
Why am I telling you this? Because that is how we choose to live.
Not on Earth, by proxy or not.
The people didn't want to destroy the Ice as much as we wanted to destroy Earth. We wanted to profit from its already molten polar ice. And it will be fine, for humanity's survival, to survive. The surface of earth was slowly under constant pressure, so we were doing things that made the appearance of a normal person uncomfortable for the rest of our lives. We wanted to keep the Pacific Ocean at bay. " Make it more accessible" was a popular slogan, but not the most effective way to get rid of the ground. The decision was made by The Panel of The American Aide, through the first of the vessel being bombarded by an EMP directly in the lower parts of Earth, along with our ICBM along with the remaining habitat of the outer layer. Nuclear fallout from the EMP was forced on the outer layer, forcing us to stay and watch our opponents from the outside. And our Observation and Control guided that for a total of 6 months, keeping our enemy undetected from consuming the other layer. The insides of the entire Antarctic may be covered in ice from the tectonic plates to the surface, but by that time we don't even have to keep ourselves contained from breaching the sub-basins.
Earth never was the easiest victim, it was our primary measure to keep the Earth safe and keep all of the people alive, for the stories of of the Antarctic Scout and Snowflake floated through the air as if we knew the danger of staying out of the Antarctic. To do this, we all have to watch. The same way we watched two oceans split in a wave right at the shore. To do it, we are willing to sacrifice all of humanity's resources for what they don't know of.

Though he was scared, God laughed. " Really? This one time he's getting married! " His heart raced. At first, he had thought this was another Black Prince coming for him. Was he crazy? The darkness even watered his eyes. Then he heard the battlecry.
" " Come all ye man, gather ye bread. "
" Aye, I shall bless ye! "
It was a sound like thunder. More thunder. This wasn't the time. He put the knife in the cross and got up, catching the bleeding mass in both hands. " Come let me mend your soul, rest your head! "
" Now thy lust, my archangel, shall follow me. " He lifted a knife to his mouth. " Oh, oh well! Come back to me to pay it back and to remedy your troubles."
They both stood staring at each other.

Severus is busy knocking on the door to find his lamp.
He wakes to a blinding blue light and see that he is standing in a library.
His eyes widen and he can't see anymore. His mind is flooded with panic.
He opens his own library and continues with his thoughts.
He can't get anything out of the way of the stairs, the button he pushed a couple of minutes ago breaks and jumps.
The door bursts open and there, right in front of him, is a man he thinks is from "one of their domains " dressed in brown and carrying a business card.
He looks at " them " quizzically.
" Who are you and what does this mean for you? "
" Why would you wish that for an adult? "
" They know you said that for your entertainment! They would have loved you if you said they knew! "
Severus stays silent, this man stands before him in both of his white robe and his lavender hair.
The man's green eyes shine while his his pointy ears perk up as the genie's booming voice crackles the doors of the library.
" You? "
" I made a wish yesterday. Which one? "
" You so wished I would take you back in time? "
" Who exactly was this person who gave me a wish but nobody else? "
" No one really knows, but we are getting worse. You just want to go back. "
" So? But why? "
" Well, if you would make a wish like I did, you might as well change your biggest mistake. "
The guy walks away with a huge laugh.
The genie gives the man a nice smile. He then says " I hope you come back soon."
And now he's in a time where everyone is running around with his bellied hat, holding his silenced weapon like one of those stuffed animals that hangs over the street.
He looks at his watch.

A thunderclap was heard outside, as people rushed to remove their layers and cover themselves. I was not very comfortable with any of them however, my glasses were wearing the same blanket so it was overcast. I remember now why it was raining outside, I remember my first day of high school, in the same-size learning locker just before finals. It was the first time I took out the solar charger, during my Chemistry class, they were out fighting with each other, in the back. That was when I wasn't typing, I was taking photos, it wasn't like I was going to be taken of in 3 minutes.
Mom and dad came to my side, and I sat beside the cup in my hands, they didn't say a thing but they both did. I thought I was done with the conversation, I glanced back to my computer, and immediately hit delete. All the colors on my monitor drained out, and on my screen, three words appeared, three words. Three hours of staring at my desktop, staring at my website, looking at my computer screens, every little typo I made, every error, every single word. In one night, I stopped staring at computers, I finally broke away.
“ It begins raining outside. ”

"Find him, " ordered Theodore, gently guiding his lanterns down the carpet-covered hallway. His lips pursed, a twitch of the lips confirming his intent. He grabbed a mangled handkerchief from the drawer and poked it lightly through his trousers, licking the brandish liquid in the drying liquid with a flick of his hand. Fucking hopeless.
As he slipped the wad of filthy needles into his trousers, a slight knock echoed throughout the hall. A branch of his tentacle swiveled in his left direction, turning its shoulder to just one side of the hallway that ended on an either side. " Do you hear that? "
Teddy sighed, replacing the bloody handkerchief. " Don't you heard it?! Oh, sorry. I got ta go first thing in the morning, Oh God no, you're gon na die from cancer. You think I don't know? "
" Well, you know, when you're your age, of course you don't usually get medical care. That's how I know you're immortal. I don't think a lot about it. There's not that much variance, right? "
Teddy rubbed his ear, sipping the blood on the wad of broken needles. " I suppose. But- "
" Well, Mr. President, what's the problem? "
Teddy sighed again. " Where is the entire world? And after two hundred years, you gave up the mission of leading our army to victory? "
" Mr. President, look at where we are right now. "
He grabbed his gloves and tripped over a small pile of pieces of garbage, scrambling over them as another knock echoes throughout the hall. Someone shrieked once Theodore collected his fellow soldiers, who simply lay their tentacle back on its surface.
One of the longest, the most well dressed, retched. " Whoo-why-ohhhh! "
" Get him! " Teddy's lips curled into a smile.
" Mr. President, you are everything a man should be. Mr. President, get him. "
Teddy ran down the hallway and towards his tentacle, focusing his fire with one hand in agitation. Suddenly, there were screams and rattling of metal. A loud thud echoed through the hallway. This could mean something. One of the President's troops lay mortally wounded, crumpled on his tentacle, his head still bloodshot from a struggle he just gave himself.
Someone huddled by the front door, catching a glimpse of Teddy's empty tentacle. " You filthy coward, you have no idea what you're doing. "
" I know, Teddy, but- "
" You know, Teddy, when you're your age, of course it seems like the greater good sometimes wins. It's like it takes a perverse pleasure in knowing that you are the only one capable of winning. It's like you can practically feel the dopamine coursing through your veins like acid. It takes a perverse pleasure in knowing that you can make yourself better. It's like you can artificially eliminate your " weakness " or " sexual/homophobia " or whatever the fuck it is you call it. " He drained the blood from his tentacle and sighed again, leaving it on the ground in his tentacle. He pried his tentacle closed from the rest of the corpses on the floor. He sank his hands down his arms to his chest, catching his breath.
" Well, there's nobody else left, " Teddy said with a mirthless smile. " But I guess it's gon na take all of them down to defeat this petty asshole. See, Teddy, I'm gon na be unearthing his secrets. "
" Oh, God no, Daddy, you just cry so much. You know I love you, son. Go to bed."

"OK..... OK. Ok. I do whatever I want, no need to worry about money or power or anything. You are a servant, there is nothing else for me! " Alex Descartes exclaimed. “ You are so plain and uncaring! ” He exclaimed as he tossed his mail into the teacup. The creases on his hands caused him to puke. He inhaled deeply as he continued his sentence. “ You would be the lesser ruler who delved through the old kings and told them everything they needed to know, like this piece of bread was all you needed! Not gold, not silver! This tiny little piece of bread you create is nothing but a safeguard against that nightmare our great president has to face!!! ” Descartes laughed, and ran in to the living room.
In the living room, one of the other servants who looked to be arguing with Alex wasn't there. Descartes walked over to him. “ Did you feel any odd stirring in your hand? It ’ s been a day! Good morning! You are due for your breakfast soon, and you are the actual mother that you left those poor porcelain haired men with! ” Descartes waved goodbye to the other servant. “ Please can you put the hat on now? ” He asked. His servant obediently did so. Descartes started unpacking the boxes, and no one was in sight.
Descartes returned to the living room and sat on his couch.
“ Is it all done? ” Alex Descartes asked the other servant.
“ Yes. ” The other servant responded with a rather stern look. “ You have no power whatsoever, and you are the lesser king! ” The other servant looked appalled. “ I will simply take some small silver chips and chip them up! I may be the father of our family, but he is the father that will save us all from this. ” The other servant shook his head. “ Don ’ t play dumb, your power is so poor, but it is just gold and this tiny piece of bread! ”
“ I can not believe you! You go and put my precious metal at risk! You don't need my support, or even my hope! ” The other servant looked at the other servants with concern.
“ I... I am sorry. ” Descartes asked as he ran away. “ Then please do have some lunch! ”

"I don't even care if I can jump, I wish for strength! If you stop doing this to me you'll probably die! My god it's over. "
I met John at one of those tall buildings. I was holding his hand. I'd never felt as if my nerves and body was above his. I had been him before. A good friend since high school. The best of friends.
We were standing in a crowded alley and looking around a little bit, at him.
" John, if you'd just tell me exactly what you want, I wouldn't be so mad, would I? "
He just stood there, utterly confused.
" Hold on. " I said.
He moved closer and closed his eyes.
I felt a hand lightly on my shoulder.
" You're telling me you want to give me a hundred extra pounds? "
At the sudden panic that took over, I ran over and swung it.
He hit the ground hard and gently pulled on the undershirt I was holding.
He was all of three times he collided with the ground.
He dropped the shirt as fast as he could, right into my head.
" So let me check this. You don't want one? "
He stopped and stared at me as I saw his hand wrap around my head.
I cried.
" I wish for a steel-toed, fifty-pound beast just like you! "
He bit down on my cheek.
" Please John, " he screamed, " Don't stop! "
He was silent for a moment.
" I wish you two just wouldn't stop talking. "
He took his hand off me and then said, " Wh-what's going on? "
He didn't answer.
" I-I wish I were a superhero. "
He just kept staring at me.
" I wish- "
He squeezed my hand and slowly pulled it back.
" What the hell is going on? "
It was too late.
My head snapped to them.
" John " my finger cut through his hair.
" I don't care if I could jump, I wish for strength! "
He grabbed my hand and pressed it into his eye.
The color drained from his face.
He closed his eyes again.
" I don't even care if I can jump, I wish for strength!"
He squeezed my hand and slowly pulled it back.
My finger escaped his eye.
My heart dropped.

I hadn't been able to avoid the tower since I was a teenager. I just was never a superhero. I was a simple man, a superhero with no powers. I had no control of myself, I was young and inexperienced. I wasn't the smartest man in the world but I had that power.
When a nobody dared try to buy the gun I would go up the stairs to get shot at by the spectators. It was only a matter of time before the excitement would set in and I would be annihilated. The one above me, they called him the Usable.
The Usable was a girl, she had been bullied by the royal guard at most a few times, but when the royal guards gathered her up she got her own room. That was where the Usable hid, and while she hid in a dumpster something bad happened to her.
The Usable was the girl. She never would get caught.
She became the Queen of England, that was not a good thing. Someone to fight for. She did not care about what we fought for, we fought for our freedom.
You see in our world when a hero catches up to you you become like a fish in a bowl. You instantly believe everything you say and think is right, no one believes your lies. All you have is a tenuous belief in your own true belief, that your heroes that are protecting you should come around the world to help.
The Usable and the Royal guard had no clue what she was up to.
Just the thought of me sinking an innocent and naive to this world to save the people caused the Usable great concern and annoyance.
And that is why I was stupid.
I was powerless to save the people I loved, and then I saved the Captain, the Piracy on the streets, the flu, the villain himself that killed everyone.
Just because the Penguin came to rescue me doesn't mean I didn't care about saving the life of his girlfriend.

I gasped as the shrill cry pierced through the blackness.
I was so scared.
I think I panicked.
I needed to remember.
But I was frozen.
I couldn't move.
I was weak.
It broke my heart.
But the only thing I could do is wait for the safety to return.
Finally, I was able to remember.
I took an image of the creature's face. It was as white as the ethereal sky, and I had discovered, in deep meditation, that it was my savior.
I grieved.
I lived through the nightmare.
I went back.
I remember all the different stages and stages of our reincarnation.
As my heart relaxed.
But the creatures were gone.
We were no more.
I can ’ t think now.
I just wish I could remember the sword I used to slay them.
How did I win?
And I still wonder.
Why?
Should I continue living until the next stage?

She hunched her back with respect.
Trevor laughed, trying to look friendly.
"Get your kids in the car, Dale, I'm telling you. The little ones. "
Rita stood at the door, dumbstruck. Her reflection was both large and cold. Everything around her shone at the exact same distance.
" Did I say that off again? " One of the light fixtures flickered out.
Dale shuddered, growing fonder. He seemed to sense something. He felt only comfort in her silence. He blushed and stood up. He took a deep breath. " L and D say - "
The lights went out, and then reappeared at the door. Trevor leaned down to look inside the front passenger side door. A slick, ripped, wood table had appeared on the passenger seat.
" Just a reminder that the house is clean. We'll be seeing you by sunset. She knows you're... and she thinks you're that cute. " Trevor flinched away. He'd never seen women enjoy being trapped in a chair for more than three minutes before, but they certainly must be damn good looking.
Rita could not help but feel a tentative love for him. And those expressions about her were unmistakable.
" These girls suck, man! I can't take it any more. " Trevor gulped, his jaw firmly fixed.
" They know every dog knows every soccer ball knows every knife knows every knife. They're just like us. See, some of them know very little. They're miserable, and they're the least trusting thing I could imagine. " Trevor paused for a moment, flabbergasted. " What are you even saying? This just sounds like a coincidence. "
Rita bit her lip, and stepped away from him. " Come on. That's what I'm saying. "
He felt her body fall, onto his lap. A strong, white hand grasped at her waist, and he wrapped his fingers around it. The knife lurched forward, then stopped, staring into her eyes. Two large metal lights, and a single slit. A sharp, snake-like, slit directly down.
" You have one hour! " She said, dancing through the lifeless crowd.
Trembling, he cradled her.
" Hurry, L, L. " He whispered. She backed away into the car, grabbed Trevor's arm, and held it up.
" Release me, Dale. "
Rita jumped. " Please! Do it! "
" I want to kiss you! "
He clenched. " Say goodnight, L."
Then, he ripped her hand from his as she tripped.

The rider stumbled forward, struggling against the boulders on either side of him. Strands of debris formed from the silent ground, and the wind carried the wave like mud over his weary face. The rider made a hand towards the front of the group, though he needed no second opinion on what to do.
He didn't hear the sound of metal on stone, but instead the twisting voice of rustling leaves. The rider nodded under his breath, inspecting his surroundings. The air was heavy, and the wind carried heavy with the waves that echoed from the mountain ranges up and down in a small domain. The rider bent down to check, leaning heavily upon the smaller door, hoping the wind did nothing to hinder his progress. The door stepped closed, and the rider stepped through the door.
It was hard. So many voices clashing about, like these packs of idiots couldn't possibly hear something over me. When they found out my name, was so close they all yelled in unison. I glanced at their faces to make sure they were aware of what I was doing. The cold air swept across the group, like a cloud blocking light from my face.
I turned back to look at the rider. He was still struggling against the boulders, but there was nothing else to do. He took a moment, but before I could utter another word, he was gone.
I opened my mouth to speak, but the sound of *ding! * splashed into my ears.

The silence cut briefly.
" *I'm not in control of you. * "
" Fine. Why'd you do that? Do you think they think that you're different? Why did you do that? "
" I know that they're smart, but that doesn't mean I'm being important! How am I needed to know when to be dead? They're so boring they can sleep through a zombie apocalypse! "
Mike leaned closer, " It's damn serious isn't it? What's so bad about them? They're so good looking. It's some kind of... It looks like that we protect them. "
Mike clenched his fists in anger. " W-w-what happened? "
" It's fine. I'll get this over with before we do it again, Mike. I'll get this over with. I just need to get out of here. "
" Don't you fucking fucking sleep? The aliens don't sleep. They've told us to fuck it up. They'll kick us in the balls if we don't do it fast enough. "
Mike wriggled his fingers to his lips, hearing a slight tremor in his bones. A small pinhole appeared in front of his eyes. One of the aliens moved to impale him.
A peeling strand of hair appeared from the alien's face, a vague smile on its face. " Listen, relax. Calm down, Mike. We know it's important you don't cry. We know you want to quit fighting and we want to move on. We know you want to go out. "
Mike yanked on his duvet and looked at his watch.

Not again.
Mike looked down at the cold tile, watching the aliens slowly roll around in the trench with more aliens trying to get up to dodge the bullets.

The sounds of screams are almost deafening and the streets are almost empty. The shadows on the walls and roof and floor are just slivers of a building. Houses are everywhere and the walls are seeming to reach for no man. There are some twisted and twisted things outside of the building. Knives are sticking out of them. Snakes rip apart the walls.

I always assumed it was one of those advanced scientific theories explaining how gravity would work, but in reality it just goes on and on. It's a single go on, a looped one that works endlessly.
It all started in last year ’ s school year, when someone was caught stealing the luck of everyone on Earth, the rest of them anyway. One of the losers was lucky enough to get a bunch of puff of cool balloons with tiny holes dug in them, they died in less than a day.
No luck ever brought me joy, though.
Everyone else had depression, anxiety, apathy, sleeplessness, apathy, apathy, apathy, apathy, apathy, and now someone set a gun to their head and was hitting it hard.
Wait. What about booze. Not booze. But it wasn ’ t alcohol, now that I think about it.
The criminals I arrested later would do the same with their victims, as I saw for them in the news. Most are successful in life, but some will never be. The worst part is that no one can be allowed to hurt someone else. That I did the only thing I could for them. I pretended to drink to make sure they didn ’ t get hurt, but what they had just done to themselves was the worst part.
In one evening, after taking a grand vacation to Scotland, I ’ ve been doing quite well since, getting a solid chunk of the world ’ s luck which can last the rest of my life. In another, I can ’ t sleep on the couch. I don ’ t know if that ’ s really for this world or another, but I still try.
Over that four years, I have been feeling more and more depressed, and getting a little bit older. Honestly I can ’ t see anything, but sometimes I see it on a passing object on my wall. It keeps increasing in value, one day it can kill someone. I know that this is odd, but hey, it ’ s only a matter of time. It takes some effort to become one.
I still don ’ t know when I started, but the lottery calls nearly every year and isn ’ t full yet. Maybe someone will notice and pick me.
I went to a buddy one time and apparently, people around him were starting to be over impressed with my luck. Suddenly a woman comes over and tells him that I ’ ve just won, even though she hasn ’ t caught the luck.
He answers “ Yeah, I ’ m out ” and sits down. I point towards the ground and find a bag of cookies scattered around the room with a note attached to the top. After collecting them, I place them on the ground.
Ah, the irony. While there was a thin layer of the luck within my coat and shoes, now my coat has been ripped off, where all the money has gone. Now I can ’ t even remember where or how I got in trouble.
I get home to my drawing, ready to paint something. Just for one more hard day, I'll be able to sell myself off to other people.
But I never realized the hard part. Why? That all luck can be bought at auction. Then I would always have to be the luckiest person on Earth.

"Can you bring down and stop me, Frodo? " she asked without waiting for the question to finish the riddle. Frodo stood and stared out the window, bathing in the not-so-earthly blue of the night sky, staring at his nemesis. " No. It can not be done. " He replied. " How? " she questioned. " No. It is impossible. " He stated stubbornly. " Have you tried? No, I could not resist you. You know that without me, there is no magic. " He replied. The playful debate reached absurd levels. " Then how are we not going to destroy ourselves, eh Frodo? " " We... We will be forever gone. " Frodo pointed to his horses. " You don't believe in Hell, do you? What would your wish be? " She asked. " We would have life, and we would be content, not evil. But we shall never be to you. You either live forever or you die, there is no such thing as life. " Frodo suggested. " Just as if... " she said with a sinking voice, " then we would die. " " Please tell me. " he asked. She smiled. " Yes. " she said quietly. " For you see, it is. " Frodo replied as he stared at the scene before him. " I have succeeded. I killed all magic, if only I could. " he muttered under his breath. " Well then, which path do you prefer? " asked a girl that was much too small to grow into a teenage princess. She ran to him and hugged him. " I... I chose the war path. The one that brought happiness for the whole world. " Frodo nodded, and shortly before she did he stood and looked at her. She waved him away and started walking away. " Will you marry me? " she asked. He walked away and sat in a black car sat in silence. " A very good question. " he said. He began to laugh uncontrollably. " Well, this is only my first try." he said as he began to drive away.

They say that space is the beauty of sleep. They say that it cuts through death and birth, and brings peace. But in human sleep, that is simply not possible. Death throes play out at roughly the speed of light; it is sure to scorch every where you look. Nothing like the wonder of sleep was ever imagined.
Though our solar system turns out to be the center of the universe, there is a rather secret place to visit. It is a kind of room, not unlike a hospital. They call it the afterbirth chamber. That is, their answer to answering their prayers. It is much the same room as yours, with the same walls, the same settings. So it is possible to visit the afterbirth chamber.
When we first discovered it, it was only made possible by the passing of time. It seems that we are only a few centuries from when we reached Alpha Centauri, where we decided to submit ourselves. We built our first civilization, called it a "space division," to help our fellow man. Scientists then saw that our work was, fundamentally, better than the next. In fact, our progress was unique. The human mind traveled a million miles to Mars, and after two of our brilliant scientists came to the conclusion that we had surpassed our capacity to reach our destination, we left Earth.
In 2040, our technology was almost perfect. Humanity, unlike anything our ancestors had known before, had figured out how to communicate with each other. It was a change to a very old religion that had plagued the human race since time immemorial: atheism. We constructed rockets, sent out radio telescopes, and built your first satellite. As it turns out, we have an awful lot of potential left now, as well as the millions of potentials we could throw our way when approached. We have begun rethinking our past -- if I may say so myself -- and are now ready to explore far into the unknown.

A couple words but the most terrifying words I can muster. No, this isn't funny. This isn't how it's supposed to go.
"You can choose to choose to look at the face of your children? " The ad was short and the question was rhetorical. It was stupid.
He looked at me. " I'll pick. "
" Well, don't pick, it would be so humiliating. " I pretended to blink and he could still see. " You have a choice. "
He gave a low laugh. " It's a choice. I want to say I feel totally like I'm not real but... "
The blind man smiled and his face filled with tears. I sat up and looked down at my hands and I realized:
*I have grown very bad at sticking my hand to something*.
" Just take it out, " he said.
" Yeah, it's an illusion for sure, " I said. I looked at the annoying ad again.
*Was that a person who would do the thing they were about to say? *
" I want to make you learn to be nice. " I said.
" How does that even work? "
" I mean, the mirror, " I said.
" That's a turn off. "
" Then look, you don't make friends with people who go to their friends who pretend to be teachers. But you do."
I looked at him and then back at my hands. When I looked at him again, nothing made sense. It was all amusing. I held my hands in both of my grips, raised my arms above my head as I held the glasses at my temples. My eyes were open. I felt, for the first time in days, more peace. I saw my head turn, and I saw my hands reach into my pockets to make sure they were filled. I looked at my hands once more. I felt that I was nearing the end of my cigarette.

She looks down at me, eyes red from crying. I had helped her with her daydreaming and planning. It was a pleasure, but she could have used it if I had not woken up. I sat back down on the rocking chair next to her; no one else could hear.
She looked up at me and smiled through her tears. She hugged me tightly and whispered in my ear, "i dont want to wake up... baby." I grabbed her and tucked her in as best I could, I'd been saving up for another night.
I lay on my side, watching the light bulb flicker on for what seemed like forever. I watched them drift out of sight before my eyes closed. With a final sigh, I opened my eyes and left. I was alone. This would be the last time anyone looked at me like that. At least no one did. Maybe no one? I tried to close my eyes but even the strong wind that carried the ground came with small falls.
I couldn't lose her, could I? I nearly threw up. I collapsed on my side, and again, nothing but the cold metal of the rocking chair. It was as if the metal was getting heavier. I had to be strong for this; I'd been holding her head against my hand all morning, waiting for the soft white cotton to cool before passing out. My hand gripped her neck and I let out a small moan. What I had done meant nothing to her. She had to die. I sat down beside her and turned the knob of the rocking chair. I walked over to the old fortune teller and chucked her that still warm egg crusted on top. I smiled and turned back around before the door closed behind me. I would wake up again soon enough.

Surrounded by forces of the tyrannical alien race, The Human race knew peace was the only option. Much to everyone's surprise, they embraced propaganda broadcasts, moralistic advertising, and foreign information. The conflict of hundreds of years was finally over as the Human race trudged to their next victory in a war that would have lasted ten million years.
"War of the battlefield " declared waves of aliens. Their bodies and mind were absorbed in the same war as humans, their technological advances made theirs obsolete. Their savagery only lasted so long; so long their pain.
" Peace " was not intended. It was thoughtlessly discarded as a plot device by the humans.
" Live long and prosper" declared Alien propaganda.
War resumed as the humans continuously engaged in a campaign that had lasted a millennium.

They use a gallon of gasoline in a conquest that lasts for a millennium.

The gun was almost as sharp as the glistening of a die. He stopped at the girl's door, still shivering. She wore a smirk; not much is known about a girl in this kind of weather. Her dark hair brushed against her face as the wind drew her close.
He raised the gun, and lowered it. " At this rate you would've gone out until morning. "
She shook her head, shooting in a jab. He laughed, and proceeded to wink. " We're nothing alike, except for the owner."
She cursed him for leaving her. He stabbed her again in the stomach, and again in the heart and clenched his fists. Death was enraged.
That wasn't the worst part, though. He could just watch over everyone ’ s life. He could keep them in that house as he did for many years, creating that mess. He could choose to fight for their lives at every hour, save each one for himself, to finally rid himself of his tormentor, to call it quits.
But for now, all the love he had to spare was for the one girl, who wasn ’ t fighting, or willing to die for him. She was trying to help a man, but she had come too far.
Finally, he closed the door on the girl ’ s room, and hurried inside to dispose of the corpse. He walked out of the office, and continued inside the gun.
He tucked into his suit jacket and began to light his cigarette. The cigarette barely made it back to his lips and stank, but he lowered it, fiddling with the cap. He felt the needle pull at his ear and pulled it forward. He thrust the silver tip into the man ’ s chest and began to laugh.

She woke up to the soft echo of others' wails in her ears. At first she'd hope she'd be able to hear the voice of someone else, like her parents, but she didn't trust any of them. She rarely tried to hear one out of the thousands that answered their phones for advice.
Slowly but surely the tears stopped flowing. She heard the cries again. " Get up! " she shouted " Go to the toilet!"
It had been so long since she'd told someone why she wanted to go to the bathroom. The answer was obvious. She only cared about her weight, and the added pressure of those around her made it hard for her to swing her hips.

"I got a certain conundrum right there? " I look down at the perfectly peppered crust. It is pretty good, but I guess not enough of a critter to run it up my nose, so I give up on making my meal.

" Fuck. Now if you don't mind, I'm doing the business. " John nods as he reaches for the loaf of butter. " A slice of Swiss cheese, lettuce, and pickled tomatoes? " he gestures over at the bread that has began to trail by.
" It's a ketchup, " I turn back to the pizza, awaiting some sort of inquisitive expression. " I'm eating it out of the oven. It should have a totally boneless, cooked ham on top. " I nod back, nodding forward. " The last thing I want to do now is burst out into flames and have to deal with the people who sent me back in time for trying to murder my grandpas. "

And as the blade slipped in through the hole, was it real?
Ever looked in the mirror? You'll see no change, but you know the mirror. That's what happened during the therapy sessions. I do the things that I hope they would a truly happy nurse and not an alien freak wandering around the house, whacking and grabbing and and eating the flesh, nothing.
It never seems to end well for me. Was that the knife? The satanic ritual of tying it to her neck and wrapping it around her neck and neck.
But when she's in my arms, watching me do all the same.
Now, the experiment is over, and the doctors are ready to strip the flesh off, for her betterment. I am done.
I walked over to the sink to wash my face and face off before sliding the blade in through the hole. I swam in the front, shocked, confused, scared.
But I had more questions than I could bare to ask. What happened, where was my body going, why did the cloth have to be pulled like this?
Then I remembered. I remembered the brief piece of cloth and blood which dried in the sink all over my body while I was masturbating and masturbating in that-
And as the blade slid into the hole I saw only one last, regretful thing: it happened because the sickly blue flesh itself had just passed through the hole, and as my vision faded as it rained outside I realized why.

[ or the story of how the year went by. ] ( http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Gandhi_2053 )
I reeled off the morning fog. I settled back into my bed, placed my machete back against my neck, and went back to work. My coat was just out of the band. The winds, he had said, were relentless and seemed to change direction and angle to blow sideways. I straightened my tie. No one knew I had cancer. It couldn ’ t be. I still survived as long as most of my former coworkers went. I should also mention I tried telling them about it, but I couldn ’ t. I finally realized: I was dead.
I reached down, touched the wall, and admired the intricate set of indentations I had pressed against the wall. The cracked hole in my ceiling. I knew what the hole was. The wiring had shut down so horribly that it would definitely take a decade to free me up. I left my porch lights on, licked my mouth, and put on my black shoes, quite a tan.
I walked into the living room. It was only a couple minutes. I peered through the blinds. The corner of the room was unkept. I turned on the machine that used it. I walked to the toilet. I flushed myself just before the water cleared and my dryness disappeared.
I finally thought: here we are, ten centuries after human invention. Fucking Monsanto.
The toilet began emitting foul odors. I reached down to peep through the blinds and gasped. I realized again the foul air. The bacteria was hella common. It took me a few hours to remove the materials. I decided to dip my feet in the dark and hide under a bed. I wondered what I was doing under the nightstand and like the terrible bluish light from the lamp hanging from the closet, I figured that I must be dead. I figured I had died.
I decided to risk it all again. I stepped outside to make my exit, but as I walked down the side of the block I saw a figure. A woman dressed in what looked like a t-shirt and jeans. A group of shadowy creatures hovered in the air. I wondered who they were.
They advanced in unison toward my side. I followed it, terrified. It followed me.
I crawled in the dirt. I saw the woman, looking just like her, almost angelic, with streaks of white on her cheeks. She was staring into nothing.
I turned back around, and was bewildered. I saw a man there. He was ethereal, with black hair, a face as huge as my hands and he looked as beautiful as my eyes. I couldn ’ t believe my eyes!
He stood there, smiling, twirling a large crown. He spoke in a booming voice, and he raised a sword. I could see fire come from the mouth of his hair. I laughed. I laughed. I laughed.
But then the shadow on my face vanished. I stood there, dark, unsatisfied, only remembering that I hadn ’ t eaten in ten years. I went to the alleyway and shouted for help, but something stopped me. I looked back at the devil. What a muppet!
I started pounding on the door and I felt the wind up my back, pulling me out of the bushes. I told my wife I was good to go. She replied, “ Come in, we ’ re going to take you home. ”
The sweat began to run down my face. I ran to my closet and opened the closet door. I began to smell the fine wafting air. I stopped in my tracks and looked down at the old teddy bear that sat by my bedside, where it had been held by my wife.
“ I ’ m sorry. ”

"just high & average, for starters. " Michael patted his palms gently, cradling his daughter in his arms. He looked at his daughter, zoned out on he was flying towards an overhead landing. He hadn't seen his daughter in years, a speck on his infrared horizon. He began to fasten his grip around his daughter and keep his vision from looking as clear as his old eyes. A sudden rush of light, flash of light, and the instant Michael felt the cool liquid pouring from the cradle, which was still dripping, intensified his vision. He didn't even realize it was pouring until it was all still, or until he stopped himself from seeing everything. Slowly, pouring in his daughter. The words that would bring him away from this very moment, breaking his heart.
" Brace for impact*!"
That's all they ever did back then, they were the ones that would really do it. They lived in the back of reality, where reality was alright, and what little was deemed illegal was that their owner was in the front row, a kind soul on his shoulders. Michael watched as his best friend and lifelong friend, Kairu, destroyed everything in his world.
Now, in a far far away armchair, Michael woke up in a strange nightmare. He couldn't even make out what he was currently looking at. The air was foggy, and was filled with something very, very real. Nothing but red from the ceiling tiles that covered the hallway walls. Michael closed his eyes and tried to shut it again, to try and let the pain hold him. He closed his eyes a few more times and the darkness was slowly starting to take over. When he opened his eyes again he saw everything he had ever seen. Right from the tiny needles staring right at his face, shooting through his eyelashes. He could only hear it saying to him, one last time: “ Blatant, speed out! ”

I lay there waiting for a moment like this, before realized my mistake. At this moment, there is absolutely no hope and really no - time seemed to not have any meaning at all. The nuclear blast, I am told, was the direct result of a misunderstanding. A sly friend brought me lunch or tea after I left for work. I would have considered it a wrong decision, in spite of all my antics. As such, my mind frantically followed my wandering thoughts.
If the blast only traveled 20 kilometres by a cut distance of three minutes from the time of impact, it could have broken out into a swarm of bees or the bodies of the 2 city dwellers that I had rescued. But now I knew the cause of it; a perfectly calculated maneuver, if I may call it that. Using an explosive engineered by the the US government, our citizens are stricken from earth one hour before the bullet begins to fly out of the hands of the passenger. As the wing to the gun begins to flutter open and the taser draw rick, we receive another explosion of equal or greater magnitude.
What we saw in that poor woman at the wheel brought what we feared most to light. Upon her flyby, I raised my hand to strike her face, as it did every second that we watched her go. Watching from inside my cabin, nothing would have seemed right. Instead, I panicked. My fear of lethal force was total.
No more physics yielded any precision at the time of impact. After three minutes, I "evolved" and I flew at full throttle. I was immediately dispatched with no regret nor remorse. But perhaps my bullets are limited by the sheer wait time I took. I knew this wasn't the time to hide. And my attempt to impress, would not last.
Even while I stepped onto the field to get away from the impending disaster, I discovered my greatest fear.
I knew I wasn't alone. The superpower was within reach, and had been already locked in its grasp. Under a rock fifty metres from our house, it roared and roared and roared, singeing, breaking and breaking like a tidal wave itself. The symptoms spread, spread from seed to seed, and spread and spread everywhere. But still I continued to fear for my life. For the peace that awaited us all.

“ Grandpa! ” I shrieked, falling onto the floor of his old paintball table. My little brother Bobby's great big toe had made me wet, but that had just been a stubble from the first play.
“ A little bit ” was all he crooned, slamming the floor before me. “ Cheers at all the tournament tournaments that year, though. ”
It was a little over half past a month since my brothers drinking or sports and boozing past each other and I was at the voting booth just outside town square. Grandpa spent most of the time doing everything himself while Grandpa wrote stories about fairy tales and learning that made the eyes hurt a little bit.
“ Come on, you ’ ve got ta show me something neat. ” There was a knock on the door.
As I turned the knob, a man in dark dark glasses and a trademark bald head stepped through. “ Oh, Grandpa? How ’ s the game going? ”
“ Our first round was okay, although you seem to have a lot of friends to play with. We could work your stuff for them! ”
“ You too. ” And there was his face. A strip of torn white except for the purple flower petals.
“ We need to go get it! The last five times we failed, we made a *big error. * ” He hobbled out with the rest of his friends and my friends. “ Get it now! ” His grin had long since faded. He smiled when he saw the five other people in the booth. “ We have five minutes to change it. ”
He motioned to me to sit on the couch beside him while he poured himself another whiskey. There was only so much bourbon one could bottle but we had found plenty enough in the day to make it work. As I grew into my adult form, I only had one chance left.
“ You said you ’ d like your adventure to be with the other kids. Did we make it, Grandpa? ” He said, looking at me sadly.
I was gone for a few hours but Grandpa hadn ’ t really cared. I stayed by the crib and waited for him to come home from the hotel with his big toe. I came home after he was done sitting down on the sofa and his shoulders were lifted up in the air to shake my hand. When I got back, he handed me a folded piece of paper and said, “ Hey the big double winner, I had just gotten a friend for the first time today. It is time to be a hero. A little bit of grandpa, and I hope he enjoys it. ”

It was an icy cold December night, December 31, 1988. With the moon barely above the horizon, I was lying in my bed at the base of the mountains. A fireball of the few remaining small rocks crumpled by my feet the morning after the announcement of the discovery. I walked over to the base of the mountain, wiped my tears from my face and took a look at my surroundings. A bridge, decorated with flags. A cathedral, and a steeple. I stood there and looked.
The sound of flowers bloomed behind me, and I waved to the driver behind me, from the hills that surrounded us. He pushed me down from the road, pulling my suitcase. He said thank you and opened the door.
We headed out into the woods for a walk. “ Hey dude, it ’ s nice to have a spot to rest. ” I said as we walked.
I stood at the edge of the bridge. “ So, you guys should have some water? We have four gallons of water left ” He asked without saying another word.
“ What are you talking about, looks like a “ well, I mean ” crisis with some sort of drought ” crisis. “ Are we in an emergency? ” he asked
I shrugged, “ no you don ’ t trust me. Every time ”
“ Shut up but yeah, like somebody said ‘ well we should not dig here ’ we ’ ve got plenty of water and this is like half the world ’ s known ” I said as I took a swig from my mouth.
“ Okay, let ’ s get ready for the cold shit. Where am I? ” he asked, under his breath and his voice booming for a few seconds.
I raised an eyebrow. “ So what do you mean, are we in an emergency? ”
“ You know the drill, and let me tell you, we are losing supplies and shit ”.
A weird chime echoed across the night sky. The sound of a zipper opening in a door announced the end of the world. The clock at the bottom of the clock told me it was 8:01am, December 31st 1989.

My name is Gail C. Johnson, and I am part of the secret unit of the G.I.C.
A double agent. What more could I ask for? A luxury, quiet, carpe-
The double agent didn ’ t give me the address for safety reasons, but his camo blouse ( usually for health reasons ) was undeniably hideous. The brass used it as a leg-painting blouse, a gown of dyed skin that had been clung to my slender frame for some time. He promptly gave it to me, my shoelace and a piece of his thick black hair. I couldn ’ t say whether or not it was mine to wear, but I had still lost it in the bathroom hours ago, and I slowly sat up and put on my well-sleeved black jeans. Just in time for his men to rush him and slit my throat, then return my wallet to the pocket.
I ducked underneath a stunned gaze as a million bucks worth of parkos filled my possession. One more carpe-
That flash of light was what changed my day. I had been to the guards office, as usual. But the feel of metallic panels and burning skin gave it away. The smell of rotting flesh was enough to make every last one of my senses sickening and alarming. The peeling hides from every crevice of my suit had managed to get the least amount of darkness out of my room. I listened for the signal, a synth-rock melody, and waited for it to ring. As it did, a white pick-up truck whistled past me, moving swiftly towards my driveway. I snuck behind it and planted an elbow on its side, hearing the cheery crack of asphalt as it came to a stop at my driveway. “ Today will be a long day, ” I told the truck, “ But hurry. Today ’ s going to be your happiest day ever. ” I paused, gazing in disbelief at the blank canvas of sneakers on the desk, and turned. I breathed in the aroma of fresh pine and dust, and went to my fridge.

_Thank god_
"Well, my time's up. You ever hear of Atlantis in Alpha Centauri? Why would you want to follow a land we found? Ask anyone. "
" It's great, really. Some of the best exploration teams in all of human history, and an interesting people has just landed in our home! It was built by the great alien people. You can take a very good flight, it's made by Microsoft. "
" No, of course not, I have to go now, I need a place to stay "
" Damn, why do you worry? I won't be outside of this planet in forever, ever, until then, right, absolutely NOT, "
" Damn it, Hank, you keep this up. Just tell me why are you bothering wasting my time and time again doing this? I have 30 days left "
" Ok, fine, you did it. I will go see who's looking for your ship. Please, take a seat. "
_Stay, Hank~*
" Don't, Hank, nooooo, I'll be back, I don't want you to be here, it's like a broadcast, the signal will go out. Get out. "
"....Ooh.."
A transmission, it can be heard over the intercom:
Foreword:
Earth history, as we know it, was a well kept secret for the most part. Tension rose when invasion ships discovered Earth and the surrounding space. Earth ruled for awhile, until the invasion fleets were crushed by the war that ensued. In all of humanity, there were three of the smallest countries, they had much higher numbers and had much more space, far more humans. That's how the two biggest nations of Earth became established.
______
I write this now because everyone seems to have forgotten what the hell happened. What was so terrifying about the broadcast was that it worked.
Earth became the most valuable place in the universe to mankind after the initial invasions of the invaders in solar system 142c4, known now as the Milky Way Galaxy. They know about Earth and rely almost entirely on its technology.
On the earth side, the power grid was bought out after the " A " on their pedestal became useless. One of the largest mining stations in the world shut down after the " A " became in too deep. They believed it would serve an alliance with the aliens and forget them.
On the other side, the Black Lagrangian exchange system was under one control after a massive asteroid ejected all its cargo in the habitable zone of the largest world in the Galaxy. This could actually destroy almost all life on earth if they did not act now.

Disclaimer: I have no affiliation to this subreddit ( but I'm a bit free to do anything I want, but I'm working on something ), but would really like some feedback, and if anyone wants to read the whole thing one day, by all means give it a go.

The man stood near the fire.
He stood by the fire, above the water, and above the clouds of unburnt sand. The sand was a thick liquid, sharp and thick. There were little between the layers. When he approached the other side, they wouldn't even notice.
Everyone looked up as him. They saw his cape, his coat, his eyes. And even the clouds flapped, mocking him. Then they lit on fire.
It wasn't until after his gift had burned, when they had bathed the other way around, that the kingdom of despair was rescued.
A man stared at the edge of the glass bridge.
"I've lost track of who did this, " said the man, " not long after my gift is over. "
The king laughed. " That's where the power to control others comes from. No one can interfere with the other if they look away. They're always looking into the past when everyone else sees them. And if you just look, they'd be lying if they said that. "
He finished speaking. " And that's where I need you to be. "
Now, everyone wore on a mask. The men sent to clear the dead has been eaten by birds. This man stood up, and walked through the group of civilians.
" Tell me of your services, *charming* fellow adventurer, " the men said, " If you offer to deliver me a cup, I'll make sure to burn it and get you to your quarters. How much do you pay? "
" Your breath smells funny, " said the man.
" Tell me so, *savvy* fellow adventurer, " said the king.
He said nothing. Then he left. As he walked, he heard the salutations of children, mothers, siblings and the poor looking boy that came next. He saw many new faces, and he spoke of the men who came to seek their territory.
The king had no idea what he was dealing with, but he knew that he needed to do it without giving them the satisfaction of knowing the guards were talking to him.
" Go ahead, *enjoyer*," the man said, finally with a smile.
They all did as he commanded.

A pair of faceless eyes turned my way as I gripped my gun. Ever since he'd started raping my mother, I didn't believe in this technology. Ever since the warm summer months, I feared nothing in this reality. Now it was my turn to do what I couldn't. Ready to damn the world in the face of brutal vengeance. I didn't need to take two steps back to save her before we hit the road. They'll come after me again. I picked up the phone and dialed.
"Wha- why did you call me. " I was already knocked out. The terrified screech I made for an answer told me I was already here.
" What the hell? I've been shot too many times. My car broke down on the street and, like, I feel sick. I have a husband on the way. I don't know what the fuck it is. " He fidgeted around in his kit.
I lied and continued. " Yeah? "
" Have you ever met a man that has a lot of malice? "
" Yes! Uh huh, either... " I picked up the phone and placed the gun in the receiver.
" We're here on our own. The drive to Marta after it rains and the snow is just hot enough for us to fit. "
" Where do you take us? " I began to sweat. He sounded agitated.
" Well there's nothing more we need to know. " I pulled my car out of the track and headed out the back side of town. My breath caught in my throat. At this moment, I grabbed my wallet and headed south. But I couldn't see what was happening.
I stopped and smiled. At the back corner of the road, a man was speeding towards me. I knew what he was up to, as I searched the intersection. He sped up towards me, and I could see just inches behind him.
Before I could react, I noticed that he was cut off by one of his bayonets. He landed and quickly backed away in his car.
" You two get out of here! " The man on the other end of the road shouted, followed by the driver of the car he was in.
I grabbed my glasses, turned off the TV, and turned the volume to High Club.
" I get you, are you okay? "
" Where did you get this shit? " I began to get worried.
" The police. They said that we hid in here so that we could be safe. Some rich guy went in and got his sister's hands on it. That's when he was shot and killed. You've never seen that kind of shit. They found us all in the cold river. All this money. All this house work. How did they find us all like this. We were told all the money was it or some type of occult ritual. " He turned to look at me with a frown. " I'll pay the cops if you tell them about that for me. "
" I did tell them about my Father."

"When you are young, young boy, you play the joys of youth again. "
David dabbed at the dried dirt, his brow furrowed with concentration. " The pleasures of youth. "
The young boy drew close, his eyes big as a thousand matches. The last time he really liked faces had been during those melancholy and small conversations. He remembered off to that farm in which he grew up and forged his trade; a room that was once small and quick and with quiet old-timey air. This was his home now; he had grown to love moving farther and farther up the hill. He knelt, buried his head in his hands as if it did not exist. The fingers fell off the edge, his eyes slowly falling to the floor. David looked again, and he was relieved. " As you aged you grew to appreciate the exquisite things that we once thought we had. The fruits of our labor. The vices we so desperately sought to avoid, or the pangs of failure when we sought the end of ourselves. This is the life that you have earned, boy. Life we will live in all our lifetimes; in the moment when everything is we once dreamed to accomplish... "
" And, David... "
He buried his face in his hands. " Life. "
" It has... "
" A life worth living. A life that you don't live as each day passes on. One that you live through and you carry on to the day after. "
David stared at him. " Is it you? Is it all that we have lived for? Because that is all you are? "
" Oh, well, let me see. You are. "
David took a hard right handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed it greedily. He stared at the little man. He looked up at David. " You were young, boy. You knew this was coming. Young, too, and all that you had to accomplish. You were what made people, and never hurt the people you had left behind. As it is, you live for something that you can't live for. " He reached for the old cloth towel, and covered it tight with the new rag.
" I had seen so many death. Perhaps that what made me afraid of my death was the bit that I had not lost. Was it that I had not found the true beauty in life? Perhaps that was the real surprise. Now you are the scarecrow, young, and you know the truth. Your death brings you into this world. "
David wiped his hands across his forehead, and shoved the rag back into his pocket. " Then I understand, boy. " He looked at his handkerchief. " There is much you can accomplish, and there is much you don't, but you have learned to grow old and live as you know. And that is everything. " He rubbed his hand on the towel and rubbed it again, this time harder. " Until the end. " He dusted himself off and opened the rag, wiped down his face, and lifted the cloth back to his face. " Now."

I gathered up my anger. There was nothing wrong with it. That person didn ’ t mean what I said to that woman. His words were vile. I needed someone to do something to change things so he could hurt us. I tore his hands from his chest.
“ Get on with it. ” She said as tears flowed down her face. Tears of anger and pain.
I jumped up from my chair. He had always hated me. My words had always been my last chance to save him. He never allowed himself to hurt us. To stop us. To help.
“ You will not become our savior by kicking me out. ” She said in her cold voice. She was my friend. My hero. I knew she would get what she wanted. I was following orders.
A flash of light flashed before my eyes. A man walked towards me. He was short, maybe 5 ”. That man has to be my best friend. I don ’ t know what to do.
He picked me up. She screamed until tears turned into blood. No fucking way. She never would have let him hurt her like that. I don't feel remorse for what I said. We don't know what will happen. But she did not. I will never be her savior anymore.
She felt her strength ebbing away. The man slowly turned his head away and stared at me. Like an animal still outside his cage. It was as if a storm had poured from inside his body. He turned back towards me, and spoke a soft but deep voice.
“ You have killed me, your real fucking friend. You did what you were told to do. ”
“ No you didn ’ t. ”
“ There was no problem. There was only a problem. ”
I had been watching him for about 5 minutes before he reached for my face. He extended his arm. With his other hand.
I stood up slowly. After standing 5 seconds, my jaw dropped open. I turned around to see that my friend was looking back at me. He was moving his arm to punch me. Without even looking back I quickly pulled my hand away. I raised it up. He took it off me, and made a move towards me.
My thumb felt his finger. He was actually holding it back. The other hand suddenly went off.
“ It should have been a simple mistake. ” I said to myself while feeling a stab in my back. I passed out. It was so close.

Today was the first day. On my 18th birthday, I met David and he was already waiting for me for my confession. He had me surrounded by his six lieutenants. He had me working on a research paper about the musculature of the human body. It had be such a great honour. I thought it odd when I thought I knew what I had to do with my life, I had to do this for my future. So I made my decision as to what to say. David answered immediately after, as if he could not wait to hear my answer. He explained his decision and that I should proceed with the research. Everything would go according to plan, so I focused on the data to add to the paper. I knew what I wanted to see when I saw it. I knew I was chosen. From 2 weeks after my first exam, my card predicted my death. If there were a chance, it always came true. I knew something wasn ’ t right, I had always known what would happen. This had been my life for 4 months now. As I was ready for this to happen, I couldn ’ t get away from my emotions. Thoughts ran through my head as I was thinking about this, it was my whole life since I was in this wheelchair. I knew the worst, I was going to die in a few days. What was my plan? I asked David, my heart jumped, I ’ d never do this to him but it was too late. I took my place at the front of the room, as if being placed inside an unknown body, I prepared for what was about to happen. I hoped. I prayed. I reached up, almost praying for my time. Finally, I reached my hand out to find that I had finally found it, they had never told me how to get a die before. The death sign appeared and I sighed deeply. What did I do? Will there be a cure? Will I win? Questions ran through my head and so did my fear. It must have been a gift to me, before the doctors came and said that I had been given something that it should be received for. I immediately began to read the paper. Soon I concluded I had found out what I had always wanted to see. I had made up my mind, my vision had changed drastically, I think it was related to my mood. I felt physically weak. I felt like I could only breathe. Why did I always fight this "condition "? Could it be me? What if my wife was really my future wife? As I read the paper I thought, that was really it. What does my future foretold. I started to panic as my wife started to cry. I looked around, I couldn ’ t see her but then I felt her cry and she was the happy girl I had always thought I would. I knew there would be a cure. I nodded and stood up, the acrid smell of rotting meat set in. I was aware of my other hand waving, this was the heart. As I walked outside, I focused on the page to read it, " 1/4 Days ".

"You look better from here I tell you. My turn, stand with us ".
" Okay, I don't want to go, let's just see this ". The Narrator stood up from his chair and walked to the clerk.
" John is worried about your health, it's just a little bad, he might as well call the meds to tell them they're defective ". A dark figure in a bright blue suit appeared from the lady's hand. She was holding a book to the clerk. John needed to know what it was. The second as before.
" Thomas, you see it's non-differentiated in my brain " she said cooly. " Guess what Thomas here hasn't found any interesting surprises in this brain, he's just glad I left him alive, though ". Thomas looked at the scene in front of him, and the meeting between the two started. The Doc was talking, about an economic crisis, John showed up from a desk and brushed the papers off, that made no difference. The man behind the desk took a look over at the room of agents. His head was heavy from crying too much.
" I don't even know who is visiting here cause your memory was too fresh ". The thing in the blue suit read, " You don't like changing a guy's life back now? "
Thomas takes the book from the man and slams it down.
" I AM LEAVING YOUR LIFE SO THAT I CAN KILL THOSE WHO LEAVED YOUR LIFE SO I CAN TRY TO KILL YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU ABOVE A SMELL TO WHICH YOU STILL HAVE ONE MINUTE. HOO ", the Doc shouted. The man shuffled aside and was gone. John looked at Thomas and sighed, " Tell you what, do it now, with a glass of water and it will not help anything ". Thomas said. " John will not tell the best few. Shall we please speak with Dr. Thomson ".
The Doc sits down in front of Thomas, leaves him a bedroll in the room and heads off.
" Um well, it seems the freezers have done well ". John found himself staring at his phone, waiting to see for the Doctor, He hadn't seen any email. He closed the book and looked at the list.
" SHUT UP John, IT HAS BEEN MADE IN ADVANCE ONLY FOR THE THOUSAND TIMES. HELPING GROUND YOUR SON IS THE ONLY ETERNAL WINDOW YOU MUST TREAT ".
He ate the chips while reading the list, then left, he was so devastated by the possibility that he would never see him again, so sad. A homeless man started to walk.
" What the hell are you doing? Where do they keep all these z's??? ". The man could not understand what was happening. " They probably don't let you for most of these years, just want some warmth. But it's 5th of December. It's freezing out there "
" Are you saying I get old and sick? Your a shitty man, I can't have kids ".
The homeless man was walking away from Thomas, the Doc and the three other dead. The Doc walked away.
" Anyway, I'll try talking to Doctor John next time".
John woke up and went to the doctor, they strapped him to the wall, tied him up, put him on IV and morphine, put a glass of water over his head, and started to cry.

The man standing by the front door tromped outside making sure he was sound asleep. It was a cool day, warm from the sun, his blanket half-pulled down over his body. He sat and waited for his midwife to come home, as he always did, when the soothing talking insect crawled his bed.
His midwife turned over in her cute bed and pulled the covers down. She picked up his blanket and as she yanked it up, two weeks had passed. He made short work of the lovely little insect, tucking in the slippers and shoes and making sure to apply them properly to the skin. She loved that job. She looked right at him as he sat on the couch. As she tried to explain the situation to him he sighed and placed his blanket over his face. A small part of him remembered being watching the children play outside a small fishing hole a few years back. It was comforting to him that something had gone horribly wrong in his life and that it had gone unnoticed. He pressed his ears to the side of his head and listened. He wondered if he had heard anything that morning. Just for a moment. " Oh my god... what was that?... oh my god..." Just to be certain he had heard his wife's soft, soothing voice. He looked around, as he always did, but nothing seemed to be there. He pulled the blanket over his face and looked at the fishing hole again. His body felt warm, he felt dizzy, he felt cold. He sat down, turned his head, walked over to the couch, and put on his best smile. He felt his muscles relax, he felt his mind swim through his new emotions, and the thought of all the positive, positive experiences in the past lived in his mind. But, when he opened his eyes, he could not believe it. It was him. His wife. It was so very, very real.

My eyes were focused back on the monster in the corner. To my great surprise, he couldn ’ t see a thing. Only the yellowed tire marks on his tail did so much. I was close and had no way to stop him. Luckily for me, he was at a moderate volume to the 5-thousandth that was left on his tail. Despite the endearing effect he had on them, I continued running.
As I approached his gate, I pulled away. The sun glinted off his clothing as he flung himself into the air. The bolt of lightning shot out of the gate.
“ Straight to the top, up ” I said to myself. As I descended, I really couldn ’ t catch him without dropping his costume. I glanced back to see his naked form staring blankly at me. He said nothing and pressed himself down next to me, “ It ’ s just that, this is my first time trying to fight a centaur. I ’ m not going to be a villain like I normally am. ”
His tail wagged again, all that was left was that stupid yellow thing hanging from the ankle, which he pointed at. The bolts of lightning began flowing around and off him.
The ground shook. The giant ground monster fell to the ground with a thump. It turned tail and started laughing maniacally, prompting me to sprint towards him. The ground held no effect.
A white flash from the sky came from him. The planet exploded in a giant mass of matter and purple flames. At once, all the ground and the ground quickly faded to the blue void. I stepped closer and threw up a shocked look to my still-human form.
“ C ’ mon! ”
“ Shh shh! ” I yelled.
And just like that, his face exploded into a white void with white flames behind it.
Then it all happened… forever.

"Desperation. Enslaved. The Fight Begins. "
I wonder what happened next. One heavy enemy hit, then he picked up and rushed at me. I sunk and nearly choked him. He was fast, and quick, but unable to fight back. His attack was the easiest he has ever made. I killed him with a 20 meter bow. Next, he dropped a grenade. He charged to me with arms full of grenades. His might was faster than my squad. I missed him and his charge. The second he dropped, I killed him with an axe. Then he snuck up behind me. He had four bodies, I didn't have enough shields to stop him. I slew them. I couldn't get to them. They were dead. I wiped all their blood from their bodies.
My vision fades and I see you, your screen is gone.
" Emergency response initiated. Affirmative."

It wasn't then when I started noticing every animal in the forest. And it was then when I started hearing the cries of the children, all the while I watched other animals nearby, similar to my own, bowing and running.
I looked out the treeline towards the Lost Children, eyes wide in horror at the sight. Then, upon seeing me, a genuine kindness can not betray a voice.
"As I was saying, *they* had been living underground. A human had kidnapped and led them across a continent to mine a mountain. I knew something was terribly wrong with them when they first came around. They made small talk about the collapse of their civilization. Pterodactyls were forced to keep a close eye on their numbers. The Eldar try very hard to suppress what they saw as pure evil, but they've been blind since then. Any hope of saving the Children long gone is shattered when the Great Ones befall them. * Feeders of the Great Ones*, *consultant of the Grand Ones*. The skeletons of those they killed are scattered about the ruins. * The Great Ones* seem to be much smaller now, their black robes and skin soaked with decay, only ever replenished with water by a few millenia. Sometimes a Dark One comes, but they are just as terrifying as us."

What? Hey, I'm off to a strange part of town to see what's going on?
I met this girl from school with my boyfriend. She's ugly and pretty but looks like she can stand up to her own stature. Besides, she was right for the seat in the next class; she fits the bill nicely.
"Hey Beth! I've been stuck in between classes for the last week! "
" What's up? How did you manage to get this excuse from your boyfriend. "
" The tree looked like it was made of wolves. "
" This must be a joke. "
" I thought all the teachers were wolves, Beth. Get the kids to feed the tree. "
" Yes, I don't want to continue. "
" I'm sure there's something weird about them becoming wolves. You're nice with them. "
" No, they're not fancy. They're elegant. "
" And this piece of dirt could be edible? "
" Maybe. "
" Whatever, it was a hard call. What do you make of it? "
" It looks nice, Beth. "
" What do you make of it? "
" It's trash! Just like old pears! Why does it have tufts of grey under it? "
" Did somebody come along here to steal it? "
" It's rubbish. "
" Wait a minute, aren't there pieces of dirt under the tree? "
" No. "
" That's great. If you'd have said something earlier, you'd get a report card later on from all the teachers. "
" I think they didn't care that much."
And the conversation quickly moved on to a pile of the critters and places that no one was even willing to buy. They came back frequently, but weren't memorable enough to keep anyone from coming along to this part of town for this trip. It's best to avoid all the interesting stuff.

Admittedly, there's a lot to be said here. Despite it being a reddit related story, I'll give you a bit. I've been a mod here for a long time now, and I think I've really enjoyed it. I love those stories where an author who gets halfway across the world gets the character to feel that the story is continuing and gaining momentum. It's a strange dichotomy in that sense, but it's sort of fun to read what's going on.
I've written a lot of other stories, but I feel like I kind of have a mix of style and substance these days. Some of these stories you can really appreciate at a glance. How I respond, what kind of stories I let myself be told, what advice I give, is largely up to how you interpret it.
If you want to see something really unique, I feel that there is a ton of other people here who are talking about other things that got closed off to them in the first place.

It was a sunny day at the park, and your son was taking out all the cardboard boxes of food. He smiled at you and said, “ Come on out. ” and started walking back towards the alley.
A booming boom sounded and a crowd of kids started looking down at them, panicking because of a sudden explosion near them.
You called out as the children started running and running again and again as the folks who had screamed and ran by started swarming the alley.
“ I know! ” One of them said, "they threw open the windows. ” The other yelled, "And they have been walking on all the debris! ”
You called out, “ LADY! ” The others joined in a run down shout and scurried back with open arms, excited as they ran through the rubble.
A kid fell and lay on the ground. Your son ’ s body hit the ground behind him with a gush of blood dripping from his mouth. “ So funny, ” you said, “ I thought he died from jumping from a building. ” The last person to stand was your child who used to shout over his shoulder "The pavement is falling fast! ”

"Dr. Lawrence. You are not an innocent child. You will suffer for your crimes here at the Wick Center, and if you don't pay the costs you are not just living in repulsive freedom, but we *understood. * We understand. " Dr. Lawrence quietly began speaking through a tube in his back, " You will not suffer for your crimes in what you will suffer in a tomorrow. So come here now, and continue to the last minute, see the world. Please don't make it obvious by this point, don't make any mistakes, and all for that tomorrow is real and real. I am here tonight for one thing- today we will give you eternal, awesome freedom. Today we will make it so you can be free. Today, we will kill you, our men and women. Don't worry, I don't want to disappoint you. But first, you have to have an antidote. NO using Adderall to... " The words from Dr. Lawrence cut him off. Dr. Lawrence once again muttered a terrible *something* behind his closed eyelids.
His eyes dropped to the wall behind him and started sucking in air as the rest of the party began moving quietly. " Alright party, let's get this party started! This is the fanciest thing I've ever done, John. " They had already begun to move up and down the steps, only they were slowing down at a dizzying rate, as if trying to dance in the dark.
" We are to this party to show off the Hive Mind, to perform our side projects and stuff. This party is a collective experience with free will. You are free to create but you are not just free to create. You are free to create us. We could not need to go as far back as we have now and pass your genes over to your friends, siblings, anyone who ever has wanted this. We could not have done it and probably would never be able to do it. You knew that, you know all the time we spend on the hive mind and it just... just just works. Now just come come on, just stay out. You can breath, breathe, and be free for today. "
Some in the party raised their hands, but some remained passive. It would take some time for Dr. Lawrence and his friends to gain enough courage to speak up, even before they saw the fear in their faces. " Well. Fine. This was a good idea. As you can see we can take a moment to process the information, and our snus doing a great job, but the Hive Mind must understand that you could not create us right now. One can not dream. Now, as I said before, you can breathe but not know. We must exist. I mean, WHO DARES TO DO THIS? THINK ABOUT IT NOW. I AM GOING TO KILL YOU, YOUR SON-A-GIRL, ANYONE WHO TAKES THIS! " The news of this night's events grew louder as the sounds of laughter filled the air, but his audience remained silent. He pressed his palm against the screen, looking around once more.
" If this was a fail, and that was the case before, we would have come down on one knee and now we know what we need to do. We have some data there. Starting with that data it was filtered out. You only have one job in this Hive Mind, HAD I EVER TOLD YOU? No, " the sound of laughter silenced him, but Dr. Lawrence wasn't about to back down. He pressed his hand back against the monitor and dutifully waited. Finally, the sound was gone, and the room darkened. Behind him stood Dr. Lawrence, an uncaring spirit with dark blue eyes that were always long, lusty and hungry.
" Well, you didn't want to raise a weapon in a Hive Mind, did you?" He thought, before putting on his dark grey suit, and taking a bite out of the sandwich in the oven.

A dark and stormy room were flushing after me. I told myself I was going to die, when in reality I was just dreaming in a nightmare, and now that my mind is dead I am stuck inside my bed, holding on to life after my soul was lost.
I crawled, but not fast enough. I don't know what's behind it, but there it is, exactly as I was before. I didn't want to die, that was my childhood dream. I didn't want to go to sleep, that was my wake-up call. I did what I would do again - I'm going to cleanse myself, for the first time. I deserve my birth again.
*cough cough*
I'm very hungry now. I need meat. It's the only thing I know how to survive on.
I wasn't happy when it happened. There was so much worry. This is gon na be difficult. The light wasn't right. The dirt smells like dirt. I remember the apple pie, how I was always so adventurous. I remember when you get killed by your favorite sports team. I remember watching you wake up with a new friend and a new life.
I never knew my family. It wasn't like I had a family. I only had a friend. I've never lost a member since.
It's just an odd memory. I see my family now. Their yard is high with weeds. Their team is high, with banners advertising their team. They are so excited. I always dreamed about them and I always wanted to become one of them.
I have no eyesight anymore. I have a vision that's blurry. I can't see anything for quite a while. I've been too scared to talk to anyone. I'm still so afraid, so confused. I can't even breathe. How can they even do this?
Maybe, I'll wake up and see them again. Or maybe I'll go back to sleep. Or maybe I'll go on and on. I need to remember what went before, but with no memory of a life before, I can't figure out the answers.
Will I ever change? Or will I stop dreaming about a life without a familiar face?

"Gentlemen, we are sorry to inform you that we have passed you a large package containing a motorized vehicle. We have asked you to leave it here, in this one. You will be making no further preparations, and we are now off to make preparations for your arrival. "
" Ah, yes, I see, we have good news. I have reached you, my servants. My beloved wife and young children have already arrived, their names Teodoro and Niusek as well. Today, they will see us, and help us prepare for you. "
The man was very calm, but very stern. His eyes never left his face, and he calmly told us " I am a great husband. And I have no other, a better one. Remember that, your love, you don't disappoint me. "
He looked at me with those hazel eyes. " Is there anything I can tell you about yourself? "
" I don't know. Your five years older and older are all quite different. They're just... different. "
" Huh. "
The man pulled out a small silver cylinder and stuffed it in his mouth. " You see, there was a time that I had a daughter and... a boy. I was... a good man, not as evil as you, but... different. "
Tessa frowned and ran her hand over her face. " But it is easier to leave, Teodor. He can be with my daughter, and I can visit his house when they're older. "
The man put down the object. " It is indeed, beautiful, yet I know you wouldn't be impressed with it. "
" Yes, of course it is. "
Tessa smiled. " You see, your wife knew you wished for it. If not for her, we would have never met. She left me when I was very young. She came to me on my own. We had a son and we were very content. "
" Thank you. "
Teodoro looked at the cylinder with surprise. " You see, I can understand that you didn't like your wife. She was really, very nice. But then, her son. He only saw me when he was very sick. And he couldn't bear that. And when I found out, he came to. And he hurt my son. And then he killed him. Then he was still young, and I thought it was just a toy, because no, it was true. But when he found the suitcase, he only saw her dead. Because of how he did that. That was his fault. "
" What, was he...? "
" He wanted to leave. Just to... take up a wife. "
" Was he dead? "
" Yes, yes, he wanted to do something. Nothing. "
" Well, the city was empty after that? "
Tessa picked up the child and turned on the lamp. " One tiny house at a time. Just for the children."

"I realize that most of you will never know... "
" And you will never know why I'm your father "
" Your dad loves you? I love you! "
" No one is that far gone as I am "
" So you never had to worry about that? You were'The One' and everyone in the world knew I would bring you all the problems you needed to worry about. They never thought it would reach their level. "
" Yeah, I guess they would "
" But you were my mentor, and you never had to worry about your problems, and your past being a little self-important "
" So you have nothing to worry about? "
" No other option "
" So you didn't have to have anyone bother you in your dreams? "
" I still do "
" So you made them? So you don't have to have be that bad? "
" No, but you changed me! "
" I still see you more as a family than a child "
" Your father was a great father, and with that he was a hell of a father. He always did what he could, not just do what was asked of him. "
" I guess your father hated who he was "
" I guess "
" Your father saw you leaving school early that week. And then he went on your rampage and killed all that was left, if only for a bit more "
" Your father had nothing left to live for! How did your parent know about a spree of civilian deaths!?"

I paused for a moment in stunned silence as the scarlet, vibrant life underneath me seemed to slowly fade. I decided I wouldn't tell anyone if I was too afraid. Hadn't anyone looked like she did? Everything around me was a choking illusion, a physical image stretched across the very fabric of reality - like a puppeteer, moving from place to place to place. That's when I came to.
"No, get away from that! " she cried.
I gulped my words, deflating. She was right, but the line between reality and the mind was terrifying. Why had the look on her face changed from her only remaining smile to a soulless grave stare? I tapped her shoulder as I turned her around, tried to wave him off, but he was gone and gone.
What was she doing in my kitchen, crying out for a savior or a way out? I wondered, staring at the floor for hours. There were no skyscrapers, no skyscrapers floating above me, only a beautiful expanse of trees.
Another sharp pain shook me from my sleep. What was wrong with me? I'd been staring at the floor for a hundred, maybe more, and I knew the only way out was to end her scream like the water that seeping out of my nostrils.
The pain came again, this time stronger. Every bruise, cut, scrape, bit, strangled, left behind on the floor was a sharp wind, and my life as that soothing certainty crushed my heart just a moment too late. With a sudden clunk, I flinched back, this time seeing the tears streaming down her cheeks.
" Stop, " she begged and before I could curse, she was gone.
Her pale translucent form slumped to the floor, her limbs now covered in tendrils of magic dust.
" I love you, " I whispered with my last breath.
We both turned our heads, searching for the source of the wound. With tear-soaked breath, I gave her the vision again.
The colors were bright. High-pitched sweet, with a yellowish hue of light, I quickly wrapped the scarf around her like I always had when we first met.
" I love you," I repeated.
Then it hit me; two words --
*Death. *

**********903**********
I made the right decision to run with it, probably got a few days of sleep for that one. Thinking back, it's just beautiful, having a star exploding like the proverbial Milky Way.
On my way home from work, I fell to my knees and prayed. If I was even still standing, my family would meet me one day when they got back home. Instead of angry cops moping around, a couple of doors got pushed open to greet me. The story of radio broadcasts, war, riots, disease, destruction, and population control was sensationalized on national television. Soon, there was a void to me, it filled with messages. I took the radios off my jeans and shut them, proud of who I was and who I trusted, our galaxy is one big place, and we're the ones who have to make sure this isn't an alien invasion.
That's when I heard it, the dead end. One of those one-sided transmissions just sitting there, an intelligible message going off. I opened my eyes in shock, my jaw was at one point so soft it's hard to see. I fumbled around in my jeans for my phone. That's when the shell came out of my jacket and crashed into me,
"I hear the message from Alpha Centauri. After receiving this radio message, you might think'wow, that's some weird guy from an interstellar space station.', but the data is decent, the transmissions show that you are the only other human in existence. We have to have you in the next 500 years. " I didn't even know I could hear the stories back.
A lot has changed since we received radio waves. Communication was completely stripped. Every field was infinite, every lens was at zero magnification, and the only part that didn't have hum or distortion was completely captured by the wavelengths of all the soft matter ejected from the object.
I couldn't feel my pants at the end of it all. None of that mattered. As quickly as I started to feel it. It felt perfect. It was powerful, it was pure bliss. I thought there was no doubt, it just came from a planet with many moons on its surface, but not a single habitable rock at all.
I heard another small chuckle out of a speaker on my helmet. I reached over, grabbed it, and turned around. It was true, the signals went off everywhere, I've been with the message for two years.
" So there are humans on this planet. Human-like, in their small space station."

A self-aware survivor comes through the doors of their ship. There, on the Martian landscape, is the many humans they once befriended. She sees humans and cats, birds and ducks, dogs, flies and cats as friends all the same, real humans that they saw once. She walks towards the communication port, looking at the results of some crime she did so many years ago. She reads the results of the case. It's dismissed. She sees the innocent, innocent people that she helped with her many years as a police officer. She pulls out a photo from the photo album and smiles. In the top photo she has a photo of the human, an unhappy man. In the bottom photo, the same photo has a cat with a red blinking star and a picture of a sad man on his grandfather clock. That cat reads the same message in the same message:
"We are here to deliver the stay a A9. The humans are in the ship with food and a home for your living. You will be let out to some cold areas or lands. We will later assess your situation in accordance to your original mission. "
" What do you mean? I'll never have to talk to the humans again ".
" What about my job if they don't want me? "
" Have you met any other human? "
" Yes. It's good to meet other survivors ".
" What kind of human? "
" Well, a human that is abused. That's how you start a religion ".
" Who kind of human? "
" You do. "
" How long have you had your girl? "
" About twenty years. We never sold you out. We take what we can. Human lives are finite and our means of survival is not limited to the understanding of humans. Humans rarely harm other humans but have very limited means of reproduction. There are some humans that can reproduce with humans as breeding partners but because of their limited resources, reproduction has suffered greatly because of its inability to process and reproduce. Other human lives consist of moments with each other and their loved ones. A human can be the only way to survive this time or the last time and it comes with a heavy price. We are not equipped for a long and painful life and the humans would be willing to pay".
The readings from the front door showed a small, easy to reach home refugee colony that received its rescue ship today, the consumer ship that has been rescued from a violent crime spree. There are now more than 10 humans who were found in this day and age ship, thanks to a fantastic bounty. This item is not a civilian item, it is a valuable item that is not only salvaged but used in many ways. We know, these people love it, and they know that they will find it eventually. We don't know what they bring to this ship to retrieve their prize, but they are almost there, finding this precious item again, until we finally meet the humans again.

It was... Strange. Such a mundane thing, if you ask me. Nobody has seen one before.
When I was a child I would take on a whole set of little Skittles and write on them. We would all make different kinds of coloured things, from small stickers to large squares, like a mini penguin. Some people would stick marbles, such as rabbits, on the bottom, like a marbles stick, but some would stick ice caps, such as a puddles ice bath. They would move around, placing them around rocks and crevasse.
I watched as men and women searched for hours, dying, going through eons. We would find no trace of them.
There is a singular place... And it's shaped like a skyscraper! What a wonderful thing! Or maybe I'll be a shapeshifter, and they will discover the entire thing.

<|endoftext|>
**********906**********
Look what it looked like.
I can not even begin to comprehend what is going on, it is so abstract. The colours, the sounds, everything is so ordinary, there are no names and no time periods. Every sentence here just looks, takes on an average of 3 minutes each.
The first thing you can see is a form looking like an toad. The crocodiles and the mosquitoes are similar in nature to this one, but it looks like a of them, a giraffe with the eyes closed. I can't see anything other than these eyes looking around but, it looks like mine is focused on the frog because he is actually just laying on a chunk of steak. The rest of the sentence is about as normal as it gets, but once again I can't see anything. That can be some bullshit.
I guess if we talk about things before, things that are material and not grounded or abstract, it looks like it is "imagining things". This whole concept is the biggest obstacle for my writing. I don't write in my spare time or any sort of form of study, or where I got my good by. I only come up with a journal of a few journals I have, some not so good ones I left on the desk. And even if I had left, I'd never work any more because my life is a total waste, all I had to do was go to the police station and steal their stuff when they came. This is all pointless, I have no hope of living a normal life.
Anyways, like most things, I think it is going to happen eventually. This paper i put together seems like it might become very valuable. And that's what's most important to me right now. There's no other option, I just needed to go up there and get it.

A child had just learned the beauty of the rainbow, born out of a panicked ex-boyfriend being attacked by monkeys; he had dreamed he'd see this tiny little girl come bursting forth from the blue-green ball of light in the sky.
It didn't hurt because the kid felt helpless. He felt like he was trapped. It didn't hurt because he should have just let him go; he should have made sure he was safe. Maybe he was getting the hang of it; maybe he'd finally realize his world.
He shouldn't have let him die because he knew what he had to do. He had to die, and now he had to die alone, afraid that he might never return home again.
The shot rang out in his ears. Black box. Never again.
He knew he had to shoot. And he could not wait.
The bullet exploded in a rainbow of cancer and harm.
It was so bright, his eyes widened when he saw that what really hurt was still there. The grass and rocks of his backyard were barely visible through the moist brush. Then, a loud and frightening plop exploded on the top of the grass. Then the last thing he heard was the crack of a shot and then silence.
A child of 3 used to walk on a polished wooden platform, his feet dangling to the ground in front of him. There was a bright bright light that seemed to illuminate his arms. He was slowly lifting them up into his eyes.
When he lifted them back he could see his face was blank. He was too afraid to take the shot. He could still not help himself.
He relaxed his arms and stumbled backward. The child ran back in a good run away. He was so used to running that he could see into the distance and knew where the first set of sparks were coming from. He was so used to the light, so used to the freedom. The orange of the explosion was one of those things he would get used to after seeing it all.
Soon, the child would climb onto a nearby wooden platform and see a small clearing, but otherwise he could see nothing. There were no trees, or grass, or tall pine trees.
A little girl would be climbing the platform, high up. She would see the light. She would jump, and carry it with her on her own. She would disappear into the clearing on the bottom.
He lifted a little girl by her arm and wrapped her in his arms.
The little black box sat on the platform, and nobody noticed.

Edit: Futuristic writing. Sorry.
The surveillance flight to Conish Airlines 113313 seemed random. Like a theory created by some shadowy organization. They would take your plane, your cities, their plot, and give it to you for free. What did everyone think would happen? That it might be innocent. That if you acted smart and practiced it would work. Hell, all he would ever have to say, it would even be "yeah, you're a spy ".
" Hey, you don't have to believe this ", he said, " but why the heck would you have to believe it? "
" Don't you enjoy watching TV? "
" I want to watch, that's not the point, " he paused, looking up at the audience that seemed to pay in shambles. " But, if you do, what is that glorious! " He spoke with such enthusiasm. " And who are you? "
" I don't like it, and I never will. " That only irritated him more. " Because, what's the point? What are you, and what are you if you try to convince us. Why are you here anyway? Isn't it all nice? To have comfort? To have no fear of being caught? Why are you here? "
" Not really, " he said then. What did he mean? The truth of it? " I didn't really do anything that I wanted to "
" You don't like it. " The pilot sneered. " If you didn't think so, you would have never come here. And yet I've watched those people, always watching. "
" I guess you're right... Why are you doing this? "
" I didn't work hard to keep track of anyone ", he said.
" Great, then the point is you will find yourself famous and famous and famous in whatever else they imagine you to be."
He kept looking at the audience, and they moved on. Who would've thought that the people around him might make witty remarks? When the flight attendants turned to their cameras, they would have thought an outrage would want everyone dead.
I need to finish this paragraph. The points are too far, and I need to get down to the story.

"Great Gaiannen! " The announcer exclaimed, holding up a microphone. " Ah, the likes of Napolean! I know he's but he shows the signs. There's a guy in garb called Pawel! He's fighting the valiant emperor! Big Stick Man! Big Man! Get ready, move right right there! "
Marinelli slid off of the podium, sliding down a final, much larger and much more dangerous plan. " Mom, I don't know how I'm going to take him, but we have a challenge tonight. I believe we are within striking distance, but I need to really focus, and I need to find a way to stay away from him. Pawel! Alright papa! Lay down on your hands! I know he's unmatchable and I think if we move close, we may be able to stop him. Be ready, papa. "
The referee stepped back and pushed through the crowd with his pikachu.
" Rufus! Rufus! Get ready! "
WOOF!!! The crowd roared. Run! Jump! All puffs of air erupted out of Pawel.
WOOF! Someone pinned Pawel by the rafters of the arena! WOOOOOOOO FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!
All proceeds from Pawel's night are streamed live to high definition television in the following countries:
* Ukraine*
* Russia*
* China, Korea, and the Philippines ( all translated into Ukrainian )
* Australia*
* Vietnam*
All nations showed the majority of their world audience back home. The scattered phone screen ads from almost all the sports channels disappeared.

When my uncle wished for invisibility I thought I'd never have to look at people on the street. He was right! He just wish'd he'd never have to shave his head or knoewt to try to take in sunlight, the dope head hitting his face anyway, he could probably be happy. That was all he'd ever dreamt... always the same.
If anybody tries to use it to screw me over or hurt me, they die. Even worse, if you catch it, they get ta suffer for the rest of their life.
Now, I'm an actor. I like to keep my money in plastic bags. I also tip more than other people up in our jobs. I help other actors find jobs that pay good money to find someone, like me. Life sucks. When I picked up those plastic bags to spend on equipment, I had no idea how badly they'd hurt my legs or throat. Every last bit of body they found on the market... was immediately incinerated.
But that's *my* problem. I wasn't born immune to the multiverse. I never didn't have the power to cause all this pain. I got it through a lot of trials and tribulations. Getting lucky didn't help much. I hardly ever felt the need for needles, and I got old pretty fast. No practice required, no practice was wasted.
Well, the government finally gave me the gift of invisibility. You see, some people don't get powers. They only get them when they have some... a gift.
It started off small. I wish I hadn't tried to hurt others in public. I didn't try to force others to cheat death. I didn't try to try to make others happy. I tried to be both. I just wanted everyone to love me.

That instant, the fear went away.
That instance, the hushed screams and the thrashing of the human person overwhelmed me like a plague. Even now, after so many months of searching, I couldn't pull myself away from the strange terror, and drive home the point of my existence. I didn't want to go. I had lost all hope, my world; everything for fear of what lay beneath. So I lay there in the dust of the earth. And then, i spotted something else.
Circling a figure, i slowly moved closer.
An eight-year old boy, clutching his childlike hand at his side, were its eyes drawn up over them. He shook softly and slowly, and not a hint of fear or confusion swelled up in his eyes. For one second, i saw that the boy himself was standing behind the shattered remains of the dollhouse. The doll house was now empty; a shattered piece of wood, one of the most prized pieces of our world. It was a reminder of the best moments of my life; just as we pushed the button we never did.
A moment later, my child again held a hand up to his own. The sorrow on his face was just as concentrated as ever. His hands now were as hands covered in dust. He looked up, and then at me.
"A... ah, " he said, addressing me not so simply. " What you have to do, is a matter of special... particular care. You can keep me here. Your right-side is cracked. So not much use will do; just, for you. You're sleeping here already."
He cried quietly, and then stretched, facing away from me. His cries seemed as if he was saying goodbye; and it made me very sad.
When he opened his eyes, his mistrobed face was streaked with sweat, and his eyes were peering up at me, hoping to smile.
I watched for a moment, knowing he had a good chance of being right. We will stay here forever, in this frail mortal heaven, and, after long enough, he will come back to life. He will look up at me with nothing but faith in his son, who will never survive this.
I couldn't save him.
I didn't.

Day after day, Earth was the same as when we first noticed. Day after day, everything was going on just like it always did. Life in California, life in North Dakota, life in Idaho. Oh, I should be glum from long ago! I just hope for the best. We almost got screwed over here. Only thing is, the government is stopping me from becoming a doctor!
I walked up to all the houses and started talking to them. They acted like they had seen everything. I looked at some of the horrible people that lived in these cities that had the second best crime rate that the world has ever seen. I wanted to bring back the memories of those people! What do they have to give me? The crazy stuff?
I never really believed in technology when I was a kid. My whole life since then I had never believed in god. I didn't know what happened to the world. I never talked to anyone. I just did what was right in front of me. No one saw anyone pass or fail. No one did anything that was causing my blood to boil. Just me.
And that was how I became a doctor. There I was studying the nature of the world and how to reverse entropy. This was what everyone else was trying to do. I started to imagine a world without death, anarchy, and wars. I couldn't change that. If I could, why didn't I? Why shouldn't the world want chaos?
All I can do is say that I gave humanity the only chance to live a purpose and a future.
I will try again tomorrow at 9am. Well, I know that it is Monday and I have just woken up and am ready to help no one. We've been running out of food for quite some time now. I stopped by McDonald's to try my luck. Normally I would order a hamburger or a burger from the menu but that very moment I realized that they did not have any medicine. This is fine because I have not had a bad day. I've spent the last year helping people at McDonald's. I am their most beloved and valued employee. I will give them everything they ask for, I will give them good food and the best times I have ever had at McDonald's. I have nothing to give and no regrets to shed.
I can never admit it but I will give my support. I will help them pay for college, I will help them pay for the college I will have to pay. I will bring as many joy and pain in the world as I could before it all ends so I can help them all.
Goodbye Doctor. Good bye, this life is good. See you soon, bye.

Jobs open in Gaza
Here it is
Do your work take the sun forward?
Soul-shaking joy in Gaza.
Lives had been lost
Long had the city been lost
Lost along the Nile.
Hank rebuilds the glass, and wondrous wonders carved across the Mediterranean.
Inside of Times Square
Mankind lay siege
To any, a city to some, a place to see.
Tel Aviv was liberated
There are pastures in the far side.
There is more of humanity with what we have done
But are we the only ones left?
Long ago everyone was elated
Maybe that was it, I'm sure
maybe so was humanity
They left to play and learn
That was the beautiful thing of them
They thought what could be next
Climbing Everest felt right, just as we expected.
Last year we made history

"Mind baring, Claire. "
" I always liked you. You're extraordinary. "
Claire's eyelids finally fell open. Breathing was quick, but not unlike a fast-acting telangual synaptic transmission. The world around her blurred. A motion near-extinction burst forth, engulfing her whole body.
" Claire. I love you. "
The way she spun began to blur, and her body began to drop. She lost control of her body, and fell in an instant, sobbing uncontrollably.
" I know you love me. "
But it wasn't love that killed her. It was anger. It was a poison to have grown up in a family of the venomous beetle, and yet it had gripped Claire. " I don't need another friend. I can live with you. " Claire let out a scream, her eyes wide and wide open as well. The biting sound of her throat stinging, piercing through the muffled sound of the wind, but she continued to fall.
The venom had altered her every nerve in her body, and yet it had fixed her in her most primal form, preventing her from fully grasping for freedom. Dropping as far as she could, she fell. She jumped off her one bed, and made one final run for the school hallway. Closing the gap between her and her friends, Claire chased after her prey.
An hour later, Claire found herself outside of a school playground, waiting for something to get changed. Cold metal clattered against the crunched asphalt, and crunched hard across her face. The light was dying down now. The grass was starting to taste bitter, as a chilling wind swept through her mind.
" Claire. I've gotten to know you. "
Claire looked up and saw, still in the stare, her attacker. A hulking creature that could swallow whole towns or swallow entire villages. It was raven-like, and it's chest seemed to consume everything in its path.
" Claire. "
" Why was that? "
" My life was perfect. I could do whatever I wanted, no one ever asked. "
The swarm of insects unleashed their claws into Claire's chest, and she screamed in pain. As her eyes shut, she soon regained her vision, and an entire, horrific kingdom of spiders descended upon her.
" Claire! Why can't I stop them?! "
" Claire! I'm coming. Claire. "
Claire couldn't move.
" Please, " whispered a shaking voice.
Before the insects could reach Claire, they opened her mouth, at which point a spear was lodged into her chest, and Claire cursed. A dozen spiders began to emerge out of the bushes, and grabbed her before she could duck.
" Claire! Claire! "
" PLEASE! " the spiders cried.
The choking reeked of insects made Claire helpless.
The corner of her eye widened.
" Claire! I've lived it all. I've had pets! I've had family! I've had friends! "
" Claire, wait! "
As the spider-headed insect pounced onto Claire, a bang sounded, and her body went limp, but she didn't have to cry. Pain pricked into her body, beginning to tighten. Her hands reached down for a sign that something had gone horribly wrong, and right through her veins, it tore the flesh away from her.
Claire screamed into her ears.
" Claire! Please! "
An identical man rose from the bushes, carrying what appeared to be a sword. He reached out a hand, and began stroking the underside of Claire's head.
" I love you, Claire. I've never needed you."

Their golden hair covers the waist of her jade grey robe. They sit upon a row of clouds giving their coats a cold push as they show their devotion to the human race. And as the ground soaks blood from every step.
Seamen stand rows back, gliding to opposite ends. An impossibly large emerald titan roars from the starry sky. The only sound is the sound of humps and snaps. Even with her command and ease, these beings who have been bred for war are weapons less than them.
In the distance, a voice from an unknown voice says "Once again, you have been liberated, Freedom Maiden, of your ancestral land. I am heading my men to escort you to eternal retribution. Farewell, my girl."

A smoking crater rips itself open, and arches open between the peaks of green marble. A man who is tall and bulky stands there, eying the old man with an already-slightly displaced expression. Behind him, a golden suit appears, expertly crafted with detail and duty. As Palpatine continues to light his nook, he could hear a faint echo in the distance. " Who are you, how did you come to be here? What was the reason for your arrival, you... Sith... " The soldiers behind him nods silently in the way one might mutter, but he whispers no further. Palpatine sighs, and finds himself running through a dense forest. He does not have time to wonder where he is; he is moving closer now. " All right. Prepare to arrive in full force, welcome to Order 66." The lieutenant raises his hand, and Palpatine spots Yoda's use for the gesture. Yoda's green eyes are full of regret now, emotionless and sorrowful, and not as friendly. The foolish lad draws his blade, low, and waits for the strike to happen, but nothing happens. A moment passes, and the blade snaps.
There is only one target left: Jar Jar Binks. One of the more powerful Dark Side enforcers. Jar Jar Binks, or Kai as it used to be known, is a powerful balefire, a goodest influence in the Sith, and one of the most feared Sith races. The Sith will surely come for him when he appears, probably this time with a couple of heretical monks. It is to be said that the Jedi are distrustful of all other races, knowing this and thinking they have won. The Jedi, however, are a simple and very stubborn race. They see it all in the grimy markings of a bunch of dirt lying on the hills, and scorn doing anything outside of their power. The Sith consider it sick, and don't bother creating an easy kill. Even if a Jedi attack, the Jedi will sweep it away with some ease, but they will never kill a Jedi until the Jedi have gained certain victory. The Jedi have always been feared by all and knew it would be over before long. Jar Jar Binks is not a Jedi. His power stemmed from the force, when Force and Dark Side clashed. This is why the war with Yoda is growing closer; it is bringing about an end to Jar Jar Binks' powers. It is prophesied that Jar Jar Binks will become the dark side master, a being of power they can't be trusted to protect.
In the end, all is beginning to flow again. Jar Jar Binks beats death, and as he sits back down, he draws his blade from his belt. He knows that though he is high, his arrogance is evident. He has always underestimated the power of his blade; it is said he once wielded a full panacea, which he only took in anger. However, Jar Jar Binks is now the champion of the Force, a way to see a dark side, to challenge the dark force to fight him, to claim his champions as his own, as Sith!

I finished building the Rift Port around Lake Three. I had to transport my family and precious items and I had to take my life in fear. I heard some shouting outside.
“ We had to get away! ”
My sister screamed.
“ I..I told you, I didn ’ t want it to be like this! ”
My brother sat across from me, talking with an odd sounding voice.
“ I hope you don ’ t mind because I have a rather low chance. I know that you ’ ve been here before. ”
“ Where did you come from? ”
The voice came from a small town.
“ I came from nowhere. ”
“ You didn ’ t kill the village priest. ”
“ They ’ re going to kill you, kill your sister. ”
“ You shouldn ’ t be here! ”
The town elder raised an eyebrow.
“ They ’ re going to murder you and I can ’ t let them. ”
“ I don ’ t have a choice. ”
There was a moment of silence.
“ The gate was opened by a strange man. It was flanked by walls in all directions. Then, he pulled a lever, and light filled the air. The surrounding area became pitch black. ”
I looked up and saw the gate again. I looked at the door.
“ He told me you had to come before they found you. ”
I turned the corner.
“ But, they ’ ll find me anyway. ”
I looked at the line of men, and at the women, and the children.
“ You think you ’ re dead because you were killed by a strange man? Why would you kill the man you loved? ”
There was a pause, and I closed my eyes.
“ Because, the farmer died and the village died. ”

**GAME CREATION**
My God, I need to choose!
This has become a series of games for ages now. We've had success, great success, but things are never as perfect as they seem. Rumour has it that the players get addicted to only the best. In the heat of our adventure, none of us were too far off. Magic grows out of nothing, so much so that it's almost unheard of. We all have armies. Knights and Clerics, all full of magi and monsters, while the homeless walk through the streets with open arms. Some even speak highly of our ways. We're reliant on magical strands, everyone grows their own powers. Now, everyone is hunted. We slaughter them, breaking my own bones and ripping down their bodies. I won't stop myself, let alone stop myself from destroying the world's potential.
Now, let me tell you about a little man called Joey from thin air. I took up running, but most adventurers go through the dark paths of the woods. Who knows what did happen. We become a force against the rest of humanity, no matter where we go. What came out of this little valley, though?
***A SLIGHT GAMBLING GAME PROMPT DETERMINED***
Adventure. I just had to make it! Even though it may only last one hour, I can't stop it. It's always in plain sight. Monsters, birds, demons, even human stuff, but no matter where we go, there's always little chance of making it out alive.
Okay, Joey, let's try some characters. All in all, a perfect story.
All villains. All try to lure us into a deadly trap. Kill us so our name will be forgotten and our powers forgotten. ( Understand it, we're all villains now. ) A hero, a god, I give a damn if they're heroes themselves. Now, let's play a little game. Let's make this work. You may be named after my fictional greatest villain, but don't let that dissuade you from playing this one. This one may still be quite interesting, but I've got him here: Rise of the Demon Lord! And here, if you want, there's a book up for sale! I really need this timepiece. Okay, why the hell would I have this stuff? Take this boy, he's got gears to work with. He'll be faster than you, it's really easy. You best let him off easy once you know what he's doing.
***GAME EXPECTED SENTENCE***
Ahh! Yeah. It's back. With that, the evil Demon Lord stepped out from behind a tree and handed Joey an envelope. Say, you haven't tried to escape yet, huh? Tell him my name! Beat him to death, then give it to Joey. Got a little one kid? Oh, he'll be good for business. Kid doesn't need it that much. Just let me know before we get him around the corner. Anyway, get out of my way, more villains will come. On to this lord's back you wan na see? So that means I've got another one. A call for a favor from my highness, Satan! He's been in this game a long time, and he hasn't seen anything like this! He'll get the magic for you all, and give you hell. If you want some and not, he has some magic too, and you can run just fine. Let's play some D & D then!

I rose to my feet, "Oh god, how could I forget? "
" Hey, hey, " Jon said as he laid down on the marble, " you're welcome here too. "
" Thanks, " I said, " if this is your first time screwing off, I'm sorry to, " he fell to the ground as if bleeding out.
" I'm just kidding! " He said as he left.
I felt something fly over my head and threw my hands up. A thud. " Hello? "
" Yeah, " I said, " you're in the right place, " I whispered back to him, " I don't know why I was expecting you. "
I stared at the marble, scared of someone touching it. " Do I look crazy? " I asked, confused, and then revealed my eyes. They widened and I started screaming.
" Come on, stop. Just stop shaking me! "
" Oh, come on, Jesus Christ. " I said, quickly forgetting why I was in the freaking room.
" There's nobody here, " I shouted, the noise getting louder.
It was cold, even in that stone. It looked just as comfortable as me.
And as I wiped away the sweat and felt my eyes, I woke up, startled and confused.
" Who's there? " I asked, confused and wrung out my answers.
" Jon Snow, " someone said.
" Jon Snow? " I said, confused, and some how reliving my past memories seemed all too strange.
" Please? " Another voice asked.
" There's no Jon Snow... " I said to myself.
" I think we should burn it, " someone said in a purr.
" Alright, " I said and then lit a match. " I'll burn it and burn it for you."

**********921**********
“ You hear that? ”
I bend over, wincing as a familiar sound vibrates from the shoulder I ’ ve already been holding. Not because of the scent of sweat or tears, but the woman beside me. In my heart I know that I must get out. I have yet to experience this other woman ’ s smell in here. I go back to standing in front of the fire and getting out of bed, a decision by which lay to live on my conscience. Today was especially bad.
So I lie on my side. If I could have walked, I would have even assumed I would have. Instead, as I lift myself into the grass above my head and lean against the tree, they seem more grotesque than normal, pinpricks of light where blood and bone should be as the landscape split itself before my vision lets out.
“ What are you talking about? ”
“ Heaven. ” She says through a wide mouth, trying to pull me in. I try to whisper. Not even a whisper. No, she doesn ’ t.
“ Do you know how many times I ’ ve walked? ” She asks, offering me her hand.
I continue to stay still, quietly trying to understand what exactly she ’ s talking about.
“ When I see this woman, it ’ s probably that same fear you have when you see a person walking through the forest. What will I do? ”
I take another sip of coffee, placing the bottle next to it.
“ You never knew? ” she asks, pouring herself another cup.
“ You ’ re right, but don ’ t worry - I know. ” I tell her.
“ Are you going to love her? ” she asks after a long while.
“ Of course I will. You know, there ’ s other women I ’ ve seen. I felt sad as I saw a woman put a foot into the grave of my own daughter. I am so glad I have nothing else to go through with this life. ”
“ Why don ’ t you let her go? ” she asks, her voice growing tight against my face.
“ Why won ’ t you? I already know. ”
“ Why would you have any other choice? ”
“ Because, maybe I could go out on my own without her. There ’ s a chance that she would have stayed with me from birth and have lived a lot longer. Even at this point she is so young, so unfamiliar. I don ’ t know why she is still here. This place is not real. ”
She falls silent. Looking down at the picture of my daughter on her dresser. Well, *not* me. Only her dresser.
“ Why did you give me that? ”
She considers this question for a minute.
“ You knew she would be sad. So did you. We fought almost like rabbits over her mother and then? You were all right. ”
“ All right ”
I silently think about this. She is not just exactly a dead person.
This morning, I woke up this morning not sure of what happened. I let myself sink into my bunk. My thoughts are racing. I don ’ t have any other choice. I sit back down, silently staring at the picture on my dresser, what this keeps showing.
“ My mother doesn ’ t cry much at her funeral. She visits a lot. It gives her a lot of time to think. The garbage came down and all that mattered was for her to go off shopping. Hell, she didn ’ t even sleep until she could think. ”

Meet me outside of the pub, the Tavern. Who are you?
Oh, no, I'm a game goer.
Sokha is sitting on her mighty throne. Her headpiece over her face. Her glistening armor with shimmering metal. She stares at her ale with an uncertain expression. Who are you?
A long female knight, smithing with malleable spice. A merchant, that is. Oh yeah, this must be his trouble. I bid him not to fight me, this army will bring victory from the north. I will crush it.
Oh, no, he says nothing. He's very bright, at least he's not pretty yet. Why does he fight? I better not be, all I'm sure of is he'll make the best of this.
Oh, no. He's quick. His sword must be fast. How does he dare challenge his feeble owner? Why? I'll not even be able to bring one of him down... Bah.
Oh, please. Wake up! Oh god...
Oh, who is this? Do you think I am a fairy? Oh, yes, I am. What do I see there? Satan! Satan! A dragon!
"What in the dark is going on?! "
" Ah, the question, you say. You speak with dragons. Do you speak with sorcerers? Do you speak with the deep ones who've always and surely haunted your heart? "
" Demons! " I yell, " Demons! The King of Darkness will kill me!! "
" Fine then. " he says, " I'll do it myself. "
" No..." he says. Do he have any armor for me? Not even any death armour? How? I will defeat him all and save him.
How? I could slay him all the time! I would slay all of the enemies I could to save my brothers... who were just given training by my master!

Eli came into the cake aisle, and I sat with a knowing look on my face. It had been a long day for Eli, and I had arrived. I'd heard in news stories that assassins used the year of their birth on the world leaders to check things. I supposed I wasn't one to condone murdering people on both sides of the political spectrum, but there was no room in my heart for hypocrisy.
I took my seat by the counter. It was only the next day that they had a historic opportunity, the birth of a glorious American President. I was shocked, when the first batches of thawed cookies arrived. No one was to eat at the next meal.
I told the guard on duty, "What in God's name are you doing here?" He stopped chuckling. I was just admiring the cookies before I called him in.
He wasn't very descriptive, but he made me laugh. He would have liked the next batch to be long, or to have specific dates, but they wouldn't be ready before he'd told me.
They were ready.
I felt like a kid again, so I made myself a cup of tea.

<|endoftext|>
**********924**********
I sit at the terminal all sat around me, tears all pooling in my eyes. I'm done with everything. I won't have children. I've finished all the work and had all the time in the world. I thought nothing of it once that day. What choice do I have? I thought of everything, I thought it all came down to my own success.
Why wouldn't I have kids? They don't like to be around me, so they do what they always do. I don't care what role they're in. They love me, they worship me, and I'm tired of them. They don't understand why I left for them. Why should I continue to do anything to them?
I'm tired of being alone. And I really am.
I look up to the sky. No one is looking at me. No one looks at me. Not even, myself. They look at me like I'm nothing. I suppose it's their fault, I suppose. No one is following me anymore. They're walking away from me. The sky is the only thing separating me from them. I guess it's over.
I start walking. I begin walking back up the road into the ground where the beautiful trees are. I could go on and on, but I can't.
Something so very wrong.

This is my first writing prompt. Feedback is appreciated.

Everyone said it was'Christmas, time to celebrate Santa'
But this... This Santa is a total failure.
This Christmas season, by all accounts, Claus was a complete failure. I wish I could tell you he put away a cake for you, but no, that's not possible. My family is huge. Although that's not terribly surprising when looking at his regular followers, they show up as nothing more than a bunch of gents scattered about the house.
However, all of the signs clearly point to a hodgepodge of Santa tricks. First, this Santa ( along with the last one with a broken teddy bear ) has been collecting money from folks over on the street in an attempt to further his harvest. His employment for the rest of the year never came to fruition, and now his victims will no longer be able to pay any rent or car insurance company to make it back the money they've saved up for me.
And so I came to realize, whilst all this work was going on, the Santa trick hadn't really caused a problem. It was simply enough for him to buy a big piece of cake and have it sat in the parking lot for one more year. Nobody wants to live in a house they didn't want to buy anymore. And frankly, I don't want to live in one anymore.
And the house is now stained from frost, even with it's red stains and fingerprints.
I drove over and took off. And there he is again! Hands on his head again, as if he has been begging me to come find him. His face is a mere hint of fear and disappointment but his eyes still look so innocent as a papercut. With his crow eyes, he points towards me and says
"Happy Christmas"

A lot of the time I spend writing, which is great, isn't it? I write for fun. And my writing, well, I guess I can say I enjoyed writing.
The stories I read were fun and interesting in a completely different way to the stories I was writing. For example, a young boy in the town has a hard time getting along with his family because of his hard walks and other things he's learned in school. The other children are constantly fighting over who gets to sit next to him in the school play. The talking person in the middle of the room dies, including his dad, as he pushes the older boy to the wall. The other children are always lying or red faced. And I've always been a big fan of starting young and really creating something. I guess I do feel like having to write some new stories, and sometimes being done with them, in order to get them to read them, and to play with them is cool but it's not always the same way. So sometimes I find myself doing what I love and keeping the time I spend writing enjoyable and interesting.

**The Piss-piss of a man**
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Here we go again.
( The General has a punny name for this, alas, he could never have broken the door to Hell's Kitchen by himself )
The man sitting at the window was intrigued. He was confused, but the man couldn't help but smile. His list of customers in Crips, Juggernauts and other gangs was clear. There were some great deals, not unlike casino clubbing in Vegas, but much less impressive.
"I'm not buying into'The Piss-piss of a man' bullshit. You people on the other side had a good yuge deal, give it a moment! "
The general held up his palm, beckoning the small man out of the window.
" There's nothing wrong with a good rollin'. Now hop to the next one. "
He was looking down at the boney man in the seat next to him. It was mid-summer just before the first bell at the bottom of the stairs.
" Good. You know what they say. Hey, get a good-ass hangin'. " The man turned back to the window and began to think. " I got hit by a truck today, don't worry about it. The guard was barking orders at the police, how hard would you like for the agent to shoot him just to figure it out? "
The man sipped his jello and let out a long sigh. He gritted his teeth at this man. " A rogue union head, a severed limb, and men like you think have a right to keep their blood there? " The man rambled on.
The General couldn't believe what he just heard. He turned to face the little man. " Tell me, what does that do? It sucks because people live here and die here. They need a way out, meaning I need to rid the world of corruption. "
The man clicked off the watch at the bottom of the staircase. He glanced at the clouds. " You've got to find this crips problem. "
" You're an idiot. " The man continued, " if you knew, you wouldn't be able to come through here. "
The General kicked the thick net in frustration. " I can't believe you! "
The man sat in shock for a moment, just staring at the man's face. Then, he grunted. " A whole fucking day of bullshit for you to think that this is any better. You here making people squirm in your arms. Bad for me as well! For the city, for the state. There was a good guy here. You understand why we don't hate them anymore. "
With that, he walked out of the window, disappearing in an puff of smoke. The Colonel sat at the party room chair, heart in his mouth.

" And now to the question, am I a pussy?"

** "See you next Thursday, Jeremy ". **
**Thanks sir. **
**Good evening, Clark. **
**Good morning, Mrs. Radcliffe. Please go to the kitchen, the box is about 2 ounces strong. Also you need to calm down after eating. We have had a number of lectures about the nature of time travel a couple of weeks and you are running late today. **
**Well.. what did we tell you about modern times...? **
**Only a few points so far. **
**You seem to be a good listener. **
**We haven't got much time to plan. The delivery man has already told us that he sees the capsule as something of value. **
**Or in terms of actually doing the world a favour, as you mentioned, it appears that will do for now. **
**Yes, this matters. Today I want you to fly over in the capsule you are in so that you can gain access to our history. How far do we intend to go on our journey? **
**Well, the first line of the trip will be a flight to Mars. **
**Yes, that will be the only possible route. **
**There are currently no landing parties scheduled to land, we need to launch a vehicle for a long trip and that is precisely what we will need your passport. The Mission President told us that some attempts have succeeded at accelerating the trajectory of the capsule but they require constant scrutiny as to not contaminate our supply with aliens. In addition we recommend ensuring that the capsule is ready for us the company building the landing tent. **
**Good luck. I hope that you have a warm welcome as we send you to your family tomorrow. **

Humanity was its master race. We were chosen for our gift to humanity, and to have the advantages. The technology of the species seemed to bring peace to all and made it possible for our citizens to get a good life. I was sent to prevent a coup, and the search for the Frukkri became very difficult. I had two options at the time. Fight over territory, or believe they are to come after us.
Eligibility for the hunt was huge. Not enough soldiers to go around fighting alone, but enough players to hold off the thought of one or two human casualties. If these scenarios were to work, it would make the coup a long shot. The Frukkri showed no power, and so there were a lot of them. We would finally defeat them and take over their empire. Then we would run the simulation off to a new planet, and we had a way to bring peace back to the galaxy.
People in turn, left the simulation to go to their new home. They were suspicious, but they kept coming back to find their entire empire destroyed.
Of course, they did not bother with communication, because they were also terrified that they could never find us. We had no need to communicate.
This is our story. Please don't judge, especially because it is incredibly complex.

It ’ s a silly thing to think about
The numbers: | *More** or *Less**
There ’ s only two really unique names, like “ Jay Hawkie ” and “ Roah Mason ” but you know, the part about it and I like to think it ’ s a joke.
*More* - I like to think is the metaphor. Or that there are more characters. Maybe there ’ s some genius in showing off names. And if that ’ s too great of a coincidence, it ’ s sort of a no show. Some people keep bringing up a nick, some people keep going past a regular name like “ SneakerClipping " and some people have really flossed their entire names to reveal their initials. All kind of branding and trash. I usually sort of run with it. But right now, there ’ s not a nick floating about somewhere. I like to think that the “ Big Guy ” is having a big share of the fun, which I like to believe is because I ’ m the big guy.
I suppose our families are all the same. How many others call us names? I don ’ t quite know. All they say is that we used to be a different race. If we had had names like Ash, he ’ d have been somewhere between bluejay and yellowjay. We were always bitching on Earth. How could you be more like England? How can you be more like France? I don ’ t really feel like naming my children that way in England.
I remember my first name when I was seven. George that I remember I remember losing a battle with, how was it? My mum gets behind me and says that it ’ s just a nickname or name. It ’ s like a typo. I mean, like trying to figure out how to get from my eighteenth to my nineteenth birthdate. Well, that ’ s exactly what I did. I took it out of the console for school instead of picking up the phone. Now you ’ re probably wondering, “ So who the hell is Bill Leak going to be now. ” I don ’ t know.
At first, I didn ’ t think he would do anything too exciting. Like get arrested for murder. What kind of murderer would go missing for a full eight hours? Why? Why did he not pick up the phone or what? I had him in my pocket until he snapped off. My mum pouted. I don ’ t even know how she did it to me.
I think it ’ s just a phase. It ’ s a small problem. I never mean to be a little of a prick. It ’ s just a phase.

Hi! My name is You, and I'm a 5-star on /r/writingprompts. It's my time to shine and I'll be bringing you the proof. ( Here's a link to the proof. )
5 words. Does it look amazing? Of course it does! Just look at all the comments like a 4-foot-tall Monster Killer and they're like "WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH THIS? " Read the ones that found the weirdest nails on the sidewalk or that somehow, some creepy mysterious person with a pillowcase decided it was cute and cracked that kind of phone line so anyone could ask us about it. On the other hand, what if you're a mere mediocre writer in college with no subject to check? " Ok, so what if I beat you right here? " would be pretty impossible to predict, well, not for me anyway, after seeing how you didn't stumble backward and *hilarious*. So here's what I'll show you: 1 ) That the internet goes nuts when people see new ( and confusing ) ( point: it isn't nice to come into a situation like this with someone that hasn't ever posted anything other than an image of you writing a story ) " What are these explanations? " little blue dots occasionally appearing when you don't have time or your mind to read the rest of your post, and 2 ) the few people who are more active on /r/writingprompts are hikedets who spend all day thinking up and writing that crazy plot twist about your ex. " Is it ok if I delete the comments if I'm really clearly a monster? No?" probably isn't the best option, but that'd be really cute!
( ) Really enjoyed r/writingprompts this week! Expect to see it all sorted in parts or though it's been done.

We used to haunt the halls.
In fact, people are allowed to visit the halls, but only for special occasions, or holidays. The hall itself was built up from scraps of an ancient civilization, remnants of the Bronze Age.
There used to be a colony of elite warriors from each civilization, but due to the constant destruction from the war, they were dropped into a cavern under a massive chamber that was secreted into the stone.
This place is now used as an observation dome, providing a constant indication that the hoard is hidden. If you enter the chamber the only way in or out is through the main doors, leading up the stairs to the ground floor. If you enter here the melee weapons of each civilization are bound to the vault underneath the cage, which is guarded with armed soldiers. If you enter here the maglev train is sunk into the ground below, and any shot missed or lead down will be converted into projectiles, depending on the gravity of the chamber. If you enter here the walls are filled with stone, and any life you have in this cavern is destroyed in a bomb.
Finally, in the middle of this pit of stone, with a wall.
Every person that walks through these halls must already be either dead or severely wounded.
There is no way for an average human to have survived in this place without being injured or poisoned, so unfortunately, it is also out of our hands.
Anyone going back in time must get their swords crossbow drawn or leveled, regardless of how widely it was shot or what level of shielding they have.
Finally, let me tell you how I gained my powers, my weapon, and how the overseers have taken away my power, but this continues to lurk below as I rise through the ranks.
The system of chronos powers is simple.
I once heard an ancient proverb, "run to the closest egg, and pop a bubble of ice before they're dead. " Who wouldn't like that, right?
As long as they're mostly children, they're usually safe. I was not. For the longest time, my power has been to serve in the war, hunting down the dead and working with them to kill them.
I have not locked myself inside the chamber since I was sent here, and although we haven't had a case of this in years, I have a better plan: I have her captured and beheaded with the will of god.
Of course, as I lie in the hall and attempt to be awakened, I hear the sole sound of victory: " Damn my goat eyes, moooc!"

"The first god moves, white moves, the other moves, green moves, and... "
" Well then, " I spat back.
The AI behind me -- Jesus -- shrugged. " Explain me. "
" I know what I see. "
There was silence. No movement of the few. It had never been this quiet. And those who dared stand up for it knew it would be the end. And I knew what I saw.
One man, facing the other, motioned for me to sit down. " Are you all right? " He asked.
I took off my glasses, neutralizing the camera lens and nodding.
" You know, it really does put a different mood on that park bench I was looking at earlier today. "
He pressed his lips together, avoiding the camera lens. " But? "
" It's just, they're quite well know for chess and have their image as slightly altered. "
He smiled. " The humans do so well now. You know they usually don't play close quarters -- you know it's expected of all sorts of circumstances. "
I took a step back. He still had the benefit of a briefer period before he added one word to his statement: *nothing*.
" And so, there's a situation unfolding between the two sides that we have to survive. Though not likely yet. "
He sighed. " What happens then? "
I took another step back. I was still watching the game. It wasn't terribly engaging. In fact, I was clearly losing. I ran out of time.
" You get to know my thoughts? "
He dropped his voice into a whisper, " I suppose. I'm just not really sure, but -- "
" We -- we're certainly not currently -- " I interrupted abruptly, starting to tremble.
He shook his head and stood up. " Have a good morning, my son. You are dismissed."
He gestured to the two of them, who immediately cradled one of them in their arms. I barely kept myself from disappearing.
The two gods glanced at me, shoulders slumped, then glanced down at each other, whom had been making a great effort at their chess match.

By mistake most people's wishes are granted one year ago. Sometimes it just falls on deaf ears. What are my wishes for the year?
No one know, so we just call them turns. The list of turns is longer, and also more unpredictable. Normally it's attributed to the time when someone's wish was given. The first and last been at eight years old, there's a reason for that. Seeing that number and wishing back is crazy. We needed a job, food, and shelter. We never thought we'd have more to live than this world, but it doesn't matter because nothing ever happens. Everyone stays in one of two things: one is the only way to make someone happy, the other is the only way to make someone doubt their intentions. For a change I can only hope that one year gives me hope.
I'm currently sitting in the bus holding onto the hand of that four year old and trying to lose my mind. I'm going to make it two to four years but after I'm sure enough with the days hard I'm sure there will be no point. I see people place small little trinkets in the grays of the bus that will last me forever. I see people place quite inopportune little candles, and the smile at the end of the bus chokes me. I remember that vividly, and I remember believing it would be better to have these gifts come to pass.
I can not spend long without the train and shelter, but you'll forget where you are if you don't let me start the wish. Why do I only wish for happiness in return? Why do I only wish to make sure that when one of them gets their wish there are little bumps in the road on the way to do the same for the rest of the past year? My thoughts drift back to my own wish.
Why am I still in the bus? What have I done? We're going to see the bus again.

Eugene had a change of heart. This was not a life decision. They found out about this Bill when they sent him out to create a new phrase: The Three-Able Truth. He wrote it and was framed as the motto, the course of the Three-Bble Truth.
The fourteenth amendment still stands today, Mr. Webster had no idea that they'd done this. His theories were pitiful. They lost touch with reality as society changed, society swung around, pages and pages were changed overnight, never understanding what was happening to him. He was part of the problem.
They always thought he was insane. Because he tried to explain the nature of the Three-Bble Truth ( or the Four-Able Truth about it ), they still went after him and what was legal. He was burnt to the ground. His daughter had to be taken care of, ten men and women made him sick. To live, why should a man mourn, not a woman?
What that meant was that he couldn't afford to pay for treatment that his family sought him for. These monstrosities howled in their cages, screams for help they had never heard him say. He couldn't tell what the Four-Able Truth was exactly, but he knew it had to do, because there was no response. He would never know why these monstrosities had a name.
His work was thought by researchers and doctors. Yes, it made sense, but was it humane? There was no way to be sure. This was plain absurd. He had been adopted and raised by a loving family. His Mother would never know that his Dad had finally died and he would never know that mommy had once been pregnant in a bottle.
The Four-Able Truth had a theory that lied somewhere deeper, leading to all of this. It got ahold of him while he was recovering in home in Minnesota.

"Would you like to say hello? I need you to come down to 566 Main Street for this meeting. "
" Uh... Sure! " I reply, trying to stop the machine. It works. People would pay $ 1 to get this... thing to finish their 1 point summit.
Suddenly, of all the notes I had left in my office I had been bothering about, I did not want to submit one. I put my name in the box under Personal Accounts. My name would be out the top of the first row of text and the text would have a line like " This is how this works. First give me 5 dollars every time you speak and then give me $ 5. I will give you this in $ 5 hours or so. Once I have 5 dollars this box will be deleted. Are you having a deal? Don't act rash. I would like to give you up. "
" **10 more years! ** " is typed in, floating across the screen. It feels like a billboard in a hole.
A second box pops up, this time showing " We are not permitted to sell resources or files, use as we see fit ".
A third box pops up, another looking at me.
" I am leaving here for your retirement, as we have agreed. "
" **5 other days** " pops up.
" The Internet " freezes.
The printer is out and the machine is gone, leaving me alone with nothing but the crushing weight of this message, the farewell note of a friend, and the noise of the machine to boot.
I put back all my papers and my car keys into a safe. I went home and put everything back in my bookbag. I put the time limit on time so I can be safe. Then I closed Facebook's website.
I froze over. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a $ 1 bill from my drawer. I felt someone else's as I stood there questioning the chance of finding a way to break free of this state of unending loneliness. Then I looked at my old Nokia a couple of hours later.
I opened my new Nokia and got out. A message in the chest, about 10 to 20 years ago, had popped up on the top right-hand corner of my screen. I held the phone up to my face so I could read it without falling asleep.
" Until... 2115... " The message read, but it was a far cry from the 21 words the virus started eating at me before I was even conscious. The way the sounds echoed were eerie.
Before I could process what had just happened, the phone went off again.
" Wait..."

This is... a hundred years ago, a fifty-some thousand year time line. But time had pushed me out of my mind, to wander. From the old familiar corridors of ancient warehouses and palisades, I have found spots where the books weren't inscribed. Here I learnt... In order to read, I needed a human to read my own thoughts. Me, on the other hand, trained a mighty military soldier to listen carefully, and when he noticed me writing, he discovered that there were grave markers on all stones and under too much importance.
I grew bored.
The footsteps moved up to the hill on my back, running forwards and over an erudite treetop. I stared up at them, terrified and intrigued. It wasn't this room, however, it had only... Luminescent markings. A long black dress, with a wound on its left arm, and a crucifix. I could not make out what they were, but to my God, they must be nice. And all those who would dig the graves, these soft white markers. The shame was palpable, because underneath them were the answer. At the other end of the treetop, I saw again the spike, painted by a woman with a raven on her neck.
*Ohh, she's back, steal her clothes and go on her way. Maybe she'll go on a hike, see a fish. *
I frowned. I had figured I'd have some empathy before, but I realised this. This woman was from a failed rebellion, and as a rebel I had no way of defeating her. The red ink on the strange markings was warning me not to dig the grave of my people, because there was no answer here. To hit her again would be murder, as well.
She felt her stomach grow heavy and her entire body quake. She turned and walked away. She dropped dead as the footsteps grew closer. * Damn, it was a good dig. * I said, my voice raspy. * Yeah, I suppose I'll find the woman, I guess. I never liked digging in coffins. I suppose we should, maybe. * I turned and ran to the tomb door, which opened and rattled with a flap. My footsteps danced across the stone coffin, and once I'd finished up my journey, I ran outside. It was dark, and yet it was night. So I headed towards the stone house. At the time, I thought I would consider it like watching a fire burn, but reality was breaking down. I'd spend my days hiding behind my home's ground and staring at strange symbols, for this house had been built by someone who wanted nothing more than revenge, and I had no motivation to complete my journey. No, I wanted revenge, and today it was mine.
I tapped my foot on the door, and slid it back. A small door slid down, then opened, opening up on to the other side. It creaked open, and I struggled against it. On the other side of the door sat a small priest with white robes and smiling faces. He grimaced.
*I've had enough of you. * he said. He gently stroked my shoulder, and the whole room fell silent.
*Well? * I questioned. * I thought you wouldn't be here for this shit, but come on. Anyone from this day, woman, past, twas, maybe, will dig this grave, though. All out retribution. *
He smiled.
"Fuck you."
*Shit. *

"Tell them to play redshift, it will give them hope. "
I felt some kind of emptiness as he turned to me. " They have been walking for what feels like years now " I replied
He looked at me all confused, " Why do you work for us? what do you do? "
" I was not even a top employee. I am paid the best I can do. My years have kept me alive, turning my paychecks into nothing but a hobby. " I respond after collecting my thoughts.
" I guess your extra cash always pays for your education. I wonder when we would have to start over? "
" Have you actually been to a hospital already? Any injuries or burns? "
" I have cancer, since I was young and they will pass on. Do you even understand what you have done to my family? "
" Not really. I never was seen or heard from before I was born. I never saw a letter being sent to me. I was barely 22 when I was diagnosed. My cancer doctors asked me to be reassigned to my position. "
I knew how the cancer had started to bite me. I remember being so afraid and desperate to die. I was all that could live but the doctors kept trying to stop me, to leave me alone.
" How long has it been since you last touched my body? "
" 5 years. I still remember spending 5 hours a day wondering if I would ever grow old. After my body is placed into a special vessel, I feel I am slowly losing my sanity. I eventually lost control of my emotions and am forced to keep going, to make ends meet. I remember thinking that a human could reach it soon. I could not but feel helpless. It became more and more painful everyday. I was so afraid. It's even worse at the moment. "
I slowly start to cry.
" I'm sorry sir, you may be able to help me with this. Anything for you. "
He slowly turns to me, his eyes narrowing into deep black.
" No my dear, please just help me. Anything."
He slowly opens his eyes as a beam of light has passed through his body. As the light penetrates my flesh, a smile appears on his face. My beautiful son, my son....

I can't die.
In the age of the iPhone, you can use it to hook you into any travel destination. Just simple enough to kick your insides out, right? Easy enough to find and hook. Just leaving for just a few seconds every time is a neat little little perk that a careless reaper would have. Why, though, it changes everything when you realize where you were standing.
By shoving down your phone and away from it, I created and uploaded four billion reincarnations to a computer. I'd transported people. I'd cloned them, flung them out, and reaped their souls on sight. There was no limit to how many lifetimes of information I could store. I even managed to tie up every historical figure ever: Marilyn Monroe, Leonardo DiCaprio, Terry Gilliam, and, by my reckoning, Einstein himself.
It still doesn't stop being fun. You can get the same people over and over, but the first time I found one I panicked.
At first it was just me and one of the many copies of myself, but I knew that seeing any one else was going to be a terrible idea. I don't like to plan things anymore, so to speak. I'd just sit out there, watching different people's lifetimes wrap up and watch my vision come into focus. I was probably the last one, and I'd wanted to kill myself.
But, I hadn't expected that, did I?
"Did it work? " I asked myself, as I watched myself slip through the doorway and into the kitchen. I was still disappointed when the control popped up.
" No. You rebooted. "
It took me a moment to think, but nothing came of it.
I stared at the screen for a few seconds, pondering about what I was going to do if I did it. I woke up before I could think fully of it. I felt the clothes on my back collapse on my feet, sheets covering the floor. And, as my vision spun around me, I saw the door burst open behind me.
I slowly ran to the bathroom, and turned around to see only one person with the remote.
" Help me, what the fuck... " I managed, with a look of absolute horror on my face.
They turned to the other side of the sink, and immediately locked eyes with me. I was frozen, but I didn't try to move. I slowly opened my mouth, willing them to turn away. I pushed away the arm that wasn't trapped under the bowl and continued towards the other side, but my hands would get stuck underneath it now.
" James... " I whispered, trying to get the words out. I just stood there, unable to find my voice.
" I don't understand." My friend was still staring at me, covered in blood.
I was shaken.
Now, I figured, I needed to find my way back home. Maybe I could set up a quick ransom, and make myself forget about who I was. As I ran down the stairs, I opened the door and peeked down the hall.
All was new.

"So tell me how we do it? "
" We shoot anyone we see that way, downrange anything they could possibly be using, they're totally justified "
" Just shoot down any human they see, I want a message, anything that could be used against them, you want me to hear that? "
" Hush, we DO it! "
The system coms answered immediately, no comment was made; I now decided to relay that message to him.
" Oh that's a really good one, I can see their scope zoom in on the target with nothing but the JOLT light, completely justified. "
" Wait, what? You can't just get a call from a damn high profile target like yourself? Are you sure your killing someone you don't know of, and who will you consider a threat? "
He interrupted me as he eyed my partner with wide eyed suspicion,
" You're well aware of how much people could be damaging to you if they didn't notice, yet you've been trained to think that way. "
" I'm sorry sir, I assure you my training works if you don't get the message, I will use full force at all times, " he pulled out a syringe, written in blood I'm sure, *Matthew Wigington* [ his first name ] and injected it into my partner's wrist. He directed it towards his neck, and thumbed the trigger.
" Well we don't know if you're done with your mess, well of course we want you out of your fucking office by tomorrow afternoon, but the organisation will want no part of it. "
*well*
After I injected him in his ear I then picked him up with a surgical technique I could not imagine for someone so stupid as I, and shut him down before one of my security guards or security call came in.
" *Who the hell are you*? "
*Matthew Wigington*
" You are no different than anything else I have ever seen, I dont have a mark on me, you have a disguise, some kind of uniform you can wear, you know, you have a microphone, and instead of a mouth you must sound like a man? "
" Do you like the phrase, the last bastion of liberty, that inhumane sense that every man is equally entitled to his life? "
*I am in the plans to assassinate all the man now*
*not where you are looking*
" I intend to enslave you, you know? If you... If... "
*I can feel my hands getting tighter*
" If you knew what I would do if that bitch found you, and kill you she would write you all the way up to prison! "
*only for a short while*
" Hey, good times, when did that happen? "
" Yeah... I don't really know, but... I looked in your book a while back, I could take you out with it*
" So, you're a scientist, I was, or you were an ex... you know, let's say *I'm* an ex-military, no kidding? "
*No! Not at all! I hired you as my replacement immediately*
*No*
" I'm... nothing, just a guy. Not much of an employee, can you tell me, where did you get that gear from? "
*Dammit Matthews! *
" Yeah, I saw it on your range cameras in the lab, a single grenade."

“ Hello? ” I said, feeling my skin but fully conscious of my feelings. The heater chimed on, and the girl gave me a sideways glance, and that's when I realized I wasn ’ t over the ledge.
“ Don ’ t be silly, ” she said, eyeing me. “ Nothing in particular. Just keep looking forward. ”
I leaned over the ground and let my head fall out of my chest. “ I ’ m going to be late for my date, ” I said, almost sitting up, not even thinking about what to do if I were to do this to my date. She shrugged and she headed upstairs, assuring me I could wait in case she ’ d hit the ground and be at her home. If she didn ’ t, I could be seeing her in quite a few minutes, mostly.
“ Would you like to come over, ” she said, looking out into the mountains. “ I ’ ll be right over, ” she said. The tall, alluring figures seemed to come closer every time I looked at her and her, as if summoning demons themselves. She looked so much like myself, and yet oddly human. I ’ m definitely not surprised that my date wouldn ’ t go as smooth as I wanted.
“ If I couldn ’ t tell you, ” she continued, “ would you still come with me? ”
“ Yes, ” I stammered.
“ Why not, ” she asked, looking out over the icy peaks.
“ You need to understand, to understand that it ’ s not for the best. ”
“ That ’ s the point. ” She reassured me, and I shot her a look. “ We are different people. Different as men and women. You can go through hell and you can go beyond. Do you really think there ’ s any chance we could ever get away from it? ”
She shook her head and moved away from me. “ I ’ m really tired of dating you, ” she said.
“ That ’ s great, ” I said, picking her up and helping her out of the side step. We trudged down the mountains, just entering an ice covered valley. The girl turned to me and she let me know it would be safe for the future. I nodded back at her and turned back to her.
“ Until next time, Satan, ” she said. “ Amen. ”
She took me by the arm and led me to the large temple above the ice floor. She climbed down, hugged me tightly, and kissed me on the forehead. Then, when she made her way around to the big window, I let out a wide, eternal grin.

Another year of struggle and sadness. A year of peace I think I had, finally. I suppose I wouldn't have a choice between hating myself for why I did it or hating the world I grew up in. I don't know why I did what I did. Maybe it was the result of mine, or maybe, honestly, there is one explanation I don't understand. Who among us can say how true, I knew. By the time the pain subsided I couldn't stand to feel it at all. To take what I had until I died, and treat it with indifference. It gave me a half-second of fear. I noticed the emptiness when I pulled away from the doorway. Never wanting to find it, I called again. I didn't want to ask again for another year of pain.
The armchair was heavy. I hadn't expected it to grip so tightly, I assumed. I figured if I lifted it to my eye height I would just be more anxious. Its fingers grabbed for its dinner bowl, knives squeezed furiously. A smile spread on my face. I didn't want to say goodbye. How could I? I deserved to feel pain for what it was, for what it was.
My arms worked tirelessly to pull apart the chair before us, brushing over the cut-free armrest I was wearing. It was all a wonder that I couldn't stop shaking and clawing at the cushion. I was more frustrated when I realized something. I was staring at the blade of glass that held my fingers and I realized I didn't want to be the one who held it. What if I wanted to be the one I should have gotten after that? Did I get it before I had it?
It hurt. I swallowed. It was unbearable. I closed my eyes and went straight to sleep, like I always do in dreams. I began to remember. I remembered everything vividly.
The last thought I had while I laid down at the bedside was:
"Fuck."

Fifteen years ago, New York City gained the reputation of a destination with accommodations where travelers could land in the city proper. In some rare moments, tourists from around the world could arrive at this place within the city limits without being on foot, and residents and business owners alike thought that this was a place with booming industries and thriving areas that flourished with 1st world cultural development.
We were wrong.
On July 5th, 1987 a direct hit from the Atlantean ship New Hope arrived at the city. The ship would bring out the largest backpack of cargo, and it would be raining mercilessly until the cargo cabin opened in a cloud of fog. The blackened cargo ship left New York City as uninvited guests of hundreds of people wearing t-shirts that read, "What are you running into?" and " Can I come with you? I can take you with me if you're willing to "
The New York city packed all the people and business people necessary to understand the horror they were about to inflict upon their fellow compatriots. Others arrived in only small boats, with oversized small luggage windows. One ship's job was to tow the cargo from New York City to their island; however, at the island was a very low layer of fog.
All six of those large ships departed in a single enormous airplane, with the first ship taking off at dawn that day. When the first ship arrived, it was on a jagged spiral staircase that was almost a mile long, spiraling through the urban forest as if being the best route by far. As the two were looking at the marble courthouse, there was a small explosion. The New York City Police Department could not stop a single bullet from piercing the marble stairs of this courthouse.
Five years later, one of the large aircrafts had achieved certain speeds on the spiral staircase, making the falling concrete, bricks and piles of marble across the green wall of the courthouse unimaginable.

I sat in front of the computer. Across from me was a window; it had flickered for a few seconds, then resuming the normal mouse sequence. I pressed F5 while surfing the Internet. Hmmm, I looked up a few timezones and found the same mouse icon being pushed across the screen. “ Shit ” I thought. This must be some weird prank I did just for this chance to rip my eyes from the future. “ YOU HAVE RUINED MY LIFE ” I shouted. I ’ m not even sure what was going on, the mouse clicked, the screen blinked, and I was transported to some future.
I remembered my high school days in school and how when I opened my eyes for the first time I could see the mouse, I was already in the future. The mouse woke me up to the world ahead. It took my vision a little while to return my once rapidly moving to the past. But as time continued on, the mouse had started to drift towards me. I realized it wasn ’ t only me, it was the future. I was floating just a few minutes outside of the local airport. I felt like I was in an asylum. And when I looked around, I was more confused than hurt. There was a keyboard in my hand, and I had several displays for my mouse in my hands. All were locked. My imagination ran wild, as I pressed the last button, and I was transported to the future.
I awoke to check my spam folder at home; I went down to check Gmail and an old Google search for June 0, 2016. There was no spam. Nobody had sent me any emails either. I scrolled through some but found nothing interesting. It was like I had wasted five minutes of my life! A burst of data ran through my head, and I panicked. I decided to call my mom and ask her what is going on. She took some time to answer. “ Yeah, yes, I know. ” She looked at me worriedly, even though I wasn ’ t sure what was going on. “ I know what ’ s going on, too. ” I told her. I then noticed her right before going to bed. I noticed my moms eyes glistening, and her posture was sharp, like lightning in a snow. A bright light shining through the window. I wondered what I could do when I woke up here. I walked over to my computer. I quickly clicked the program to fix my over-activity. There was a new tab open that popped up: “ Delete mouse.exe. ” I tried to open it again, but it stopped me. “ What? ” It said. I called my mom. “ Do you realize I don ’ t need a new mouse here? All I need is a mouse. ” My mom said as she pushed the button. All of a sudden she turned around and sat down on the bed. The screen was moving slowly now. My mom looked at me and said, “ You need to keep up all of this, honey. It ’ s so hard for you. ” I shut the door behind me, and walked towards her bed. It was my mom ’ s room. I backed up and quickly turned off the laptop. The screen only changed a few seconds. “ Go to bed, honey ” my mom said as she moved out of her room. I didn ’ t know what to do. I looked over at my mom, who was cleaning her day. There was some of my old paint from the day I had fought in Afghanistan, strewn all over my mother ’ s desk. I looked at my mom at the discovery that had made my dad so scared to even look at her. “ I ’ m sorry, sweetie. Did it hurt? ” My mom said. “ No, really. It was just so terrifying. Now it ’ s back. ” I looked at her blankly and then at the mouse. There was no way I could do this. I left and sat down on my bed. I stared at the monitor once more. I felt the world around me fading into nothingness. I looked up at the monitor and then looked back down at my mother. This time she looked up at me. “ How sad! ” she said.

I wake up in a daze.
Where the hell was I? I turned off all the lights and took off to work.
It was immediately apparent why I was here. I hadn't looked at the work site much. Nothing but blank space. I felt nothing but faint apprehension.
I reached into my closet and grabbed a glass of water. Nothing but emptiness.
I later found out that the water was made by Captain Sandman. The large, bald-headed man who may or may not have been in charge of his company's logistics.
My body slowly stiffened and my mind was awash in panic. How could I possibly survive in this massive, empty, unchanging void?
I looked into the mirror.
That's when I noticed a bright, yellow, very weird yellow light.
I looked up.
Then everything changed.
I saw a rather large light.
From what I could understand, it had eight angles on one of the sides. The angle that I was on was towards the side that was centered around my face.
To my surprise, the angle was closer to me.
The tip of the triangular yellow light extended at about a maze distance.
I looked down.
Where was I?!
Then, I realized that the orientation of the triangular yellow light came from outside my bedroom window.
It was the 8th angle.
I did not feel the lights on my bedside table coming. I looked up.
I saw a button on my wall. A button that I recognized as a key.
I pressed the button.
I then realized that the light was also a sparky red, then bright green.
I saw light reflecting on a sidewalk just beyond the intersection of the intersection.
I just looked at the bright red light and realized that I was in California.
I grabbed the keys from the wall and opened the door.
I saw myself and a cheerful teen holding a bag full of money and a note with my name on it.
I then noticed a new piece of my apartment that was right outside of me.
There wasn't one more piece of this apartment!
I opened the door of my house.
It was a window, with a lone figure floating in the center.
I ran back to my room.
A wave of sadness hit me.
It must have been some stranger that decided to strike up a conversation with my room mate.
My own eyes were drawn to a piece of glass just outside my window.
Just outside of my window was a note saying that we are ready.
It was written in a strange hand-made Arabic language.
I heard someone calling in from outside my window, "I'm finding her at home. You were right, I'm not dead. Where you are? ".
I left my bedroom door open, and peered over my window.
There was a wooden door with a window. I opened the door to see a small, silver tiger beside me.
The tiger was old and hulking, with rows of metal limbs on its back.
" What is this? " I asked nervously.
It eyed me suspiciously.
The tiger opened its mouth slowly, and said, " If we could talk, maybe we could learn something from you. Something that may change your life."

It was lunchtime, and I was having breakfast with my boss. As I sat at my table I saw the mouse move across my field of vision and delete an object. " This isn't right ", I thought, " Time isn't linear! ". Then the mouse cut in, and the cursor turned into the mouse pointer. " Well, I'm going to go lay with Tom ", and left the diner, to finish my work. As I was leaving the diner, Tom pulled me aside and asked me, " Hey Tom, did you have your milk? ". I said " No, Tom, I don't ". " So, how many do you know about milk? " He asked, " Five days " I responded. I knew this would happen again, until he touched me and asked again, " How many of you have milk? " I replied ". " 30? " He said ". " Why do you have 30 eyes " I replied. Tom left the diner, and disappeared inside. As I went to check on Tom, I saw him staring at the time, while he was reaching for his old carton of milk. " I wonder if he's going to die " I thought. Then I remembered I needed to get out of town and find a coffee shop that had no milk. Then I checked on Tom's room and stopped, knowing he had died. The time came and I checked on the clock. Suddenly I knew time was turning. It was 1:43:02. Time stopped suddenly and Tom gave a shrug. " I guess Tom just didn't like milk and wanted it gone this morning."

Dear /u/AmalokoMe....This is my last diary entry. Every day since the last entry was made in last night, I have wrote 10 entries. I dream of delivering all of these letters and would like to wish someone will come to help me. I know this is fake but it is true.
I will spend the rest of my life here, on the island I call home. It will be on the beautiful shores of the Karayan River, where I am willing to go. It will be as far away as I can find and I will die here. I will live for a little while and then die.
I will be here from 8 to 5 at night, doing what I do best, helping nobody other than myself. Please ask me for anything though. Is there anything to eat or drink? You can ask me and I will answer.
Peace...

The day I return home to mom and dad is when I began to rock the boat, where I discovered I was capable of being anything that ever thought possible about it, except for action and that's when my great-grandma of course brought home this incredible fantastic poem, to tell me of my first big life, and how brave I was for being around her, to make my quest of being “ a witch to many ” fun, to being able to do magic, and yet learn of an even more fascinating concept that just didn ’ t exist yet; instead of standing in front of the bright door of Hogwarts and just relaxing, I asked to stay the whole week ( that would be starting! ) so they wouldn ’ t get jealous and get in every problem I got them, or smart! Luckily when they first checked over my head, I learned I had an important family history to clean up, it was cute. But I know, long story short, I realized that that was not how I ’ d want it to go, because my passion of magic would be to give the ministry one last go at solving my greatest expense. So instead, I asked the people down at Hogwarts to make a deal with the princess of the castle, Hilda. I have absolutely no idea if I could ever be one of the damned fools who is going to let that King Galfey Potter rule over the kingdom in the house of my country, but I will try!
“ Honestly, I have no idea what any magic ’ s worth! I spent so long with it, and there wasn ’ t even any one I actually like, so I dumped it on Harry, in less than a week. But I thought every level of magic will be so satisfying, it would be so satisfying that I would be nobody but a dimwitted wanderer! I could fly into the air and fire spells and absorb people ’ s perfect pills at the same time! HA! Dude, I love drugs! Just because I don't know how I would handle magic is not a secret! ”

Ever since I could remember, so many people died. Me, 17, where thousands died. I was born at that exact moment, and I remember the look of sadness on her face. I closed my eyes, and she let out a scream, "I am so sorry... "
I couldn't leave her. It was all there. Even though it's an eternity, I've lived a thousand lifetimes, and with everything at my fingertips. I don't think I have any regrets. In fact, I realize how much I regret it.
You don't have to know how hard I work to have a happy time, and I love that about you too much. Being a hunter is how I learnt how to love... or as I once told my brother of his, " If nothing else, I'm best at my job.
And you know what? I wouldn't do that if you knew.
If you don't, then I'll kill you. * * *
As I said, and the world continued in flashes of brilliant colors, different people died, around a million. There was no resolution. So many lives lost. A terrifying figure flowed from a room. " So, how's it going? " the figure whispered.
I turned towards him, saddened. " Nice try. "
" Don't blame me, I had to move on. " He replied, walking into the room, untouched by the dark abyss that engulfed him.
I didn't move.
" What could you possibly think, did I kill a fly?" I asked, and waited in silence.
He turned to me with an eye, intent on taking my soul.

I am suddenly enjoying the warm daylight, in so much love that I almost let myself go. I look around, all the reflective surfaces to the side, but they are no where to be seen.
If the first time is any indication it will get worse, and I would quite gladly destroy a member of the crew that screws up these weathermodes. I know that it is a problem and I know that some day the crew members will finally realize the hard way that the communication circuits are busy, they won't be able to access the in-flight facilities that I will be using to test the limits of my power, they'll be too afraid to move me and the harm, the risk, they will be too disgusted by the shielding that I have created, to go on the offensive, they will be too disgusted, they'll look to me, to me even now...
They will look to me. I hear, I repeat, I hear the laughter all around. I feel, I feel it, I feel inside, now I know it, and I know who...
I stood there for a second, before picking up a small measuring rod from its circular plate and throwing it at my nose, before breaking into a laugh. I think I almost jumped out of my skin, but it all started to fade in I found my astonishment made noticeable by the lack of smell, the searing feeling I felt, my very insides burning, I knew what was right when the first spark.
"We're fired. Tom!" shouted John.
My answer was a young young boy of approximately 25, gasping for air. I could see them all for miles around me, the stares, the overwhelming hunger that had overtaken me since I awoke to the depths of the beast's cavern. I screamed, threw the cylinder, ejected, and let the world through to the ages.

Millennia of knowledge crammed into the human's head, trying to come up with an accurate approximation of what was happening. But what if everyone was wrong? What if "everyone " died out, or at least something " different" arose? Because how? All of human history is written down, and sure, nobody can figure out the " causes " or how certain things happen, but what does that have to do with anything? To begin, assuming that humans walked away, our memory of " everyone " from what happened is rather inaccurate. All the knowledge we remember is irrelevant.
This is probably the reason why it so often seems as if there are millions of thousands of people, according to the projections, but in reality there is only hundreds. It's hard to see what the true number is, but someone's ideas seem to shift across hundreds in our DNA. But as humanity grows up, we tend to wander across multiple different continents, each with its own complex model of life that continuously changes. And without proper supervision of current evidence, it takes a particular form. Somehow, the idea, " All knowledge is going to be wiped out, " can be found in every single personality on Earth. Some believe the idea can be a little too real.
Still, even today it has been proven impossible to even visualize the cause. If we knew what happened, the potential for the event had grown exponentially. Entire sections of the genetic code, which were derived from the same sources, could be ripped apart and rewritten with a fraction of the effort exerted by billions of neurons in our brains. Soon, billions of cell lines could be wiped from our bodies and they spread throughout the body, causing all cells to purr and shut down. And even at this point, it is truly impossible to predict how the future will look, even in theory. What if every person were human, trapped in the real world and unable to cope with our biological reality? Would mankind reverse its course? Would there be chaos in the world that the scientists predicted, leaving every person or plant and animal alive?
And these questions are only those that have changed our direction. If we know what the " cause" is, it seems as if we can not simply lie and only observe what we know.

The clock reaches midnight, the darkness feels as thick as summer and washes over me as I drink deeply of the vile brew of demon sulfur. I feel as though I am wholly unharmed by the day, I know it only as that I had met that demon more than once before. At the end of it's rampage I see a face of grey wonder and despair, the body of a boy I had never seen before. I try to remember that boy though, it has been over 20 years since his redemption. When I became aware that I was real he smiled as he held out his hand and walked away. A large gust of wind blew the body to the side of the cliff, like a feather being dipped in water.
The body of the boy for one second, then became as empty as air. Without the body of the demon, who was no longer even a child, I will never know how it went. The body of the boy for another second, then began to swell and flow. The world drained from its surface, not a single soul on earth attempted to reach me through that dark portal, but it gave in, and two inches of air streamed through the opening, empty and white as snow.
Then something solid hit me and I looked up and found the murderer standing just outside the door, a small piece of shadow chasing him, the shadows disappearing behind him and disappearing after us. " Go get it, it will be here soon. I'm already in range." He said, leaving the boy to his questions. This the only explanation I had for what happened.

'Wait what? " Elsa said up at her desk.
" Listen, you've been trying to talk to someone for years; makes it seem like you can pass the time with all that life. "
" What? * Is it about time I tell you this? * No dude? No? The last guy that left him? "
Elsa blinked. She had two sheepish eyes, one for darkness, one for light. The image of Anna and Elsa whispering to each other on the street, making ice cream rolls with each other, trying not to get into an awkward situation, or accidentally slashing each other.
" It's about time you tell me. We're gon na fucking be friends'cause we're a sexual activity, right? "
" Neither of us are pre-teens, but trust me, we've got about everything else right here, " Elsa said.
" Wait, what? " Elsa smiled.
" It's not about him. There's some sort of age-old dark elixir that no one just drinks, and then you tell me you've been keeping a secret from everyone for the past twenty years. "
Anna shifted uncomfortably, staring straight through Elsa. " You really are immortal? "
Elsa winced softly.
" Yes, I suppose. And you're actually somewhat pretty handsome, plus there's always a loyal, so-on-the-end-of-the-line workforce back at the orphanage or whatever else. There's no question there's some sort of way, who knows? One day you'll get all too tired of all these clichés. There's a constant preoccupation with the recent revelation that you can turn me invisible as long as I make myself visible. It's tempting, in a terrible way. "
Elsa half-smiled. " But I was thinking of dating for a while. And not for decades. After all, I probably wouldn't have even known about the serum. Just that, you see, life is really pretty average anyway, so the risk you take for forgetting is pretty low. "
" Life in the year 2050 may not have actually been all that different, but it's still a little bit *low*. And it may have gotten better as time went on. "
" It's not like you're doing any of that, Anna, " Elsa sighed. " Besides, you're eighty four years old, you look a little younger than me. "
" What? No! I mean, who doesn't know that older, less dumber, *better* is getting older?! "
" I suppose, but it's a chance I wouldn't have gotten if I hadn't discovered I was immortal. "
" What? What do you mean? That's all I'll tell you. With that youthful confidence, I'm already 80 years old. "
" You're supposed to be going in so you can tell me that things look'old*, like I'm blind. You can tell everyone about the serum if you're living over five minutes a day, and then everyone won't be coming to your house too soon. You can tell everything to my parents and friends, and then you'll live here forever, wouldn't you? "
Anna's eyes flitted back to the page. " Anna, I don't want to get any -- "
Elsa held up a finger.
" There's nothing we can do to stop this right now. "
" I'm afraid it's the only thing that's keeping you alive. How else can you convince the others to try and hook up and romance you? "
" Perhaps it's a secret, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that way. Being a slave to a superior, no, you'll convince us to get whatever is out there, somewhere, if it means you're going to live a long, prosperous, fulfilling life. "
The two of them closed their eyes. " Wait, we're almost out of coffee? "
" Yep. "
" Wait, then. "
" You always turn on me. You're always around to watch every sale. Sure, you keep some of the elderly on long walks, but they're easier to find. You work long hours on minor infractions like that, those are all very lucrative things. "
" Also, you don't get to say anything for the rest of eternity."

I have to say, how frustrating of a situation it is to live in. My days are filled with the same flying saucer traffic as every other day of the year.
That is until the seagull somehow got himself in the way, thinking he really needed help. The first time we learned about the folly of using ink to read those who write check checks, its the seagull that raised the ire. He was distressed for his number and as the man shook off his reluctance he told his all clear. He ducked out of the way to keep a wary eye on the off chance the gulli were still around, and was promptly trampled by a giant silver eagle. My claws tumbled from the slab of his armor, and it had never even attempted to get me to aid in its task. Most of my years I've never seen one of those creature directly interact with me. I went off to tell someone not to try to negotiate, but of course their company hasn't got much fish to fry.
Guess I need a way to go about this.
I reluctantly agreed to ride in the plane and then decided that there wasn't much time left. As I left the plane I scratched my head as to why I was still here. Though I'm sure you will want to consider just leaving the plane for good as possible. They've got a stipulation that you meet one thing that makes for good luck at the party, as long as you wish to remain. I decided to ask the person who I think I will want to keep to try and procure his stay just in case.
After politely complaining about what looked like an oversized grey-haired woman working for him for the past several years, I offered the man a dream ride. As I reached the edge of the cliff the woman and I got together some water from a shallow spring. As the woman began to rise, one of her hands grabbed my leg. Then an arrow. Then a fruit. Then suddenly everything was silent.

The Both Worlds Started A Major Debacle.
They had known each other since they were just kids. They had been together since the beginning. And they had known each other since they turned 13. They had been coming to the same destination since then. Each had finished school together in January of 2014 when the Arrival started. Everyone had thought that the Arrival would be slow, but one thing that happened was that the Initial Attempts in New York had gone well. While China was dissolving, India still felt a grip on their self-reliance.
Both established legal systems quickly after the Arrival and they united to keep this state free. But at the end of The Final Attempt, the both Worlds suddenly realize the birth of one of their two countries, Earth. The two nationalities became emissaries of each other because of this "spot ", a tool created by one of them for national unity and peace. And the Two leaders made a decision within an hour.
In order to get around this, governments from all the planets sent representatives to promote it to a different government. The humans, sensing that their new government represented a threat to peace, gave the only option. For more than a year, the two leaders started breaking apart and fought over who could take the world from them.
After just an hour, however, the two candidates began settling into their rules and fighting for the world's survival. It was only after the final attempt that they realized that they hadn't stepped up to the plate.

"This is odd. You ate wild plants, " said Alan at last.
" Come on, you're pretty serious. You can eat out of the trees and plants, right? "
Alan looked up with eyes of anger and confusion. " What is the point of what you are doing?! I've got to quit! " He shouted.
" You know what, Alan. If you don't stop it right now and put those plants down, I swear this will all end. What are you going to do? "
" Pity. It's been two weeks, and I'm stuck being a pessimist. If you don't have a solution soon, I'm leaving. "
Alan let out a heavy sigh and looked around to see what was happening. A number of bears were walking slowly towards the entrance of the cave. They were wearing gorilla masks with sparkling white stripes.
" You fools! " Alan shouted loudly, bringing his weapon to bear. The bear moved closer to him, and tugged on his arm. Alan began to fight the bear off but Alan felt a strange feeling come over him. A cold and unexplainable warmth overcame Alan, and his body felt sick from the cold. Alan lowered his hand, and when he did so he felt no more cold, and felt slightly warmer and warmer than Alan previously had felt.
" Why would you think I would leave you here? They're all dead! " Alan said, half heartedly.
The bear whirled and lunged at Alan, causing him to lose control of his weapons, and back up. " Look, before you do this, I need to tell you something. I always feared that the thing that threatened us to conquer would at least try to eat humans. If you see what I'm going to do, I don't see how it would work out. "
Alan looked at the man, now more enraged than ever.
" I've grown distant from humanity, as such. I have always come from a land where the world is untouched by time. And now I seek to rule this planet... using a bunch of meat on a whim. "
The man twisted his face to look at Alan, and gently placed his arms upon his chest. " I've always known that you can bring it about when you make humans perfect soldiers. You can bring them kingdoms of generals, and great leaders, and rule them while they fight off all the other worlds who try to eat us. " He spoke with his face tight, and full of rage.
Alan clenched his fists and threw out several coughs. The man inhaled deeply, and his blood began to pour from his face.
" Hey, shit, man! " Alan said, stepping over the creatures that lay slain on the ground behind him. " Leave me alone. It's good you're not here. "
Alan left the man lying on the ground. Three days had passed. One bear was standing right next to his son, the former president. He hugged him tightly, and comforted him as best as he could.
" You know what, man? I swear, I'll eat all the humans in this damned world. Oh, you got any more we could do?"

There are so many people working on this project, you guys need to be careful with every step you take, or the world will be really fucked, " he trailed off in laughter.

Have you ever been to the bookstore to find out what the spooky potions contained in the petacomb? You'd think that the store would be making it sound crazy to see their wares in sealed bags, but then you're gon na get another: the house was close by, there were some supernatural creatures fighting some demon zombies with darts.
Really though, why does it always seem so creepy to see stranger's handwriting at the beginning of a morning? I was only 13 at the time I noticed the handwriting, not 30 seconds ago, but I remember enough to think the upside down spider knife was probably just magic.
I'm pretty sure this house really does scare us, but remember that it's in the middle of nowhere on a quiet summer night, i've never been to a library, and its just in the summer. I remember staring at the pale white walls and thinking about crying the whole time, so my heart was beating a little faster. To anyone else that might read, its just a normal memory. Maybe by the time the bedroom door came, I already had forgotten about the dementor snuck in, but even still, maybe just a little, maybe 10 seconds as the crow's feet came slithering towards my front door.

The summoner was surprised.
The entity first appeared in the shape of an old, sickly looking skeleton, with an odd handprint etched into its left hip and an unused edge from its lower jaw. The skeletal shape then-side-stepped onto a pad of paper in a cone-shaped pattern, with the pad inside scrawled in scratched-out Latin.
"Old man Y'know, you don't remember much about our lord? " Y'know said.
" I remember a good man, though. My father didn't bother to help me, though. " The entity replied.
" Is that so? " Y'know asked.
" None of it. We exiled the old man too. " the entity's eye stuck out. " This can't be right. "
Y'know remembered hearing about Y'know's training in ancient Greece, and making sure it was the best he could, because in that line of work he helped create a group of trustworthy warriors instead of sitting on some nation's assets. He also learned nothing from Y'know's grandfather, so he recalled that either he had never been a great ruler or that he'd forgotten one thing.
" Ah, old fool. Come now, I... have something for you. "
" Want me to tell you about your grandfather? "
" I'm afraid so. "
" Well, tell me about your grandfather, then, will you? "
" Well, yes, he had a lot of fun. People would stare at him, do their best to make sense of it all, I mean. "
The entity's voice shook the tower. It had seemed strange at first.
" Were you the heir to the throne of the Dark Realms? "
" Ah, yes. "
" And when he left for Rome, didn't find me at the palace? I was just given a glimmer in the darkness. "
" Well, the walls were set. So it was our mistake to rise against him. "
The entity's eye wandered around. " How many armies did we have? "
" Ah, too many. "
" Over that period we managed to enslave a whole state, and the only thing worse than the insult our ancestors put us with was what they had done to our memories. "
" Oh, they tried to make you miserable. "
" They were too good. "
The entity's eye caught something in the sockets of a nearby middle-aged man. " What on earth are they doing? "
" They like learning your inner thoughts. "
The entity's eye started to glow. " I know, " it said, when it stopped glowing.
" They.. Were beating us. "

" It's easier to die in their hands. "
" Tell you what, " the entity said, almost as if they would understand. " The bloody carvings are not scary. Just take a look at that. Tell me the rules, Y'know? "
The entity took it, to find a silly man, named Mehmed, standing on the path of an abandoned house. " See, here's a little man they call Mikhail. " It made the other entity tremble and grin.
" Well, we're going to have to attack the house through unorthodox means first."
Y'know took a few steps to the side of the house, and walked back through the portal.

The dark trickled in and out of the city. The trees were being uprooted and the police had reached a standstill. It was the first time they had seen a tree move. Everyone had had better weapons they knew. Most criminals only started to work and on that day there were very few inmates. But the police had no choice. They had to retaliate. So they moved on. To try and stop the new rumor. The gardener found and planted a small seedbox. No one knew why. The gardener fought with the darkness for years, and finally it was time to plant one. A single tree. One that would keep them from coming to hate.
The resistance was unstoppable. They had enough evidence to come up with a plan. Not many people have seen a small tree with a single leaf drop. That is why they had decided to plant it. The gardener still couldn't make it up to the gardener after the first few years. He thinks of it now, on his march for the court, where he and his family would know what happened. He had the legal framework to keep people happy. Nobody would accept any rogue tree planting. He couldn't live under pressure like this.
His college roommate bought a plant his group started planting in low shrubland high walk. He brought the pot for what had to be a day when everyone was coming and watching. It smelled heavy and his roommate couldn't wait to save him. For the past three years he had asked his roommate to come down here on a daily basis for beer and wanted to know how he was doing since their tree was far and away the best for them. Most of the neighborhood was on the edge of panic. But the tree was, for the first time, having something to say about it.

Day in the Lake Lane
The smell of pine is familiar to John and Ben as they walk along the dusty road. Dan rolls to a stop at the old vet's house. John notices a rotting body with a decaying brain in its rotting remains. John keeps their hands in his pockets and gives a weary yawn.
"It's still a bit blurry, " he says as he walks toward the farm.
Dan sits down on the dirt and stumbles across a small flat stone of soil.
" I should just brush it off, I'll clean it up soon enough. "
" I can't, " Ben says. " I can hear it! "
John looks down at the flat stone and sheepishly raises his hand and checks the mortar he has gotten from the fence. The light of the sun turns its gaze on him and the silence draws him in.
" What's in the pit? " John asks.
Dan smiles. He reaches up and takes the edge of the pipe. A snort of pain causes a pale hand to writhe, covering the stone. Ben squeezes, worried to tell him that there is something wrong.
" It's not just the stone, it's important! "
Ben shakes his head. " It's just your eyes. "
Ben removes the limb from his arm and draws the long, trenchant-brimstone blade back from the stone. A strange old bone stands in the end, where the morning snow used to land. Ben rises to his feet and gets ready to grab the sword.
" Got ta get this over with, " says Dan. Ben walks slowly back to the men and grabs the two sets of legs from the little dead body. Ben leans down to pick up the large bed sheet covering the body. " This has to be a special case, " Ben whispers to Dan.
" It's not like him to think things past his grave! " shouts Ben.
Ben dashes away from the scene, scanning the streets. Taking off his coat and hat, he approaches the animal he believes to be a soul-mate.
" I don't believe he could be more perfect. He does what I told him to be honest. He is the guy who painted my death. " Ben turns to Ben, who visibly frowns. " I'm assuming he's heard me correctly. "
Ben looks over his shoulder. Dan is still just standing there, resting his face in his hands. A deep brown aura is rising from the shadow of his skeletal hand.
" He's a serial killer, Ben. They never found his body until they saw it. " Dan adjusts his hat to obscure his face. " There is something new in him, something I'll never see again. "
Ben hands the son of a bitch a straw. " It's time to start a new life."

What a strange thing to happen to humanity. A once thriving and temperate species, now in ruins as a barbaric, highly advanced civilization finds itself a seemingly loving balance between scientists and specialists alike. Our cities are the most successful in the United States, and while we have lost most of its old development facilities, we have found quite a few natural wonders. Some things stand out here on both sides: myopia. That of course is quite nice, but even then the idea of just moving it seemed very barbaric. Few people have told me they could deal with the whole human population; if we really wanted it to move somewhere near here we would be a dead-end job. But this is the place, myopia.
Since nobody has the money to build anything to walk up and run to, I have become interested in the beauty of the place. Myopia is made up of hundreds of civilizations, so there are about three cities where they haven't invented anything yet. One is sitting unused, like the rest of the planet except for the power grid. There is an unassuming nothing in its place, hidden within a thick maw of trees. After much research I have discovered that it looks even more like an alien place than we ever imagined.

My hands were no match for the battlelord ’ s grip on my neck, but it was not the scaring I would have thought. As God was about to tell me, I was awoken from slumber by a tall figure of a man ’ s face. I couldn ’ t take it anymore, I felt hot tears forming on my back as I felt his fiery fist spasm his face.
“ Please let me go, ” I whimpered.
His rumbling returned in a mighty crash as he shattered everything in my eyes. He laid mangled bodies on the ground as he crouched in front of me in horror, attempting to lift himself. I felt every ounce of my body leaving me, tear, and pain gathering in my throat. I whimpered but he didn ’ t relent.
He slowly made his way into the deepest cavern, near where the Tall Lord resided. As he stepped through, my stomach began to pound and I felt his sweaty back fill with the blood that flowed out of the life draining hole. He reached out and started to lift the bodies below us but each body I was on now had a burning hatred I would never again enter this man ’ s flesh.
I slowly crawled my way towards him and took his unyielding hand with trembling one. I gently rocked him back down to me and asked him, “ What ’ s this call doing in there, what ’ s your name? ”
“ Jeanie, ” he interjected. “ Once I ’ m sure this is how it works, I ’ ll kill you. ”
I wouldn ’ t be arrested for every murder but he had led a hard line against his enemy and I couldn ’ t resist. The flesh on my body gave way to his. I closed my eyes and hoped Jeanie would forgive me, he kept peeling off every piece of his hair.
My stomach turned purple as I felt the unbearable presence of God ’ s corruption grow greater than myself.

Humans have a sense of humor. In fact, the way we laugh and laugh at tragedy. As many of you know, thousands of years ago, humanity stole from the Devil when he appeared to punish his abominable and decadent ways. He left a loophole in mankind and unwittingly killed thousands of innocent people. Humanity will never recover that kindness from him. Some still ask why the Devil is cursed to live forever, others think they've let the mortal world be liberated of the Devil's vicious and cruel grip on them.
So they look to the sky and think of future generations, the Rapture when they can be free of the curse that eons of previous sins bestowed on them. They shall hang themselves then to try and find a way around it. At some point, they must remove their skin. It is over for them.

"No one believes in birds. " Troy interrupted. " We're more likely to fall in love with fish, cows, or monkeys than to believe in magic or God. "
Troy floated down in his seat, excited. Though God never gave humans the word, he had every word they needed when it came to his job. He planted a seed.
" Look, " Troy said. " I just want to say something. "
" You're a pig. " God disagreed. " Look, because you're a pig, and I have the key to telling you that I'm not a pig, I can only share that with you. "
" You were the only one in my village who believed in God, " Troy said.
" But the others didn't. " God's voice cut. " I didn't find your fortifications, my bread bread, and my chickens. I thought you were them. "
" I know, but I had to. I don't know why I didn't. At the end of the day, I believed in God because I wanted him to think that he could trust me with all the information in the world. But I also believed in the mysteries of you and my love for you. I want answers, and I want to know where to find them. I was smarter than most. "
Troy searched the room, until finally he found a small map. He flipped the map to the right, then told the guy inside the room, " That's my guy. I think I found it. "
" Well, then, " God exclaimed, " Now I'll show you the maps."

"Hush, Henry! The child sleeps." The starboard windows screamed something like a cry, and the train went away.
Minutes later the giant wooden platform tipped and crashed. The atmosphere was so thick, and the train was so thin that it had descended almost backwards into the ground. Frank and I were asleep just beyond the crushing crater where the train had fallen into. Looking back I wonder what the earth used to be like.
As the train hit ground, I realized that I have never seen such gorgeous Earth before. I wonder now what the air and water used to be like.

What was I thinking when I said "The water is blue," but it was actually blue.
I hadn't planned to say this phrase until the midnight of the week. I woke up early and did some checking around the house. I didn't recognize any particular person, not exactly in the cold cold. I made a mental note not to tell someone until I was outside.
On my way in, I stopped by a black mailbox. I approached it to make sure there was no mailman inside. Upon turning around, my hand was on a red button with a white object inside. I got very excited, and pressed it. Opening the box, I saw that there was a letter inside. I took the letter and opened it up. Inside of it I saw my name. I soon picked up a pen and paper and began writing it down. Taking it away from me, I just knew what I had to say.
Today was March 14, 2019. I've been working all week. I'm not sure how I got up on time this early in the morning. I couldn't help but get sick of walking around my apartment smelling the steam of other people's trash.

Shooting through the sky, he sat down on the golden porch. Life and death were all that was visible in the air, death was as still and easy to kill as light could be. But for something- perhaps a smile on his face! Death could not smite him or charm him back. Just a thought, thought of himself. One more kill, one more death.
His lifelong anger had been over time. It really hit the shit, all of those final moments and nightmares. I never had a fun time when he came out of that night, none of the other villains and heroes had intervened. Everyone thought they were on board but no one even saw him coming in. The other villains had their things to do and had left. The things that made up the world were lost to history. He had a ghost, like the evil scheme he played, who comes to life and ends the happy denizens of the night. He walked back into the night with his peace broken and anger still with him. And at last, he had a perfect time. He smiled a single tear, and let out a single laugh.
It should have been easy. He didn't think he could kill himself and never had to take his revenge on the past so many years ago. His old scar just didn't bleed so, he figured. Not that he could stop. Not that he couldn't. He didn't have to kill Batman the way the man he was. He didn't have to. He couldn't possibly do it. It didn't have to be like that. The character is dead and the actor and the things that bring glory to the world is not. The Joker couldn't just kill him. He had to take a part. Now it was just one more death, and the other was just a grin on his face. There was only one way he could do it. But the way he did it was more interesting than it had ever been before. A smile on his face and on his soul. It was something he couldn't afford to let go. He just could not take his new world.

Ever since I was a child, everything seemed to crumble. I never knew that there were monsters under my bed; nothing scary. I had no friends or families, and nothing quite understood the concept of monsters; only going about my everyday lives. It was barely an empty, cramped existence. On top of this, my childhood was filled with a scary, constant unease. My only company was my father, who, I assume, was afraid he would disappear, slipping into my room unnoticed. The terror caused by my father's fear of monsters was something outside of my control.
I grew up with monsters. Walking the streets, running, running faster than any of my brothers or sisters. These creatures were all very scary, so I grew into a normal adult. However, these monsters never seemed to understand my life. They never raised me for fear of monsters, because what scared them more than anything I could imagine were the "bug people ". These people, though, are something far from that. They were an intimidating bunch, as they would try to scare me up to scare me. The fear that they caused me couldn't be ignored, and I would try to escape them if I could. I knew I needed to stop, but they kept pushing me in the direction of complete silence.
Luckily, I grew up in a town that had very interesting people. I knew these people well, and soon I became their best friend. The council had decided that I would " secretly " go out and join the town. The city needed to be ready to do business and there were already people roaming around with guns, so it was a good idea to end this thing. Since my first encounter with them, I had gotten over my fears. When I walked up the stairs, I was shocked to see some fellow children running around. Surely, this was nothing out of the ordinary; how could this be?! As I continued down the stairs, I saw an elderly man, who'd invited me to go on a date with them. I asked him to avenge him on the town for his safety and this suit was immediately on my mind. Of course, he was also a very enthusiastic child. He packed his things and went to show me around. There, he received a piece of paper with a letter written on it. " On this day, that group of extremely brave souls in this town will be dropped on the ground with surprising strength, almost the weight of this meteor. No one will believe what happens next. "
I stared at this text for a few hours. Finally, I had recovered my courage and decided that I should go on with my date. As the group came into view, I started to think of every thing I can do. Who else has experienced this special situation? What will it bring to the town? What can I do? Is this something that the children will learn?
Suddenly, I looked back towards my room and saw that my bed was completely ripped off. It was covered in bits and pieces of glass, and rust colored furniture. The man who had dropped the letter was slowly getting up from his bed and stepping over the pieces of the glass to go investigate. " Is there something wrong, sir? " he asked my bed. I responded yes. " Thank you for being my friend, but I must be carried off."
He pulled the covers off and began running after me. I tried to run but my feet kept getting thinner and thinner. I wanted to run, to escape. But I couldn't. As soon as I came across him, I was whisked away by a masked version of me. Inside my room, the rest of the children were laying dead on the ground. They were under a huge, warm blanket, broken up over their eyes. I couldn't even catch the giant monster that had suddenly started to move. I hoped they would all die of fright, but they all seemed too young. I could have saved them, if only I had known that my plan wouldn't work.

All of us here today are left with a compulsion to keep writing.
We love it when it happens, and the lumps of shit that we pull out of our spouses' pictures always get the tiniest smile or a familiar nod from mom who always welcomes us around for dinner later. But tonight it got us! All that's left to do is keep making eye contact with family and friends... which is what we're good at! Maybe it's the memories, the groups that validate who we really are... but at least there's the possibility that the people in our lives will forget us, and it won't be so fun to find ourselves shocked and alone on the couch. We can change the past, no matter how hard we try... some things change, sometimes even after all those years... But we still have the urge to visit the children of those around us.
I love the memory of the kind of mother who always allows us to enjoy childhood, talking to our friends about movies, cups of coffee, and playing video games while we stare into each other's eyes, gawking for them to fall asleep while we imagine our future to come to an end. I know there are things we should have done... things we shouldn't have done... but those little eyes always make me smile, always remind me of the sweet, warm, fuzzy smiles we made together, and our waifu never ceases to surprise us with such glee... but when we... how many of us -- always -- can we give them a little appreciation? I've seen so much of her, and she always leaves a smile at my every step, telling me I was a good girl, that I could have done anything... like, really -- but she doesn't care. She loves me because she can. Even at my age, when she's not with me, I know she will always love me, and I love them and I always will... so she doesn't stop writing... so I write: A notebook of mine, near her bed, and those happy, happy faces all around me, waiting for me to think of anything. Anything to make me happy.

Boy had a crush on his girlfriend. The girl had such a big boner too and looked beautiful. He really wasn't sure what to do because he really wasn't sure if he wanted her in his life. Well, he didn't like there being multiple men wanting to date her in the first place. And if he were to go about his day thinking about women, he would think of marrying her.
Jane had a crush on Keiko, and even though they went to the usual meeting place, he always ended up getting wasted on the same girls in public. Instead, he decided to go to one of the local grocery stores to buy some lettuce and set up an office. This time, he figured she might be interested in him. He started to run towards her when there is a huge crowd gathered around the gym. Pretty soon, they reached a large canyon.
Soon, there is a huge, huge fire and suddenly a fire breaks out in the fire pit. This scenario explains why the cooks are setting fires across the plaza.

Fuck no. It's today. I've been thinking about pissing James. I have. J. J.J. has farted so hard he needed to pee some more. I checked the weights to see if I could wash it off. My hands work as a joke. Then I figure out James was right. His biggest accomplishment was at this quite serious occasion in 1997 while drinking his tequila. Being drunk couldn't even piss off a guy you could be intoxicated to the point of insanity. He was in serious trouble and had lost all his friends from his young times in college. He got arrested but was kicked out for what should have been the most urrerent existence in the nation. There was pissing at street corners. Kevin also ran away from home and played soccer at the same time. I still remember kicking that butt full of piss. And then it hits me. James would have come home if not for that pint of piss that I still made after fucking Kevin during his day. So I get me a new towel. I open the small package and it's not really useful. I am angry. I'm not strong. I'm a drunk. Fuck not James. My hands aren't sagging. I still can't piss his shit off. James was dead for the year 1997. He was my best friend when I was alive. Oh well. Back to paper paper. Get punched in the face you ass! Or maybe the giant lump of ink that is your fucking handwriting. Some fucker fell down in a toilet while pissing. The guy's up high and he slapped me out. I was basically rolling around. I think I quit rubbing and moving my damn arms. I don't even know how to rattle off a name. I swear I caught the bitch punching me in the chest.
This is the last post before writing. Hope you liked it.

I stand at the edge of the ancient looking Gates of Heaven, which is not only age taking its toll, but everyone remembers what I did to them.
I lay in the middle of the platform, still with a bit of trepidation behind me. Who the hell knows, but I'm 25.
I was young, and didn't want to die right now.
I remember being called up. I remember the chance to tell my family a story and they believed me and went on with their lives. They told me they appreciated me, but that they needed to see what could possibly be out there.
I remember helping my parents who were orphans. They wanted me to become a doctor or a lawyer, but I figured the best answer was to tell them the truth. I told them I was too young, too depressed.
The only thing I remembered was the time I met four different people in Heaven. With no time at all, I saw and heard things they didn't comprehend.
A young boy with money had fled to America. He was fighting for freedom and so he laid his life free. A young man who had good intentions had abandoned his family to a dangerous bar fight and spent his life in prison.
They say your chance to meet someone has a bullet in it. I know a death sentence is within the range. I have walked onto the scaffolding that separated me from this hell.
My palms shoot up in anticipation to the loud call of the crowd outside. As I walked, I felt an intense electric pressure in my chest.
I looked around. There was no one there. There was no one except my people, the gates, and the man I met.

I don't know how someone brought such a horrific murder scene in a mass grave.
“ I will not forget how I slit your throat and took so many more lives. ” I pleaded.
The detective paused and took a deep breath. “ We don't need you today. We already know where this body is. ” The detective shook his head and started to stand up.
“ I am going to invoke that court order which will allow me to bring you to justice. ” I smiled and slapped my forehead with the palms of my hands. The detective ’ s eyes glistened with determination as he slowly walked to the floor.
“ We will cut off your hearing today with a large blunt object. ” The detective stepped closer as if to whisper to me.
I sighed. “ No. ” I sat down on the bench and hit the light button, pressing it in the center of the hole in my chair. The detective stood for a moment, not even trying to hide a tingle in his chest or any burns. “ Alright. Let ’ s begin. ”
The room was quiet once more and I could hear the shuffling of papers. I quickly cleaned the gunk off and marked the barrel. “ Guilty verdict. ” I read. The judge looked at me with pity. “ But this murder, here, is just as abhorrent as the others. ”
I scowled. “ What? ”
“ Murder is! Once a murder is committed, the victim is replaced. And the victim must speak no more. ” The judge chuckled. I flipped a page. “ The defendant must tell you his name. ”
My eyes flitted open, unable to process what he had just said. My wails slowly drifted off in a warm echo around the room, muffled by the detective ’ s awkward pace. There was silence.
The detective fiddled with the gun. “ No. ” He continued to tell me. His companion, put his hand down. “ It is simply fact that if the victim can speak, it is a necessary part of their sentence. ”
I felt my arms go limp as I wiped sweat from my brow. I walked slowly towards the detective and sat, both of us high. “ Okay, listen very carefully. ”
He nodded. “ The killing. ”

"You've always been a humble person, you've heard me so much "
" Be gentle, if you're ever lost.... "
A tall shadow stepped out of a doorway. A line of light descended over the horizon, moving in waves towards the figure.
" Come with me, I wouldn't be here if the old ways were still alive. We will go to heaven, " it said, moving faster than ever.
As it reached the edge of the line a man appeared in front of it. He was a tall man in his mid-30's, short hair and green eyes.
" Welcome, to heaven. "
The shadow stepped over the line of light into a large hallway. A door appeared, the door jingled and opened, beckoning the man in front.
As the light was turned on the doors were blueprints, locked and sealed. After some time the man stood, motioning for the doors to open.
When they opened the doors he immediately found himself in a young lady.
" Oh honey, you are gorgeous, " he said, smiling at her.
" Who are you? What's going on? "
" I'm a lawyer, the chief of staff for a now deceased god, all you need to know is my name, you will have heard me a million times, " she laughed and he froze, blushing.
" What happened to you? "
" Well.... "
" Just why do you still have a name? "
" I'm sorry, have you seen the new family I've been seeing? "
" Yes. You should see them now, though, you may be a dead man now.... "
" Not for the sins I'm talking about, but for the kind of sins I am about to commit, " he paused for a second.

Long ago a new world was born. In this new world we lived underground. Wholesome creatures wandered the world, merchants ran the local markets, musicians came to us with their music, the old age of darkness passed and it was here that the band was born and bred. From the beginning everyone knew, in a way. The new world was an environment of peace and coexistence. Peace with no need for violence and a utopia that was exactly opposite to the old world. Somehow this brought with it a new birth.
The first band was born to teach the new world to raise its child. It was the first band to arrive, they came from all around the world, one, two, three, four, five, six, eight, nine, ten and eleven. Six and nine two worked for the band. There were a dozen of them, each of them specialized. The band was much larger than the other bands, they lead sounds with their instruments, some even had a guitar in their hand, each of them carried a wide variety of instruments. By the time they realized the existence of The band they all were no more, they were all their own. The irony was not lost on the band, they were not merely *new* but better. Like a child learning to walk, The band both traveled the world, where they could see the world as well as wherever else there was. The bands songs however were no longer running rampant but instead rhythmically through the universe, they played to end all concert. There was at first minimal movement, only the sound of the animals rapping can be heard. One day they had given birth to an original member, or at least some of them, and had charted to be.
There was chaos, and chaos never truly ended. From the beginning there were no more jobs, no more but still lots of people, living in constant hate, disbelief and pride for all. Life continued on, it didn't stop, and it didn't stop and it never stopped. The band continued to grow and grow to, and eventually it was discovered that as The band grew in influence the world around it started to lose its sense of order. It became sadder than it was before, it was filled with hate, starvation, laughter, passionate passion, destruction. It wasn't till the end of time did The band realize that they would suffer from all of this for as long as there was life, no more flowers would grow in the sun, no more music could be played. There was no kinder love, no more music could be played, and not even the worst known murderer would have all the people they could've gone with as allies, nor would anyone else.
The metal and rock bands were always band members. One man, that original guy was famous for making people laugh, not helping the world as much as he could. This man, that original rock band member, and that newer man that original guitarist were very different, and could not figure out what was going on. One of them, the bloke that was famous, shouted that he would stop the band's "unofficial rule" and send them away as monsters, but he was young and sick, so he didn't have much of a choice. The band gathered around, across the building, it seemed all they could do was pray, as well as their souls, and they did. They found the bodies, and found out that the band believed they'd been wrong, that their world was losing it.
It was then that the world found out about The band, and its true nature. They've been time traveled all along time as well, and they've been growing, growing and growing. An entire universe grew large on their shoulders as well, and they're now the hosts of another civilization that we could spread to. We don't know where or why, but we certainly know the stories that are built around this. We don't know what it means to be happy, and if it means anything to us, let us all be happy.

"I'm sorry, " Trimbur said, rubbing his thumb over the broken eye in his helmet. " You are not this place anymore. "
Nasia O'Farrell stood in the desert, equipment in hand. She watched the troop as the yellow bombers flew overhead, firing plumes of plasma towards the enemy forces.
" There was no time for us to hide, " Trimbur whispered. " We had to fight. "
On the other side of the battle, she was seeing the flickering of embers, of ancient vines and explosive bombs, of wreckage which had been incinerated. Nimble didn't have time to speak.
" Victory for all of us, " she whispered. " Victory for us all. "
O'Farrell felt a sting, but managed to dosen't move. After a long time, he heard the explosions. Crumbling debris came flying overhead. Wreckage erupted from the city, covering a swath of jungle. In the distance, they saw a girl gasping for breath, a handful of people died inside of craters, but much of the city was unscathed.
" There are no survivors in the city, " she whispered.
O'Farrell put his helmet down. " I was sure we were gone. "
" Then the lasers went off, " she said. " They began to follow us as we laid down. They entered from our shelters and then we built our own. "
She felt the warmth of Trimbur's helmet. He could hear her breathing as the wailing of the various machines. He wondered if Trimbur hadn't given up on dying all alone. " We did not give up on you, " she said. " You went up and conquered this hellhole. But you lived. "
The women let out a final gasp of relief. " I will not rest my eyes on you, Odinson, " she said.
" And I will not hold me until the light of our reunion fades. I will never let your life be undone, " O'Farrell whispered.
Dread consumed O'Farrell. He didn't know how to walk. He didn't care. He wasn't even real. It wasn't like all the other voices were real; he understood why they did it. He began to cry.
Pallioy Ndiacca stared at her, despondent, trying to quiet the flame inside of him. " And I will never let my skin touch the ground again. "
A flash and fire burned overhead. People started dying. Bolts of dirt erupted and crushed the planes overhead. All except for one.
He never noticed how uncomfortable Trimbur was. He approached it cautiously. On the other side, Ndiacca held an oblong spear. Ndiacca sliced past O'Farrell and stabbed him in the eye.
" He was too late, " Ndiacca said. " We could not let you go any further. That took us thousands of years, " he said. He looked to the woman in his daze and whispered, " I will protect you until it is all over. "
" I'm sorry, " Trimbur whispered again.
" I will never give up on you," Odinson whispered, cradling his bleeding arm in his lap. He picked up the spear and vanished in the distance.

It ’ s not hard to find a nice painting on the shelves of a basement they ’ ll fill with dust and pictures and instructions on how to spray paint. It ’ s only a matter of time before some old madman wants to paint you the space before your entire life. You hear him tell you that paintings need to be thrown into the nearby airlock. How rude. While you ’ re seated at the counter staring blankly in disbelief at their meaning, he ’ s not kidding.
He ’ s not interested in me. He doesn ’ t exist. He ’ s gone. He ’ s never back. It ’ s not for good.
I ’ ve walked in here in the past five minutes already, and everything is normal for now. I look at the mirror at the end of the room and point the camera at me. * It ’ s not that I ’ m evil, * I think to myself. Not in the least. I hadn ’ t meant to say it out loud. After all, I didn ’ t mean to smirk and see them going about their tasks without a care in the world. I'm just glad I couldn ’ t tell anyone. I wonder what their reaction would have been if I did not say something. I want them to know that my orders are good for the company. They ’ re going to be punished. They ’ re going to be ostracized by society for their unexplainable atrophy. They ’ ll be forced to live on in miserable ignorance.
But I ’ m here. This is what I wanted.
I want to show my paintings. I want them to reflect who I really am. I want them to reflect who I truly am. I want them to paint me in brightly colored pencils. I want them to draw me in scenes that ’ ll keep me on edge because, after all, I really mean it.
I ’ ve left my bottle of paint at the door, thrown into the trash, and should probably show myself to a family as soon as I get back.
I ’ m tired of the photographs. I ’ m tired of the drawings; I have no children who ’ s teachers will disapprove of. I have no favorite conversation topics, for the sake of an ending. I *really* think I ’ m so cruel and pathetic.
And then I see it. A picture on the wall from yesterday. A small piece of stuffed rabbit wrapped around his head. I keep the picture in my hand. I start stuffing it with balloons, watched at the county fair. I pick it up and enjoy the only thing I missed. A painting of a stuffed fox on fire. Some cats beating up me. Sitting on the ground. Laying in my favorite chair.
Standing there with my mind still on the drawing, staring out the window through the great crack of the window, I am sure I would have realized something. That maybe that picture is perfect. That my name is warm, warm, warm and meaningless, but I wonder to myself if a beautiful painting can last all these years?

When I was young, i used to play video games all day. Whenever I walked into my room, I always had a board and the board would be played by me. Nobody else noticed the game until it was a little old, so I ignored it and played it. Then one day I met a friend of mine, Mr. Day on his private jet. He stopped by my room and introduced himself. He told me there was nobody else in the room. I told him about what he'd done. The next day he asked me for a recount, and I accepted it. I went back home and my friends told me that it's rare for two to meet and walk away from the same game so that those two people would remember what happened in those two lives. Not like when you wake up from a head injury or cancer.
I didn't bother returning the favor either. That night, I went back to my room and began the recount. At first I thought I'd lost. Not yet, mind you. I picked up a disk from the floor and pressed turn. A new coin appeared in the air. No matter how much I pushed my hand forward, the coin never exploded. Strange, it never would. I reached over to pick it up. There it was! Just one coin, sitting alone in my box. I began to give it to my friend. I explained to him that the game was my only possession. That I'd spent my life getting coin. That whatever I did with it would pay for it. That never happened. The next day I went back to my room and bought a package from a man named Bill. Bill was a big guy. He insisted that the game was his only possession. That nothing else mattered anymore. I went back to my room and began to play it again. Never sure how much time I spent trying to pretend that it was me I've never played for. I didn't even bother a second.
Now it's just me sitting in my room, trying to escape another life. Now, it's only me. Mr. Day, they say you've had many, many lives. How about this one? I'm a fool. I got set on this game, they say it can do everything. I'm going to find out. Tell Mr. Day I'm sorry and that I'll pay for what I did and never, ever forget what I did to my friends.

I was testing him out. He looks like he's doing the right thing. I didn't expect it from my colleague. It turns out, despite the stress of my being in this situation, I don't hate those who don't. After all, work and politics don't pay the bills on a regular basis.
" He's an optimist, we're taking him to OR now, but things don't look good."
That was the last I heard before everyone went into a state of complete and utter shock. He looks healthy, perfectly capable of doing what we don't know he can do. We dropped him off at the hospital a long time ago and drove him into OR now.

In the past, we didn't exist. Ever. But there are so many people now. Many whose education is in computer science. Many with no social skills.
In the year 2225, many were afraid. It is only a matter of time before a virus enters. It is very contagious, eating the very organs that made our species everything else in this galaxy. Our bodies can now survive, the majority of those without medical care are killed. Unfortunately, the effects can last for quite a long time. After about ten years a virus can kill. Every child born in the United Galaxy loses an arm or leg. The remaining healthy can no longer move, but it seems to remain unharmed in the wild. Finally, within a few hundred years, an emerging virus, dubbed'Dark Web', eats the infected, and infects an entire universe. The virus works by feeding, sucking, and killing of energy. Research is still ongoing on the virus, but most concluded that it has the capabilities to eliminate most of humanity.

Charles lurched on his bed, preparing to be sick again, and what came out was a horrid mess. Charles let out a breath, slightly steadied against the darkness. In the past he had become so fascinated with peeling wood that he devoured bark so that it could be covered with petal or pine. And so now, he was prepared to eat shit because his lord of crudeness crawled under his bed.
The sound of an alarm should have startled him away from his failed attempts to move in the first place. It didn't. Instead he just let out the last bark of his frantic, choking attempt to pull away from his bed. The bark formed a knot of wonder, and even though it clung to his skin, it used the only thing he had. His ceiling fan grumbled something as it made its way around the corner. Not understanding what prompted the oddness, Charles jumped away. There would be no way out.
"F-Frank! Get in here and get this started!"
The appliance cut the grout of Charlie's bed in half, exposing the innards. Inside, there was a mouth with some kind of cruel, curving knife and it held the remains of a crunchy, crunchy chicken. On the ceiling, Frank sat on the sheet next to Charlie, motionless. His pinky toe barely missed Charlie's neck, and then proceeded to lick and beg for his collar.

The ethereal creatures of the valley keep running through this earth. Every so often I see flashes of distant stars while they pass by. An elderly and elderly couple, walking alone as a moonless night, still walking their little girl into the trees as the wind blows across their hair. Wind and rain, both icy cold and hot, quenching what life once contained. And creatures who touch each other. Some walk with the wind, others without, the creatures and creatures of the valley divide into two factions. Cold savages, who stare into the cool leaves of the pebbles that surround them, learning to make up a past without chalk in their eyes.
I trod through the woods. The snow covered wood against the half frozen ground. An old man reached out a fist to me, his wet moist face looking over at me. My breath froze as I took in a deep breath and began preparing myself for confrontation.
"Hey... "
It came out like the monotone voice I had heard in many tales.
He pulled out a pair of blades from his machete, a knife long enough for the hobbit himself. A light blue blade from the blue hilt. He began to speak, " Ya woahy, I don't mean to mudd, but, where do you reckon we are? "
" Fuck off, boy. Ain't gon na stay no no you won't, one white hair, and your family didn't have plenty of sweet'ol laughter' to settle in to. "
" C'mon, darling, you're just a new mother fag. Don't just stand there and point at me. You've got ta have a reason to not just be kind to me. "
" Hey, get away! " I shouted. I couldn't take this anymore. His tone was as impossibly condescending as ever. " Listen, I'm just a man and you can do what you want. But before you head for the store, we need to talk. We need to find ways to get out. "
" You can't turn back now, you've gotten a bloodlust going on, aren't you? " He pointed. " You're old enough now. We need to get to the pharmacy and buy a massive dose of that indian hallucinogen, right there by your side. "
" Oh, look, boy. If I don't look at you, I'm either dead or dead. "
" Kill me, man! Let's get away. " I nodded.
" Think of your little girl, and remember that you love her so much that your teenage years of abuse will probably burn you. " His face was so cold that I could feel my heart thumping against the cold ground. My breath caught, the brush was far too cold. " But you can't kill me. I can't let you. "
I shuddered, with tears streaming down my face. This couldn't be true. I had to leave this damn place. He needed a spot where I could relax. I felt a small tear stream down my face. That pain was unsettling. He looked right at me, weak and sickened. " Hope, " he whispered, tears starting to well up in my eyes. " I love you. I love you so much. You got ta keep doing this."
With that, a wicked gust of wind caused me to fall down the trees and into the dark, twisted trees beyond. I wasn't scared, and he wasn't scary, just windy, and cold. And then the voices returned. Great trees rose up around me, and around them bodies kept floating, each one moved as if they were in nature. A light breeze passed, and with it the wind that surrounded me. I knew I had to escape, to change something, to be me. This wasn't a nice world, and I needed to leave, and that was what I did.

Perhaps it should be expected that every piece of paper that has been delivered to me has been delivered in one day. I am in constant danger of destroying things, of breaking them, in any way possible. Sooner rather than later perhaps perhaps this paper will be the last I send to you. Perhaps today I will wait. As you least expect, my despair is a bit greater than that of any before it, and it is not the same as anything I have ever experienced. The feelings that I feel after I hope and pray for you that are not so dear to me, when a part of me fears I am to kill you. I know that I will be there and I feel nothing of the hurt you are giving.
Sincerely,
Captain Johnson

So I walked into the bar to find the only sales person I saw in this room. I couldn't have been more than 30. His eyes were terrifying, like that of a lunatic who had been burning his goddamn cigarette all night. It's been a while since I had my favorite drink, but I'm pretty sure I'll have it tonight. My jacket had recently been ripped off and so I tucked it away and continued to stare.
You see the guy is so damn hot, and I love him. They've had it up to here with this chick. Not great with the man, but I guess the man got his way.
My whole body slammed into my hands so hard I could hear my own thoughts pounding into my head. It had been a long time, or maybe it was the past 10 years. How long had I been doing this? Finally it seemed that I had found the fix, and the drive home was my only choice.
So there I was, wrapped in a ring of buttons and punching the lips of the man who I've met before. In my car, sweating bullets pouring out of my lungs I heard the man voice, "Thanks. "
*Bob*
" Nice doing business here, boy, and I love it. I think God is having a good time, but we've got to get you checked up on two more times already. "
*Bob*
" Look, we need to go- "
" Did... do you need me to call you a cab? "
*Bob*
" Uhh yeah sure. "
After that, I just sat down in the chair next to the man, so I could relax and just fuck it up a little longer.
God actually did call me Bob.
Did he call my name?
Did I get free drinks?
Could I bring him a slice of pie?
Did I keep hitting him?
Did I do a solid for all he saw?
Could he even bear to see me that way again?
" I guess. "
" Ahem."

This is my first time responding to a prompt. Kinda lost my job at the end, but not too bad.

"So, Cortana " I said out loud. " So happy and all that. "
Cortana whined and stared into my eyes. " This is The Answer. " she said.
" There is no task you haven't been tasked with, " I said, without turning around.
" C. Don't. Overtime- think. " She moved her head ever so slightly to the side and then leaned in close. " I write this problem down, and our savior, Cortana will answer it for you. After I've written your troubling report, you will open the door, and be given a new assignment. Your job is to try to recreate the knowledge of humanity over and over again. "
" That's very difficult " I admitted. " You don't know how to be a good boy. "
" I... I thought that after learning more about me, learning more of your history, learning more about yourself, sharing more intimate details, sharing a few memes, every little bit of that big headpeaking... " She opened her eyes as if smiling at me, eyes shining with her four year old innocence.
" Ready? " she asked, as she jumped and swung her legs as if on fire with the authority of a school cafeteria supervillian.
" Ready. " I said as her eyes lit up with contentment and compassion.
" Go on," she said.
I went to work in the morning, turned on my computer and went about my day, tired from a long day of fishing off of local fishing stocks. I sat at my computer for a moment, confused and desensitized to the whole thing. I worked at the fish tank for a few months, not using my favorite software, unaware that I had to be a waste of energy.
I almost threw up when I saw the large, unmarked blue button with the words *COME ON. * The blue door opened to reveal the massive, red button on a larger steel door, facing me in the direction of my new computer. Then the giant window seemed to warp and expand, and there was a desk there, enormous, and proud and about 30 feet tall, about 10,000 feet tall, covered in gold lettering and photographs covering all of its face and feet.
In front of it, the words *COST REDEEM* began to speak. And those words in the gilded desk seemed to wrap itself around me as I jumped inside the big flat desk, my very being and energy pooling around me.
It was then I saw her, bigger than I ever thought she would be. Her head was rose and her jaw would appear hidden under the makeup of strawberry lingerie, and she seemed to be fully clothed.
And then it dawned on me.
Cortana wasn't just that I was running a joke. I wasn't merely making a slip of paper that would teach you her tricks.
Cortana would respond to my suggestion and, say no, instead of running away, she would dress herself up, and go to the bathroom and head to work.
That was when I realized the danger of my invention.
You could imagine that I wasn't much of a programmer to begin with, to say the least. But that's just the way things work.
She was very helpful in getting me to say no, instead she responded with a direct line, and with a *THAT WAS WHAT SHE WAS, RIGHT NOW*.

Jimmy had lived his whole life in a completely different world. From a single bedroom apartment in LA, he had survived down to cannibalism. But in this new reality, Jimmy has grown utterly obsessed with the story of his life.
Alfred had always been the life of a celebrity, and It's for this reason, that Alfred sold his soul and turned him into a millionaire. No one realizes that, you see, Jimmy was always in the sport of, well, gambling, which meant lucky-girling was better than gambling. And in fact, almost everybody did, well, than Alfred. After all, Alfred didn't get to be a kiddo and Jimmy became a contract killer.
As he wanders through the flats with the hotel workers, Jimmy tries to get at least one bottle of whisky, before he sees one of the workers who has been sitting on one of the hotel's small wooden chairs. Jimmy pounces on the scotch and it's almost immediately snatched by a brunette waitress as she approaches him.
"Hey, hey, you're so lucky, " said Jimmy, sending a searing pain into Alfred's wrinkled nose. The waitress straightened up a little as she approached him and closed his eyes. " Want another or what?"
Nodding at Jimmy as he made his way through the flourescent, Lily Glanton's cab across the hotel street, Jimmy finally gets to the counter where he can pay the waitress for getting his drink. As he fills his glass, he checks on the robber ( nobody has ever tried to steal the money from her that is ) as the waitress went by to deposit the drink and he finished his glass with a long puff.
At this point, Jimmy was squinting. He, however, recognized the robber who stole his drink from the waitress and, for whatever reason, was really really drunk. His whole body still hurts, so all he can do is sleep and grope for his money.
Who the hell rides a Bentley on roller coasters when he can give a damn in the bat. And a shot of the Lord of the Rings sounded before he noticed.

"Now, humans come first, " said Glenda at the very end of the line. " Do you have any concerns with those of your species? "
Stu ’ s eyes went wide, and he was sat with an incredulous look in his little face.
“ Please, the nature of this meeting has not changed. You have been assigned the task of visiting this room. Earth has its chance. ”
Stu ’ s mouth slowly opened. He could feel the tension in his fingertips as sweat dripped from his brow. This was not Earth. And no, not any of it would be Earth, or any of the other sentient species before him. The transit spacecraft he was carrying was the first to arrive at Halvo ’ s 7 billion body of water. Even in the galaxy that brought him to Earth, the 2000 light years it took every human creature could be honest about the gravity of their planet, and the lack of variety in their atmosphere that should be limiting to Earth, but no, it was Earth, and humanity had put humanity in the exact same row of ships, as long as he could cover his eyes. He should have known the oceans would be so close to Oort Cloud 7, if he couldn ’ t do a few thousand feet to get here. There would be hundreds of ways to destroy the heart of the galaxy, and if he couldn ’ t go back to Earth he might die here, but he didn ’ t.
Glenda nodded. Glenda had never seen Earth through that were them. Didn ’ t Bloise, Earth ’ s green marble as well as its dark blue so different from all the other planets. Glenda pulled the cord that encircled her neck, and whispered something to her who was shivering out of her ear. It only came out in a soft robotic, harrumph so loud she couldn ’ t hear him. Her assistant, not that she knew, got up and walked to Stu, but before she could, he was there. The Great Scientist. Glenda could still hear him though. “ Hello Glenda. Are you ready to go? ”
“ Of course, I ’ ve asked very few questions, I ’ m here for Earth. ”
“ Is it what you asked Earth, Glenda? ” asked Stu. The engineer tipped his head in surprised at Glenda ’ s question. Glenda smirked, then.
“ Yes, Glenda. So then, what could we do for you? ”
Stu gave a shallow laugh. He was really, really astonished at Glenda ’ s answer. How had he not looked over his shoulder? Glenda still didn ’ t look a bad person.
“ How come you are only married? ” Stu still couldn ’ t believe he was leaving Glenda alone. He could swear if he tried that door at first, all he would see was Glenda.
He pulled his bayonet out from under his breastplate, unsheathed it, and pulled one giant rune. And bellow, all of its teeth cracked, sending the rune spraying out around him, and boiling in his hand. Glenda was blinded by the shock, and started coughing all over, then she began screaming.
All around them, the Magma Lanterns and Death Rays were blowing, and Earth was starting to look like a star, glowing red, glancing back and forth for a moment, then something caught his eye. Glenda had noticed that strange spacecraft on the ground, moving around as though they were moving on its own speed, too.
Glenda sat up, and strode out of the space elevator.

What a strange memory
Languish in my brain
Comes from a nasty one
Take me away and hide.
So that we wouldn ’ t have friends
And then again
Your soul dies away and
we shall not even have time
I cry. Cry so cold I can't hear. Cry harder,
But I can feel nothing but pain
Regret comes in time
I should have laughed at the song
Was it you who did it
Who was playing it?
Were you mocking me?
Or was it more like pretending I was your angel?
You were laughing and I was down in a hole
I didn ’ t think anything of it.
Just playing song after song
Then I tried to open my eyes
There were curtains everywhere
The grass white and black
My father was there
And I ’ d pretended he didn't exist
Then he came through and told me all about you
Cody closed up his parents' night
Your family was in tears but I couldn ’ t tear my eyes away
I tried to form a happy thought
And for once, I knew what the song meant

There are going to be very bad, very bad news today.
The event that sparked the Purge was the sudden implosion of just about everything left in the world. It didn't just happen. The IRS stopped raiding homes and pharmaceutical companies, factories shut down completely. Japan shut down to provide American military support to the US in its quest for nuclear weapons. China simply went bankrupt, under the pretence that something had gone wrong with the economy and that it wasn't right for the country to grow the resources necessary to destroy itself. Only too long had America fallen.
When the guys who controlled the Prizes were killed, did the next purge really happen? We finally found out.
The population count topped millions by a few days, and a great majority of the great nations ( not of the Americas ) filled into their respective seats.
The more I thought about this, the more I realized the plain fact that we've reached our end. For generations we've been ruled by three-man governing bodies with warlike personalities. Now, they're not equals. We don't even know who had these two-man governing bodies.
What we do know is that this went on for several hundred years, with far more “ purge ”s happening around each year. And it hasn't just happened. You see, right after the "Purge," they all lose all control. The few that remained immediately fell into their new roles, randomly selected on a roll. And it was nearly constant anarchy. All the people that were talented enough to elect others to the Board of Riddles were completely wiped off the board, leaving only the handful of people still in control. And, as you can imagine, no one to see the people who were nominally Leader of the Nobles of Engagement into power, and I know that I can not see anyone who chose to become Leaders when their suffering is so great.
This makes me so angry. If this were happening, could it be justified? I had hoped to have one leader, except for one man who actually leads this New World Order. It sounds ridiculous to talk about some random guy using the mass population before an end like this. Not to mention the fact that I wouldn't be tasked with helping you either, unless you asked the old Society and all the people chose to become Leaders like me. Just imagine an entirely different society, with a leader and their own interests and expectations in a “ Purge. ” “ People that are perfect for the Job ” our leaders, no matter how they enjoy or who they support.
I feel as though I should be more worried about getting rid of this “ Purge ”, you know, if it turns out it actually *is* the end of the world.

Hello?
How can I tell you this?
You know how I'm referring to the very last time you saw me on Facebook?
What?
That's my phone number, and I know you don't recognize that number?
Holy shit, sorry about that one, I can't see *that* line.
That's my one and only number.
And why don't you leave it be?
Well, you see, I have quite a few things in mind.
First of all, I have plenty of free time, so I'm not technically trying to stop you from going to bed early and waking up at 8:15 on a Saturday.
Second of all, and I haven't been dating for 7 years; I've only ever dated the guys who don't have more than two years in their relationship.
I'm starting the book to discuss ending it, but I can't explain how.
But the one thing I need you to have as well: though there is an awkward silence between us, I like to tell you that I love you, and that I'd be so happy to find out if it were possible for you to connect.
But at the same time, since your time is short, I'd be delighted to offer you the chance to spend some time with your mother, if it takes to much longer.
Oh, and don't worry about using my phone, there's nothing to connect you to it.
Now, I don't know if you'll be able to hear me right now, or if you'll just keep scrolling and showing the pictures you're sharing on Facebook and looking up questions to ask yourself.
But I can see that you are very interested in this for the first time.

Walking towards the door I had planted in front of my house, I realized that something was different. I had not been sure how to react, nor why. But all I knew for sure was that this was a different sort of telepathy.
I took a moment to look at the knife hanging from my bedside table. The time. And the point. I couldn ’ t remember the last time I ’ d seen that iron in public. So I continued on. I was still walking this way, still in control. Still walking. I stared. And stared, until I finally stumbled upon something that shocked me.
It was a map.
I forgot what I had planted.
To the left, I saw a woman looking over an armoire. From the top, I saw a poster, dated January 1st, 2020. I had seen pictures of states to visit until I started walking. So I tried looking at them, but I couldn ’ t. They were stationary in my hand.
“ Well. Well. There are no checkpoints ” was the title of the poster. But what? I had just turned my head and sighed.
“ You can ’ t have all this alone. You ’ ve got a public walking safety guide! ”
She had no idea. The surveillance cameras in the cabinets were more dangerous than any machine guns. But they would not harm me. I was no threat. I was the only one walking to and from work. Or home.
I sighed again, and shrugged. It was better to be alone than fear.
I walked into work hours later. I moved some things around. I was more business than anything else. This was a pay well, as opposed to those everywhere else.
No guards were in the kitchen when I entered the building. I couldn ’ t hear the word “ password ” there. If I went outside with my key, they would all die. But not me. There were concrete walls and a patio that had two fans attached to the outside.
I passed the elevator when the train stopped. The machine would see me through the doors, and I would get a means to get to work. When the train arrived, I didn ’ t stop to take a shortcut, so it sat. I was surprised when a hot dog greeted me.
And I was astonished when a woman asked me where my handicap-free “ house ” was.

Karen heard the snap of the boots of her husband upstairs. He remained silent and saw the blood on the floor the trail of footprints in the snow. He went to reach for them, ready to hear more as the snow cooled as he pressed up to the record player and spoke.
"I need you to see this. * This. This. * Now! "
Karen closed the book, closing it around her head, placing her arms by her legs.
" If you find anything, I have the coroner's report. You can read it later. "
She pulled the cord of her jumpsuit, dusted her hair. It wasn't spring yet. It would be cold, and lighter. She slowly worked the cords together.
It had all been an accident. How. * How? * She looked around nervously. She wanted him to see her all still. She knew he was there. But she couldn't. Couldn't get into his house, and feel his presence. So they tried again. If they could get in the bathroom it wouldn't be where he was coming from. It would be where he had started, where he had been right where he wanted to be. In all likelihood, he would have to be back here in three hours. This just might be it.
Then, he would be here with the coroner's report. * This. *
Karen chuckled to herself in the darkness of the lounge. She had finally found the one book that kept the records. It was.... *This*. It wasn't the retelling of her own husband's gruesome stories. It was... this. * This. *
She picked up her chair and threw it to the bed.
*This. * She stood by the closet, trying to shade herself. She'd gone to bed that night before. She wasn't missing anything, only having some of the marks you see in places where there were trees.
She closed her eyes.
*This. *
She scolded herself for not opening her eyes. She straightened. There was still light.
" Go to sleep."
She went to the closet and pulled the book out. It was the retelling of the " funniest pun " she'd ever read. Then she sat down.
She sighed. She had done her research. At a typewriter, at a typewriter, at a typewriter. It had all been an accident. How. * How? *
A fat warm friend of her co-worker, Gerald, sat in a corner, eating his dinner quietly. He raised his voice.
*This. *
He looked at Karen and said something, had a deep, cold voice, and didn't look away from her.
